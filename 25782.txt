THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY, NOW A QUARTERLY.

Some of our friends write us, saying that they do not receive the
"American Missionary" regularly. Perhaps these friends have not
noticed the announcement that our magazine is now a quarterly and not
a monthly. The last number was issued December, 1897, and this number
will appear March, 1898.

LIST OF FIELD WORKERS.

We publish in this number of the magazine the annual list of our Field
Workers. We take pleasure in presenting this list, believing that it
will be valued, not only by the friends of these faithful workers, but
by many others who will be glad to trace their names and locations.
Our workers have been epoch makers. They entered upon the work during
the first year of the war and followed the advance of the Union
armies, and when at length the slaves became freemen, these teachers
and preachers were their guides in the paths of industry, knowledge
and piety. The work was opportune, for it needed a strong influence to
direct their uncertain steps in the new life that broke so strangely
upon them. Many of these workers have devoted well-nigh their active
life to this work, and gray hairs are adorning the temples of some
who entered the service in their early and vigorous youth. Their
achievements are the ample reward for their self-denying and useful
labors and are found in neat homes, family purity, skilled industry in
shop and on farm, in well-prepared teachers and in educated and pious
ministers of the gospel. Their work is multiplied by the successful
toil of hundreds and perhaps thousands who have been trained by them.
May God bless these workers and the peoples among whom they toil--the
Emancipated Slaves, the Indians on our Western border, the Highlanders
on our Southern mountains, the Chinese on the Pacific Coast, and the
heroic family in far-off Alaska.

       *       *       *       *       *

OUR INDUSTRIAL WORK.

The American Missionary Association was a pioneer in introducing
industrial training and work among the freedmen of the South. In May,
1867, the Association purchased a tract of land on which the buildings
at Hampton, Va., are now located, and agricultural and industrial
pursuits were immediately inaugurated. In 1872 a charter was obtained
and the property was turned over by the Association to a Board of
Trustees, and Gen. Armstrong, with his remarkable enthusiasm and
administrative skill, pushed the institution forward in its marvelous
career.

At Talladega, Ala., in 1867, the Association purchased a large
building, with forty acres of land attached, and the young men were
set to tilling the soil under systematic training. In 1877 the Winsted
Farm, of 160 acres, was secured, and ten years later the Newton Farm
was added, the whole tract now containing 270 acres. On this large
farm is carried forward every variety of agricultural industry in the
preparation of the soil, in drainage and irrigation, rotation of crops
and the raising of stock. An institute for farmers of the county is
statedly held under the College auspices, and annual meetings of
several days' length are conducted in three or four of the counties of
the State. The varied industries of the shop are kept up with the home
industries of cooking, laundry, sewing and nursing. A printing office
publishes a little monthly which is very creditably printed. Similar
periodicals are published in nearly all our large institutions.

At Tougaloo, Miss., the Association purchased 500 acres of land in
1869 and subsequently added another tract, until now the whole domain
embraces 650 acres. A great feature of the institution is its
industrial work. Here has been developed the full range of farming
industries, stock raising and the cultivation of the various crops
adapted to the soil, together with shops for mechanical work,
embracing carpentry, blacksmithing, wheelwrighting, steam-sawing,
sewing and other branches of domestic economy. Strawberries are raised
and shipped to the Chicago market.

Our normal schools at Memphis, Tenn., Macon, Ga., and Williamsburg,
Ky., have carpentry, printing and other industrial training for young
men, and training in the various arts of home life for the young
women. At Wilmington, Savannah, Thomasville, Athens, Marion, Mobile,
Pleasant Hill and other normal, graded and common schools, the young
women are trained in all things needed in making comfortable and
pleasant homes.

In our Indian schools industries are taught and practiced. At the
Santee Agency a tract of nearly 500 acres gives room that is well used
for farming and stock-raising, and well-arranged shops give employment
in carpentry, blacksmithing and printing and other avocations. The
"Word Carrier," a monthly publication, is not surpassed in neatness of
printing by any paper that comes to this office. In other Indian
schools various industries are taught, especially those that relate to
the care and improvement of homes.

As evidence that this industrial work is pushed forward, we may
mention that in our most recently established school in the South,
that at Enfield, N. C., the farm of more than a thousand acres of land
(the gift of a generous Christian lady of Brooklyn, N. Y.), a large
portion of which is under cultivation, gives ample employment to the
student. Cotton, corn, potatoes, and the products of the field, the
garden and the orchard are cultivated, while in the shops the boys are
taught in blacksmithing and in carpentry, and the girls in the various
kinds of domestic work, sewing, cooking and housework.

       *       *       *       *       *

BOTH ARE RIGHT.

Mr. Booker T. Washington has written two very able articles in _The
Independent_, setting forth the supreme importance of industrial
training and work among the colored people of the South. On the other
hand, Dr. T. J. Morgan, Secretary of the Baptist Home Missionary
Society, has published in the same paper a carefully prepared article,
emphasizing the absolute necessity of the higher education of the
leaders of that people. Both these writers are correct. No people can
rise unless they have the guidance and inspiration of highly educated
ministers, teachers, thinkers and writers, and no people can rise if
its masses are idle and unthrifty. The American Missionary Association
aims, in its great work, to give due and impartial importance to both
aspects of this great problem.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES.

A peculiar history is that of the five civilized tribes of Indians. It
was supposed for a time that they had given the brightest example of
the success of the Indian on his reservation. These tribes had forms
of government modeled after that of the States. They had governors,
legislators, and judges, schools and churches. Many of the members
were highly educated. But the outcome has been a failure. The laws are
inadequately administered, and crime has been rampant and unpunished.
But now the general Government has taken the one decisive and initial
step in the matter by directing that the United States courts should
have civil and criminal jurisdiction over all cases arising in the
Indian Territory, irrespective of race. Thus the wedge has entered,
and the reservation system and the dream of Indian autonomy--an empire
within an empire--will happily soon be a thing of the past.

       *       *       *       *       *

CHINA AND THE CHINESE IN AMERICA.

China, with her vast population, has stood almost unmoved for
thousands of years. But now disintegration threatens, and the nations
of Europe may yet divide that great country among themselves, and a
new world may arise. In such a change, the influence of Christianity
must be a vital force, to guide and strengthen.

The coming of the children of China to our Western coast may be a
providential element in this change and the importance of the work of
the Association among these peoples on our Pacific Coast, so ready to
learn, and many of them so ready to return to their native land as
missionaries, may be a very significant factor in the future.

       *       *       *       *       *

ALASKA.

In 1847, California was almost as little known and valued as Alaska
was last year. But the discovery of gold in Sutton's mill-race changed
the whole aspect of affairs in California, and it is now a State with
a large and thrifty population, and its western shore is connected
with the Atlantic seaboard by railroads, towns and cities. The
discovery of gold made the change. The recent discoveries on the Yukon
River in Alaska are sending hundreds and thousands of people thither,
and while Alaska may never become a California in population, yet a
wonderful change is taking place, the end of which no one can predict.
But the native population of that distant land must not be neglected
nor crushed under the pressure of hordes of gold hunters. The work at
our mission station at Cape Prince of Wales should be enlarged and
made more effective.

A BLESSED SEASON.

BY PROF. L. S. CLARK.

This has been a blessed season spiritually for Knox Institute, Athens,
Ga. We observed the "week of prayer." We exerted ourselves in every
way to lead our pupils to Christ. God heard our prayers and he is
still hearing and blessing us. We have had many a hopeful conversion.
About fifteen took a stand for Jesus on the last day of the "week of
prayer;" two on the following Monday; thirty-nine asked for our
prayers on the following Friday; seven more gave themselves to Jesus
last Friday, and we expect that more will come forward, for the spirit
of God is with us. The work moves on smoothly.

ORANGE PARK, FLA.--A WONDERFUL DAY--CONVERSIONS.

BY REV. ERNEST R. LATHAM.

Yesterday was a wonderful day for us. We observed the day of prayer
for schools and colleges, devoting the whole time to religious
services. In the forenoon I preached from Eccl. 12:1, "Remember thy
Creator in the days of thy youth," urging upon the students the
importance of accepting Christ at the beginning of life. After the
sermon we had a prayer and testimony meeting, in which a large number
took part with great earnestness and deep feeling. At the close all
but two of our boarding students rose either to indicate a desire to
be given up more fully to Christ's service or to say that they wished
to become Christians at once.

In the afternoon a meeting for the girls was held in the Girls' Hall,
conducted by the lady teachers. The boys had two meetings in their own
rooms. All these meetings were very helpful.

In the evening in the chapel I preached on the "Rich Young Ruler" and
urged immediate decision and full surrender to Christ. The meeting for
testimony following the sermon was one of the most remarkable I have
ever attended. Several of our brightest students came out clearly for
Christ and nearly every one of those who were not Christians spoke
voluntarily of their desire to enter the new life. The meeting was
very quiet, but many were weeping, and there seemed to be a deep sense
of sin.

Every student above the eighth grade is now a Christian, I believe,
with possibly one exception, and that one is a young man of fine
promise, who said publicly last night that his supreme desire was to
be a Christian, and that a great burden had been upon him, night and
day, for many weeks. We think that his only difficulty is that he
desires the experience he has seen in others and does not see that
faith is the door by which he must enter that experience.

I know that you will rejoice with us in this great blessing.

SELF-SUPPORTING CHURCH.

THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH OF ATLANTA, GA.

BY REV. H. H. PROCTOR.

The first Congregational Church of Atlanta was founded in 1867 by Rev.
Frederick Ayer and wife, of Wisconsin, the former of whom has entered
into his rest, but the latter is still living at a ripe old age in her
native State. The church grew out of the Storrs School, the pioneer
educational institution of Georgia for the colored race, and was a
response to the conscious need of a more enlightened Christianity.

The chapel of the Storrs School was its first place of worship, but
there was soon felt a need for a regular meeting house. By the aid of
the American Missionary Association and of the C. C. B. S., a handsome
and substantial structure was built at the corner of Courtland avenue
and Houston street. The $2,000 contributed by the people for this
building represented no little sacrifice. All of the work on the
building was done by colored men, and the neat, slate-covered brick
structure, most appropriate in architectural design, is an ornament to
that elegant portion of the city in which it is prominently located. A
well-appointed eight-room parsonage stands hard by the church, built
by students of Atlanta University. The funds for the erection of the
parsonage came in part from a benevolent Northern lady, but the
greater part was contributed in pennies and nickels and dimes by the
people themselves. The church building and parsonage are located in a
community settled chiefly by white people. Once they made vigorous
protest, but since they found it is not a "shouting" church, no
complaint is heard. They often listen to the services from their
verandas, and not a few worship with us from time to time, and express
themselves highly pleased.

The church has been blessed in having such an excellent line of
pastors from New England. The first was Rev. C. W. Francis, now a
pastor in Connecticut. Then came Revs. E. E. Rogers, C. W. Southgate,
S. S. Ashley, C. W. Hawley, Evarts Kent, and S. H. Robinson. All of
these brethren are remembered for their sterling character and their
faithful labors. The present pastor finds living monuments to the toil
of every one of them. They have written their names individually on
the hearts of the people.

This church has not had an easy road to travel. At first it was
despised by the whites and misunderstood by the blacks--despised
because of its doctrine of equality; misunderstood because of its
newness in these parts. But it was not to be kept back by hatred on
the one hand, nor by ignorance on the other. True and tried spirits
rallied to its standard, and to-day, in a large measure, it has
overcome these things. It bravely stood out for an enlightened
Christianity, and its Sunday-school supplied workers for every other
school in the city. It espoused the cause of temperance, and has been
always an uncompromising foe to strong drink. It held up the standard
of Christian citizenship and has stood for an upright Christian life
and has been rigid yet loving in its discipline.

Its members make themselves felt in the practical occupations of the
community. A sociological investigation reveals some interesting
facts. They are engaged in about fifty different occupations; 85 are
housewives, 85 are in the schools studying, 31 are household servants,
28 are teachers, 19 are porters, 9 are waiters, 4 are grocerymen, 5
are postmen, 7 are professional nurses, 4 are shoemakers, 2 are
blacksmiths, 2 are politicians, 3 are seamstresses, 4 are washerwomen,
4 are postal clerks, 3 are Government clerks at Washington, 12 are
tailors, 3 are janitors, 2 are draymen, 2 are carpenters, 3 are
barbers, 3 are carriage drivers, 3 are carriagemakers, 2 are cotton
samplers, 2 are professional cooks, while the following occupations
are represented by one each: upholster, elevator conductor,
stonemason, piano tuner, sleeping car porter, dairyman, dentist,
bricklayer, restaurant proprietor, photographer, ice cream maker,
insurance agent, coal dealer, baker, jewelry clerk, bridge builder,
packer, hackman, editor and postmaster (of South Atlanta). May they
not say, as Paul: "These hands ministered unto my necessities"?

This church has furnished not a few excellent men who are doing
conspicuous service. Among these are Prof. R. R. Wright, president
State College, Savannah, Ga.; Rev. J. E. Smith, pastor First
Congregational Church, Chattanooga, Tenn.; Rev. George V. Clark,
pastor Congregational Church, Charleston, S. C.; Rev. John W.
Whittaker, pastor Central Congregational Church, New Orleans, La.; Mr.
Butler R. Wilson, attorney at law, Boston, Mass.; Rev. E. J. Penny,
chaplain Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, Tuskegee, Ala., and
others.

The present pastor is the first of his race to be honored with the
pastorate of this church. He is a product of the American Missionary
Association, having received his college training at Fisk University.
He began his labors here immediately upon the completion of his
theological course at the Yale Divinity School, in 1894. With his
coming the church entered upon a distinct era of its life. Not without
some misgivings on the part of many, the church bravely launched out
to assume self-support. For some time it had been without a regular
pastor, and the flock was divided and scattered. After three years the
membership has been doubled and the contributions trebled. Last year
it contributed a share of the "Jubilee Fund" of the American
Missionary Association. The church is now united and progressive.
There is a growing Christian Endeavor Society, a Working Men's Club
for financial aid, a Woman's Aid Society for general church work, a
Young Men's League for increasing the attendance at the Sunday evening
services (printed bulletins of the services being distributed weekly).
The church issues the Parish Visitor, a monthly church paper which
forms a bond of interest by unifying the various forces of the church.

The prayer meetings are well attended and the Sunday-school is
thriving. New members are received at every communion. The week of
prayer is followed by a large number of conversions. The membership
now numbers 403, making this the largest Congregational Church in the
South. Great stress is laid on the quality of the membership, but
quantity is not despised, and within the next seven years it is the
aspiration of the church to enroll a thousand members. With a
continuance of the spirit of unity and work, why, under God, should
not this end be realized? The possibilities of a thoroughly organized
Congregational Church of a thousand members in a community like this
are untold.

COLORED MINISTERS OF THE BLACK BELT OF ALABAMA--EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS.

BY REV. GEORGE W. ANDREWS, D.D.

The so-called Black Belt of Alabama is a wide tract of land extending
across the central portion of the State, from east to west, embracing
twenty counties, more or less. In general it is level, differing
widely in this respect from the hilly and mountainous region lying
directly north of it. It is the great cotton producing section of the
State. The soil is either sandy or a black loam, and some of it is
exceedingly fertile. Here you will find the canebrakes and cypress
swamps, as well as the prairies and the vast fertile regions. Here
also are cities and towns of importance, such as Montgomery, Selma,
Marion, Greensboro, Demopolis, Tuskegee, Eufala and the like. In the
rural sections of the belt are the vast plantations and imposing
mansions of ante-bellum days. Here slavery was at its best and its
worst.

This part of Alabama came to be called the Black Belt because into it
were gathered so many people of African descent--about 400,000--to
till the soil and harvest the crops. Some say the name originated
from the character of the soil. At the present time the ratio of
colored people to white people varies in the different counties from
two to six of the former to one of the latter. Averaging the twenty
counties, the ratio is about three colored to one white, while the
ratio in the State, as a whole, is about one to one. It is thus seen
that the Black Belt has an interest and a character of its own, and
problems somewhat more pronounced than similar problems in other parts
of the State. This was far more the case thirty or even twenty years
ago than now. It is doubtful whether any other section of Alabama has
made more rapid progress along intellectual and moral lines the past
twenty-five years than the Black Belt. Here multiplied schools and
colleges and missionary efforts have been doing their utmost, and
great has been the result.

Just about twenty-seven years ago the writer came from New England
into this Black Belt, curious to see and to hear. One Sabbath
afternoon it was noised abroad that a famous colored preacher was to
speak in one of the large town churches. His text was, "And there was
war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and
the dragon fought and his angels." Rev. 12:7. A very difficult text.
The sermon, however, was almost wholly about John the "revelator," and
not on the text at all. The preacher began by informing his hearers
that John was a very wonderful man, and the Romans wanted to kill him,
so they put him into a kettle of oil and boiled him and boiled him,
but could not kill him. Hence they determined to banish him to Patmos,
so they put him on board a ship and sailed for three months over the
great ocean, and then they got out the telescope and looked for three
thousand miles further over the mighty waters, and there they saw the
tip of a great mountain coming up out of the sea, and the great
serpents were coiled around the top and were sliding down the sides
into the waters, and there was not a cracker there for John. And so,
with scarcely a grammatical sentence and with most unfitting words, he
went on for an hour with a discourse full of wildness and weirdness,
and full of untruth, while the people looked on with amazement at the
wonderful knowledge and power of the man. Twenty or thirty years ago
you might hear many similar sermons. But now, were you to go into the
churches in the cities and larger towns of the Black Belt, you would
find no place for the old-time preacher or the old-time sermon, but
instead you would find in the pulpit a man of considerable education
and refinement, preaching good gospel truth to an attentive audience.

Some of the causes and evidences of progress in the Black Belt, both
of preachers and people, may well pass in review at this point.

In the first place, at the close of the war there were no schools for
colored people; now you will find at least twelve hundred common
schools for them in the Black Belt alone, besides a goodly number of
select and higher schools of different denominations, while just up
out of the Belt, in a most beautiful and healthful region, is
Talladega College, well patronized by the people of the lower and less
healthful parts of the State. These many schools could not fail to set
in motion great changes affecting the homes, heads and hearts of the
people. The ministers have powerfully felt their influence and in
large numbers have been drawn into them or have been driven from the
public leadership which they once had. The American Missionary
Association schools and churches are at the foundation of all that has
been accomplished. Others have patterned after these.

Again, previous to the time when the Christian missionary work began
in the South, I cannot learn that there was more than one regularly
ordained colored minister in the region under consideration, or that
there were any regularly organized churches among them. At the present
time there are at least sixteen hundred such churches in the twenty
counties, and probably nearly as many ordained ministers--not to
mention the five thousand licensed preachers, many of whom are hoping
for ordination. These ministers and churches are working out a great
problem. It is true that much of the work is of a low grade, but it is
equally true that much of it is intelligent, earnest and effective.
There are only a few college and theological graduates among
them--perhaps not more than half a dozen. There are many more who have
had normal and theological training, and a still larger number who
have had a partial course of Bible study and who can manage a church
fairly well. Of the more than six thousand ministers and preachers of
the Black Belt, perhaps it would be a generous estimate to say that
one hundred are in a measure educated. These are the leaders of the
unschooled thousands counted among the preachers of the gospel.

Other evidences of progress in learning and piety are such as these:
All over the State, as well as in the Black Belt, the churches are
calling loudly for a more intelligent ministry. Not a few churches
have been rent asunder by this issue, the more progressive part going
out to organize a new church and secure a more acceptable minister.
Scarcely an important church can be found where the subject of a
competent ministry has not been agitated. There have also been erected
within the past ten years a surprising number of new and greatly
improved church edifices. Those whose "care of all the churches" has
led them up and down through the Black Belt declare with emphasis that
the quality of the preaching has greatly improved; that more books are
bought and read; that the churches are better organized; that the
conferences, associations and conventions of the ministers and
churches are immeasurably in advance of what they were even ten years
ago; that the subjects discussed in these gatherings are of a higher
order and more intelligently and spiritually handled, and that there
is a growing sense of responsibility and an earnest desire to meet it.
I have been in many of these gatherings, especially among our American
Missionary Association people, where the sermons and papers were
excellent.

Also, it should be noted as a hopeful sign that the preachers and many
of the pastors are greatly desirous of a more complete literary and
theological education. Those who seek such an education are numerous.
We sometimes have at Talladega applications from fifty such in a
single year. It is often pitiful to hear their appeals to be admitted
to school, when denial is forced upon them, since there is neither
room nor money. Still, there are many who secure books, seek help, and
blindly plod on.

Let no one suppose the work in the Black Belt or the State is
finished. It is only gloriously begun. The Black Belt is probably
better provided with schools, churches and ministers than any other
part of the State. The mining regions about Birmingham and in North
Alabama are more destitute and the condition of the people quite as
deplorable. There are hundreds of preachers and not a few ordained
ministers who cannot read or write, and many more who know very little
of God's Word. One such recently sought ordination, and when asked to
find the book of Jude, he replied, after a fruitless search, "That
book is torn out of my Bible and I can't find it." He was ordained
just the same. Our friends may be sure, however, that the leaven has
been cast into the meal, and in due time will leaven the mass. But,
oh, the darkness, the moral corruption, the sorrow and ruin that comes
from the long delay. Where we can put one good minister into the field
we need a score, and where one boy or girl is in school there should
be a dozen. May the dear Father open our eyes to see His work and to
know the joy of self-denying service for Him!

DEACON SAMUEL HOLMES.

The death of Deacon Samuel Holmes takes from active career in life one
who has been prominent and useful in many forms of Christian work in
the local church and in broader efforts for the extension of the
Redeemer's kingdom. He was for many years a member and officer in the
Broadway Tabernacle, New York city, and on his removal thirty years
ago to Montclair, N. J., he was one of the charter members of the
growing Congregational Church organized there. He was the first man
elected as its deacon, and to the day of his death was its senior
deacon. At the time of his death, Dec. 9, 1897, he was a member of the
Executive Committee of the American Missionary Association and the
oldest in age and in date of appointment, having held that position
for the third of a century. He was a corporate member of the American
Board and a vice-president of the Congregational Education Society. He
was an officer in the National Congregational Council held in Boston
in 1865, and was one of the committee which convened the National
Congregational Council in Oberlin in 1871. He was also a delegate to
the International Congregational Council held in London in 1891. His
memory will be warmly cherished in the many circles of Christian
service in which he was actively engaged.

MISS MARY E. McLANE.

The painful intelligence of the death of a most useful and highly
esteemed teacher, Miss Mary E. McLane, of New Haven, Conn., which is
received by us, will be seriously felt in our missionary work.

Miss McLane died at Mobile, Ala., on the 2d of February. Appointed in
the year 1887 to St. Augustine, Fla., Miss McLane had taught in Fisk
University, Tennessee, had been principal of a school at Anniston,
Ala., for four years; was then transferred at her own request to
Athens, Ala., where she was principal, and after three years service
there was appointed as matron in the Teachers' Home of Emerson
Institute, at Mobile, Ala. In a missionary service of more than ten
years Miss McLane obtained a good report as a most faithful and
earnest teacher, thoroughly imbued with the missionary spirit and
always actuated by a missionary purpose.

MISS ANNA COFFIN.

The death of Miss Anna Coffin occurred at her home in Haverhill, Mass.
At the age of 18 she was graduated from the Salem Normal School.
Having a desire to serve the needy colored people, she accepted a
commission from the American Missionary Association to teach in
Burrell School, at Selma, Ala. She threw herself into the work with
all the ardor and enthusiasm so natural to her, and for the two years
of her stay proved a devoted teacher and faithful servant of Christ.
Later, for four years, she was connected with Tougaloo University, at
Tougaloo, Miss., where her unselfish, consecrated life was powerful
for good. With grief softened by joy, we count her among the "happy
saints that dwell in light, and walk with Jesus in white."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
