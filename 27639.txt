PREFACE.


There are already a good many vegetarian cookery books, ranging in
price from one penny to half-a-crown, but yet, when I am asked, as not
unfrequently happens, to recommend such a book, I know of only one which
at all fulfils the requirements, and even that one is, I find, rather
severely criticised by ladies who know anything about the matter.

To have to live by some of them would almost make a vegetarian turn
meat-eater. Most are compilations from other books with the meat dishes
left out, and a little porridge and a few beans and peas thrown in. All
of them, I believe, contain a lot of puddings and sweets, which certainly
are vegetarian, but which can be found in any ordinary cookery book.

What is required is a book that will enable us to provide something to
take the place of meat, which, while nourishing, shall at the same time
be palatable. This the present book aims at doing. Of the 221 recipes
given, upwards of 200 are absolutely original, having been carefully
thought out and tested by the author herself, and not hitherto published
anywhere. Many of them are as nourishing, weight for weight, as ordinary
dishes made with meat, those containing beans, peas, eggs, and the
various sorts of grain, being the most nourishing. If they are not all
found to be palatable, the fault must be in the individual cook, who
cannot have put in the important ingredient of _feeling_, without which
no work can be wholly good.

The thorough-going vegetarian, to whom abstinence from meat is part of
his ethical code and his religion,--who would as soon think of taking
his neighbour's purse as helping himself to a slice of beef,--is by
nature a man of frugal habits and simple tastes. He _prefers_ a plain
diet, and knows that the purest enjoyment is to be found in fruits of
all kinds as nature supplies them. He needs but little cookery, and that
of the simplest. To him this book will be of little use, except when he
wishes to entertain his friends.

But there are others who, while not feeling that any moral principle
is immediately involved in the matter of diet, yet would like to be
relieved from the necessity of eating flesh, possibly on aesthetic
grounds, or it may be from hygienic reasons, or in some cases, I hope,
because they would willingly diminish the sufferings involved in the
transport and slaughter of animals, inevitable as long as they are used
for food. To these it is hoped that this little book may act as an
encouragement and help.

Nor need our carnivorous friends be afraid of it. A good deal of nonsense
is talked (by meat-eaters I mean, of course) about the properties of
food, and they would have us believe that they eat a beef-steak mainly
because it contains 21.5 per cent. of nitrogen. But we know better. They
have eaten steaks for many years, but it was only last week, in working
up for a debate, that they found out about the nitrogen. It is not the
chemical ingredients which determine the diet, but the _flavour_; and it
is quite remarkable, when some tasty vegetarian dishes are on the table,
how soon the percentages of nitrogen are forgotten, and how far a small
piece of meat will go. If this little book shall succeed in thus weaning
away a few from a custom which is bad--bad for the suffering creatures
that are butchered--bad for the class set apart to be the slaughterers--bad
for the consumers physically, in that it produces disease, and morally,
in that it tends to feed the lower and more ferocious qualities of mind,
and also for ever prevents our treating the animal creation with that
_courtesy_ (as Sir Arthur Helps put it) which is their due--then I know
that it will not have wholly failed in carrying out the author's
benevolent intention.

NEW VEGETARIAN DISHES.




GENERAL HINTS.


Haricot Beans.

Among the pulses there is none more nourishing, more generally liked,
nor more useful to the vegetarian cook than the haricot bean. Whether on
account of its refined flavour, its delicate colour, its size, or last,
but not least, its cheapness, I do not hesitate to place it first. Like
the potato, however, its very simplicity lays it open to careless
treatment, and many who would be the first to appreciate its good
qualities if it were placed before them well cooked and served, now
recoil from the idea of habitually feeding off what they know only under
the guise of a stodgy, insipid, or watery mass. A few hints, therefore,
respecting the best manner of preparing this vegetable may be useful.

Firstly, the beans should invariably be washed and placed in a basin of
cold water the night before they are required for use, and should remain
in soak about ten or twelve hours. If left longer than this during hot
weather they are apt to turn sour.

They should not be cooked in the same water that they have been soaked
in.

Soft water must be used to cook them. If this be not obtainable,
Maignen's Ante-Calcaire will be found to render the water soft.

Salt should not be added until they are at least half cooked, as its
tendency is to harden them. This applies also to peas, lentils, etc.

They take about two hours to cook, or three if required very soft.

They must not be allowed to boil very fast, for, like potatoes, they are
then liable to break before becoming tender.

About two pints of water, one ounce of butter, and one teaspoon of salt
to half-pint of soaked beans, may be taken as a fair average.

During soaking they swell to nearly double their original size, and in
boiling they double again.

Never throw away the liquor in which they are boiled but reserve it as
"stock."

When they are to be plainly served as a vegetable, it is best to remove
the lid of the saucepan a few minutes before dishing up, and so reduce
the liquor to the desired strength.

When required for frying they should be strained as soon as tender, and
spread over a plate to dry. They may then be fried in butter or oil.

Always make a point of tasting them before sending to table, for if not
sufficiently salted they are very insipid.

All spices, herbs, etc., boiled with the beans for flavouring purposes,
should be tied in a small piece of muslin, which may at any moment be
easily removed.

Haricot bean pulp, which will be found frequently mentioned in the
following recipes, is made by boiling the beans until tender and rather
dry, and then rubbing them through a wire sieve with a wooden spoon.


Lentils.

Next in usefulness to the haricot bean comes the German lentil. This
must not be confounded with the Egyptian lentil, which closely resembles
the split pea; for not only is the former double the price of the
latter, but I may add double its worth also, at least from a culinary
point of view.

In vegetarian cookery the lentil takes the place of the dark meats of
the flesh-eaters' dietary, such as beef and mutton, the haricot bean
supplying a substitute for the white, such as veal, chicken, etc.

The liquor in which lentils have been boiled forms a rich foundation
for dark sauces, also a delicious and nourishing beverage, in flavour
resembling beef-tea, can be obtained from them (see Recipe No. 12).

Besides being darker in colour, the flavour of lentils is much more
pronounced than that of haricots.

Throughout the following recipes the word "lentil" means German lentil,
without exception.


Split Peas, etc.

Most of the advice given above respecting haricots and lentils applies
to the treatment of split peas, dried green peas, and Egyptian lentils.


Thickenings for Soups and Sauce.

Pearl barley is invaluable for thickening soups, sauces, etc.

It should be strained away when the required consistency is obtained,
for if left in too long the flavour is apt to be found a little too
strong for some tastes.

Sago, tapioca, rice, and semolina are all useful for thickening, and it
is generally advisable to strain the sauces in which they are used,
before sending to table.

If paste of flour and butter be used for thickening, there will be no
necessity to use a strainer, unless the sauce becomes lumpy. This can
generally be remedied, however, by prolonged stirring over the fire.

The paste is made by placing equal quantities of flour and butter on a
plate, and working them together with a knife until the flour is
thoroughly incorporated.

Use about one ounce each of flour and butter to one pint of sauce, or
to two pints of soup.

For thickening dark sauces, stews, etc., flour which has been baked in
the oven until it has turned a very light brown will be found better
than white flour. If allowed to become too brown it will acquire a
disagreeable flavour.


Frying in Oil.

A medium-sized iron saucepan and a wire basket to fit it easily should
be kept for this purpose. Fill about a third of the saucepan with oil
(be quite sure that the quality is good), put in the wire basket, and
place the saucepan over the fire or gas, and after a few minutes watch
it carefully to see when it begins to boil. This will be notified by the
oil becoming quite still, and emitting a thin blue vapour. Directly this
is observed, drop the articles to be fried gently into the basket, taking
care not to overcrowd them, or their shape will be quite spoiled. When
they have become a golden brown, lift out the basket, suspend it for one
moment over the saucepan to allow the oil to run back, then carefully
turn the fritters on to some soft paper, and serve piled on a hot dish,
not forgetting to use a fish paper.

When cold, the oil should be strained through a fine strainer, lined
with a piece of muslin. It is then ready for use again with a little
more added.

Should the oil become burnt, it must of course be thrown away.


Bread Crumbs.

To procure _fine_ bread crumbs, rub stale bread through a wire sieve.
For this the hands should be scrupulously clean.

Should the crumbs be required _coarse_, rubbing the bread on a grater
will answer the purpose.




RECIPES.




SOUPS.


No. 1.--Artichoke Soup.

  3 pounds Jerusalem artichokes after peeling.
  2 pints water.
  1 pint milk.
  2 ounces butter.
  2 teaspoons salt.
  2 shalots.
  2 teaspoons chopped celery.
  1 tablespoon sago.
  1 dozen peppercorns, with a suspicion of mace and cinnamon tied in
    muslin.

Peel the artichokes and throw them into cold water. Dissolve the butter
in a large enamelled saucepan, slice the artichokes and fry for five
minutes in the butter, then add the water, shalots and celery chopped,
and the seasonings. Boil for three-quarters of an hour, removing the
scum as it rises. Add milk and sago, and stir frequently for twenty
minutes. Rub through a hair sieve into a tureen.

Note.--Cream is often recommended for this soup, but when sago and milk
are used as above, the result will be found extremely satisfactory, and
the expense considerably lessened.


No. 2.--Asparagus Soup.

  60 heads of asparagus.
  1 cabbage lettuce.
  2 quarts of water.
  1 ounce of butter.
  6 medium-sized onions.
  A sprig of mint.
  1 tablespoon of sago.
  2 teaspoons of salt.
  1/2 teaspoon of pepper.
  2 or 3 drops of spinach extract.

Dissolve the butter in a large saucepan, place in the lettuce finely
shredded, the salt, pepper, mint, onions sliced, water, and the green
portion of the asparagus, but reserving thirty tops. Boil one hour. Stir
in the sago and boil again, stirring frequently for half an hour without
the lid. Boil the thirty tops separately in a little salted water until
tender. Strain the soup through a hair sieve (rubbing the pulp through
with a wooden spoon) into a hot tureen, add the tops and the colouring,
and serve.

Note.--If the soup be made some time before required, do not cook the
tops until it is being re-heated.


No. 3.--Brown Soup.

  6 cold boiled potatoes.
  2 onions stuck with cloves.
  1 tomato.
  2 1/2 pints stock.
  2 ounces butter.
  1 strip of lemon peel.
  3 whole allspice.
  1 dozen peppercorns.
  1 teaspoon Worcester sauce.
  Pepper and salt to taste.
  1 dozen forcemeat balls, No. 78

Slice the potatoes and fry them very carefully in the butter, so as to
thoroughly brown without burning them. Place them in a saucepan with the
stock and simmer five minutes; by this time the brown colour will have
boiled off the potatoes into the soup. Strain away the potatoes, return
the soup to the saucepan, add onions (each stuck with three cloves),
lemon peel, sauce, spices, pepper and salt, and the tomato sliced and
fried. Simmer one hour, strain into a hot tureen, place in the forcemeat
balls, which have been previously fried, and serve quickly.


No. 4.--Carrot Soup.

  1 pint haricot beans.
  5 pints water.
  2 ounces butter.
  1 ounce salt.
  6 large carrots.
  2 large onions.
  1 small head of celery.
  1 teaspoon peppercorns.

Dissolve the butter in a large saucepan. Slice the vegetables, and place
them in the saucepan together with the water and peppercorns, and simmer
for one hour. Add salt, and simmer for another hour and a half. Strain.


No. 5.--Celery Soup.

  3 large heads of celery.
  1 large onion.
  1 potato.
  3 pints water.
  1 dozen peppercorns.
  2 ounces butter.
  3/4 ounce flour.
  1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
  1/2 pint milk.
  1 pinch of mace.

Dissolve one ounce of butter in a good-sized saucepan, then add the
vegetables sliced, and all the other ingredients, except flour, milk,
and the other ounce of butter. Simmer for one and a half hours. Strain,
thicken with flour and butter. Add milk, and serve very hot.


No. 6.--Chestnut Soup.

  1 pound chestnuts.
  1 1/2 pints water.
  Yolk of one egg, or 1 teaspoon cream.
  1 onion.
  1 small turnip.
  1 ounce butter.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.
  6 peppercorns, and a very small pinch of mixed herbs.

Boil the chestnuts for half an hour. In the meantime dissolve the butter
in a stewpan; then fry in it the onion and turnip sliced, add the water
flavourings, and chestnuts after removing the shells and skins. Boil one
hour. Place the cream or yolk in a basin, strain the soup on to it and
stir, then strain it back into the saucepan; re-warm, but do not allow
to boil. Pour into the tureen and serve.


No. 7.--French Bean Soup.

  3 pints water.
  1 pint soaked haricot beans.
  2 potatoes.
  1 ounce butter.
  1 onion.
  1 pound French beans.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  1 dozen peppercorns.

Dissolve the butter in a saucepan and fry in it the potatoes and onion
sliced for five minutes, then add the haricot beans and water and boil
for two hours. Add the salt, rub through a wire sieve, replace in the
pan, add the French beans cut fine, and simmer until tender. Tinned
beans do equally well, and only require to be made thoroughly hot.


No. 8.--Green Kale Soup.

  2 pounds green kale.
  1 onion.
  1 Spanish ditto.
  2 potatoes.
  1 ounce butter.
  2 teaspoons sago.
  1 quart water.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  1 dozen peppercorns, and a suspicion each of mace and sweet herbs.

Dissolve the butter in a saucepan, and place in it the onions and
potatoes sliced; then add water, salt and flavourings, and boil for one
hour. In the meantime prepare the kale by picking off all but the tender
middle shoots, trim the stalks and throw the kale into salt and water;
rinse well and see that it is all quite free from insects, and boil
separately in salted water for ten minutes. When the soup has boiled an
hour, thicken with the sago and continue stirring ten minutes, strain,
return to the saucepan. Strain also the kale, place it on a chopping
board and cut small; add it to the soup, boil up and serve.

Note.--Any kind of greens may be treated in the above manner.


No. 9.--Haricot Bean Soup.

  1 pint soaked haricot beans.
  1 good-sized carrot.
  1 good-sized turnip.
  2 onions.
  1 small head of celery.
  2 ounces butter.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  2 quarts water.

Dissolve the butter in a saucepan, place in the onions sliced and fry
five minutes; then add the other vegetables sliced, the beans, and
water. Boil one and a half hours, add salt, and simmer half an hour
longer. Strain before serving.


No. 10.--Lentil Soup.

  1 pint lentils.
  2 quarts water.
  1 1/2 ounces butter.
  1 carrot.
  1 onion.
  1 turnip.
  1 potato.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  1 tablespoon minced parsley.

Slice the vegetables and fry in the butter for five minutes, place them
in a saucepan with the lentils and water and boil one and a half hours;
add salt and a little pepper if liked. Strain, replace in the saucepan,
add the parsley, boil for three minutes, and serve.

Note.--The solid part which is strained away should on no account be
wasted, but will be found excellent for making lentil puddings, pies,
stews, etc.


No. 11.--Lentil Broth.

  1/2 pint soaked lentils.
  1 tablespoon pearl barley.
  1 quart water.
  1 ounce butter.

  { 3 allspice, and a small strip of lemon peel, tied in muslin.

Place altogether in a saucepan with the exception of the salt, which
should be added later, and boil gently for two hours, removing the scum
as it rises. Strain and serve with sippets of freshly-made toast.

Note.--The above will be found a very excellent substitute for mutton
broth, being very nourishing, and tasty; when liked a turnip maybe
added, and will give additional flavour. The lentils and barley, which
have been strained, may be used in many ways.


No. 12.--Lentil Tea.

(A substitute for Beef Tea.)

  1 pint soaked lentils.
  1 pint water.

salt and pepper. Boil half an hour, removing the scum as it rises. Add
salt, boil another half hour. Strain carefully and serve with toast or
bread.

Note.--The lentils should be re-boiled, and will make a very useful
stock.

the fire. Slice the carrots and turnips and fry in one ounce of butter
until slightly brown. Add them to the beans and boil altogether for one
hour, then add salt and peppercorns. Boil for another hour, strain,
return to the saucepan and thicken with the flour, curry powder, and one
ounce of butter made into a paste. Stir until it has boiled for three
minutes. Strain again if necessary before serving. Serve boiled rice in
another dish.

it rises. Strain; return the soup to the saucepan, which should first be
rinsed, allow it to simmer, pour in the white of egg, re-strain through
a very fine sieve (or a piece of muslin placed in an ordinary sieve

knife, dry the slices in a clean cloth and braize them in the butter
until tender (about a quarter of an hour), adding a little salt and
pepper. When done (they must on no account be allowed to break), remove
them carefully with a fork one by one on to a suitable sized dish, and
place on one side. To make the sauce, cut up the tomatoes and shalot,
and place them with the seeds and any rough pieces of the cucumber in
the butter which has just cooked the cucumber, adding water and salt if

for half an hour (three-quarters of an hour if the peas are not very
young). Add the sugar and salt, then stir in the yolks of eggs and
cream; continue stirring for a minute until it all thickens (but on no
account allow it to boil, or the eggs will curdle), and serve with
sippets of toasted bread.


No. 42.--Green Pea and Potato Stew.

  1 pint shelled green peas.
  6 new potatoes.
  2 onions.

longer, then shake in the semolina, and continue stirring for about ten
minutes. Cooked semolina will do equally well, and need only be added
five minutes before serving (about a quarter of a pound will be
required). Lastly, add tomatoes, which should have been previously
stewed (see No. 155), and serve.


No. 45.--Haricot Bean Stew.

in a saucepan with the water, and stew gently for one hour. Add
seasonings a quarter of an hour before serving.


No. 49.--Lentil Stew with Forcemeat Cutlets.

  1 onion.
  1 teaspoon Worcester sauce.
  2 teaspoons salt.
  1 ounce butter.
  Forcemeat.

Simmer the lentils gently in three pints of water for one and a half
hours. Strain. Put a quarter of a pound of the lentils on one side to
cool. Rub the rest through the wire sieve with a wooden spoon until
nothing but the skins remain. In the meantime, boil the vegetables with
sufficient water to cover, until quite tender. When thoroughly cooked
pour into the lentil puree, add the sauce and salt, and re-warm. Prepare
forcemeat No. 77, adding the quarter of a pound of lentils chopped fine;
shape into little cutlets (about twelve), brown in a frying-pan with the
butter, place on a hot dish, pour the gravy over, and serve at once.


No. 50.--Rice Stew.

and boil for one hour, or until tender. When done, stand the saucepan
on one side for a few minutes to get thoroughly off the boil. Mix the
flour and butter well together, add them to the stew; re-boil and stir
until it thickens; add rice, and boil for one or two minutes. If curry
powder is liked, it should be mixed with the flour and butter, but the
Worcester sauce may be added at the last moment.


No. 51.--Spanish Onion Stew.

  3 Spanish onions.
  1 carrot.
  1 turnip.
  1 1/2 pints water.
  1 ounce butter.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  1/2 dozen peppercorns tied in muslin.
  A few sticks of celery.

Slice the carrot and turnip and fry a few minutes in the butter, place

salt, celery and peppercorns. Boil gently until quite tender, remove the
peppercorns, reduce the gravy, and serve with sippets of toast.


No. 52.--Tennis Stew.

  1/2 pound mashed potato.
  1/2 pound cold greens of any kind.
  6 medium-sized carrots.
  1/2 pint rich brown sauce.
  1 egg.
  A few bread crumbs.
  Pepper and salt.

Mix well together the potatoes, greens (which must be finely chopped),
egg, and seasoning to taste, adding as many bread crumbs as are needful
to render the mixture firm enough to roll into balls. Fry the balls in a
little butter, or they may be rolled in egg and bread crumbs and dropped
into boiling oil. (The latter way is specially recommended when only
half the above quantity of vegetables is being used, and consequently
only half an egg is needed; the other half should then be reserved for
this purpose.) Arrange a circle of balls on a hot dish, have ready the
carrots boiled, slice them rather thickly and shape them into the form
of tennis bats; place them in the centre, and pour the sauce over them.
If curried sauce be used, rice may either be served separately, or a
border of it placed round the balls.

  1 1/2 pints water.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  1/2 teaspoon pepper.
  2 ounces butter.
  1 ounce brown flour.

Slice the onion, turnip and carrot, and cut the two latter into very
neat or ornamental pieces, cut the celery very small, place altogether
in a stewpan with the water and salt, and simmer gently for two and
a half hours. Stew the tomatoes according to No. 155 in a separate
stewpan, using one ounce of butter. When the vegetables are quite
tender, the tomato juice, which has been previously strained, should
be added to them, and the whole thickened with the flour and remaining
ounce of butter thoroughly mixed to a paste. The stew must be allowed
to boil gently for a few minutes after it has been thickened, to cook
the flour.

Note.--A small teaspoonful of Worcester sauce may be used instead of the
pepper.


No. 54.--Rich Baked Vegetable Stew.

  2 large young carrots.
  4 fresh tomatoes.
  3 or 4 new potatoes.
  1 shalot.
  A pinch of sweet herbs.

  Pepper and salt.
  2 ounces butter.
  2 ounces bread crumbs.

Melt the butter in a stewpan and fry in it the carrots and potatoes,
sliced very thin, for about ten minutes, or until they begin to brown.
Scald the tomatoes by pouring boiling water over them, remove the skins,
slice them, and place in the stewpan with a sprinkle each of salt,
pepper, sweet herbs, and the shalot, very finely minced. Stew altogether
gently for about half an hour (the juice from the tomatoes with the
butter makes sufficient liquor), and when thoroughly cooked, pour into a
shallow pie-dish. Break the eggs and separate yolks from whites, beat
the former and stir in the bread crumbs, with which have been mixed a
pinch of salt and pepper; then beat the whites to a stiff froth, mix in
with the yolks, stir well altogether and place over the stew in the form
of crust, and bake a quarter of an hour in a very brisk oven. Serve hot
or cold.


No. 55.--Vegetable Ragout.

  2 1/2 ounces butter.
  1 ounce flour.

Prepare the vegetables, cutting the onions and turnips in quarters, and
slicing the potatoes and carrots, place them together with the water,
salt and half an ounce of butter in a saucepan, and boil for one hour.
Scald the tomatoes, remove the skins, quarter and add to the ragout;
simmer for a quarter of an hour longer, then carefully strain away the
vegetables and place them in a deep dish; return the liquor to the
saucepan, and thicken with the flour and butter made into a paste; stir
until the sauce boils and is free from lumps, then pour over the
vegetables, and serve hot. Sippets of toast may be added with advantage.

Note.--Should the sauce remain lumpy it should be poured over the
vegetables through a strainer.


No. 56.--Stewed Vegetable Marrow.

  1 middling-sized vegetable marrow.
  1 pint water.
  1 ounce butter.
  1/2 ounce flour.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.

Peel and slice the marrow and remove the seeds; place these in a
saucepan with the water and salt, and simmer for a quarter of an hour.
Dissolve half an ounce of butter in a stewpan, put in the slices of
marrow, and strain the liquor from the seeds over them; stew gently for
half or one hour, according to the age of the marrow. When quite done,
lift the pieces out carefully. Mix the other half ounce butter and flour
into a paste, thicken the gravy with this, pour it over the marrow, and
serve. A sprig of mint may be boiled with the seeds if liked.

Note.--This method of boiling vegetable marrows will be found greatly
superior to that generally adopted, as in this case there is no waste
nor loss of flavour.

them as even as possible; fry them a golden brown in a little butter,
lay in a hot dish, pour over them the sauce (hot), make a border of the
rice, and serve.

Note.--The rice may be omitted.




VEGETABLES.


No. 143.--Artichokes with Sauce Royale.

  3 pounds artichokes.
  1/2 pint water.
  3/4 teaspoon salt.
  1 pint sauce No. 172.

Wash and peel the artichokes, and boil for twenty minutes in the salt
and water. Should any of the water then remain, leave lid off for a few
minutes to allow it to evaporate. Turn the artichokes into a hot
vegetable dish and pour over them the sauce, which must have been
thoroughly heated previously.


No. 144.--Fried Beetroot.

(A Breakfast Dish.)

  1 medium-sized beet.
  2 ounces butter for frying.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  1/2 teaspoon pepper.
  2 teaspoons flour.
  2 tablespoons vinegar.
  1 tablespoon water.

Peel the beetroot, and cut into slices about a quarter of an inch thick.
Dissolve the butter in a frying pan, place in the beetroot and fry for
twenty minutes, sprinkling each slice on both sides with the pepper and
salt. When done, arrange the slices on a hot dish. Reset the frying pan
on the fire, stir in the flour, thoroughly mixing it with the butter,
and fry for a couple of minutes, stirring all the time, then pour in the
water and vinegar, stir until quite smooth; pour over the beetroot and
serve quickly.


No. 145.--Brussels Sprouts.

  Sprouts.
  Salted water.

Clean the sprouts _very thoroughly_, removing all the decayed and
outside leaves, and when perfectly free from dirt and insects, place
them in plenty of fast-boiling salted water, and boil for about twenty
minutes, or until quite tender but not broken. Keep the lid off all the
time they are cooking, remove the scum as it rises, and be sure and use
_no_ soda. When they are tender, have ready a colander with a cloth laid
in it, lift the sprouts out with an egg slice, and lay them carefully on
the cloth to drain, place about a dozen of the best shaped ones on a hot
plate or dish, slide the remainder gently off the cloth on to a hot
drainer in a vegetable dish, and arrange the reserved ones on the top.

Sprouts are often spoiled in the dishing up, but no vegetable looks and
tastes nicer if properly cooked and served.


No. 146.--French Beans.

  1 pint tomato juice.
  1 shalot.
  1 pound cooked French beans.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.
  A little pepper.
  Thickening of flour and butter.

Slice the shalot, and stew it in the tomato juice for about half an
hour. Strain, add pepper and salt, and thicken the juice with the flour
and butter. Lay the French beans in, and thoroughly re-heat.

Note.--Tinned beans may be used, when fresh ones are not obtainable.


No. 147.--A nice way of serving Greens.

  2 pounds greens.
  Salted water.
  1 ounce butter.

Boil the greens (Scotch kale, broccoli tops, etc.) in the usual way.
When quite tender, strain and press well, place on a board and chop very
finely; dissolve the butter in a stewpan, place in the greens, add a
little pepper and more salt if required, and stir briskly over the fire
for two or three minutes. Serve in a hot vegetable dish.


No. 148.--Tasty Greens.

  2 eggs.
  1 ounce butter.
  1/2 pound cooked greens of any kind.
  Salt and pepper to taste.

Dissolve the butter in a small stewpan, beat up the eggs, add them to
the butter, and stir over the fire until the sauce thickens, but on no
account allow it to boil; add the greens, which should be finely chopped
(see No. 147), also seasoning if required, and continue stirring over a
gentle heat for two or three minutes.


No. 149.--Haricot Beans.

  1 pint soaked haricot beans.
  1 pint water.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  1 ounce butter.

Boil the beans in the water for half an hour, add salt, and boil again
gently for another half or three-quarters of an hour; strain away the
liquor, and leave the beans in the colander to dry off. Dissolve the
butter in a stewpan, gently toss the beans in it, taking care not to
break them, and serve.

Either chopped parsley, grated nutmeg, or lemon juice may be added to
the butter, but the beans are extremely good quite plain.

Note.--They may also be served in the liquor. See General Hints, page 1.


No. 150.--Mushrooms Baked.

  1 dozen mushrooms.
  1 ounce butter.
  2 tablespoonsful water.
  Pepper and salt.

Peel the mushrooms, removing part of the stalks, and lay them (stalks
upwards) in a flat baking tin or dish containing the water; place a
small piece of the butter in the centre of each mushroom, pepper and
salt them to taste; cover them, and bake in a moderate oven for twenty
or thirty minutes. Serve very hot.

Note.--Great care must be taken that the mushrooms are quite free from
insects before cooking.


No. 151.--Green Peas Boiled.

  1 pint shelled peas.
  1 pint water.
  A sprig of mint.
  1 ounce butter.
  1/4 teaspoon salt.

Wash the peas, and place them in a stewpan with the other ingredients,
simmer with the lid off until they are quite tender, remove the mint and
serve. The small quantity of liquor which remains will be found useful
for flavouring sauces, stews, etc.

Note.--This way of cooking peas is greatly superior to that of putting
them into a large quantity of water, as there is no waste and the entire
flavour and nutriment of the vegetable are retained.


No. 152.--Mashed Potatoes.

  1/2 dozen large potatoes.
  1 ounce fresh butter.
  3 tablespoons milk.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.
  1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Wash and scrub the potatoes until perfectly free from dirt and mould,
bake them, and when done prick with a fork to allow the steam to escape,
then wipe with a cloth to remove any charred skin, etc. Have ready a
good-sized saucepan (enamelled for preference) in which the milk and
butter have been heated, halve the potatoes and squeeze them into it,
add salt and pepper (the latter should be omitted when being prepared
for children), then with a cook's fork beat backwards and forwards, then
round and round, until the whole mass is perfectly smooth and quite free
from lumps. Turn into a very hot vegetable dish, arrange in a pile and
mark prettily with a fork or knife, then place in the oven for two or
three minutes to re-heat.

Note.--Potatoes prepared in this way constitute an ideal diet. All the
valuable salts are retained instead of being thrown away in the water,
as when peeled before cooking, whilst the butter and milk supply the
fatty elements in which the potato is lacking. The colour also is good,
which is not the case when they are _boiled_ in their skins, and the
taste is delicious.


No. 153.--New Potatoes Fried.

  20 very small new potatoes.
  1 egg.
  2 ounces bread crumbs.
  1/4 teaspoon salt.
  1/4 teaspoon pepper.

well together the salt, pepper, mace, sweet herbs, and bread crumbs.
Roll the potatoes first in the egg, then in the savoury bread crumbs,
and fry in boiling oil until a golden brown.

Serve with sauce piquante No. 171.


No. 154.--Salsify.

  1 dozen roots of salsify.
  1 ounce butter.

Scrape the salsify, and throw it into cold water, cut into pieces about
two inches long, and place in an enamelled stewpan with the water, milk,
lemon, salt, and half an ounce of butter. Boil one hour or until quite
tender, remove the lemon, lift out the salsify and place in a warm
vegetable dish, thicken the liquor with the other half ounce of butter
and the flour, pour over the salsify and serve.


No. 155.--Tomatoes.

  1 dozen tomatoes.
  1 1/2 ounces butter.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.
  1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Scald the tomatoes by pouring boiling water over them, then place in
cold water for half a minute. Remove the skins, which will now come off
quite easily, slice the tomatoes into about four pieces with a very
sharp knife. Have ready a stewpan in which the butter has been dissolved,
place the tomatoes in it, add the seasoning, and stew gently for about
twenty minutes, stirring frequently.

Note.--When strained, this constitutes a very choice sauce, and it may
be slightly thickened.

not serve until perfectly cold.


No. 190.--Haricot Bean Salad.

  1/2 pint soaked haricot beans.
  1 pint of water.
  1 ounce butter.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.
  A little grated nutmeg.
  1/2 pint Sauce No. 174.

Dissolve half an ounce of butter in a saucepan, place in the beans and
water, and boil one and a half hours; add salt and boil another half
hour. When done, strain (saving the liquor), and turn the beans into a
basin containing half an ounce of oiled butter and the nutmeg. Stir the
beans about carefully, and then place them in a dish or salad bowl;
pour the sauce over, and stand on one side to get thoroughly cold.


No. 191.--Onion Salad.

  2 large Spanish onions.
  1 strip of lemon peel.
  1/2 dozen peppercorns.
  Sauce No. 176.

Peel and quarter the onions, and boil them in salted water with the
peppercorns and lemon peel. When quite tender, lift them out and place
on one side to drain and get cold. When quite cold, place them in a dish
or bowl, pour half the sauce over, and reserve the remainder to pour
over just before sending to table.


No. 192.--Potato Salad.

  4 good-sized cold potatoes.
  1 tablespoon of chopped watercress.
  1/2 pint Sauce No. 175.

The potatoes may either be boiled in their skins or peeled; in the first
way they will be the better flavoured and more nourishing, in the latter
a better colour. They must be taken up carefully directly they are
tender, and not allowed to break up at all. Cut into slices about half
an inch thick, stamp out into fancy shapes and arrange prettily in a
small bowl or dish; sprinkle them with the watercress, which should have
been thoroughly washed in salted and rinsed in fresh water; then pour
over the sauce.

This salad, which is generally much appreciated, will be found a very
useful way of using up cold potatoes.


No. 193.--Sea Kale Salad.

  6 or 8 heads of kale.
  Sauce No. 176.

Boil the kale until tender in salted water. When quite done, strain, and
stand on one side to get cold. Cut into pieces about one inch long,
place in a dish or bowl, pour over half the sauce, and the remainder
just before sending to table.


No. 194.--Vegetable Salad.

  4 young carrots.
  4 young potatoes.
  1 shalot.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.
  3 tomatoes.
  1 teaspoon minced watercress
  1/2 pint water.
  1 tablespoon vinegar.

Scrape the carrots and potatoes very clean, and stew them gently until
tender in the vinegar, salt and water, but on no account must they be
allowed to break. When done, take up carefully and place on a board to
cool. Scald the tomatoes by plunging them first into boiling water and
then into cold; remove the skins and seeds and cut into small slices.
When the vegetables are quite cold, cut them up into ornamental shapes,
and arrange them with the tomatoes and shalot very finely minced in a
salad bowl, pour over a Mayonnaise sauce or salad sauce No. 176, and
sprinkle the watercress on the top. Hard-boiled eggs may be added if
liked.

  1/4 pint water.
  2 tablespoons soaked sago.
  1/2 ounce butter.
  1 turnip.
  1 carrot.
  1 shalot.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.

tie a floured cloth over, and boil for three hours.


No. 204.--Potted Lentils.

  1 quart soaked lentils.
  1 quart water.
  4 ounces butter.
  1 teaspoon salt.
  A pinch of sweet herbs.
  6 cloves.
  6 allspice.
  12 peppercorns.
  1 inch cinnamon stick.
  A piece of mace size of a shilling.

Dissolve the butter in a saucepan, then place in all the ingredients
except the salt. Remove the scum as it rises. Boil one hour, add salt,
boil again half an hour, then remove the lid and stir constantly for
another half hour, or until the lentils are reduced to a thick pulp. Rub
through a wire sieve with a wooden spoon until only the husks remain.
When quite cold, place in a dish or jar, and pour oiled butter over the
top to exclude the air. It will keep good for some days.

Note.--The thick remaining in the sieve may be re-boiled for stock.


No. 205.--Baked Mushroom Pudding.

  1/2 pound haricot bean pulp.
  6 or 8 button mushrooms.
  1 shalot.
  2 teaspoons of Worcester or other sauce.
  3 eggs.
  1 ounce butter.
  Pepper and salt to taste.

To obtain the pulp, rub about three-quarters of a pound of well-cooked
beans through a wire sieve, add the mushrooms and shalot very finely
minced, stir in the yolks of the eggs reserving the whites, add
seasoning if required; grease a deep tin or pie dish with the butter,
pour in the mixture, and bake for about half an hour, or until set. In
the meantime beat the whites to a stiff froth, and after beating add
the sauce, turn the pudding on to a hot dish, arrange the froth prettily
over it, and return to the oven to set the egg. Serve quickly.

This pudding may be steamed instead of baked, but the whites of eggs
will not then be required.


No. 206.--Boiled Mushroom Pudding.

  Mushrooms.
  Pudding crust.

Butter a pudding basin, line it with paste, fill with mushrooms, add
pepper and salt to taste (about one teaspoonful of salt and half of
pepper to one dozen good sized mushrooms), adding gravy made by stewing
the peel and stalks of the mushrooms for half an hour in sufficient
water to cover them, and strained before using. Cover with paste, flour
a cloth and tie firmly over, and boil for three hours.


No. 207.--Plain Paste for Puddings.

  3/4 pound flour.
  6 ounces butter.
  Rather less than 1/2 pint water.
  A pinch of salt.
  1 teaspoon baking powder.

Pass the flour through a sieve on to a board, mix with it the salt and
baking powder, and thoroughly rub in the butter. Make a hole in the
centre of the paste, pour in the water, stirring it into the paste at
the same time with the other hand. When sufficiently moist to adhere in
the shape of a ball, roll out to the required thickness. If cooked in a
basin the pudding will require to boil for at least three hours; if in a
cloth, less time will be found sufficient.


No. 208.--Puff Paste.

  1/2 pound Vienna flour.
  6 ounces butter.
  1 egg.
  1/2 tea-cup cold water.
  1 teaspoon lemon juice.

Place the flour in the middle of a paste-board, and lightly roll the
butter in it, then divide the butter into two equal parts, and place one
half on one side. Chop the other half in the flour, then make a hole in
the centre, in which place the lemon juice, the egg (whole), and the
water; mix well together, and put in a cool place for about fifteen
minutes. Then roll it out half an inch thick. Place the other half of
the butter in the centre, fold over two sides of the paste, and roll out
again; this latter counts as the first roll, and the paste must be
rolled out five times in all, allowing an interval of ten minutes
between each roll. The paste should then be left for at least two hours
in a cool place with a damp cloth over it before being used.

Note.--In warm weather, the butter, egg, and water should be kept in a
basin with ice for at least half an hour before using.


No. 209.--Potato Pie.

  4 or 6 potatoes, according to size.
  Cooked haricot beans.
  1 onion.
  About one tablespoon of chopped mint or parsley.

  1 teaspoon salt.
  1 teaspoon mixed sweet herbs.
  Paste for crust No. 207.

Boil the potatoes, onion and egg separately for fifteen minutes, then
slice and mix well together, sprinkling in the salt and herbs. Line a
middling sized pudding basin with paste, fill with the mixture, pour in
the milk, cover with paste, wetting round the edges so that they join
well, tie a cloth over, plunge it into a large saucepan half full of
boiling water, and boil rather fast for three and a half hours.

  1/2 peck green peas.
  1 cabbage lettuce.
  1 onion.
  1 egg.
  1 tablespoon chopped mint.
  1/2 teaspoon salt.

beaten egg, and bake in a rather hot oven for about three-quarters of an
hour.

FRUITS.


No. 214.--Puree of Apples.

Very suitable for young children.

  1/2 pint water.
  24 lumps sugar.
  6 apples.
  A little cinnamon or cloves.

should not be peeled). Simmer for twenty or thirty minutes. Then rub
through a sieve with a wooden spoon.


No. 215.--Stewed Apples.

  6 or 8 apples, according to size.
  1 pint water.
  40 lumps sugar.
  A few cloves.

Dissolve the sugar in the water, peel and core the apples (but do not
cut them), and place them with the cloves in the syrup, stew very gently
for about ten minutes, then turn the apples and simmer for another ten
minutes, or until they are tender, but not broken. When done, place them
in a pretty dish, and fill the hollow part with jam or custard. Reduce
the syrup by boiling it over the fire for a few minutes with the lid
off, strain over the apples, and allow to cool before serving.


No. 216.--Apples Stewed a la Gloire.

  10 or 12 stewing apples.
  1 1/2 pints of water.
  1/2 pound loaf sugar.

  { 12 cloves.
  { 1 small stick of cinnamon tied in muslin.

Place the water, sugar, and flavourings in a large enamelled stewpan,
and stand over a gentle heat until the sugar is dissolved. Peel the
apples, carefully remove the cores, leaving the apples whole; place them
in the syrup, and simmer until perfectly tender, but not broken. When
done, lift them out into a glass dish (which should have been previously
warmed to prevent cracking), press them slightly with a spoon so as to
make a smooth surface slightly raised in the centre, and stand them on
one side to get cold. When the apples are cold, strain the syrup into a
small stewpan, and reduce over a moderate heat for fifteen or twenty
minutes. Cut the bananas into quarter-inch slices, stamp out the seeds,
and arrange the rings on the apple, placing a cherry in the middle of
each ring. Pour the syrup over the top, when, if it be sufficiently
reduced, it will immediately set, and form a very ornamental as well as
delicious dish.


No. 217.--Stewed French Plums.

  1 pound French plums.
  6 or 8 lumps of sugar.
  Water.

Wash the plums by placing them in a sieve or strainer and pouring hot
water over them; then place them in a stewpan, cover with water, and
boil very gently for half an hour; drop in the sugar and simmer for
another half hour. When done, remove the lid and stand the stewpan on
one side for the plums to cool. Pile them in a glass dish, and pour the
syrup over.

Make a syrup of the sugar and water, peel and hollow the pears (which
must remain whole), place them in the syrup, and stew gently one hour or
until tender; lift them out very carefully on to a plate and allow to
cool. Fill them with jam, roll in egg and bread crumbs, place in a
buttered dish, and bake for about twenty minutes. In the meantime, place

Dissolve the sugar in the water, using an enamelled stewpan, place the
pears in this and allow to simmer for two hours, keeping the lid on.
Remove the stewpan from the fire, and stand it on one side _without_ the
lid until the pears are perfectly cold, then carefully lift them out
(they should be a beautiful red colour) into a glass dish. Strain the
syrup into a small stewpan, boil over a good heat for about fifteen
minutes (watching it carefully the latter portion), reduce to three
tablespoons, pour over the pears, and allow to thoroughly cool before

Pound the cherries in a mortar, crushing as many of the stones as
possible. Place them with the water and sugar in a stewpan, and boil one
hour without the lid. Strain the syrup into a small stewpan, and reduce
until it commences to thicken, then place in the strawberries (first
removing the stalks), and shake them so that they become coated with the
syrup. Lift them out into a glass dish, reduce the syrup again until it

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
