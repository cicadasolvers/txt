      |  1. At the end of this text, an addition has been made   |
      |  of the translation of the eighty-five "Illustrative     |
      |  Games" into Portable Game Notation. While every effort  |
      |  has been made to reproduce the text of "The Blue Book   |
      |  of Chess" exactly as published, the exception has been  |
      |  the inclusion of identification "tags" of the form      |
      |  "{PGN xx}", where "xx" is a two digit number. This has  |
      |  been done to facilitate the reader in locating the PGN  |
      |  for each game by performing a search on the             |
      |  identifying tag.                                        |
      |                                                          |

      |  2. Due to the limitations of ascii art, the Knight has  |
      |  been abbreviated as "N" on the chessboard, while it     |
      |  appears as "Kt." in the text. The ascii convention of   |
      |  the Black pieces being marked with an asterisk has      |
      |  also been followed.                                     |

                    PREFACE TO NEW REVISED EDITION.


The following work is designed for those who are learning the noble game
of Chess.

Many persons have been confused and discouraged at the very outset of
the study by the great variety and the delicate distinctions of the
openings: and this has constituted a fault in many otherwise excellent
manuals for the learner.

The chief aim of the Editor of these pages has been to avoid this fault,
by simplifying the openings, and by giving to the student chiefly such
moves as are recognized to be the best, both in attack and defence. By
playing over carefully the illustrative games, the learner will also
see, at each opening, the variations made by experienced players in
accordance with circumstances. As great a variety of actually played
games has been given as was possible in a work of such limited scope. To
this end the games of the distinguished players of different nations
have been introduced, classified according to the different openings;
and thus the reader will find the combined genius and skill of the old
heroes like Philidor, Morphy, Staunton, Anderssen, Harrwitz, Evans,
Montgomery and Cochrane, together with such recent masters as Lasker,
Steinitz, Schlechter, Pillsbury, Marshall, Tarrasch, Janowsky,
Tchigorin, and many other players of world-wide celebrity. The basis of
this work is Staunton's "Chess Player's Handbook;" but other standard
books have been drawn upon to fit it to be a manual for the beginner of
to-day.

In order to insure perfect accuracy, all the lessons and games have been
carefully gone over on the board after being put in type.

                DESCRIPTION OF THE CHESS-BOARD AND MEN.

The game of Chess is played by two persons, each having at command a
little army of sixteen men, upon a board divided into sixty-four
squares. The squares are usually colored white and black, or red and
white, alternately; and custom has made it an indispensable regulation,
that the board shall be so placed that each player has a white square at
his right-hand corner.

The following diagram represents the board with all the men arranged in
proper order for the commencement of a game:--

                                No. 1.

                                 WHITE.

Each player, it will be observed, has eight superior Pieces or officers,
and eight minor ones which are called Pawns; and, for the purpose of
distinction, the Pieces and Pawns of one party are of a different color
from those of the other.

A King            [Illustration: Chess Pieces, White and Black Kings.]

A Queen           [Illustration: Chess Pieces, White and Black Queens.]

Two Rooks,        [Illustration: Chess Pieces, White and Black Rooks.]
or Castles (as they are indiscriminately called)

Two Bishops       [Illustration: Chess Pieces, White and Black Bishops.]

Two Knights       [Illustration: Chess Pieces, White and Black Knights.]

And each of these Pieces has his Pawn or
Foot-soldier      [Illustration: Chess Pieces, White and Black Pawns.]

making in all an array of sixteen men on each side.

On beginning a game, these Pieces and Pawns are disposed in the manner
shown on the foregoing diagram. The King and Queen occupy the centre
squares of the first or "royal" line, as it is called, and each has for
its supporters a Bishop, a Knight, and a Rook, while before the whole
stand the Pawns or Foot-soldiers in a row. (To prevent a common error
among young players, of misplacing the King and Queen on commencing a
game, it is well to bear in mind that at the outset each Queen stands on
her own color.) The Pieces on the King's side of the board are called
the King's, as King's Bishop, King's Knight, King's Rook; and the Pawns
directly in front of them, the King's Pawn, King's Bishop's Pawn, King's
Knight's Pawn, and King's Rook's Pawn. The Pieces on the Queen's side
are, in like manner, called the Queen's Bishop, Queen's Knight, and
Queen's Rook; and the Pawns before them, Queen's Bishop's Pawn, Queen's
Knight's Pawn, and Queen's Rook's Pawn.


                   MOVEMENT OF THE PIECES AND PAWNS,
                 AND MODE OF CAPTURING AN ADVERSE MAN.

A knowledge of the moves peculiar to these several men is so difficult
to describe in writing, and so comparatively easy to acquire over the
chess-board, from any competent person, that the learner is strongly
recommended to avail himself of the latter means when practicable: for
the use, however, of those who have no chess-playing acquaintance at
command, the subjoined description will, it is hoped, suffice.

The "Pieces," by which title the eight superior officers are technically
designated, in contradistinction to the "Pawns," all take in the same
direction in which they move. This act consists in removing the adverse
Piece or Pawn from the board, and placing the captor on the square the
former occupied. To make this clear, we will begin with the King, and
show his mode of moving and of capturing an adverse man.


                              THE KING.

The King can move one square only at a time (except in "Castling," which
will be explained hereafter), but he can make this move in any
direction, forwards, backwards, laterally, or diagonally. He can take
any one of the adversary's men which stands on an adjoining square to
that he occupies, provided such man is left unprotected, and he has the
peculiar privilege of being himself exempt from capture. He is not
permitted, however, to move into check, that is, on to any square which
is guarded by a Piece or Pawn of the enemy, nor can he, under any
circumstance, be played to an adjacent square to that on which the rival
King is stationed. Like most of the other Pieces, his power is greatest
in the middle of the board, where, without obstruction, he has the
choice of eight different squares. At the sides, he may play to any one

Supposing diagram No. 2 to show the position of the men towards the
conclusion of a game, and it being either party's turn to play, he could
take the adverse Pawn from the board, and place his King on the square
it occupied; and, by doing so, the King would not depart from the order
of his march, which, as we have before said, permits him to move _one
step_ in every direction. In each of these instances we have placed the
Pawn in _front_ of the King, but he would be equally entitled to take it
were it standing on any other part of the eight squares immediately
surrounding him, _always provided it was not sustained or guarded by
some other Piece or Pawn_.


                                THE QUEEN.

The Queen is by much the most powerful of the forces.

She has the advantage of moving as a Rook, in straight lines, forwards,
backwards, and sideways, to the extent of the board in all directions,
and as a Bishop, diagonally, with the same range. To comprehend her
scope of action, place her alone in the centre of the board; it will
then be seen that she has the command of no less than twenty-seven
squares, besides the one she stands on. (Diagram No. 3.)

Thus placed in the middle of the board, the range of the Queen is
immense. She has here the option of taking any one of eight men at the
extremity of the board, on the squares respectively numbered 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, and 8, should her line of march be unobstructed; and if these
men were nearer, on any of the intermediate squares, she would be
equally enabled to take any one of them at her choice. Like all the
other Pieces and Pawns, she effects the capture by removing the man from
the board and stationing herself on the vacated square.

The Rook, or Castle, is next in power to the Queen. He moves in a
straight line, forwards, backwards, or sideways, having a uniform range,
on a clear board, of fourteen squares, exclusive of the one he occupies.

The Rook has the same power in taking as the Queen, forwards, backwards,
and sideways, but he cannot, like her, take any man diagonally.

For example, place the Rook in the centre of the board, and an opposing
man on each of the squares numbered, and the Rook has the power of
taking any one of the four; and he has the same power if the Pieces are
one or two squares closer to him, or immediately surrounding him, in the
direction indicated by the four figures. (See Diagram No. 4.)


                               THE BISHOP.

The Bishop moves diagonally forwards or backwards, to the extent of the
Board. It follows, therefore, that he travels throughout the game only
on squares of the same color as the one on which he stands when the game
begins, and that each player has a Bishop running on white squares, and
one on black squares. When placed on a centre square of a clear board,
he will be found to have a range of thirteen squares.

The Bishop takes, as he moves, diagonally, either forwards or backwards,
his range extending, on unobstructed squares, to the extent of the
diagonal line on which he travels. (See Diagram No. 5.)


                              THE KNIGHT.

The action of the Knight is peculiar, and not easy to describe. He is
the only one of the Pieces which has the privilege of leaping over
another man. The movements of the others are all dependent on their
freedom from obstruction by their own and the enemy's men. For example,
when the forces are duly ranged in order of battle before the
commencement of the game, the Knight is the only one of the eight
capital Pieces which can be played before the Pawns are moved--King,
Queen, Bishop, and Rook are all hemmed in by the rank of Pawns, which
they cannot overleap; but the Knight, having the liberty of springing
over the heads of other men, can be brought into the field at once. His
move is one square _in a straight line_, and _one in an oblique
direction_; or it may be perhaps better understood by saying that he
moves two squares _in a straight line_, and _one in a side direction_.

His power and method of taking an opponent's man will be seen from the
diagram (No. 6) on page 14.

In this situation, in the centre of the board, he would have the power
of taking any one of the men stationed on the squares numbered, by
removing the man and placing himself on the vacant square.


                               THE PAWN.

The Pawn moves only one square at a time, and that _straight forward_,
except in the act of capturing, when it takes one step diagonally to the
right or left file on to the square occupied by the man taken, and
continues on that file until it captures another man. It may, however,
for its _first_ move advance _two_ steps, _provided no hostile Pawn
commands the first square over which he leaps_, for, in that case, the
adverse Pawn has the option of taking him in his passage, _as if he had
moved one step only_. A Pawn is the only one of the forces _which goes
out of his direction to capture_, and which has not the advantage of
moving backwards; but it has one remarkable privilege, by which, on
occasions, it becomes invaluable, _whenever it reaches the extreme
square of the file on which it travels, it is invested with the title
and assumes the power of any superior Piece, except the King, which the
player chooses_. From this circumstance it frequently happens that one
party, by skilful management of his Pawns, contrives to have two, and
sometimes even three Queens on the board at once, a combination of force
which of course is irresistible.

As we before observed, the Pawn is the only man which captures in a
direction different from his line of march. Suppose, at the opening of
the game, White begins by playing King's Pawn to King's fourth square
(see the article on Notation), Black may reply in the same manner with
King's Pawn to King's fourth square, and neither Pawn can do more than
remain an obstruction to the onward march of the other, but if Black
answer instead with King's Bishop's Pawn to Bishop's fourth, or as in
the diagram, with Queen's Pawn to Queen's fourth, then White, if he
choose, may take the adverse Pawn from the board and place his own in
its stead.

                    THE NOTATION ADOPTED TO DESCRIBE
                          THE MOVES OF THE MEN.

There is no portion of an elementary work on Chess of so much importance
to the learner, and none which requires more resolute mastering than
this.

The notation may be called the language of the game and a knowledge of
it is absolutely indispensable to every one who is himself ambitious of
excelling, or who is desirous of appreciating the excellencies of other
players.

Having marshalled the men in battle order, as shown in the first
diagram, you will observe that each party has two _ranks_ of men, on the
first of which stand the superior Pieces, and on the next the eight
Pawns. The eight squares which compose the first rank are each
distinguished by the name of the Piece which occupies it when the men
are first arranged. There are, therefore, the King's square, the King's
Bishop's square, King's Knight's square, and King's Rook's square, and
in like manner, the Queen's square, Queen's Bishop's square, Queen's
Knight's and Queen's Rook's squares. The _files_, that is, the row of
squares running from top to bottom of the board, are also named by the
Pieces occupying the first square in each _file_. Thus each of the
superior officers has a file or row of eight squares running from his
end of the board to the corresponding Piece of the enemy, and every one
of these eight squares takes its name from such officer.

Bear in mind that White names every square on the board, in accordance
with its relative position to one of _his_ eight Pieces, and that Black
does the same. Hence it follows that Black's _first_ squares are White's
_eighth_, and _vice versâ_.

Before proceeding further, it will be desirable for the student to
familiarize himself with the respective moves of the Pieces, names of
the squares, &c. A very little practice will enable him to do so,
especially with the aid of any friend acquainted with them. He should,
in the first place, accustom himself to the setting up the men in order
of battle; after a few repetitions of the process, and comparing their
position with diagram No. 1, he will soon have no difficulty whatever in
arranging them correctly without referring to the book. It will then be
well to clear the board of all but a single Piece, and practise with
that until perfect in its movements; another, and then another, may be
added, until the action of every one is as familiar as the alphabet.

Suppose, as a first exercise, you begin by placing your Queen on her
square (_i.e._, her first square), then play her to Q's 5th square, then
(diagonally, observe) to Q. Rook's 8th square, then to King's Rook's 8th
square, then to Q. R's square, and then home again to her square. It is
proper to mention that the directions for moving a Piece are not usually
printed in full, and that, according to the modern abbreviations in the
present and other chess-books, these several instructions would be given
thus:--

                           1. Q. to her sq.
                           2. Q. to her 5th.
                           3. Q. to her R's 8th.
                           4. Q. to K. R's 8th.
                           5. Q. to her R's sq.
                           6. Q. to her sq.

As a next exercise, put the Queen's Bishop on his square, beside the
Queen, and play him as follows:--

                           1. Q. B. to K. R's 6th.
                           2. Q. B. to K. B's 8th.
                           3. Q. B. to Q. R's 3d.
                           4. Q. B. to his sq.

To these two Pieces now add the Queen's Knight, on his own square, and
play as follows:--

                           1. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.
                           2. Q. Kt. to K's 4th.
                           3. Q. Kt. to K. B's 6th.
                           4. Q. Kt. to K's 8th.
                           5. Q. Kt. to Q. B's 7th.
                           6. Q. Kt. to Q. Kt's 5th.
                           7. Q. Kt. to Q. B's 3d.
                           8. Q. Kt. to his sq.

By taking all the Pieces in succession thus, you will speedily obtain
sufficient knowledge of their movements to commence the opening of a
game; but before attempting this, it is needful for you to be

                TECHNICAL TERMS IN USE AMONG CHESS-PLAYERS.

_Castling._--Although, as a general rule, the move of the King is
restricted to one square at a time, he has the privilege, under certain
conditions, once in the game, of moving in conjunction with either of
the Rooks two squares. This peculiar movement is called _Castling_, and
is performed in the following manner:--If a player wishes to castle on
his King's side of the board, he moves the King to K. Kt's sq., and then
places the K's Rook on K. B's square. If he castles on the Queen's side,
he plays his King to Q. B's sq, and Q's Rook to Q's sq. The object of
this compound move is to place the royal Piece in safety, and at the
same time bring the Rook from the corner square into better play.

The conditions under which a player is permitted to castle are:--1st.
The King must not be in check. 2d. The King must not have moved. 3d. The
Rook must not have moved. 4th. The King must not pass over or on to any
square attacked by an enemy's man. And 5th. There must be no Piece,
either of his own or the adversary's, between the King and the Rook.

In exemplification of the importance of castling, to escape from an
attack, and to retort one on the adversary, see, presently, the diagram
No. 8 (p. 24).

_Check and Checkmate._--The King is said to be in _check_ when he is
attacked by any Piece or Pawn, for it being a fundamental law of chess
that the King can never be taken, whenever any direct attack upon him is
made, he must be warned of his danger by the cry of _check_, and the
player is then compelled either to remove his King _out_ of _check_, or
parry the check by interposing a man between the King and the attacking
Piece, or capture the checking man.

When he can do none of these three things, he is _checkmated_, and the
game won by the other side. (See diagrams Nos. 9 and 10.) When the King
is directly attacked by the Piece played, it is a _simple_ check; but
when the Piece moved does not itself give check, but unmasks another
which does, it is called a _discovered check_. (See diagram No. 8.) The
third species of check is named the _double check_, where the King is
attacked both by the Piece moved and the one discovered. The fourth
description is called _perpetual check_, a case which arises when a
player has two or more squares on which he can give check, and his
opponent can only parry one check by affording an opportunity for
another. If the first player then persists in the repetition of these
particular checks, the game must be abandoned as drawn. (See diagram No.
11).

_Doubled Pawn._--When two Pawns of the same color are on the same file,
the front one is called a _doubled pawn_.

_Drawn Game._--When neither party can give checkmate, the game is drawn.
This may arise from several causes, as:--1st. _Perpetual check._ 2d.
Where there is not sufficient force to effect a mate, as a King and a
Knight only, or a King and two Knights, &c., &c. 3d. Where one party has
force sufficient, but is ignorant of the proper mode of applying it, and
thus fails to checkmate his helpless adversary within the fifty moves
prescribed by the "Code". 4th. Where both parties persist in repeating
the same move from fear of each other. 5th. Where both parties are left
with the same force at the end, as a Queen against a Queen, a Rook
against a Rook, and the like, when, except in particular cases, the game
should be resigned as a drawn battle. And 6th. When one of the Kings is
_stalemated_.

_En Prise._--When a Piece or Pawn is in a situation to be taken by the
enemy, it is said to be _en prise_. To put a piece _en prise_, is to
play it so that it may be captured.

_The Exchange._--When a player gains a Rook for a Bishop or a Knight, it
is termed _winning the exchange_.

_False Move._--Any illegal move, such as castling when the King has
been moved or is in check, moving a Rook diagonally, or a Bishop like a
Knight, is called a false or an "impossible" move.

_Fool's Mate._--This is the simplest of all checkmates, being
accomplished in two moves in the following manner:--

               WHITE.                        BLACK.
    1. K. Kt. P. to K. Kt's 4th.     1. K. P. to K's 4th.
    2. K. B. P. to K. B's 4th.       2. Q. to K. R's 5th, checkmate.

It cannot possibly be given by the first player.

_Forced Move._--When a player has one only legal move at command, it is
said to be a _forced move_.

_Gambit._--This word is derived from an Italian phrase in wrestling, and
signifies a movement by which the adversary is tripped up. In chess,
this is attempted by the first player putting a Pawn _en prise_ of the
enemy early in the game, by which he is enabled more rapidly and
effectually to develope his superior Pieces. There are several gambits,
but the most important, and one which includes many others, is the
King's gambit, commenced as follows:--

             WHITE.                          BLACK.
    1. K. P. to K's 4th.             1. K. P. to K's 4th.
    2. K. B. P. to B's 4th.          2. P. takes K. B. P.

The Pawn offered by the first player here at his second move is called
the Gambit Pawn, and when taken by the adversary the opening becomes a
gambit.

The varieties of the gambits are often designated by the names of the
players who invented or first brought them into vogue--as the _Muzio_
gambit, the _Salvio_ gambit, the _Allgaier_ gambit, the _Lopez_ gambit;
while others obtain their names from the opening moves of the first
player, as the King's Bishop's gambit, which begins thus:--

            WHITE.                          BLACK.
    1. K. P. to K's 4th.             1. K. P. to K's 4th.
    2. K. B. P. to B's 4th.          2. P. takes P.
    3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.

and is so called because the K's Bishop is played out at the 3d move
instead of the K's Knight.

There is also the Queen's gambit, of which the opening moves are--

             WHITE.                         BLACK.
    1. Q. P. to Q's 4th.             1. Q. P. to Q's 4th.
    2. Q. B. P. to B's 4th.          2. P. takes P.

The gambits are the most brilliant and animated of all the openings,
full of hair-breadth 'scapes and perilous vicissitudes, but affording an
infinitude of beautiful and daring combinations.

"_Giuoco Piano_," a solid and instructive modification of the King's
Knight's game, is safe and for drawing games generally practised by the
leading players. The opening moves are:

            WHITE.                         BLACK.
    1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
    2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
    3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.

_To Interpose._--When the King is checked, or any valuable Piece in
danger from the attack of an enemy, you are said to _interpose_ a man
when you play it between the attacked and attacking Piece.

_Isolated Pawn._--A Pawn which stands alone, without the support and
protection of other Pawns, is termed an _isolated_ Pawn.

_J'adoube._--A French expression, signifying "I arrange," or "I
replace," which is used by a player when he touches a man merely to
adjust its position on the board, without intending to play it. (See the
7th law.)

_Minor Pieces._--The Bishop and Knight, in contradistinction to the
Queen and Rook, are called _Minor Pieces_.

_The Opposition._--A player is said to have the opposition when he can
place his King directly in front of the adverse King, with only one
square between them. This is often an important advantage in ending
games.

_Party._--From the French _partie_. Frequently used by modern writers
instead of the word "game."

_Passed Pawn._---A Pawn is said to be a _passed_ one when the adversary
has no Pawn to obstruct its march on the same file, or on either of the
next files to the right or left.

_Pion Coiffé, or Marked Pawn._--This is a description of odds but rarely
given, and only when there is a vast disparity between the skill of the
players. It consists in one party placing a _cap_ or ring on one of his
Pawns, and undertaking to checkmate his opponent with that particular
Pawn. He is not allowed to _Queen_ the Pawn, and if he loses it, or
happens to checkmate his opponent with any other man, he forfeits the
game. The Pawn usually _capped_ is the King's Knight's, because it can
be more readily and effectually surrounded by protecting Pieces.

_To Queen a Pawn, or to advance a Pawn to Queen._--When a player has
contrived to advance a Pawn to the eighth or last square of the file, it
assumes the rank and power of a Queen, or of any other Piece he chooses,
and he is then said to have _queened_ his Pawn. (See the 21st law.)

_Scholar's Mate._--A checkmate occasionally given at the opening of a
game by a practised player to one but little tutored in the science. The
following are the moves:--

            WHITE.                         BLACK.
    1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
    2. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          2. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.
    3. Q. to K. R's 5th.             3. Q. P. one.
    4. Q. takes K. B. P., giving checkmate.

_Smothered Mate._--A checkmate which is sometimes given by the Knight
when the adverse King is hemmed in, or _smothered_, by his own forces.
(See diagram No. 12.)

_Stalemate._--When one party has his King so circumstanced that, not
being at the moment in check, he cannot play him without going into
check, and at the same time has no other Piece or Pawn to move instead,
he is said to be _stalemated_, and the game is considered drawn. (See
diagram No. 13.)

_Taking a Pawn en Passant, or in Passing._--It has been shown before, in
speaking of the action of the Pawn, that he is limited in his march to
one square forward at a time, when not capturing, and one square forward
diagonally, either to the right or left, when he takes an adversary, but
that he has the privilege, on being first played in the game, to advance
two squares, unless in so doing he pass a square which is attacked by a
hostile Pawn; in which case the opponent may, at his option, permit him
to make the two steps forward, and there remain, or may capture him in
his passage in the same way as if he had moved but one step.

In this situation the white King is threatened with what is called "a
discovered check," that is, his opponent, by removing the Bishop, would
_discover_ check from the Queen, a proceeding in the present instance,
which would speedily involve the loss of the game to White. Not being
at the moment in check, however, and having moved neither King nor Rook,
and there being no _intervening_ Piece between the King and his own
Rook, White is enabled to castle, giving check to the adverse King at
the same time, and win the game easily, for Black has no square to which
he can move his King without going into check, and is consequently
obliged to interpose his Q. at K. B's second, or K. B's third square, in
either case being checkmated in two more moves, as you will soon be able
to see.

The above position represents the appearance of the forces on each side
towards the end of a game, and will assist to explain the application of
two or three of the technical terms described in the present section, as
well as to exhibit the King in a situation of checkmate. You already
understand that the moves at chess are played by each party
alternately; in this case it is White's turn to play, and he will
checkmate his antagonist in two moves. Place the chess-men on your board
exactly in the order they stand in the diagram; having done this,
suppose yourself to be playing the White men, and take the Black King's
Pawn with your Queen, in the manner before shown, _i.e._, by taking the
Pawn from the board and stationing your Queen on the square it occupied.
By this act, you not only take his Pawn, but you attack his King, and
must apprise him of his danger by calling "_check_." He has now two ways
only of parrying this check. It is clear he cannot move his King,
because the only two squares to which he could move without going into
check are occupied by his own men; he is forced then either to take the
Queen with his K. B's Pawn, or to interpose the Bishop at King's second
square. If he take the Queen with his K. B's Pawn, you must reply by
playing your King's Bishop (which you will know by the color of the
diagonal on which he travels) to K. Kt's sixth square, crying "check."
Examine the position attentively, and you will find that Black has no
square to which he can move his King, the only vacant one being attacked
by your Queen's Bishop, that he has nothing wherewith to take the Bishop
that has given check, and neither Piece nor Pawn with which to interpose
between it and his King, and that consequently, he is not only checked,
but _checkmated_. In like manner, if, at his first move, instead of
capturing your Queen, he interpose his Bishop at King's second square,
you immediately take the Bishop with your Queen, who is protected by her
Bishop, and say "checkmate."[A]

[Footnote A: We append a diagram here, showing a position which has
frequently been misapprehended by unpractised players.

By inspecting the diagram it will be seen that the White King is in
check of the Black Queen. By the simple move of the White Rook to K.
Kt's 5th square, checking the Black King, and at the same time
discovering check by the White Queen, Black is checkmated, although
having by far the strongest force of men. We give the position to show
that any Piece or Pawn, although employed in covering a check of its own
King, has nevertheless the power to check the adverse King.

                          _Perpetual Check._

The diagram on page 28 will enable you to understand what is meant by
_perpetual check_ as well as the most elaborate arrangement of the men
could do. Place the men on your chess-board according to the diagram,
suppose yourself to be playing the white Pieces, and that it is your
turn to move. Your adversary, you will observe, has the advantage in
point of force, but this is counterbalanced by the situation, which
enables you to draw the game. To do this, you must first play your Queen
to one of the three squares where she will check the King, _i.e._, to
K's 4th, Q's 5th, or Q. B's 6th; it is indifferent which, say,
therefore, Q. to K's 4th (check). Black has no option, his King cannot
move, he must interpose his Queen. If now you were to take the Queen you
would lose the game, on account of his two Pawns; but instead of doing
so, you play the Queen to King's 8th sq, giving check. The black Queen
must again interpose; you repeat the check at K's 4th, Black can only
parry it with his Queen, and you may persist in giving the same two
checks, _ad infinitum_. In such cases, the game is resigned as "drawn by
_perpetual check_."

                           _Smothered Mate._

This is a familiar example of _smothered mate_, which you will find can
be effected by no other Piece than the Knight. White first move is,
Queen to her 5th square checking. Black is obliged to retreat his King
to the R's sq., because, were he to play him to his B's sq., the Q would
checkmate at once. Upon the King retiring, White gives check with his
Kt. at K. B's 7th; this brings the King back again to Knight's sq., and
affords to White an opportunity of giving _double check_, which he does
by moving the Knight to K. Rook's 6th, checking with both Q. and
Knight; as before, the King must go to Rook's sq.; and now follows a
beautiful move--White plays his Queen down to K. Kt's 8th (next square
to the Black King), giving check; the King cannot take on account of the
Knight; he is compelled, therefore, to capture with his Rook, and the
Knight then gives the _smothered mate_ at K. B's 7th square.

Here you observe that White has the great advantage of a Queen against a
Rook; but with all this, and the move to boot, it is impossible for him
to do more than draw the game. It is evident that he cannot move his
Queen from the front of his King on account of exposing him to check
with the Rook. If he move his King, Black takes the Queen, and the game
is drawn. And lastly, if he take the Rook with his Queen, he places the
adverse King in the position before described of _stalemate_.

              ON THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE CHESS FORCES.

An attempt to establish a scale of powers whereby the relative values of
the several men could be estimated with mathematical exactitude,
although it has frequently engaged the attention of scientific minds,
appears to be an expenditure of ingenuity and research upon an
unattainable object. So ever varying, so much dependent on the mutations
of _position_ which every move occasions, and on the augmented power
which it acquires when combined with other forces, is the proportionate
worth of this with that particular man, that it would seem to be beyond
the reach of computation to devise a formula by which it can be reckoned
with precision. But still an approximation to correctness has been made,
and the result arrived at gives the following as the ultimate respective
values:--

                           Pawn   = 1.00
                           Knight = 3.05
                           Bishop = 3.50
                           Rook   = 5.48
                           Queen  = 9.94

The King, from the nature of the game, which does not admit of his being
exchanged or captured, is invaluable, and he is not, therefore, included
in the calculations.

The Pawn, it is seen, is the least valuable of all the men, the Knight
being worth at least three Pawns.

The Bishops and Knights are practically considered of equal value,
although there is a difference in the estimate here given.

A Rook is of the value of five Pawns and a fraction, and may be
exchanged for a minor Piece and two Pawns. Two Rooks may be exchanged
for three minor Pieces.

The Queen is usually reckoned equal, in average situations, to two Rooks
and a Pawn, but towards the end of a game she is hardly so valuable as
two Rooks.

These comparative values may be of service to the student in general
cases of exchanging men, but he will find in practice the relative worth
of his soldiers is modified by so many circumstances of time,
opportunity, and position, that nothing but experience can ever teach
him to determine accurately in every case "which to give up and which to
keep."




                              THE CHESS CODE.

                           OR, LAWS OF THE GAME.


                         DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED.

     Whenever the word "_Umpire_" is used herein, it stands for any
     Committee having charge of Matches or Tournaments, with power to
     determine questions of chess-law and rules; or for any duly
     appointed Referee, or Umpire; for the bystanders, when properly
     appealed to; or for any person, present or absent, to whom may be
     referred any disputed questions; or for any other authority
     whomsoever having power to determine such questions.

     When the word "_move_" is used it is understood to mean a legal
     move or a move to be legally made according to these laws.

     When the word "_man_" or "_men_" is used, it is understood that it
     embraces both Pieces and Pawns.


                          THE CHESS-BOARD AND MEN.

     The Chess-board must be placed with a white square at the
     right-hand corner.

     If the Chess-board be wrongly placed, or if there is a deficiency
     in number, or a misplacement of the men, at the beginning of the
     game, the game shall be annulled, provided the error is discovered
     before the second player makes four moves.


                            FIRST MOVE AND COLOR.

     The right of first move must be determined by lot.

     The right of first move shall alternate, whether the game be won,
     lost or drawn.

     Whenever a game shall be annulled, the party having the move in
     that game shall have it in the next game. An annulled game must be
     considered, in every respect, the same as if it had never been
     begun.


                                CONCESSIONS.

     The concession of an indulgence by one player does not give him the
     right of a similar or other indulgence from his opponent.


                                   ERRORS.

     If, during the course of the game, it be discovered that any error
     or illegality has been committed in the moves of the pieces, the
     moves must be retraced, and the necessary correction made, without
     penalty.

     If the moves cannot be correctly retraced the game must be
     annulled.

     If a man be dropped from the board and moves made during its
     absence, such moves must be retraced and the man restored. If this
     cannot be done, to the satisfaction of the Umpire, the game must be
     annulled.


                                 CASTLING.

     The King can be Castled only:--

     When neither the King nor the Castling Rook has been moved, and

     Where the King is not in check, and

     Where all the squares between the King and Rook are unoccupied, and

     Where no hostile man attacks the square on which the King is to be
     placed, or the square he crosses.

     In Castling, the King must be moved first, or before the Rook is
     quitted. If the Rook be quitted before the King is touched, the
     opposing player may demand that the move of the Rook shall stand
     without the Castling being completed.

     The penalty of moving the King prohibits Castling.


                                EN PASSANT.

     Taking the Pawn "_en Passant_," when the only possible move, is
     compulsory.


                             PROMOTING THE PAWN.

     A Pawn reaching the eighth square must be at once exchanged for any
     piece of its own color (except the King) that the player of the
     Pawn may elect.


                                   CHECK.

     No penalty can be enforced for an offence committed against these
     rules in consequence of a false announcement of "check." When check
     is given it is not obligatory to announce the check.


                                 "J'ADOUBE."

     "J'adoube," "I adjust," or words to that effect, cannot protect a
     player from any of the penalties imposed by these laws, unless the
     man or men touched, obviously _need_ adjustment, and unless such
     notification be distinctly uttered _before_ the man, or men, be
     touched, and only the player whose turn it is to move is allowed so
     to adjust.

     The hand having once quitted the man, but for an instant, the move
     must stand.

     Men overturned or displaced accidentally may be replaced by either
     player, without notice.

     A wilful displacement, or overturning of any of the men, forfeits
     the game.


                                 PENALTIES.

     Penalties can be enforced only at the time an offence is committed,
     and before any move is made thereafter.

     A player touching one of his men, when it is his turn to play, must
     move it. If it cannot be moved he must move his King. If the King
     cannot move, the offender must move a man selected by his opponent.

     For playing two moves in succession the adversary may elect which
     move shall stand.

     For touching an adversary's man, when it cannot be captured, the
     offender must move his King. If the King cannot move, the offender
     must move a man selected by his opponent. But if the man touched
     can be legally taken, it must be captured.

     For playing a man to a square to which it cannot be legally moved,
     the adversary, at his option, may require him to move the man
     legally, or to move the King. If the latter penalty be exacted, and
     the King cannot legally be moved, the offender must move any piece
     designated by the opposing player.

     For illegally capturing an adversary's man, the offender must move
     his King, or legally capture the man, as his opponent may elect. If
     neither is possible, the offender must move a man selected by his
     opponent.

     For attempting to Castle illegally, the player doing so, must move
     either the King or Rook, as his adversary may dictate.

     For touching more than one of the player's own men, he must move
     either man that his opponent may name.

     For touching more than one of the adversary's men, the offender
     must capture the one named by his opponent, or if _either_ cannot
     be captured, he may be required to move the King or capture the man
     which can be taken, at the adversary's option; or, if _neither_ can
     be captured, then the King must be moved.

     A player moving into check may be required, by the opposing player,
     either to move the King elsewhere, or to move some other piece
     designated by the opposing player.

     For discovering check on his own King, the player must either
     legally move the man touched, or move the King at his adversary's
     option. In case neither move can be made he must move a piece
     designated by his adversary.

     While in check, for touching or moving a man which does not cover
     the check, the player may be required to recover with another
     piece, or move the King, as the opposing player may elect.


                               ADJOURNED GAME.

     Upon a game being adjourned, the player whose turn it is to move
     shall seal his move. Sealing a move consists in writing it legibly
     on a piece of paper which shall remain in the keeping of a third
     party during the adjournment.

     Upon the resumption of an adjourned game the position existing at
     the time of adjournment shall be set up and the sealed move made on
     the board.

     If the position existing at the time of adjournment cannot be
     ascertained the game shall be annulled.

     If upon opening a sealed move the record cannot be interpreted as
     expressing a legal move, the offending player may be required to
     move his King, or, if the King cannot legally be moved, a piece
     designated by his opponent. If the record can be interpreted as
     expressing either of two moves, the offender shall make the one
     selected by his opponent.


                              DRAWN GAMES.

     A game is drawn--

     (a) When the players agree to treat it as drawn.

     (b) Upon the proof by either player that fifty moves have been
     made on each side without a piece being captured.

     (c) When either player claims a draw upon his turn to play, and
     proves that the existing position has occurred at least twice
     before during the game.

     (d) When either player claims a draw and demonstrates that he can
     subject the opposing King to an endless series of checks.

     (e) When a stale-mate occurs.


                                TIME LIMIT.

     The penalty for exceeding the time limit is the forfeiture of the
     game.

     It shall be the duty of each player, as soon as his move be made,
     to stop his own register of time and start that of his opponent,
     whether the time be taken by clocks, sand-glass, or otherwise. No
     complaint respecting an adversary's time can be considered, unless
     this rule be strictly complied with. But nothing herein is intended
     to affect the penalty for exceeding the time limit as registered.


                           ABANDONING THE GAME.

     If either player abandon the game by quitting the table in anger,
     or in an otherwise offensive manner; or by momentarily resigning
     the game; or refuses to abide by the decision of the Umpire, the
     game must be scored against him.

     If a player absent himself from the table, or manifestly ceases to
     consider his game, when it is his turn to move, the time so
     consumed shall, in every case, be registered against him.


                              DISTURBANCE.

     Any player wilfully disturbing his adversary shall be admonished;
     and if such disturbance be repeated, the game shall be declared
     lost by the player so offending, provided the player disturbed then
     appeals to the Umpire.


                              THE UMPIRE.

     It is the duty of the Umpire to determine all questions submitted
     to him according to these laws, when they apply, and according to
     his best judgment when they do not apply.

     No deviation from these laws can be permitted by an Umpire, even by
     mutual or general consent of the players, after a match or
     tournament shall have been commenced.

     The decision of the Umpire is final, and binds both and all the
     players.


                   RULES FOR PLAYING THE GAME AT ODDS.

     I. In games where one player gives the odds of a piece, or "the
     exchange," or allows his opponent to count drawn games as won, or
     agrees to check-mate with a particular man, or on a particular
     square, he has the right to choose the men, and to move first,
     unless an arrangement to the contrary is agreed to between the
     combatants.

     II. When the odds of Pawn and one move, or Pawn and more than one
     move, are given, the Pawn given must be the King's Bishop's Pawn
     when not otherwise previously agreed on.

     III. When the odds of two or more moves are given, the player
     receiving the odds shall begin the game with these moves, but may
     not, in making them, advance any piece beyond his fourth rank.

     IV. When a player gives the odds of a Rook he may move his King as
     though to castle with the Rook given, provided the square of the
     missing Rook has been unoccupied throughout the game, and provided
     the ordinary conditions as to squares and the King are complied
     with.

     V. When the odds of a Pawn, Knight, Bishop, or Rook, are given, it
     is understood that the King's Bishop's Pawn, or the Queen's Knight,
     Queen's Bishop or Queen's Rook, is intended unless special
     agreement to the contrary is made.




                    GENERAL RULES AND OBSERVATIONS.

_Concerning the King._--It is mostly advisable to castle the King pretty
early in the game, and to do so on the King's side, because he is less
subject to an attack, and better able to repel one on that side than the
other.

Be fearful, when castled on the King's side, of permitting an adverse
Knight to gain safe possession of your King's Bishop's 4th square, and
remember that it is seldom prudent in an inexperienced player to advance
the Pawns on the side his King has castled.

Be cautious of playing your Queen in front of your King and in
subjecting yourself to a _discovered check_. It is better when check is
given to your King to interpose a man that attacks the checking Piece
than with one that does not. Beware of giving useless checks to your
adversary's King, but when, by checking, you can oblige him to move, and
thus deprive him of the right to castle, it is generally good play to do
so. It is sometimes useful to give a series of checks, and even
sacrifice a Piece, to force the King into the middle of the board, where
he may be subjected to the attacks of your other men.

Do not in all cases take an enemy's Pawn which stands before your
King,--it may serve sometimes as a protection to him; and bear in mind
that towards the termination of a game, especially when the superior
Pieces have been taken off the field, the King should be made to
compensate for his previous inactivity, by being busily engaged. The
fate of the game is then dependent for the most part on the skill
displayed in the management of the King.

_Concerning the Queen._--The Queen is so powerful and important a Piece
at chess that she should rarely be employed to defend or attack any
point if you can do it as well with a subordinate.

It is not good to play the Queen out in the game at the beginning,
because she can be attacked by inferior Pieces, and is compelled to
retire with the loss of many moves.

Be careful, too, when about to capture a distant Pawn or Piece, that you
do not remove your Queen too far from the immediate point of action. A
skilful player will often permit you to win a Pawn with the Queen, that
he may prevent her returning in time to rescue your King from his
attack. The power of the Queen is wonderfully greater when she is aided
and protected by other Pieces than when she goes forth unsupported; it
is generally injudicious, therefore, to make an attack with her unless
in combination with some other of your forces.

_Concerning the Rook._--The Rook is a most important officer, yet few
players even amongst the best avail themselves sufficiently of his
power. He has seldom much scope for action in the early part of the
engagement, but when the field is thinned no time should be lost in
bringing him into action. You should then endeavor to _double_ your
Rooks, that is, to place them one before the other on the same file: in
this situation, mutually sustaining one another, their potency on a
clear field is equal to the Queen's.

It is usually good play to get command of an open file, that is to say,
a file which is occupied by no other man, by stationing a Rook at one
end of it. When you have thus gained possession of the file, should your
opponent try to dispossess you of it, by playing one of his Rooks on the
same file, it is frequently better to defend with your other Rook than
to take his or remove your own. You will often embarrass your adversary,
too, if you can manage to post a Rook on his second rank, say at your
King's 7th or Queen's 7th square. In this position he generally makes an
attack on the Pawns unmoved, and compels the enemy to lose time in
defending them, while you can bring more forces into action.

One of the strongest reasons for playing out your Pieces early in the
battle, is, that while at home they are not only themselves inactive,
but they utterly retard the movements of your Rooks. In an unskilfully
developed game it is a common occurrence to see the victory won before
the defeated player's Rooks have ever moved.

_Concerning the Bishop._--When the game is opened by each party with
King's Pawn to King's 4th square, the _King's Bishop_ is somewhat
superior to the _Queen's_, because it can be sooner brought into play,
and may be made to bear immediately on the King's weak point, his
Bishop's Pawn. It is desirable therefore generally to exchange your
Queen's Bishop or Queen's Knight for the adversary's King's Bishop. The
King's Bishop should rarely or never be played to the Queen's 3d square
before the Queen's Pawn is moved. His best position, as we have remarked
above, is to Queen's Bishop's 4th square, where he attacks the
opponent's King's Bishop's Pawn. If your antagonist then challenges an
exchange of Bishops by moving his Queen's Bishop to King's 3d square, it
is not always prudent to accept it, because although you may double the
Pawns on his King's file, you at the same time afford him an open range
for his King's Rook when he has castled. The best play in such a case
is, therefore, to retreat your King's Bishop to _Queen's Knight's 3d
square_.

Be careful, as a general rule, in an open game, not to move your
Queen's Pawn _one_ square _before_ you bring out the King's Bishop, as
by so doing you leave him but the _King's 2d square_ on which to move,
and there his position is defensive rather than attacking.

If strong in Pawns towards the conclusion of the game, endeavor to get
rid of the enemy's Bishops, because they can impede the march of your
Pawns more readily than either the Rooks or Knights.

When the other men are exchanged off, and you remain with a Bishop and
two or three Pawns, it is often proper to keep your Pawns on squares of
a different color from those on which your Bishop travels, as he can
then prevent the opposing King from approaching them. If, however, you
have the worst of the game, it is mostly better then to keep them on the
same color as the Bishop, that he may defend them.

Supposing you have _Pawns only_ at the end of a game, and the adversary
has a Bishop, it is generally advisable to move the Pawns as soon as
possible to squares of a different color from the diagonals on which he
moves.

Do not indiscriminately exchange your Bishops for Knights, or _vice
versâ_. Two Bishops at the finish of a game are stronger than two
Knights, and one Knight generally more useful than a single Bishop.

_Concerning the Knight._--The Knight is at once the most striking and
most beautiful of all the Pieces. The singularity of its evolutions, by
which it is enabled to overleap the other men and wind its way into the
penetralia of the adverse ranks, and if attacked leap back again within
the boundary of its own, has rendered it the favorite Piece of leading
players in every country.

The assault of the Knight is more subtle and dangerous than that of any
other Piece, because he attacks without putting himself _en prise_, and
his attack can never be resisted by the interposition of another man.

At the commencement of a game, the best place for the King's Knight is
at _K. B's 3d sq._; it there attacks your adversary's K's Pawn, if it
has been moved two squares, and offers no impediment to the playing out
your King's Bishop, and prevents the adversary from placing his Queen
on your King Rook's 4th sq., where she would often be a source of
restraint and danger to your King. Many persons prefer playing the
K. Kt. to _K's 2d_ at the second move, from the mistaken notion that the
K. B's P. should be moved before the Knight is played to B's 3d; this is
an error, and generally leads to a very bad game.

When you have brought out your _Q. Kt._ to _B's 3d_, it is frequently
advisable, at a proper opportunity, to get him round by K's 2d sq. to
the _K. Kt's 3d_, where he exercises a very important influence, by
threatening, whenever the square is left unguarded, to post himself on
_K. B's 5th_.

A Knight with three or four Pawns, at the end of a game, has an
advantage over a Bishop with an equal number of Pawns, because he can
leap from white to black, and thus attack the Pawns on either colored
squares, whereas the Bishop can attack them only when they move on
squares of the color of his diagonals. In similar circumstances,
however, he is not so useful in defending as a Bishop or a Rook, since
if forced to remove he ceases to defend, while the Rook or Bishop may
retreat and still protect.

_Concerning the Pawns._--Struck by the scope and power of the higher
Pieces, young players commonly overlook the homely Pawns, or deem them
scarcely worthy of regard, and are amazed to learn that the combinations
of these simple elements are among the most refined and arduous studies
of the science. Yet such is the fact, and without a thorough
comprehension of their quiet but remarkable predominance in almost every
circumstance of the game, it is impossible for any one to attain a high
degree of excellence.

It is generally advantageous for your Pawns to occupy the middle of the
board, because when there they greatly retard the movements of the
opposing forces. The King's Pawn and Queen's Pawn, at their fourth
squares, are well posted, but it is not easy to maintain them in that
position, and if you are driven to advance one of them, the power of
both is much diminished. It is well, therefore, not to be too eager to
establish two Pawns abreast in the centre until you are fully able to
sustain them there.

When you have two Pawns abreast, the King and Queen's, for instance, at
their fourth squares, should the adversary attack one of them with a
Pawn, it is occasionally better to advance the Pawn that is attacked
another step, than to take the Pawn.

The Pawns, however, should seldom be far advanced, unless they can be
properly sustained by the Pieces. Pawns at their fourth squares are
therefore mostly more powerful than at their sixth.

The King's Bishop's Pawn having no support but that of the King, is
usually the point to which the first attack is directed, and more than
ordinary care should be taken to preserve it. It is rarely good play to
move the King's Bishop's Pawn to Bishop's 3d early in the game.

As a general rule, it is not advisable to move King's Knight's Pawn or
Queen's Knight's Pawn early in the game. The former played to K. Kt's 3d
square will often allow your adversary to play his Queen's Bishop to
your King's Rook's 3d square, a dangerous move when you have castled on
King's side.

After castling, it is generally proper not to move the Knight's Pawn
that is before your King, until you are obliged.

In a diagonal line of Pawns you should endeavor to preserve the Pawn at
the head of them. Pawns, when united, have great strength; but when
separated, their power is sensibly lessened.

A passed Pawn is mostly serviceable when supported by another Pawn.

A doubled Pawn is not in all cases a disadvantage, especially if it is
united with other Pawns. The worst kind of doubled Pawn is one on a
Rook's file; while the most advantageous is the King's Bishop's Pawn
doubled on the King's file, because it strengthens your middle Pawns and
opens a file for your King's Rook.

The Pawn being less important than a Piece, it is usually better to
defend with it than with a Piece. For the same reason it is likewise
better to protect a Pawn with a Pawn than with a Piece. No Piece can
interpose between the attack of a Pawn, it can therefore frequently
check the King with great advantage.

Be cautious generally of advancing the Pawns far on either side, till
you see on which your opponent castles; and remember, when approaching
the end of a game, where you have Pawns, or even a Pawn, against a minor
Piece, that _you may win_, but that your opponent, except in very rare
cases, cannot, and that two Pawns in any situation can _protect
themselves_ against the adverse King.


             MAXIMS AND ADVICE FOR AN INEXPERIENCED PLAYER.

There is nothing that will improve you so much as playing with good
players; never refuse, therefore, when any one offers you odds, to
accept them: you cannot expect a proficient to feel much interest in
playing with you upon _even_ terms, and as you are sure to derive both
amusement and instruction from him, it is but fair that he should name
the conditions. It will soon happen that you yourself will be able to
give odds to many amateurs whom you meet; when this is the case, avoid,
if possible, playing them _even_, or you are likely to acquire an
indolent, neglectful habit of play, which it will be very difficult to
throw off.

Never permit your hand to hover over the board, or indeed to approach
it, until you have completely made up your mind what Piece to move; a
contrary habit begets a feeling of indecision that is fatal to success.
Play invariably according to the laws of the game, neither taking back a
move yourself, nor allowing your opponent to recall one. Do not exhibit
impatience when your adversary is long in making his move. His slowness
is a tacit compliment to your skill, and enables you to play with
proportionate quickness, because while he is meditating on his next step
you can take advantage of the time to consider what shall be your
rejoinder; besides, it is absolutely necessary for every one desirous
of excelling at chess to play slowly. A fine player examines
occasionally from five to twenty or more moves on each side: can this be
done in a moment? It is easy enough to play quick against inferior play;
but against equal and very good play one cannot play quick without
losing.

Learn to play indifferently either with the white or black men. Do not
play too many games at a sitting--and never suffer the loss of a game to
occasion you much disquietude. Think of how many thousand games a
Philidor must have lost before he attained his highest excellence;
besides, the loss of one well-fought game with a fine practitioner will
do more towards your improvement than the gain of ten light skirmishes
with weaker players than yourself. Endeavor to play all your Pieces
equally well. Many young players have a predilection for a particular
Piece, as the Knight or the Queen, and lose both time and position in
trying to prevent exchanges of their favorite. In opening your game,
endeavor to bring your superior officers into action speedily, but avoid
all premature attacks. Take care not to play a Piece to a square where
it impedes the action of another, and beware of venturing an unsupported
Piece in the adversary's game.

If subjected to a violent attack, you may often disconcert your opponent
by compelling the exchange of two or three Pieces. When, however, you
are about to exchange officers, you must calculate not only their
ordinary value, but their peculiar worth in the situation in question;
for example, a Rook is generally more valuable than a Knight or a
Bishop; but it will happen, that by exchanging a Rook for one of the
latter you may greatly improve your game.

It is mostly good play to exchange the Pieces off when you are superior
in power, so that when you have the odds of a Piece given to you by a
finished player, you should endeavor to exchange as often as you can
consistently with safety.

When an exchange of two or more Pieces appears inevitable, look closely
to see whether it is better for you to take first or to compel your
opponent to do so. When one of the enemy is _completely_ in your power,
do not be too eager to make the capture--there may perhaps be a move of
importance which you can make before you take him. Beware also of
snatching hastily a proffered man, it may be only given as a bait to
catch a more important advantage from you.

If at the end of a game you remain with Pawns against a Knight and find
it difficult to evade his repeated checks, recollect that by placing
your King on the same diagonal as the Knight, with but one intervening
square between them, you cannot again be checked under three moves.

When you have lost a game which has cost you great attention, it is a
good practice to play it over afterwards in private, and endeavor to
discover where the error occurred through which your opponent gained his
first advantage. This custom will improve both your memory and your
play.


           ON THE SEVERAL OPENINGS OR BEGINNINGS OF GAMES.

Before proceeding to the consideration of the various methods of
commencing the game, it is advisable for you to recur to the preceding
sections, which treat of the arrangement of the men--the moves of the
men--their relative powers--the technical terms in use among
players--and the laws of the game. When you have familiarized yourself
with these, it will be time for you to direct your attention to that
most important feature in the game of chess--the art of opening the
game.

There are several modes of beginning the game, but the following are the
principal:--

1st. Each player begins by moving his _King's Pawn to King's 4th
square_, and the first player then moves _King's Knight to King's
Bishop's 3d square_. This is called the _King's Knight's opening_.

2d. Each player commences by moving his _King's Pawn to King's 4th
square_, and then he who has the first move plays _King's Bishop to
Queen's Bishop's 4th square_. This is known as the _King's Bishop's
opening_.

3d. Each player opens with _King's Pawn to King's 4th square_, and the
first plays _Queen's Bishop's Pawn to Bishop's 3d square_. This is
termed the _Queen's Bishop's Pawn's opening_.

4th. Each player begins with _King's Pawn to King's 4th square_, and the
first follows with _King's Bishop's Pawn to Bishop's 4th square_. This
is called the _King's gambit_.

Of these four openings on _the King's side_ there are many
modifications, of which each has its appropriate appellation; there are
also several openings begun on the Queen's side, but the four
above-named are those most generally practised, and with them you should
be thoroughly conversant before advancing further.


                            PRELIMINARY GAME.

Preparatory to the investigation of the several openings treated of in
the following chapters, it may not be uninstructive to give a short game
which shall exhibit the application of some technical phrases in use at
chess, and at the same time show a few of the most prominent errors into
which an inexperienced player is likely to fall.

In this game, as in all the analyses which follow, the reader will be
supposed to play the White Pieces and to have the first move, although,
as it has been before remarked, it is advisable for you to accustom
yourself to play with either Black or White, for which purpose it is
well to practise the attack, first with the White and then with the
Black Pieces.

            WHITE.                            BLACK.
    1. K's P. to K's 4th.              1. K's P. to K's 4th.

When the men are first arranged in battle order, it is seen that the
only Pieces which have the power of moving are the Knights, and that to
liberate the others it is indispensably necessary to move a Pawn. Now,
as the King's Pawn, on being moved, gives freedom both to the Queen and
to the King's Bishop, it is more frequently played at the beginning of
the game than any other. You will remember, in speaking of the Pawns it
was shown that on certain conditions they have the privilege of going
either one or two steps when they are first moved.

    2. K's B. to Q's B's 4th.          2. K's B. to Q's B's 4th.

Thus far the game illustrative of the _King's Bishop's_ opening is
correctly begun. Each party plays his King's Bishop thus, because it
attacks the most vulnerable point of the adverse position, viz., the
_King's Bishop's Pawn_.

    3. Q. B's Pawn to B's 3d.          3. Q's Knight to B's 3d.

In playing this Pawn your object is afterwards to play Queen's Pawn to
Queen's 4th square, and thus establish your Pawns in the centre; but
Black foresees the intention, and thinks to prevent its execution by
bringing another Piece to bear upon the square.

    4. Q's Pawn to Q's 4th.            4. Pawn takes Q's Pawn.
    5. Q's B's Pawn takes Pawn.        5. K's B. takes Pawn.

Here you have played without due consideration. Black's third move of
Queen's Knight to Bishop's 3d square was a bad one, and afforded you an
opportunity of gaining a striking advantage, but omitting this, you have
enabled him to gain a valuable Pawn for nothing. Observe, now, your
reply to his third move was good enough, (4. Queen's Pawn to Queen's 4th
square), but when he took your Pawn with his, instead of taking again,
you ought to have taken his _King's Bishop's Pawn_ with your Bishop,
giving check: the game would then most probably have gone on thus:--

    5. K's B. takes K. B. Pawn (ch.)   5. K. takes Bishop.
    6. Queen to K. R's 5th (check).    6. K. to his B's square.
    7. Queen takes K's Bishop (check).

In this variation, you see Black has lost his King's Bishop's Pawn, and
what is worse, _has lost his privilege of castling_, by being forced to
move his King; and although for a moment he had gained a Bishop for a
Pawn, it was quite clear that he must lose a Bishop in return by the
check of the adverse Queen at King's Rook's 5th square. It is true that
he need not have taken the Bishop, but still his King must have moved,
and White could then have taken the King's Knight with his Bishop,
having always the better position.

But now to proceed with the actual game:--

    6. K's Knight to K's B's 3d.       6. Queen to K's B's 3d.

Bringing out the Knight is good play; you not only threaten to win his
Bishop, but you afford yourself an opportunity of castling whenever it
may be needful. Black would have played better in retiring the Bishop
from the attack to Queen's Knight 3d square than in supporting it with
the Queen.

    7. Knight takes Bishop.            7. Queen takes Knight.

Both parties played well in their last moves. You rightly took off the
Bishop, because supported by the Queen he menaced your Queen's Kt's
Pawn, and Black properly retook with his Queen instead of the Knight,
because having a Pawn ahead, it was his interest to exchange off the
Queens.

    8. Q's Knight to Q's 2d.           8. K's Knight to B's 3d.

You played correctly here in not exchanging Queens, and also in
protecting your Bishop and your King's Pawn, both of which were attacked
by the adverse Queen; but all this might have been done without impeding
the movements of any of your Pieces, by simply playing Queen to King's
2d sq.; as it is, the Knight entirely shuts your Queen's Bishop from the
field. Black properly brings another Piece to the attack of your King's
Pawn:--

    9. K. B's Pawn to B's 3d.          9. Q's Knight to King's 4th.

In protecting the King's Pawn with your K. Bishop's Pawn, you are guilty
of a very common error among young players; as you improve, you will
find that it is rarely good play to move the K. Bishop's Pawn to the
third square--in the present instance, for example, you have deprived
yourself of the power of castling, at least for some time, since the
adverse Queen now commands the very square upon which your King, in
castling on his own side, has to move. Black's last move is much more
sensible. He again attacks your Bishop, and by the same move brings his
Q's Knight into co-operation with the King's, on the weak point of your
position:--

   10. Pawn to Q. Kt's 3d.            10. Q. takes Queen's Rook.

This is a serious blunder indeed. In your anxiety to save the threatened
Bishop, which you feared to withdraw to Q. Kt's 3d sq., on account of
the adverse Knight's giving check at your Queen's 3d square, you have
actually left your Q's Rook _en prise_! Black takes it, of course, and
having gained such an important advantage, ought to win easily.

   11. Castles, (_i.e._, plays        11. Q's Kt. takes Bishop.
         K to his Kt's sq., and
         Rook to K. B's sq.)
   12. Kt. takes Kt.                  12. Castles.
   13. Queen to her 2d.               13. Q. B's Pawn to B's 4th.

Your last move is very subtle; finding the mistake that Black had
committed in not retreating his Queen directly after winning the Rook,
you determine, if possible, to prevent her escape by gaining command of
all the squares she can move to. Seeing the danger, Black throws forward
this Pawn to enable him, if possible, to bring the Queen off, by playing
her to her 5th sq., giving check.

   14. Bishop to Q. Kt's 2d.          14. Q. takes Q. R's Pawn.

This move of the Bishop is well timed; it does not, to be sure, prevent
the Queen from escaping for a move or two, but it gives you an attack,
and very great command of the field.

   15. Q. to K. Kt's 5th.             15. Knight to K's sq.

Very well played on both sides. By playing the Queen to K. Kt's 5th, you
threatened to win his Knight by at once taking it with your Bishop,
which he could not retake without opening check on his King. Instead of
so moving, you might have played the Knight to Q. Rook's 5th sq., in
which case, by afterwards moving the Rook to Q. Rook's square, it would
have been impossible for his Queen to get away.

   16. Q. to King's 3d.               16. K. R's Pawn to R's 3d.

You prudently retreated your Queen to guard her Knight's Pawn, which it
was important to save, on account of its protection to the Knight. Black
played the King's R's Pawn to prevent your Queen returning to the same
post of attack.

   17. K. R's P. to R's 3d.           17. K. to his R's sq.

Here are two instances of what is called "lost time" at chess, neither
move serving in the slightest degree to advance the game of the player.
That you should have overlooked the opportunity of gaining the adverse
Queen was to be expected. Similar advantages present themselves in every
game between young players, and are unobserved.

   18. K. B's Pawn to B's 4th.        18. Q. Kt's Pawn to Kt's 3d.

Again you have failed to see a most important move; you might have taken
the K. Rook's Pawn with your Queen, giving check safely, because Black
could not take your Queen without being in check with your Bishop. All
this time, too, your opponent omits to see the jeopardy his Queen is in,
and that as far as practical assistance to his other Pieces is
concerned, she might as well be off the board.

   19. K. Kt's Pawn to Kt's 4th.      19. Q. Kt's Pawn to Q. Kt's 4th.

Your last move is far from good. By thus attacking your Knight, Black
threatens to win a Piece, because upon playing away the Knight you must
leave the Bishop unprotected.

   20. Pawn to K. Kt's 5th.           20. Pawn takes Knight.

Although your Knight was thus attacked, it might have been saved very
easily. In the first place, by your taking the adversary's Q. B's Pawn,
threatening to take his K's Rook, on his removing which, or interposing
the Q's Pawn, you could have taken the Pawn which attacked your Knight;
or, in the second place, by moving your Queen to her 2d square. In the
latter case, if Black ventured to take the Knight, you would have won
his Queen by taking the K. Kt's Pawn with your Bishop, giving check, and
thus exposing his Queen to yours. Black would have been obliged to parry
the check, either by taking the Bishop or removing his King, and you
would then have taken his Queen. This position is very instructive, and
merits attentive examination.

   21. B. to Q. B's 3d.               21. Pawn takes Q. Kt's Pawn.
   22. Pawn to K. R's 4th.            22. Pawn to Q. Kt's 7th.

In such a position, the advance of your King's flank Pawns is a process
too dilatory to be very effective.

   23. Pawn to K. B's 5th.            23. Pawn to Q. Kt's 8th,
                                             becoming a Queen.

Now the fault of your tortoise-like movements with the Pawns becomes
fatally evident. Black has been enabled to make a second Queen, and has
an overwhelming force at command.

   24. Rook takes Queen.              24. Queen takes Rook (check).

You had no better move than to take the newly-elected Queen, for two
Queens must have proved irresistible.

   25. King to his Kt's 2d.           25. Kt. to Queen's 3d.
   26. K. Kt's Pawn to Kt's 6th.      26. P. takes Pawn.
   27. P. takes Pawn.                 27. Bishop to Q. Kt's 2d.

Here you have given another remarkable instance of lost opportunity. At
your last move you might have redeemed all former disasters by
checkmating your opponent in two moves. Endeavor to find out how this
was to be accomplished.

   28. K. R's Pawn to R's 5th.        28. Knight takes King's Pawn.
   29. Bishop to King's 5th.          29. Kt. to K. Kt's 4th
                                            (discovering check).

Up to Black's last move you had still the opportunity of winning the
game before mentioned.

   30. King to Kt's 3d.               30. K's Rook to B's 6th. (ch.)
   31. King to R's 4th.               31. Q. to K. Bishop's 4th.

At this point you were utterly at the mercy of your antagonist, but
fortunately he wanted the skill to avail himself properly of his vast
superiority in force and position, or he might have won the game in half
a dozen different ways.

   32. Q. takes Rook.                 32. Q. takes Queen.
   33. B. takes K. Kt's Pawn (ch.)    33. King takes Bishop.

This was your last chance, and its success should serve to convince you
that in the most apparently hopeless situations of the game there is
often a latent resource, if we will only have the patience to search it
out. By taking the Bishop, Black has left your King, _who is not in
check_, no move without going into check, and as you have neither Piece
nor Pawn besides to play, you are _stalemated_, and the game is DRAWN.

If thoroughly acquainted with the information contained in the preceding
sections, you may now proceed to the consideration of the openings;
before you do this, however, it is necessary to apprise you that without
a great abridgment of the notation adopted in the foregoing game, it
would be impossible to compress within the limits of this work one-third
of the variations which are required to be given. The following
abbreviations will therefore be used throughout the remainder of our
HANDBOOK:--

                      K.       for King.
                      Q.           Queen.
                      R.           Rook.
                      B.           Bishop.
                      Kt.          Knight.
                      P.           Pawn.
                      sq.          square.

                      dis. ch.     discovering check.

The word "square" is only used to distinguish the first row of squares
on which the superior Pieces stand at the commencement--thus, we say,
Kt. to K's 2d, and omit the word square; but if the Kt. were played to
K's _first_ square or R's _first_ square, the move would be described
not as Kt. to K's or R's _first_ square, but "Kt. to K's or R's square."




                               CHAPTER II.

                       THE KING'S KNIGHT'S OPENING


             WHITE.                       BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.             1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K's Kt. to B's 3d.

Your second move gives the name to this opening, which is one of the
most popular and instructive of all the various methods of commencing
the game. The Kt., it will be observed, at once attacks the adverse
Pawn, and the defence recommended by the best authors and the leading
players of Europe, is for Black to reply 2. Q's Kt. to B's 3d. He has,
however, many other ways of playing, and as the examination of these
comparatively simple variations will serve to prepare you for the more
complex and elaborate combinations of the best defences, it will be
advisable to consider them previously. In the first place, then, Black
may sustain his Pawn by playing--

  1. P. to K. B's 3d.
  2. K's B. to Q's 3d.
  3. Q. to K. B's 3d.
  4. P. to Q's 3d.

or, in the second place, he may leave it unprotected, and play--

  5. K's Kt. to B's 3d.
  6. K's B. to Q. B's 4th.
  7. P. to K. B's 4th.
  8. P. to Q's 4th.

He has thus eight different modes of play at his command, besides the
move of Q's Kt. to B's 3d, in answer to your second move of
K's Kt. to B's 3d. Each of these will form the subject of a separate
game.


                           GAME THE FIRST.

                         THE DAMIANO GAMBIT.

        WHITE.                        BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.             1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K's Kt. to B's 3d.         2. P. to K. B's 3d.
        3. Kt. takes K's P.           3. P. takes Kt.
        4. Q. to K. R's 5th. (ch.)    4. P. to K. Kt's 3d.
        5. Q. takes K's P. (ch.)      5. Q. to K's 2d.
        6. Q. takes R.                6. K's Kt. to B's 3d.
        7. P. to Q's 4th. (best.)     7. Q. takes P. (ch.)
        8. Q's B. to K's 3d.          8. Q. takes Q. B's P.
        9. Q. takes Kt.               9. Q. takes Q. Kt's P.
       10. K's B. to Q. B's 4th.     10. K. B. to Q. Kt's 5th. (ch.)
       11. Q's Kt. to Q's 2d.        11. Q. takes R. (ch.)
       12. K. to his 2d.             12. Q. takes K's R.
       and you give mate in two moves.

The foregoing moves are dependent on Black's taking the Kt., which is
very bad play. His proper move, under the circumstances, is
3. Q. to K's 2d, as in the following example:--

              WHITE.                        BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.             1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K's Kt. to B's 3d.         2. P. to K. B's 3d.
        3. K's Kt. takes P.           3. Q. to K's 2d.
        4. K. Kt. to B's 3d. (best)   4. P. to Q's 4th.
        5. P. to Q's 3d.              5. P. takes K's P.
        6. P. takes P.                6. Q. takes P. (ch.)
        7. B. to K's 2d.              7. Q's B. to K. B's 4th.
        8. Kt. to Q's 4th.            8. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
        9. Kt. takes B.               9. Q. takes Kt.
       10. Castles.                  10. B. to Q's 3d.
       11. B. to Q's 3d.
                  You have an excellent position.


                            GAME THE SECOND.

              WHITE.                         BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.              1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K's Kt. to B's 3d.          2. K's B. to Q's 3d.
        3. B. to Q. B's 4th.           3. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        4. P. to Q's 4th.              4. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
        5. P. takes K. P.              5. B. takes P.
        6. K. Kt. to his 5th.          6. Castles.
        7. P. to K. B's 4th.           7. B. to Q's 5th.
        8. P. to K's 5th.              8. Q. to K's 2d.
        9. Q. to K's 2d.               9. K. Kt. to K's sq.
       10. B. to Q's 5th.             10. K. B. to Q. Kt's 3d.
       11. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.          11. P. to K. R's 3d.

In reply, you may now play P. to K. R's 4th, having a capital game. If,
instead of 11. P. to R's 3d, he play 11. Q. Kt. to Q's 5th, you move
12. Q. to her 3d, then B. to Q's 2d, and finally castle on the Q's side.
If, however, in lieu of that move, he play 11. B. to Q. R's 4th, you can
move 12. B. to Q's 2d, and presently castle on the Q's side; and lastly,
if he play 11. K. to R's sq., then you take your Queen to K. R's 5th,
and he cannot save the game.


                            GAME THE THIRD.

             WHITE.                        BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.             1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.          2. Q. to K. B's 3d.

It is seldom good to bring the Q. into play early in the game, unless
for some decisive blow, because she is so easily assailable by the
opponent's minor Pieces, and in attacking her he brings his forces into
action.

       3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.       3. Q. to K. Kt's 3d.

Black now attacks two undefended Pawns, but he can take neither without
ruinous loss to him; for suppose on your playing P. to Q's 3d, to
protect the K. P., he ventures to take the K. Kt. P., you immediately
take the K. B. P. with your Bishop (ch.). If he then take the Bishop
with his King, you attack his Queen with your Rook, and on her retiring
to R. 6th, you win her by K. Kt. to his 5th (ch.). On the other hand,
you can leave the King's Pawn, and castle safely.

       4. Castles.                   4. Q. takes K. P.
       5. K. B. takes B. P. (ch.)    5. K. to Q's sq.

It is quite obvious that he would lose his Queen by the check of the
Knight, if he took the Bishop.

       6. Kt. takes K's P.           6. K. Kt. to B's 3d.

If he take the Kt., you will play R. to K's sq., compelling him either
to take it with his Q. or be mated.

       7. K. R. to K's sq.           7. Q. to K. B's 4th.
       8. K. B. to K. Kt's 6th.      8. Q. to K's 3d.
       9. Kt. to B's 7th. (ch.), and gains the Queen.


                          GAME THE FOURTH.
                         PHILIDOR'S DEFENCE.

               WHITE.                     BLACK.

        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.         2. P. to Q's 3d.
        3. P. to Q's 4th.            3. P. to K. B's 4th.
        4. Q. P. takes P.            4. K. B. P. takes P.
        5. Kt. to K. Kt's 5th.       5. P. to Q's 4th.
        6. P. to K's 6th.            6. Kt. to K. R's 3d.
        7. P. to K. B's 3d.          7. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
        8. B. to Q. Kt's 5th.        8. Q. to her 3d.
        9. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.         9. Q. B. takes K. P.
       10. K. Kt. takes B.          10. Q. takes Kt.
       11. Q. takes Q's P.          11. Q. takes Q.
       12. Kt. takes Q.             12. Castles.
       13. P. takes K. P.
       You have a Pawn more than Black, and a better position

                  SUMMARY OF THE FOREGOING VARIATIONS
                         IN PHILIDOR'S DEFENCE.

The result of the preceding analysis serves to prove that Q. P. one, as
the second move of Black, is not a tenable defence; since, play as he
can afterwards, if the best moves are adopted by the first player, he
will always have a very insecure or a very constrained game.

     And wins; the battle having lasted about seven hours.

[Footnote A: To enable him to capture the Bishop, which is about to take
the Kt., with the Q's Pawn.]

[Footnote B: The attack looks already irresistible, but the actual
finish is charmingly accomplished.]

[Footnote C: By this move Black may be said to lose a Piece. His best
course--but that a bad one--was possibly to retreat his Bishop to
K's square.]

[Footnote D: Threatening mate in two moves.]

[Footnote E: To avert the promised mate, by R. takes Pawn, &c.]

[Footnote F: The termination is very pretty--quite an elegant little
problem.]

[Footnote G: And Black has no possible means of escape; for, if he play
Q. to K's sq., White simply captures the Queen for nothing; if
B. to Q. B's 4th (ch.), then follows K. to B's sq., &c.]

opponent. It must be admitted, however, that Black has no good move at
this crisis.]

[Footnote B: Perfectly sound, as the sequel shows.]

        1. P. to K's 4th.            1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.         2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        3. P. to Q's 4th.            3. P. takes P.
        4. P. to K's 5th.            4. Kt. to K's 5th. (best)
        5. Kt. takes P.              5. P. to Q's 3d. (best)
        6. P. takes P.               6. K. B. takes P.
        7. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.      7. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.
        8. Q. B. to K's 3d.          8. Castles.
        9. Castles.                  9. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.
        The game is equal.


                             VARIATION I.

                   _Commencing at Black's 3d move._

               WHITE.                      BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.            1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.         2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        3. P. to Q's 4th.            3. Kt. takes P.
        4. K. B. to Q's 3d.          4. P. to Q's 4th.
        5. Kt. takes K's P.          5. Kt. to Q's 3d.
        6. P. to Q. B's 4th.         6. P. takes P.
        7. K. Kt. takes P.           7. Q. B. to K's 3d.
        8. Kt. to K's 3d.            8. B. to K's 2d.
        9. Castles.                  9. Castles.
     You have the move, and somewhat the advantage of position.


                            VARIATION II.

                   _Beginning at White's 5th move._

              WHITE.                      BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.            1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.         2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        3. P. to Q's 4th.            3. P. takes P.
        4. P. to K's 5th.            4. Kt. to K's 5th.
        5. K. B. to Q's 3d.          5. K. Kt. to Q. B's 4th
        6. Kt. takes P.              6. P. to Q's 3d.
        7. P. takes P.               7. K. B. takes P.
        8. Castles.                  8. Castles.

It would not be a good move for Black, instead of castling, to take your
K. R. P. (ch.) and then to take the Kt., on account of your check with
the B., which would leave his Q. exposed to capture.


                            VARIATION III.

                    _Beginning at White's 3d move._

              WHITE.                      BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.            1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.         2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        3. Kt. takes K's P.          3. Kt. takes P.
        4. Q. to K's 2d.             4. Q. to K's 2d.
        5. Q. takes Kt.              5. P. to Q's 3d.
        6. P. to Q's 4th.            6. P. to K. B's 3d.
        7. P. to K. B's 4th.         7. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.
        8. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.         8. Q. P. takes Kt.
        9. Q. Kt. to Q's 5th.        9. Q. to her 3d.
       10. Q. P. takes P.           10. P. takes P.
       11. P. takes P.              11. Q. to her B's 3d.
       12. K. B. to Q. Kt's 5th.    12. Q. to her B's 4th.
       13. P. to Q. Kt's 4th.

Winning the Q. At his 12th move, Black might prolong the game by playing
12. Q. to K. Kt's 3d, but in that case you would take 13. Q. B. P. with
the Kt. (ch.), then take Q. with Q., and afterwards Q. R. with Kt.


                             VARIATION IV.

                    _Beginning at Black's 3d move._

               WHITE.                       BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.             1. P. to K's 4th
        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.          2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        3. Kt. takes K. P.            3. P. to Q's 3d.
        4. Kt. to K. B's 3d.          4. Kt. takes K's P.
        5. P. to Q's 4th.             5. P. to Q's 4th.
        6. K. B. to Q's 3d.           6. K. B. to K's 2d.
        7. Castles.                   7. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
        8. P. to Q. B's 4th.          8. Q. B. to K's 3d.
        9. P. to Q. R's 3d.           9. Castles.
        You are now enabled to play Q. to her B's 2d, and
        obtain a good attacking situation.


                          ANOTHER VARIATION,

                 _Beginning at the 3d move of White._

              WHITE.                       BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.             1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.          2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.       3. Kt. takes P.
        4. Q. to K's 2d.              4. P. to Q's 4th.
        5. Kt. takes K. P.            5. K. B. to Q. B. 4 (best)
        6. P. to Q's 3d.              6. B. takes K. B. P. (ch.)
        7. K. to Q's sq. (best)       7. B. to Q. Kt's 3d.
        8. Kt. takes K. B. P.         8. Q. B. to K. Kt's 5th.
        9. Kt. takes Q.               9. B. takes Q. (ch.)
       10. K. takes B.               10. Kt. to K. B's 7th.
       11. R. to K. B's sq.          11. P. takes B.
       12. Kt. to K's 6th.           12. P. takes P. (ch.)
       13. P. takes P.               13. K. to his 2d.
       14. Kt. takes K. Kt. P.       14. R. to K. Kt's sq.
       15. Kt. to K. B's 5th. (ch.)  15. K. to his 3d.
       16. Q. B. to K's 3d.          16. B. takes B.
       17. Kt. takes B.              17. Kt. to K. Kt's 5th.
         The positions are equal, but you have a pawn more.


                             VARIATION (A.)

                    _Beginning at Black's 6th move._

              WHITE.                       BLACK.
        1. P. to K's 4th.             1. P. to K's 4th.
        2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.          2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
        3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.       3. Kt. takes P.
        4. Q. to K's 2d.              4. P. to Q's 4th.
        5. Kt. takes K. P.            5. K. B. to Q. B's 4 (best)
        6. P. to Q's 3d.              6. Q. P. takes B.
        7. Q. takes Kt.               7. Castles.
        8. Q. takes doubled P.        8. Q. to K's 2d.
        9. P. to K. B's 4th.          9. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       10. Q. to K's 4th.            10. K. R. to K's sq.
       11. K. to Q's sq.             11. Q. to K. R's 5th.
       12. P. to K. Kt's 3d.         12. Q. to K. R's 4th. (ch.)
       13. K. to Q's 2d.             13. Kt. takes Kt.
       14. P. takes Kt.              14. R. takes P.
                         Winning easily.

Instead, however, of playing 12. P. to K. Kt's 3d, you might at that
moment move Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.

       12. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.         12. Q. to K. R's 4th. (ch.)
       13. Q. Kt. to K. B's 3d.      13. Q. B. to K. Kt's 5th.
            (best)

and now, play as you can, Black must gain a decided advantage by taking
the K. Kt. with Kt., &c.

                  ILLUSTRATIVE OF PETROFF'S DEFENCE.

              GAME I.--Mr. Morphy plays without seeing the
             Chess-board or men, against M. Potier, at Paris.

     17. Q. B. takes Q.                  17. P. takes Kt.

     25. K. B. to Q. Kt's 3d.
                      And Black abandons the game.

[Footnote A: It is to be regretted that Mr. Potier did not take the Kt.
rather than retreat, as many amateurs would have been pleased to see Mr.
Morphy carrying out the attack of this interesting and comparatively
novel début.]

[Footnote B: Finely played.]

[Footnote C: The termination of this _partie_ is remarkably elegant and
finished.]

advantage of by M. Petroff.]

[Footnote B: They do not appear to have had a better move.]

[Footnote C: Well played.]

[Footnote D: It would have been better to leave the Rook _en prise_, and
advance the Pawn to King's Bishop's 5th.]

       27. Resigns.

[Footnote A: NOTES by JAS. MASON.--In this familiar "double Lopez"
predicament, 7. B. takes Kt. is highly recommended, if a dull but
durable kind of game is desired.]

[Footnote B: ... Something like a leap in the dark. If the doubled Pawn
can be "dissolved" betimes, or the open file well used in attack, a safe
landing may be confidently expected.]

[Footnote C: More or less necessary, sooner or later. Black does not
attempt to dissolve, just here; for then Q. to R's 6th, threatening
Kt. to Kt's 5th, might be uncomfortable.]

[Footnote D: Routine--indirectly including the questionable
16. P. to Q's 5th? At once Kt. to Kt's sq., to be speedily followed
by P. to Kt's 3d and P. to K. B's 4th, would have given the matter
another and perhaps very different complexion.]

[Footnote E: ... The difference is in favor of the young American
representative, who presses it fully.]

[Footnote F: Manifestly weakening. The Russian champion feels himself on
the defensive, and at a loss how to continue. Thus the text move may be
as good as any other.]

[Footnote G: 24. Kt. to R's 4th would be much stronger, the importance
of halting the advancing Rook Pawn duly considered. Going from bad to
worse, the downright blunder two moves later caps the climax--and more
need not be said.]


                          GAME THE SIXTH.

               WHITE.                      BLACK.

If now Black take the Knight with his Bishop, you retake with the
Q. Kt. (ch.), then exchange Queens, and win the Q. Kt. P. He may,
however, move 12. K. to his 2d, whereupon you check with
K. Kt. at K. B's 5th, and afterwards liberate your other Kt.

                            GAME THE NINTH.

                           THE GIUOCO PIANO.

An attentive examination of the eight separate methods of reply to your
second move of K's Kt. to B's 3d in the antecedent games, will have
enabled you to understand that four at least of these defences, viz.:
P. to K. B's 3d, B. to Q's 3d, Q. to B's 3d, and B. to Q. B's 4th, are
untenable and injurious for the game of the second player, and that the
remaining four, if not absolutely bad for him, are unsatisfactory,
because against the best attack, they leave the balance of advantage in
favor of the party playing first.

It is now time to consider the consequences to both parties when Black,
abandoning the objectionable or uncertain modes of play he has hitherto
adopted, shall answer with the move which the best authorities at length
concur in recommending as the proper one, _i.e._ 2. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
Upon his playing thus, you have the choice of three good moves: in the
first place to play 3. K's B. to Q. B's 4th, as in the present game;
secondly, 3. P. to Q's 4th; and thirdly, P. to Q. B's 3d. The two latter
of which will form the subjects of games hereafter.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th

It is generally admitted that Black's third move is the best he can
adopt; and the opening now formed is that which the Italians have
entitled the "Giuoco Piano;" an opening, less attacking than many
others, but one perfectly safe for both players, and therefore always
in request, and which usually generates games of the most solid and
instructive kind.

       4. P. to Q. B's 3d.              4. K. Kt. to B's 3d. (best)
       5. P. to Q's 4th.                5. P. takes P.
       6. P. to K's 5th.                6. P. to Q's 4th. (best)
       7. K. B. to Q. Kt's 5th.         7. K. Kt. to K's 5th.
       8. B. takes Kt. (ch.)            8. P. takes B.
       9. P. takes P.                   9. B. to Q. Kt's 3d.
      10. Castles.                     10. Q. B. to K. Kt's 5th.
      11. Q. B. to K's 3d.             11. Castles.
                          The game is equal.

              WHITE.                          BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          3. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.
       4. P. to Q. B's 3d.              4. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
       5. P. to Q's 4th.                5. P. takes P.
       6. P. to K's 5th.                6. K. Kt. to K's 5th.
       7. K. B. to Q's 5th.             7. Kt. takes K. B's P.
       8. K. takes Kt.                  8. P. takes P. (dis. ch.)
       9. K. to Kt's 3d.                9. P. takes Q. Kt's P.
      10. Q. B. takes P.               10. Q. Kt. to K's 2d.
      11. Q. to her B's 2d.            11. P. to Q's 3d.
      12. B. to K's 4th.               12. Kt. to K. Kt's 3d.
      13. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.            13. P. to Q. B's 3d.
      14. Q. R. to Q's sq.
              And the game appears to me in your favor.

Remember that at your move 14. you must not, instead of playing
Q. R. to Q's sq., take the Kt. with your B., and afterwards play
15. Q. Kt. to K's 4th, because after taking your B. with K. R's P.,
he might move Q. B. to K. B's 4th, and thus prevent you moving your
Kt. advantageously.

      72. K. to Q's 3d.
                          And Black surrenders.

[Footnote A: Black would have gained no advantage by taking the Q. P. at
this juncture, or by advancing his P. to K. Kt's 4th, to attack the
Rook. The move in the text was not made without due deliberation, and
we believe it the best on the board.]

[Footnote B: White designedly gives up the Queen's Pawn, to get a
counter attack with his combined forces.]

[Footnote C: Queen to her Knight's 3d would have been worse than
useless.]

[Footnote D: Had he gone to Queen's square, to protect his threatened
Pawn, White would have won the King's Knight's Pawn. (_e.g._)

                  WHITE.                     BLACK.

      27. Q. takes K. R.               27. Q. takes R.
      28. Q. takes R. (ch.), &c.]

[Footnote E: A most important move. Black dare not now advance his Q. P.
on account of Q. to B's 7th (ch.), which would enable White to double
his Rooks on the adversary's K. Kt. P., and thus win easily.]

[Footnote F: K. to R's 2d would have been very bad play, because Black
would have checked with his Q. at K's 4th; and if then the Queen were
interposed, he would have taken the Q. and played R. to K's 6th (ch.),
and afterwards R. to Q. Kt's 6th.]

[Footnote G: He could not save all the Pawns attacked.]

[Footnote H: Threatening to take the K. Kt. P. with his Rook, and then
check with the Queen at her Bishop's 3d.]

[Footnote I: K. to his 3d would have been better.]

[Footnote J: This was ill-judged. He should have played
R. to K. Kt's 2d, or Q. R's square.]

                  And then Black mates in two moves.

[Footnote A: From this point we look upon the game as virtually lost for
White.]

[Footnote B: Probably his best move. Had he played P. to Q. Kt's 4th,
Black might have taken it with his Kt., and upon the B. P. retaking,
have moved K. B. to Q's 5th, winning the exchange.]

[Footnote C: As good a move, perhaps, as he had on the board. By playing
K. R. to Q's sq., he would evidently have lost a Piece.]

[Footnote D: Well conceived. Tempting Black to open the discovered
check, which would cost him "the exchange."]

[Footnote E: Interposing the Kt. and then pushing the K. B. P. on
the Rook afterwards, would have been unwise, on account of
B. to Q's 3d. (ch.), &c.]

[Footnote F: Threatening, if White took the Q. P., to win a Piece.]

                            Black resigns.

[Footnote A: The proper move is B. to Q. Kt's 3d. Taking the Pawn gives
an immediate advantage to White.]

[Footnote B: If White play P. to K. B's 5th at this point, his opponent
may move Kt. to K. Kt's 5th, threatening to play afterwards
Q. to K. Kt's 8th (ch.), and then mate with his Kt. at B's 7th.]

[Footnote C: From this move the attack is very lively and interesting.]

[Footnote D: There appears to be nothing better, bad as this is.]

adverse K. Kt. is in the field, appears safer play.]

[Footnote B: Threatening to exchange the Kt., and then take Q. B. P.
with the Rook.]

[Footnote C: Intending again to take the Kt., and thus win a Pawn.]

[Footnote D: Well played, the advance of this Pawn secures to him an
irresistible attack.]

      46. Q. to B's 6th. (ch.)         46. Resigns.

[Footnote A: White in this instance had probably made up his mind to
adopt the plan frequently employed by Gunsberg in the Giuoco Piano,
namely, playing Q. to Q's 2d and Castling rapidly on the Queen's
side.--Gunsberg.]

[Footnote B: ... Black's difficulty is how to dispose of the Kt. Now
Kt's 3d in this instance, although perhaps preferable, is not a good
place either, subject as it must be to an early attack from the
K. R. P.--Hoffer.]

[Footnote C: If 11. B. takes Kt., Kt. to B's 5th; and the Kt. cannot be
captured on account of B. to Kt's 4th winning the Queen.--_Leeds
Mercury_.]

[Footnote D: ... There seems little use in this move. Either he can
Castle now; if not, then it is proof positive that his defence is
bad.--Gunsberg.]

[Footnote E: This premature advance is admirably taken advantage of by
Steinitz.--_Leeds Mercury_.]

[Footnote F: ... Although this looks like a defensive move, (to make
room for the Kt.) it is a subtle design which was entirely overlooked by
Lasker.--Hoffer.]

[Footnote G: But here is a great mistake, which ought to lose the game.
16. P. takes Q. B. would have averted the loss of a Pawn, but at the
expense of position and attack; he was outplayed by Steinitz up to this
point.]

[Footnote H: From this move to the end Lasker exhibits most marvellous
power of resource. With 20. Q. R. to B's sq. he commenced one of the
most ingenious attacks.]

[Footnote I: One of the moves which will make this game memorable. The
object is, if P. takes P. to open up the Rook's file by P. to R's 5th.
Allowance must of course be made for the fact that, being two Pawns
behind, White has nothing to lose and everything to gain by desperate
tactics.--Gunsberg.]

[Footnote J: Exhibiting consummate coolness in a "do or die"
predicament.--Pollock.]

[Footnote K: 33. B. to B's 5th is evidence with what perfect lucidity
Lasker detects the weak spots, and how immediately he takes advantage of
his opponent's slightest omission or commission.--Hoffer.]

[Footnote L: ... Imprudent. The King should make for safety in the
corner, _via_ B's 2d.--Mason.]

[Footnote M: Threatening R. to B's 8th.--Gunsberg.]

[Footnote N: ... 41. Q. to Q's 2d is a final blunder. 41. R to Q's 2d
should have been played, or R. to K's 3d. The game is now over. It will
be readily admitted that it is a well-earned victory which none will
grudge the plucky young player.--Hoffer.

... We really cannot see a satisfactory move, for if R. to K's 3d, then
follows Q. to B's 2d (ch.), and R. to B's 8th. Or if Q. to Q's sq. then
likewise Q. to B's 2d (ch.) should gain some advantage, as, on King
playing to Kt's 4th, White could continue with P. to R's 4th (ch.) and
Q. to Q. B's 5th, &c.--Gunsberg.]


                THE QUEEN'S PAWN GAME, OR SCOTCH GAMBIT.

                             GAME THE FIRST.

             WHITE.                          BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. Kt. takes P.

It is from your third move the opening derives its name
of "The Queen's Pawn Game."

       4. Kt. takes Kt.                 4. P. takes Kt.
       5. Q. takes P.                   5. Kt. to K's 2d.
       6. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          6. Kt. to Q. B's 3d.
       7. Q. to her 5th.                7. Q. to K. B's 3d. (best)
       8. Castles.                      8. B. to K's 2d.
       You have a better opened game, but the superiority is
       not important.


                             VARIATION I.

                   _Beginning at White's 4th move._

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. Kt. takes P.
       4. Kt. takes P.                  4. Kt. to K's 3d.
       5. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          5. K. Kt. to B's 3d.
       6. Castles.                      6. P. to Q's 3d.
       7. Kt. to K. Kt's 4th.           7. B. to K's 2d.
       Your game is less confined than his, but you have very
       little advantage.


                           GAME THE SECOND.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. P. takes P.
       4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.
       5. P. to Q. B's 3d.              5. P. to Q's 6th.
       6. P. to Q. Kt's 4th.            6. B. to Q. Kt's 3d.
       7. P. to Q. Kt's 5th.            7. Q. to K's 2d.
       8. Castles.                      8. Kt. to K's 4th.
       9. Kt. takes Kt.                 9. Q. takes Kt.
      10. Q. to her Kt's 3d.           10. Q. to K. B's 3d, K's 2d.
      11. P. to K's 5th.
                          You have a fine game.


                              VARIATION I.

                    _Beginning at White's 5th move._

              WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. P. takes P.
       4. K's B. to Q. B's 4th.         4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th
       5. K. Kt. to his 5th.            5. K. Kt. to R's 3d. (best)
       6. Kt. takes K. B's P.           6. Kt. takes Kt.
       7. B. takes Kt. (ch.)            7. K. takes B.
       8. Q. to K. R's 5th. (ch.)       8. P. to K. Kt's 3d.
       9. Q. takes B.                   9. P. to Q's 3d.
      10. Q. to her Kt's 5th.          10. P. to Q. R's 3d.
      11. Q. to her 3d.                11. K. to Kt's 2d.
      12. Castles.                     12. Q. B. to K's 3d.
      13. P. to Q. B's 3d.             13. Q. to K. B's 3d.
      14. B. to Q's 2d.
             You appear to me to have the better game.


                             VARIATION II.

                   _Beginning at White's 5th move._

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. P. takes P.
       4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.
       5. Castles.                      5. P. to Q's 3d.
       6. P. to Q. B's 3d.              6. P. takes P.
       7. Q. Kt. takes P.               7. K. Kt. to K's 2d.
       8. K. Kt. to his 5th.            8. Kt. to K's 4th.

And he has at least as good a game as you have. This variation serves to
prove that your castling on the 5th move is less advisable than the move
of 5. P. to Q. B's 3d.


                            VARIATION III.,

                   _Beginning at Black's 4th move._

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. P. takes P.
       4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          4. P. to Q's 3d.

Black now relinquishes the defence of the P. he has gained, but he also
in some degree neutralizes your attack.

       5. P. to Q. B's 3d.              5. P. takes P.
       6. Q. Kt. takes P.
       You have certainly the advantage in position.


                            VARIATION IV.,

                _Beginning also at Black's 4th move._

              WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. P. takes P.
       4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.          4. Q. to K. B's 3d.
       5. Castles.                      5. P. to Q's 3d.
       6. P. to Q. B's 3d.              6. P. to Q's 6th.
       7. Q. takes P.                   7. Q. to K. Kt's 3d.
       8. Q. B. to K. B's 4th.          8. B. to K's 2d.
       9. Q. Kt. to Q. R's 3d.          9. P. to Q. R's 3d.
      10. Q. Kt. to Q. B's 2d.         10. K. Kt. to R's 3d.
      Your game is better opened, but there is no very striking
      disparity in the positions.


                            GAME THE THIRD.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.

       7. P. to K's 5th.                7. P. to Q's 4th. (best)

       P. to K's 5th is the move adopted by Mr. Cochrane.

       8. Q. takes P.                   8. Q. takes Q.

                               VARIATION.

      12. K's Kt. to his 5th.
      Followed by R. to K's sq., and you appear to me to have
      a better game than Black.


                            GAME THE FIFTH.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.

      12. Kt. to K. B's 6th. (ch.)
                     You have an excellent attack.


                               VARIATION,

                    _Beginning at Black's 7th move._

             WHITE.                           BLACK.

      15. Kt. takes K. B. P.
                           And you must win.


                            GAME THE SIXTH.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.

      11. Kt. takes Q. R.

I believe the best answering moves have been made by Black, and now,
upon surveying the aspect of the board, there can be no question, I
apprehend, that your game is much superior. The Kt. which has captured
your Rook, he can never extricate, while, to secure yours in the same
position, he must lose many moves, and thus afford you ample time for
the development of your remaining forces.


                               VARIATION,

                    _Beginning at Black's 5th move._

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. P. takes P.
       4. Kt. takes P.                  4. Q. to K. R's 5th.
       5. Kt. to Q. Kt's 5th.           5. Q. takes K's P. (ch.)
       6. B. to K's 2d.                 6. K. to Q's sq.
       7. Castles.                      7. P. to Q. R's 3d.
       8. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.             8. Q. to K's sq.
       9. K. Kt. to Q's 4th.

And again, I believe, with the strangely changed positions of his King
and Queen, and the facility afforded you for bringing the Pieces into
immediate action, that the game is very much in your favor.


                           GAME THE SEVENTH.

           _Varying from the preceding at Black's 4th move._

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             2. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.
       3. P. to Q's 4th.                3. P. takes P.
       4. Kt. takes P.                  4. K. B. to Q. B's 4th.
       5. Kt. takes Q. Kt.              5. Q. to K. B's 3d.
       6. Q. to K. B's 3d.              6. Q. takes Q.
       7. P. takes Q.                   7. Q. Kt. P. takes Kt.
       8. Q. B. to K. B's 4th.          8. P. to Q's 3d.

      10. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.
                And the game is in every respect equal.

      39. R. to K's sq.[AA]                And Black resigns.

[Footnote A: The best move.]

[Footnote B: Preparatory to the move of Q. to Q. B's 2d.]

[Footnote C: Threatening to win Q. B. P. or take Kt. with Kt.,
winning Q. P.]

[Footnote D: If Black had played B. to Q. R's 3d, to prevent
White Castling on King's side, White would have won a piece
by P. to Q. R's 4th.]

[Footnote E: A premature move.]

[Footnote F: The best move.]

[Footnote G: Better than taking Kt., as White would then have opened
the Rook's file.]

[Footnote H: Better than P. takes P.]

[Footnote I: The best move.]

[Footnote J: Intending to advance Q. B. P. A strong move.]

[Footnote K: An impudent move, in the face of such an attack.]

[Footnote L: A strong move.]

[Footnote M: P. to K. B's 5th perhaps stronger.]

[Footnote N: Weak. We cannot see its object. Why not Q. R. to Q's sq?]

[Footnote O: The best move.]

[Footnote P: Preparatory to Kt. to Kt's 4th, and then B. to K's 5th.]

[Footnote Q: Preventing Black's contemplated move with the Q.]

[Footnote R: With a view of withdrawing the B. and playing the
R. to R's 3d.]

[Footnote S: The first move of a combination, which gave the victory to
Philadelphia.]

[Footnote T: Insures the winning of the Kt.]

[Footnote U: A powerful move, as it compels Black to take the Kt., and
thereby opens White's R's file.]

[Footnote V: If B. takes P., White would have played Q. to K. Kt's 5th,
threatening to check K. and Q. with R., or win the R.]

[Footnote W: An all important check before taking B., as it prevented an
interposition of R. to R's 4th.]

[Footnote X: A very attacking move. Much better than B. to K's 5th.]

[Footnote Y: A better move than checking, as it prevented Black's K.
escaping to B's 2d, and then to K's 3d. White also threatened
P. to K. Kt's 4th.]

[Footnote Z: Black would have lost the R. had they taken the B. by a
check at K's 8th, and afterwards at his 7th.]

[Footnote AA: The _coup de grace_.]

[Footnote A: White gains a move by this exchange of Pieces.]

[Footnote B: P. to K. R's 3d would have been better play.]

[Footnote C: This is very finely played, and is an example to young
players of the importance of gaining time at chess. Had White paused in
his attack to recover the lost Bishop, the adversary might have
succeeded in dislodging one or other of the Pieces by which he is
beleaguered, or in bringing his own forces to the rescue, and then have
ultimately retrieved the game.]

               And Black mated by force in three moves.[B]

[Footnote A: Black plays capitally now to the end.]

[Footnote B: It is rarely in actual play one sees so pretty a mate.]

                            THE KING'S GAMBIT.


This opening comprises every variety of the game in which the first
player, after 1. P. to K's 4th has been played on both sides, commences
the attack by moving 2. P. to K. B's 4th. Should the second player take
this Pawn with his King's Pawn, he is said to accept the gambit.

This gambit has many modifications, the names appropriated to which will
be found in their proper places in the following pages.

An attentive consideration of the foregoing examples will lead you to
the conclusion, I think, that the Salvio defence, or that of Cochrane,
which varies from it in the transposition of Black's 6th and 7th moves,
is a safe and trustworthy method of opposing the King's Gambit, and that
the danger to be apprehended by the second player, in advancing his Pawn
to K. Kt's 5th on the 4th move, is not that his opponent should play the
Kt. to K's 5th, and admit of the Salvio or Cochrane defence, but that he
should leave his Kt. to be taken, and adopt the powerful and almost
irresistible attack of the Muzio Gambit.

                            THE MUZIO GAMBIT.

In the two defences to the King's Gambit by Salvio and Cochrane just
examined, when the second player for his fourth move advances his
P. to K. Kt's 5th, attacking the Knight, White replies by moving his
Knight to King's 5th, subjecting himself, as was shown, to a
counter-attack, from which escape without loss is difficult if not
impracticable. From this circumstance, apparently, originated the
conception of the "Muzio Gambit," wherein the first player instead

instead of retreating the K.

Our examination of this Gambit would be imperfect without some notice of
a variation in the opening, where the first player, instead of
abandoning the Knight at his 5th move, sacrifices his Bishop by taking
the K. B. Pawn, checking. This attack is not, strictly speaking, a part
of the Muzio Gambit, but it is so intimately associated with it that I
think it better to consider them both under the same head.

In the previous games we have followed out, at some length, the most
prominent variations which occur when both the attack and defence in
this opening are conducted upon the principles recommended by the best
authorities, and the result would seem to prove that against every
system of attack in the King's Bishop's Gambit at present known, the
defence, though difficult and complex in the extreme, is satisfactory.

It yet remains for us to consider what are the probable deviations from
the several standard methods of defence, and in what manner these should
be turned to advantage by the opening player.

      10. K. to his sq.
      The game is about even, since Black must eventually lose
      the gambit Pawn.


                            GAME THE FOURTH.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.

                             GAME THE FIFTH.

Having gone through the probable variations which Black may adopt
instead of checking with the Q., at his 3d move, we have now to consider
those at his command, (after giving the check,) when he does not play
the usual move of 4. P. to K. Kt's 4th.

       4. K. to B's sq.                 4. B. to Q. B's 4th.
       5. P. to Q's 4th.                5. B. to Q. Kt's 3d.

      13. Q. R. to K's sq.
                      You have the better game.


                            GAME THE SIXTH.

       4. K. to B's sq.                 4. K. Kt. to B's 3d.

                       Mr. McDonnell resigned.

[Footnote A: This was a favorite opening of McDonnell's; he bestowed
much time and labor on its analyses, and discovered many skilful methods
of diversifying the attack.]

[Footnote B: Q. B. to K's 2d would have been better play we believe.]

[Footnote C: This game is very cleverly played by La Bourdonnais.]

[Footnote A: Had Black checked with his Kt. and taken the Rook, he would
have been mated in five moves.]

[Footnote B: This portion of the game is played by Mr. McDonnell with
great judgment.]

[Footnote C: It would have been better to take the Q. B. P. with Q.]

[Footnote D: It is obvious he would have lost his Q. by taking the P.]

                           THE GAMBIT DECLINED.

If Black does not choose to accept the Gambit, he has several modes of
defence, which may be briefly noticed.


                              GAME THE FIRST.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th.                1. P. to K's 4th.
       2. P. to K. B's 4th.             2. B. to Q. B's 4th.

       This appears to be Black's best move, if he declines
       taking P. with P.

       3. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             3. P. to Q's 3d.

       6. K. Kt. to B's 3d.             6. K. B. to Q's 3d.
       7. P. takes P.                   7. Q. B. takes P.
       8. Castles.                      8. Castles.
       9. Q. Kt. to B's 3d.             9. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d.
       The positions are pretty equal, but you have still an
       advantage in the move.


                             GAME THE THIRD.

Before proceeding to the consideration of games wherein Black refuses
the gambit, it may be well to give a brief example of a different mode
of carrying on the opening in the regular gambit which is at your
command, and often adopted.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.

       6. P. takes P.                   6. K. B. to Q's 3d.
                      The game may be called even.


                               VARIATION,

                    _Beginning at Black's 3d move._

       7. K. B. takes P.                7. K. Kt. to K's 2d.
                              Equal game.


                            GAME THE FOURTH.

                          THE SCHWARTZ DEFENCE.

       8. B. to Q's 2d.                 8. Q. takes Q. P.
       9. Q. takes Kt.                  9. Q. takes Q. Kt. P.

                              White resigns.

[Footnote A: NOTES BY W. STEINITZ.--White's game has been modelled
chiefly after Steinitz's favorite attack. Here, however, 7. P. takes P.
is preferable, for if 7... P. takes P; 8. B. to Kt's 5th, B. to Kt's 2d;
9. Kt. to K's 5th, with a strong attack.]

[Footnote B: As often shown in my annotations in similar positions, it
is absolutely injurious to White's game to allow three well-supportable
Pawns against two to be established on the Queen's side. The prospect of
a King's side attack on which White speculates is quite unreliable in
comparison to the disadvantage on the Queen's side to which he is
subjected. At any rate, Pawns ought to be exchanged first, and thus
Black's centre weakened.]

[Footnote C: It was better to make sure of his superiority on the
Queen's side by P. to B's 5th at once.]

[Footnote D: He had sufficient force on the King's side to ignore any
hostile attack in that direction, and systematic operations on the other
wing, commencing with P. to Q. Kt's 4th, were most in order.]

[Footnote E: The combination of this with the next five moves, more
especially with the two closely following, is full of high ingenuity,
which, however, is wasted on an imaginary danger. For all purposes of
defence it was only necessary to advance P. to K. Kt's 3d at the right
time, and then to play R. to B's 2d, followed by B. to K. B's sq.
eventually. The Queen's wing was still the proper point of attack to
which he should have directed his attention more promptly.]

[Footnote F: For aggressive purposes on the Queen's side, the Queen was
better placed at B's 2d.]

[Footnote G: This rash attack and Black's timid reply were only to be
accounted for as results of time pressure on both sides.]

[Footnote H: There was not the slightest danger in capturing the Pawn
with a Pawn ahead, while this loses one.]

[Footnote I: A fatal miscalculation. R. to Q. B's 8th led to a most
probable draw, for if 38... R. to Kt's 5th; 39. Q. to B's 6th (ch.),
&c.]

[Footnote J: Black seizes his opportunity with scientific exactitude.]

[Footnote A: Marshall abandons his favorite variation 7. Q. to B's 2d.]

[Footnote B: Janowsky also changes P. to B's 4th, played in the earlier
games.]

[Footnote C: Janowsky's favorite manoeuvre, which might have been
expected. Therefore Marshall could have played P. takes P. previous to
B. to Q's 3d.]

[Footnote D: P. to Q. R's 4th would have prevented the Bishop being
dislodged; but as he manages eventually to prevent Black from keeping
the majority of Pawns on the Queen's side, there is nothing to be said
against it--except that he only keeps about an even game.]

[Footnote E: This is compulsory, because of the threat P. to B's 5th,
followed by P. to Kt's 5th.]

[Footnote F: B. to Kt's sq. might be followed by P. to Kt's 5th, when
Q. to K's sq. would take up the place which the K. R. intends to
occupy; but the move would have been better, nevertheless.]

[Footnote G: It is doubtful whether the advance might not have been
dispensed with, because of the threat Kt. to Q's 2d, Kt's 3d, and B's
5th eventually. But Marshall plays still for attack, not content with a
draw in an even position.]

[Footnote H: Black has now the better game.]

[Footnote I: Better would have been 22... Q. to B's 2d
23. Q. to Kt's 2d, K. R. to B's sq.; 24. R. takes Q.,
Q. takes R., with the command of the open file.]

[Footnote J: NOTES BY L. HOFFER.--Q. to B's 2d could be played here.]

[Footnote K: An alternative would be 25... Q. to B's 3d;
26. P. to K's 5th, Q. to Q's sq.; 27. R. takes R., Q. takes R.;
28. Q. to B's 2d, Q. takes Q.; 29. B. takes Q., Kt. to Q's 2d,
winning the K. P.]

[Footnote L: Q. to Q's 3d or Q. to B's 2d could be played. The text move
gives White a chance to bring his Queen effectively into play.]

[Footnote M: Kt. to K's sq. would have been safer.]

[Footnote N: Marshall did not expect this _complaisance_, and Janowsky
would not have obliged him had he seen the fatal 35. Q. to R's 4th.
34... Kt. takes K. P. should have been played.]

[Footnote O: Marshall risked losing the game in trying to win. His
boldness was rewarded, but the verdict should be: Don't try it again.]

[Footnote A: The best line of play against the McCutcheon defence. It
was played in a game Sjöberg _vs._ Giersing, Stockholm, 1906.]

[Footnote B: Out of place in this position. Q. Kt. to Q's 2d or
Kt. to K's 5th, would be alternatives--the former move in preference.]

[Footnote C: This excellent move was probably not taken into
consideration by Tarrasch when advancing P. to B's 4th.]

[Footnote D: If 10.., P. takes P., then 11. R. takes P., and Black could
not challenge the Queen with 11.., Q. to Q. B's 4th, because of
12. R. to Q. B's 4th. Nor could 10.., K. to K's 2d be played, because of
11. P. takes P., and 11.., Q. takes B. P. would be answered with
12. R. takes Kt. winning the Queen, and as the continuation in the text
is hopeless, there remains the only alternative of 10.., Castles, with
a good enough game, all things considered.]

[Footnote E: Simply position play. Black's forces are paralyzed, and the
King fixed on the middle of the centre.]

[Footnote F: Q. to B's 2d at once seems comparatively better, and if
necessary Castles, and the case is not altogether hopeless.]

[Footnote G: Not a judicious capture, to say the least.]

[Footnote H: This move, or resigning. There is nothing else. The latter
course would be more to the purpose, unless a miracle is expected.]

      34. Q. takes R.
      And Black surrenders, after a struggle of nearly nine hours.

[Footnote A: A very ingenious move. If Black take the Pawn with his
Queen, he of course loses her by "B. takes Q. R. P. (ch.), etc." and if
with the Kt. it costs him at least a Piece.]

      34. Kt. to K's 6th.              34. Q. takes Kt.[Q]
                           And Black wins.

[Footnote A: A favorite move with several of the strongest of modern
players.]

[Footnote B: If White take P. with P., the Black K. B. is brought into
play; and if not, the advance of P. to B's 5th is threatened.]

[Footnote C: Chiefly to double White's Pawns.]

[Footnote D: Black foresaw the intended attack on the B. P., and by
providing for it in this way brought another Piece into action.]

[Footnote E: White keeps up the attack on the B. P. with a great deal of
vigor. The move of R. P. two was a very good one.]

[Footnote F: The best move.]

[Footnote G: The R. is well posted--for attack and defence.]

[Footnote H: Black has now resumed the offensive.]

[Footnote I: Threatening to take Q. if P. takes P., and attacking Q. R.
at the same time. There was still another motive for this move, viz.: to
induce White to take R. P., foreseeing the R. would be lost
subsequently.]

[Footnote J: To enslave the Rook.]

[Footnote K: An excellent move. In this and the succeeding moves, White
played very well. His efforts were directed to saving his R., but, as
the result showed, without success.]

[Footnote L: Apparently hazardous, but justified by the gain of time.]

[Footnote M: We believe his best move.]

[Footnote N: White was obliged to lose the exchange, although he fought
manfully against it.]

[Footnote O: Another very good move in White.]

[Footnote P: Black's advantage in the exchange begins now to tell on the
game.]

[Footnote Q: Threatening mate if R. takes Q.]

[Footnote A: A favorite move of Mr. Harrwitz, though decried by the
chief authorities.]

[Footnote B: Had he taken the Queen's Pawn, White would have won at
least the exchange by moving Kt. to Q's 7th.]

[Footnote C: Fearing to take the Bishop lest White should obtain an
entrance with the Rook.]

[Footnote D: All this is exceedingly well played by White.]

[Footnote E: The _coup juste_. From this point it would not be easy to
improve on White's moves.]

[Footnote F: Better, perhaps, to have played the Rook to Q. R's sq. at
once.]

[Footnote A: The ingenious attack instituted hereby was invented by
Zukertort.]

[Footnote B: 10. P. takes B., Kt. to B's 3d!; 11. Q. takes R. (ch.),
obtains three pieces for the Q., but loses the game. Q. to K's sq.,
here or on the following move, offers the only defence.]

[Footnote C: Zukertort's analysis, which filled pages and pages of the
_Neue Berliner Schachzeitung_, considered every conceivable move of
White's down to P. to Q. R's 3d, but this one, upon which, in
conjunction with the following K. move, Steinitz rested his gambit.
11. P. to B's 3d has been refuted in an elaborate analysis by
Mr. Walter Penn Shipley, of Philadelphia.]

[Footnote D: Black wins here by,

      12. ...                          12. P. to Q. R's 3d.
      13. K. to Kt's 3d.               13. P. takes Kt.
      14. P. to B's 3d.                14. R. takes P.!

      18. K. to K's 2d.                18. Kt. to Kt's 5th.!

as played by Messrs. Honegger and Raubitscheck in a consultation game
against Steinitz at the Metropolitan Chess Club, 1897. If, instead of
K. to Kt's 3d, 13. Kt. takes P. Black wins by R. takes P.!.]

[Footnote E: White has brought his K. into safety and will remain a
piece ahead. Had Black, instead of his last move, pinned the B., the
game would have proceeded as follows:

      19. ...                          19. R. to Kt's 3d.
      20. P. to Q. R's 4th.            20. P. to Q. R's 3d.
      21. B. takes P.                  21. R. takes P.
      22. K. to B's 2d.                22. P. takes B.
      23. P. takes P.                  23. Q. takes P.
      24. B. takes P. (ch.) and wins.]

                            ENDINGS OF GAMES


To play with correctness and skill the ends of games, is an important
but a very rare accomplishment, except among the very best players. In
order to assist the learner as much as possible in this branch of the
game, we present a number of end positions, with the proper play
necessary in each case. Our selection of positions is necessarily very
limited; but those we give will serve to show the careful play that is
requisite even when the stronger party feels sure of success, and the
danger of defeat if he suffer his vigilance to be relaxed for a moment.

                  KING AND TWO KNIGHTS AGAINST KING.

The two Knights, with the assistance of the King, cannot force
checkmate, except in some very rare cases.


              KING AND PAWN,--KING, BISHOP, AND PAWN,--AND
                 KING, KNIGHT, AND PAWN,--AGAINST KING.

When one Pawn only is left on the board, supported by its King, and the
adverse King is either in front of the Pawn, or within such distance as
to be able to intercept it, it becomes a point of great nicety in some
cases, to calculate whether or not you have the power of Queening the
Pawn, and therefore of winning the game. This frequently depends upon
your gaining the opposition, which you cannot always do.

In the next position (see Diagram 6) you have the opposition, and if
Black have to play you will win. Thus:--

                                        1. K. to his sq.
       2. P. to K's 7th.                2. K. to his 2d.
       3. K. to B's 7th, and
       4. P. Queens.

But if you move first, the game is drawn; for if you play
P. to K's 7th (ch.), Black moves King to his square, and you must either
abandon the Pawn or give stalemate. You will find, on trial, that any
other mode of play on your part will produce the same result,--from
which is deduced this important general rule: That if you can advance
the Pawn to its 7th sq., _not giving check_, you will win; but that if
the Pawn checks at this point, you will only draw.

In this position (see Diagram 7), you will win either with or without
the move; for if Black have to play, he is forced to allow your King to
be moved either to B's 7th or Q's 7th sq.; and if you move you gain the
opposition, by playing K. to B's 6th or Q's 6th, and then P. to K's 6th.
It is evident that this would equally hold good if your Pawn were any
number of squares less advanced; so that you invariably win, if you can
succeed in placing your King on the sixth square of the file occupied by
your Pawn, and in front of it; provided, of course, that the single King
cannot attack the Pawn, so as to compel you to retreat in order to
support it. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to observe, that if the
Pawn be upon either of the Rooks' files, these remarks will not
apply--this contingency will be considered hereafter.

Diagram 8.

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
       1. K. to Q's 2d.                 1. K. to his 2d.
       2. K. to his 3d.                 2. K. to his 3d.
       3. K. to his 4th.                3. K. to B's 3d.
       4. K. to Q's 5th.                4. K. to K's 2d.
       5. K. to his 5th.                5. K. to B's 2d.
       6. K. to Q's 6th.

If he play K. to B's 3d, you advance P. to K's 4th, then to K's 5th,
and on his afterwards moving K. to his sq., you gain the opposition, as
shown before.

                                        6. K. to his sq., or to B's sq.
       7. K. to K's 6th.
                    And then advances Pawn, winning.

Next, suppose Black has the move, and he will draw:--

             WHITE.                           BLACK.
                                        1. K. to K's 2d.
       2. K. to Q's 2d.                 2. K. to his 3d.
       3. K. to his 3d.                 3. K. to his 4th.
       4. K. to Q's 3d.                 4. K. to Q's 4th.
       5. P. to K's 3d, or              5. K. to K's 4th.
          to K's 4th. (ch.)

And it is clear that, play as you may, you can only draw the game.

The only exception in all the foregoing cases is to be found, as has
already been remarked, when the Pawn is upon either of the Rooks' files.
In these instances, Black will invariably draw the game when his King
can be placed on any part of the file in front of the Pawn, it being
quite immaterial at what distance the adverse King and Pawn may be.
Even, as in the next example, the player of the single King will draw
the game, if he have not the move, against two Pawns in a somewhat
similar position. For White being to move, he can only play
K. to R's 8th, to which Black must reply by K. to B's sq.; and if White
then advance B's Pawn, it will be taken: or if he play R's Pawn, Black
returns K. to B's 2d, and his adversary is stalemated. (See Diagram 9.)

Two _united_ Pawns, with their King, always win against King alone.
Another advantage in having two Pawns thus situated is, that they can
always maintain themselves until the arrival of the King to their
support; for should one be taken, the other will advance to Queen.
In the next position (see Diagram 10), White wins by advancing
K. to Kt's 5th, then Queening Rook's Pawn, and upon that being taken,
playing K. to R's 6th, or B's 6th, having the opposition.


                    QUEEN AGAINST A KNIGHT OR BISHOP.

(In all cases, each party is of course understood to have a King in
addition to the Pieces named.)

                              Diagram 11.

               WHITE.                        BLACK.
       1. Q. to her 4th. (ch.)          1. K. to his 3d.
       2. K. to his 4th.                2. Kt. to K. Kt's 3d.
       3. Q. to her Kt's 6th. (ch.)     3. K. to B's 2d.
       4. K. to B's 5th.                4. Kt. to K's 2d. (ch.)
       5. K. to Kt's 5th.               5. Kt. to Q's 4th.
       6. Q. to her 6th.                6. Kt. to K's 2d.
       7. Q. to K. B's 6th.[A] (ch.)    7. K. to his sq.
       8. Q. to K's 6th.                8. K to Q's sq.
       9. K. to B's 6th.                9. Kt. to Q. B's sq.
      10. Q. to Q. B's 6th.
                        And you must win the Kt.

The Queen also easily wins against a Bishop.

With few exceptions, arising from peculiar situations, the Queen wins
also against a Rook and Pawn. Diagram 13, illustrating a won game, is
from Philidor.

[Footnote A: This is the position which White must endeavor to gain, in
order that he may force the King to his Queen's 4th, in front of the
Pawn.]


                       QUEEN AGAINST TWO BISHOPS.

The Queen usually wins against two of the minor Pieces, at least if they
are on different parts of the board, or at a distance from their King.
There are, however, many instances in which, by skilful play, the weaker
force may draw the game.

The two Bishops will be able to draw when they can assume a position
similar to that in Diagram 14, or in other words, such a position in
front of their King, that the adverse King cannot approach.

                           White moves first.

                         QUEEN AGAINST TWO KNIGHTS.

Two Knights can often draw the game against a Queen.


                      QUEEN AGAINST KNIGHT AND BISHOP.

A King with Bishop and Knight can in many cases draw the game against a
King and Queen.

                    QUEEN AGAINST QUEEN AND PAWN.

In cases of this kind the game is usually drawn without difficulty, and
most generally so by means of a perpetual check, though the same object
may sometimes be attained by an exchange of Queens, when your King is
able to stop the Pawn. When, however, the Pawn is advanced to its 7th
square, and more particularly if defended by its King, the task is one
of more difficulty, and many instructive situations occur where the Pawn
may be Queened and the game therefore won. We subjoin an example or two
of each kind, by way of illustration.

          White will always be able to make a drawn game.

                               And wins.

       7. Q. to her 3d. (ch.)
          Then forces an exchange of Queens, and wins with
          his remaining Pawn.


                          QUEEN AGAINST PAWN.

In all ordinary situations, the Queen of course easily stops a single
Pawn and wins against it; if, however, the latter has reached its 7th
square, and has the support of its King, there are instances in which
the game must be drawn. Our first position (see Diagram 18), will show
the method of winning, and we shall afterwards point out the exceptions.


                              Diagram 18.

                 WHITE.                        BLACK.
       1. Q. to K. B's 5th. (ch.)       1. K. to K. Kt's 7th.
       2. Q. to K's 4th. (ch.)          2. K. to B's 7th.
       3. Q. to K. B's 4th. (ch.)       3. K. to Kt's 7th.
       4. Q. to K's 3d.                 4. K. to B's 8th.
       5. Q. to K. B's 3d. (ch.)        5. K. to his 8th.
       6. K. to Q's 4th.                6. K. to Q's 8th.
       7. Q. to her 3d. (ch.)           7. K. to his 8th.
       8. K. to his 3d.                 8. K. to B's 8th.
       9. Q. takes P. (ch.) and wins.

The same mode of procedure can always be adopted, unless the single Pawn
should be either on the Bishop's or Rook's file, in which case Black may
usually make a drawn game, owing to the power which he then has of
making a stalemate. His having this alternative, however, altogether
depends upon the distance which the adverse King may chance to be from
the scene of action. In the next position (Diagram 19) the game is
drawn.

                   WHITE.                     BLACK.
       1. Q. to K. Kt's 4th. (ch.)      1. K. to R's 8th.
       2. Q. to K. B's 3d. (ch.)        2. K. to Kt's 8th.
       3. Q. to K. Kt's 3d. (ch.)       3. K. to R's 8th.

And it is evident, that if White take the Pawn, his adversary is
stalemated.

The result is the same when the Pawn is on the Rook's file, as you will
at once see by making the experiment.

The next position (see Diagram 20), is a very ingenious exception to
this rule, and will well repay your attention.

                WHITE.                           BLACK.

                               And wins.

                          ROOK AGAINST KNIGHT.

In ordinary positions, and where the Knight is near to, or cannot be
prevented approaching, his King, the weaker party will be able to draw
the game. The method of doing so, however, is not very easy, and there
are many positions (of which we shall give an example) where the Rook
can win.

In the following position (see Diagram 23) White will win either with
the move or without it.

              WHITE.                             BLACK.
                                        1. Kt. to R's 2d. (ch.)
       2. K. to K. B's 7th.             2. Kt. to Kt's 4th. (ch.)
       3. K. to K. Kt's 6th.
                              And wins.

                               And wins.

                       And the game must be drawn.

But suppose Black have to play:--

                        And the game is drawn.

If Black move, he plays:--

                                        1. K. to his 4th.
       2. K. to his 3d.                 2. K. to Q's 4th.

(Were he to move K. to B's 4th, you would win by 3. K. to Q's 4th.)

       3. K. to B's 3d.                 3. K. to his 4th.

       5. K. to Kt's 4th.               5. K. to B's 3d.

                             And wins.

Next, if White move first he must equally lose.

             WHITE.                             BLACK.

this instance had probably made up his mind to adopt the plan frequently
employed by Gunsberg in the Giuoco Piano, namely, playing Qd2 and O-O-O
rapidly. --Gunsberg.} Ng6 {Black's difficulty is how to dispose of the
Kt. Now g6 in this instance, although perhaps preferable, is not a good
place either, subject as it must be to an early attack from the h
pawn--Hoffer.} 7. Qd2 Be7 8. O-O-O a6 9. Be2 exd4 10. Nxd4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4

this move. Either he can O-O now; if not, then it is proof positive that
his defence is bad.--Gunsberg.} 13. Nd5 O-O 14. g4 {This premature
advance is admirably taken advantage of by Steinitz. --Leeds Mercury.}
Re8 {Although this looks like a defensive move, to make room for the
Kt., it is a subtle design which was entirely overlooked by Lasker.
--Hoffer.} 15. g5 $2 Bxd5 16. Qxd5 {But here is a great mistake, which
ought to lose the game. exd5 would have averted the loss of a Pawn, but
at the expense of position and attack; he was outplayed by Steinitz up
to this point.} Re5 $1 17. Qd2 Bxg5 18. f4 Rxe4 19. fxg5 Qe7 20. Rdf1

resource. With Rdf1 he commenced one of the most ingenious attacks.}

this game memorable. The object is, if hxg6 to open up the Rook's file
by h5. Allowance must of course be made for the fact that, being two
Pawns behind, White has nothing to lose and everything to gain by
desperate tactics.--Gunsberg.} d5 24. gxh7+ Kxh7 25. Bd3+ Kg8 26. h5 Re8

detects the weak spots, and how immediately he takes advantage of his
opponent's slightest omission or commission.--Hoffer.} Kf7 34. Rhg1 gxf5

{Qd7 is a final blunder. Rd7 should have been played, or Re6. The game
is now over. It will be readily admitted that it is a well-earned
victory which none will grudge the plucky young player.--Hoffer We
really cannot see a satisfactory move, for if Re6, then follows Qf2+,
and Rf8. Or if Qd8 then likewise Qf2+ should gain some advantage, as, on
Kb5, White could continue with a4+ and Qc5, etc.--Gunsberg.} 42. Qg1+ d4

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
