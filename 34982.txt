IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA




IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA


 In the East ye struggle for glory
 And power, and wealth, and fame,
 And time ye expend, and much labor,
 To trace down your ancestors' name;
 But here in the land of Dakota
 Where the winds sweep over the plains,
 Is winnowed away much useless "chaff,"
 And only true worth remains.

 In the East ye crush out the life-blood
 Of innocent children, grown old
 By premature toiling and labor
 To fill up your coffers with gold;
 But here in the Land of Dakota
 Our children are happy and free,
 And over the plains of its limitless mains
 Re-echo their laughter and glee.

 In the East ye build up great mansions
 And sky-scrapers gaunt and high,
 That shut out the glory and grandeur
 Of the infinite tender sky;
 But here in the Land of Dakota
 Our eyes look up on high
 And our souls learn wonderful lessons
 From the white clouds sailing by.




THE SEASONS IN NORTH DAKOTA


 Spring--and the wild March wind
   The snow-covered prairies sweep;
 From North Dakota's frozen clod
   The fur-clad Pasque Flowers peep.

 Summer--and gentle showers,
   And soft the zephyrs blow;
 O'er North Dakota's rolling plains
   The modest Roses grow.

 Autumn--and burnished skies,
   And parching, sun-scorched sod;
 And by the wayside still there blooms
   The stately Goldenrod.

 Winter--the flowers are dead
   And fierce the cold winds blow;
 Yet 'spite of North Dakota's snow
   The flowers of Hope still grow.




 THE DELUGE
 (A Berthold Indian Legend)


 Long ago, yes, oh, so long since,--
 When the world was young and fair,
 All the animals were friendly;
 E'en the bison and the bear
 Aided man with all their cunning,
 Helped him with their counsels grave,
 Helped him as the gods alone can--
 Made him wise and strong and brave.
 And the flowers on the prairies
 Blossomed ever, shy and sweet,
 For the land of the Dakotas
 Knew not frost, nor killing heat.

 But there lived a dread god, North Wind,
 Cruel was he, with heart of stone,
 Feared of all and loved by no one,
 Living to himself alone
 In the land of snow and blizzard,
 In the land of deadening cold,
 Plotting ever some new mischief,
 Some new ravage, cruel and bold.
 And one day this mighty North Wind
 Left his throne of ice and snow,
 In the cold, far distant northland
 Where the wriggling ice-worms glow;
 Southward came he, and the flowers
 Bent their lovely heads in death,
 For from out his icy nostrils
 Came an all-destroying breath.--
 At the mighty, stately forests
 Angrily his teeth he gnashed,
 With one mighty blow he felled them
 And with chains the rivers lashed;
 Ceased their laughter and their murmur,
 Ceased their sweet life-giving flow.--
 All the birds and beasts in terror
 Fled, and knew not where to go;
 Food they found not, and no shelter,
 Dying were the mortals all,
 And a slow relentless snow shroud
 Draped the earth as with a pall.--
 Death supreme reigned; loud the North Wind
 Roared defiance to the gods!--
 Birds and beasts and man in terror
 Fled, and, dying, called the gods
 To avenge their death and suffering,
 To unite them one and all
 In the holy cause of vengeance,
 To secure the North Wind's fall.--
 And the South Wind, fairest maiden
 Of the gods, took up their cause;
 Girded now herself for battle,
 And after a moment's pause
 Called unto her loyal brothers,
 The strong East Wind, and the West,
 "Help revenge the suffering mortals"--
 And they granted her request.

 Strong the fight raged in Dakota
 'Twixt the North Wind and his foes,
 Now one side yields, now the other,
 Fierce and loud the tempest blows;--
 Savagely the monster charges
 Grappling with his unseen foes
 While a wild, chaotic blizzard,
 Such as ne'er was seen, arose,
 Hiding all within its fury,
 Made the daylight dark as night,
 For the very gods were grappling
 In a last terrific fight.--

 Ages long the battle lasted--
 Then the maiden fair and lovely,
 Smiled benignant on her foe,
 And his very heart was melting
 (For 'twas made of ice and snow);
 Loosed the rivers from their bondage,
 Vanished now the shroud of snow,
 And o'er North Dakota's prairies
 Flowers fair began to grow;
 With the advent of the flowers
 Came the birds and beasts and man,
 Built again their homes and wigwams--
 And no more they anxious scan
 The horizon for the North Wind,
 Knowing that he's met his fate;
 But the South Wind, fair and lovely
 Rules now o'er Dakota's state.

 Southward now each year the North Wind
 Wends his way to see her face,
 To the land of the Dakotas
 Where the battle once took place;
 Smiling sweet, the maiden greets him,
 Warms again his chilly heart;
 Satisfied, he briefly lingers--
 With him, winter's cold, depart.




NORTH DAKOTA SUNSETS


 Such beautiful tints in the western skies!
 Purples and gold and the deepest rose,
 Crimson and scarlet the heavens suffuse
 Where the sun of the prairies sinks to repose;--
 Spaces where lingering daylight plays
 With the skirts of night in her sombre gown,
 Spaces where gathering mists hang low
 Ere the shadows of night come drooping down.--
 Such, North Dakota, thy sunsets are--
 Spreading their glory near and far,
 Flooding the soul with a holier peace
 That lingers long after the daylight shall cease!




 NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT
(The Passing of the Red Man)


 Low-lying hills, "bad lands" and rolling plain,
 Stretching afar like billows on the main,
 With winding rivers seeking distant homes,
 And leagues of virgin prairie
 Where stately bison roams.

 The brave Mandan, the Sheyenne and the Sioux,
 The Chippewa and the Grosventre too,
 Along the rivers and the plains did dwell;
 The land they called Dakota,
 And methink they named it well.

 And here they lived for centuries untold,
 Watching the secrets of the plains unfold;
 Their homes they built and smoked the pipe of peace,
 And vowed by the Great Spirit
 Their friendship would not cease.

       *       *       *       *       *

 Gone are the braves. The papooses and the squaw
 No longer wait for winter snows to thaw;
 The tepee's gone, the peace pipe and the dance,
 Gone, gone, alas! forever,
 The Red Man's fighting chance.

 For pale face came, and from Dakota's plain
 The Red Man drove, and claimed his vast domain;
 No power on earth could stay the Viking's son,
 For "iron men" are born
 In the land of midnight sun.

       *       *       *       *       *

 Onward they came, these Northmen, feared of old,
 Bold pioneers, to wrest the hidden gold
 From North Dakota's hills and virgin sod;
 The ploughshare won the land
 For these "master men" of God.

       *       *       *       *       *

 Their children now look out on well-tilled fields,
 And garner wealth, that many a rich mine yields;
 The argosies of earth their treasures bear--
 For empty rank and title and sham,
 They little care.

       *       *       *       *       *

 O boys and girls of North Dakota's Land,
 Guard, love her well! Pledge her your heart and hand!
 Where else on earth are seen such sunset fires--
 What other race can boast
 More fearless dames and sires!




A PRAIRIE SUNRISE


 Gray and silent is the morning--
   Shadows like some airy lawn
 Veil the prairies from our vision;
   Night is breaking into dawn.

 Look! Along the eastern heavens
   Yonder cloud a beacon glows,
 Touching all with mellow brightness;
   Gray is turning into rose.

 Sombre shadows swiftly vanish--
   Gorgeous are the fiery dyes
 That adorn the far horizons,
   Flooding earth, and air and skies.

 See! The sun is slowly rising
   O'er the level fields of grain,
 Restless, golden billows surging
   On a vast and boundless main.--

 Hark! A distant sound is breaking
   Through the stillness deep and calm--
 O'er the prairies floats the cadence
   Of sweet Nature's morning psalm.




DAKOTA LAND, DAKOTA LAND


 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy rolling prairies;
 Thy "bad lands" 'yond Missouri's bed
 The fertile valley of the Red--
 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy rolling prairies.

 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy sunset fires;
 Thy sunny days, thy azure skies,
 Thy starry nights, thy sunrise dyes--
 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy sunset fires.

 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy modest wild rose;
 Thy fields of waving, golden grain,
 Like billows on a boundless main--
 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy modest wild rose.

 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy changing seasons;
 Thy winter's cold, thy summer nights,
 Thy blust'ry spring, thy autumn bright--
 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy changing seasons.

 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy far horizons;
 No mountains hide the gorgeous dyes
 That paint with splendour western skies--
 Dakota Land, Dakota Land,
 We love thy far horizons.




NORTH DAKOTA'S MISSION


 Pioneers of North Dakota
   Spread her fame!
 Bid thy youths and bid thy maidens
   Guard her name!--
 Tell them of your dreams and visions--
 Tell them of your great ambitions;--
 How you fought to win the land;
 Tell them of brave Custer's band.

 Tell them how you fought the Red Man,
   How he lost--
 Tell them North Dakota's story
   And the cost!--
 Can they too, like you, the price pay?
 Can they too, like you, their lives lay
 Down, if need be, for their state?
 Dare they share her every fate?--

       *       *       *       *       *

 To the children of Dakota
   This we give,
 First of all, a glorious vision
   How to live--
 Them we give our mines and "bad lands,"
 Prairies broad and fertile wheat lands
 Stretching from Missouri's bed
 To the Valley of the Red.

 And the fame of North Dakota's name
   Shall rise,
 Like the never-tiring Phoenix
   To the skies!--
 State of promise and of fair play,
 State where rises bright a new day
 For the weak and the oppressed,
 State which millions shall call blest!

 Men and women of Dakota
   Who shall say
 What the fruitage of our efforts
   Of to-day?--
 Labor then, nor lose the vision
 Of this North Dakota's mission,
 To free body, soul, and mind,
 To help all their true work find.




WE WHO HAVE LIVED IN DAKOTA


 We who have lived in Dakota
 We who have loved her right well,
 We who have known her, and tried her,
 Marvelous tales could we tell;
 Tales of the Sioux and the Mandan,
 Tales of the Sheyenne as well;
 Deeds of brave Custer and Sully,
 Fain unto you we would tell.

 Hard have we worked, and we've conquered,
 Conquered the Red Man--the sod.--
 Over the primeval prairies
 Forward and onward we've trod.
 Fought we with sword and with ploughshare,
 Wresting our bread from the clod--
 Virgin and untouched we found it
 As left by the hand of our God.

 Yes, we've weathered the blizzards.
 Crop failures many we've known.--
 Early and late have we labored,
 Felt the cold wind to the bone.--
 Glad we have been when our neighbor
 Garnered the golden grain,
 Knowing our mortgage was unpaid,
 And all of our efforts seemed vain.

 Glad have we been when the harvest
 Yielded an hundred-fold--
 Paying the debt and the mortgage,
 Lining our pockets with gold.
 Yes, we still love North Dakota,
 Knowing she'll compensate well
 Those who are willing to try her;--
 To summer and winter her well.




MISCELLANEOUS VERSES




GUIDING VOICES


 Echoes of beloved voices
 Reach us in the silent night,
 Sooth the feverish, restless spirit,
 Bring us messages of light;
 Messages of love to cheer us
 Onward still, though dark the way,
 Whispers fraught with hope and courage
 For the battles of the day.

 'Midst the clamor and the tumult
 And the din of shop and mill,
 Still the voices of our loved ones
 All our vibrant beings thrill
 With celestial music holy;
 Quenching lust, and pain and strife,
 Which are rife where Mammon reigneth
 All supreme in human life.

 When the evening shadows lengthen
 On life's pathway, as we go,
 And our sight is getting dimmer
 And the sands of time run low,
 "Courage, brother," still they whisper,
 "Keep the path, we'll guide the way,
 Till thou reach the land where shadows
 Lose themselves in Perfect Day."




A PRAYER


 Make me gentle, Lord, and kind;
   Honest, frugal, pure of mind;
 Patient, humble, meek and mild;
   Trustful as a little child.

 Make me earnest, Lord, and strong;
   Just and faithful; foe of wrong;
 Slow to anger; friend of all;
   Swift to answer duty's call.




TO A FRIEND


 My love for thee, lips cannot tell,
   Nor words, nor actions, half as well
 As my full heart would wish;
   But sometimes, in another land,
 When we have reached the Golden Strand
   I know, you'll surely understand.




A DREAM


 It was midnight. And those spirits
 Who men's destinies control
 Were in solemn court assembled,
 Waiting for the bell to toll
 The final hour of the year;
 And what happened you will hear:

 Elves and gnomes and dwarfs came tripping
 On the light fantastic toe,
 From their distant caves and castles
 In the land of ice and snow;
 And the elf-king, white and hoary,
 From his throne arose and spoke:
 "Fellow spirits all, I greet you."
 (And just then old Father Time
 Rang out the old year--1909.)
 "Friends, I feel our power is waning,--
 Man, our ward, is now proclaiming
 Among others, a most curious thing,
 That in a chair he likes to swing
 Because his ancestor, an ape,
 Was very apt to use his tape
 To swing himself from limb to limb
 Of trees and vines which on them cling.
 Moreover, he is now so learned
 That to a fossil he is turned,
 Instead of joining our free band
 Of spirits, in the fairy land."

 Silence reigned supreme a moment;
 Then an old dwarf, ripe with age,
 Arose, and all those elves and fairies
 Bowed their heads a little space
 For that "grand old man," whose wisdom
 In that hall rang loud and clear:
 "Time has come when man no longer
 Feels he needs invoke our aid,
 For creation, now he tells us,
 By itself was surely made;--
 Blind he is to Nature's teachings,
 And so wise in his conceit
 That he would forget the lessons
 Taught by wayside flowers sweet;
 By the river and the mountain
 And the myriad things that creep
 Upon the earth. And this wondrous
 Human being calls himself but a machine,
 Classed among the things he fashions
 From the metals earth doth yield.
 Ah, his very heart is hardening--
 Love no longer can hold sway
 When the heir of all creation
 Says he's only made of clay."

       *       *       *       *       *

 I awoke from my light slumber
 At the New Year's earliest beam,
 Pondering deeply if a lesson
 Could be learned, e'en from a dream.




THE LIGHT


 The way is long, the night is drear,
   I stumble on through doubt and fear;
 My heart grows numb, all hope takes flight;
   Oh, Father, let me see the light!

 Was it for me that He has died?
   Was it for me the Crucified
 Bore the deep anguish in the night?--
   Oh, Father, let me see the light!

 O doubting child, look up and see,
   It was for sinners, such as thee,
 Christ conquered sin, and death, and night.
   Look up, dear child, behold The Light!




SISTER DEAR, I LOVE YOU SO


 Sister dear, I love you so!
   As the seasons come and go,
 Dearer still, my friend, you grow.
   Sister dear, I love you so!

 Sister dear, I love you so!
   Ah, forgive each thoughtless blow;
 Though I've often hurt you--oh,
   Sister dear, I love you so!

 Sister dear, I love you so!
   May love's flame still brighter glow,
 Friendship's fires ne'er burn low.--
   Sister dear, I love you so!

 Sister dear, I love you so!
   As your birthdays come and go,
 Let me whisper, soft and low,
   Sister dear, I love you so!

 Sister dear, I love you so!
   When life's fires dimmer glow,
 Take this with you, as you go,
   Sister dear, I love you so!




NIGHT WATCHES


 In the still watches of night
 Long ere the dawn comes a-creeping
 Over the eastern skies,
 Think of the hearts that are breaking;--
 Oh, hear the moans and the sobbing--
 Feel how the pulses are throbbing,
 Just because some one was thoughtless.--
 Oh, was that someone you?




MEN ARE THREE


 There are all kinds of people we meet on the road,
 As we travel along life's way;
 And some are surly and some are grave
 And others are jolly and gay.
 And some folks are short, while others are tall,
 Still others are skinny and thin--
 And some skip along, a-humming a song,
 But others are simply all in.
 But where'er they come from, or whither they go,
 We pigeon-hole each of them so,
 We group them, and sort them, and label them all,
 The short ones, the skinny, and tall.

 There's the man or the woman, the boy or the girl,
 That's always a-wishing a share
 In somebody's fortune, or somebody's fame,
 Yes, they wish for the moon 'way up there.--
 Then there's that group of persons
 Who talk, talk, and talk,
 You simply don't know what they say--
 From morning till night they keep talking away,
 And the night is like unto the day.--
 But quietly along, on the very same road,
 Walk others, with little to say,
 And if they have wishes (What mortals have not?),
 They put them discreetly away.
 They're the workers, the lifters of burdens,--who dare
 To fight for the right if need be,
 Alone 'gainst a world--
 And defiance they hurl
 To all tyrants wherever they be.

 You have met these three classes of people, I'm sure,
 As you've traveled adown life's way--
 The folks with their wish-bone enormously grown,
 And the "jaw-bones," who talk all the day.--
 And I know you have shunned them,
 As others have done
 From the day that time began,
 But you've hailed with delight,
 And you've longed for the sight
 Of the steady, quiet, "back-boned" man.




SMILES AND TEARS


 Swift run the hours on to days
   And days to years--
 And each and every one is filled
   With smiles or tears.

 Sometimes the skies are over-cast
   The live-long Day--
 But when the sun shall smile again
   Why, who can say!




 COLUMBIA TO SHAKESPEARE
 (An Appreciation)


 We are gathered here from the ends of the earth,
 The children of Teuton and Celt;
 The children, too, of Latin and Slav
 At Liberty's shrine have knelt.

 America is proud to take
 From out of bondage and strife,
 And weave them all into one great whole,
 These strands of human life.

 She'll dye them all in the self-same red
 Of Liberty's crimson hue;
 And place them as the glorious stars
 On Freedom's field of blue.

 And we, the children of all the earth,
 To thee, poet of all times,
 Bring honor, and laurel, and love as well--
 And crown thee, king of rhymes.

 Thou brought us to the very homes
 Of Saxon, Dane and Moor,
 And sweetly sang thy choicest lays
 Alike to rich and poor.

 Thou didst act well, thy every part,
 On this brief stage of life;
 Thou taught us too, our parts to play
 In peaceful work, or strife.

 Renowned bard of Albion's land
 America bids thee rise
 Like Phoenix, fabled from of old--
 Immortal, to the skies.

 Thy crimson bars to us are dear,
   Thy stars with hope our hearts imbue;
 Thou emblem of fraternity,
   We will be true, yes true to you!

 O Flag, thou flag of Washington,
   Thou emblem of democracy,
 We'll follow thee, whate'er befall,
   We pledge to thee our fealty!
 Our brain, our brawn, our life, our all--
   America, we give to you!
 With heart and hand we pledge anew
   To God and you, we will be true!

 We will be true, yes, true to you,
   O Flag, and all for which you stand:
 Equality and liberty
   And happiness throughout the land.--
 Thy foster sons, America,
   Will serve thee well--thy daughters too;
 Their life, their all, they pledge anew,
   O Stars and Stripes, to you--to you!




THE PEACE OF THE WOODS


 Oh, oft when I come to the city,
 I long for the peace of the woods;
 For the sighing of winds in the pine trees
 And the laughter of running brooks;
 The chatter of squirrel and chipmunk,
 The call of the shy wood dove.--
 Oh, the forest's the place to listen
 To that grandest of anthems--Love.

 Ere the darksome shades of the forest
 Have vanished, at early dawn,
 A million happy creatures
 Are chanting their morning psalm;
 They sing of the joy of living,
 In happiness, peace, and love,
 And gratefully raise their voices
 To the great All-Giver above.

 And I, in a gladsome spirit,
 Join in with the happy throng;
 Sustained, and strengthened, and soothed,
 By Nature's mighty song.--
 And oft when I come to the city,
 I long for that song of love,
 That the forest's happy creatures
 Raise to the Father above.




KEEP THE PATH CLEAR!


 Oh, do not trifle with friendship, I pray,
 Guard it more closely each swift-flying day;
 Gifts the most precious, and gold cannot pay
 For friendship once broken.
 It's vanished for aye!--

 Keep clear the path to your friend's heart, I pray!
 Weeds of forgetfulness soon choke the way;
 Pass that way often; keep polished, I pray,
 The flagstones that guide you down friendship's own way!




TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:

One minor change has been made (to correct thoughless to thoughtless)
for a typesetter's error; otherwise, every effort has been made to
remain true to the author's words and intent.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
