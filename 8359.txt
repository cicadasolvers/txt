THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS

Thessalonica was the capital of Macedonia, in which St. Paul, having
preached the Gospel, converted some Jews and a great number of the
Gentiles: but the unbelieving Jews, envying his success, raised such a
commotion against him that he, and his companion, Sylvanus were obliged
to quit the city. Afterwards he went to Athens, where he heard that the
converts in Thessalonica were under a severe persecution, ever since his
departure; and lest they should lose their fortitude, he sent Timothy to
strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings. In the meantime St.
Paul came to Corinth, where he wrote this first Epistle, and also the
second to the Thessalonians, both in the same year, being the nineteenth
after our Lord's Ascension. These are the first of his Epistles in the
order of time.


1 Thessalonians Chapter 1

He gives thanks for the grace bestowed on the Thessalonians.

1:1. Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians:
in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.

1:2. Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you
all: making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing,

1:3. Being mindful of the work of your faith and labour and charity: and
of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our
Father.

1:4. Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:

1:5. For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power
also: and in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness, as you know what manner
of men we have been among you for your sakes.

1:6. And you became followers of us and of the Lord: receiving the word
in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:

1:7. So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia
and in Achaia.

1:8. For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in
Macedonia and in Achaia but also in every place: your faith which is
towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.

1:9. For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had
unto you: and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and
true God.

1:10. And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the
dead), Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.

1 Thessalonians Chapter 2

The sincerity of the apostle's preaching the gospel to them and of their
receiving it.

2:1. For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it
was not in vain:

2:2. But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated,
(as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto
you the gospel of God in much carefulness.

2:3. For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in
deceit.

2:4. But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed
to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proveth our
hearts.

2:5. For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you
know: nor taken an occasion of covetousness (God is witness):

2:6. Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.

2:7. Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of
Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse
should cherish her children:

2:8. So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the
gospel of God but also our own souls: because you were become most dear
unto us.

2:9. For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and
day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you
the gospel of God.

2:10. You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and without
blame we have been to you that have believed:

2:11. As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a
father doth his children),

2:12. We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of
God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

2:14. For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God
which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same
things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:

2:15. Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have
persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;

2:16. Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved,
to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to
the end.

To fill up their sins... That is, to fill up the measure of their sins,
after which God's justice would punish them. For the wrath of God is
come upon them to the end... That is, to continue on them to the end.

2:17. But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in
sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face
with great desire.

2:18. For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again:
but Satan hath hindered us.

2:19. For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not you, in the
presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

2:20. For you are our glory and joy.

1 Thessalonians Chapter 3

The apostle's concern and love for the Thessalonians.

3:1. For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain
at Athens alone.

3:2. And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the
gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:

3:3. That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves
know that we are appointed thereunto.

3:4. For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should
suffer tribulations: as also it is come to pass, and you know.

3:5. For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your
faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our
labour should be made vain.

3:6. But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your
faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always,
desiring to see us as we also to see you:

3:7. Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity
and tribulation, by your faith.

3:8. Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.

3:9. For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy
wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,

3:10. Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face
and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?

3:11. Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct
our way unto you.

3:12. And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity
towards one another and towards all men: as we do also towards you,

3:13. To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and
our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints.
Amen.

1 Thessalonians Chapter 4

He exhorts them to purity and mutual charity. He treats of the
resurrection of the dead.

4:1. For the rest therefore, brethren, pray and beseech you in the Lord
Jesus that, as you have received from us, how you ought to walk and to
please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.

4:2. For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.

4:3. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: That you should
abstain from fornication:

4:4. That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour,

4:5. Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:

4:6. And that no man overreach nor circumvent his brother in business:
because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you
before and have testified.

4:7. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
sanctification.

4:8. Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but
God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.

4:9. But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to
write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.

4:10. For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia.
But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:

4:11. And that you use your endeavour to be quiet: and that you do your
own business and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that
you walk honestly towards them that are without: and that you want
nothing of any man's.

4:12. And we will not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that
are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.

4:13. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again: even so them who
have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.

4:14. For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are
alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them
who have slept.

4:15. For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment
and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God: and the
dead who are in Christ shall rise first.

4:16. Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together
with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air: and so shall we be
always with the Lord.

4:17. Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words.

1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

The day of the Lord shall come when least expected. Exhortations to
several duties.

5:1. But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we
should write to you:

5:2. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall so
come as a thief in the night.

5:3. For when they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden
destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child,
and they shall not escape.

5:4. But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should
overtake you as a thief.

5:5. For all you are the children of light and children of the day: we
are not of the night nor of darkness.

5:6. Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do: but let us watch, and be
sober.

5:7. For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk,
are drunk in the night.

5:8. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breast
plate of faith and charity and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.

5:9. For God hath not appointed us unto wrath: but unto the purchasing
of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

5:10. Who died for us: that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live
together with him.

5:11. For which cause comfort one another and edify one another, as you
also do.

5:12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you;

5:13. That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work's
sake. Have peace with them.

5:14. And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet: comfort the
feeble minded: support the weak: be patient towards all men.

The unquiet... That is, such as are irregular and disorderly.

5:15. See that none render evil for evil to any man: but ever follow
that which is good towards each other and towards all men.

5:16. Always rejoice.

5:17. Pray without ceasing.

5:18. In all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus concerning you all.

5:19. Extinguish not the spirit.

5:20. Despise not prophecies.

5:21. But prove all things: hold fast that which is good.

5:22. From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves.

5:23. And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things: that
your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless in the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

5:24. He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it.

5:25. Brethren, pray for us.

5:26. Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.

5:27. I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy
brethren.

5:28. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
