PREFACE.


This is a modest little volume. It consists but
of selections from the Editor's note-book, and its
object is but to amuse. It does not even aspire
to be read consecutively. The Compiler's hope
is only that it may be found a pleasant companion
at spare moments--that it may be considered
handy for the pocket, and be thought agreeable to
dip into.

To that end, two things have been aimed at in
selecting--brevity and variety. There is scarcely
anything in the volume that cannot be read
almost at a glance, and the matter ranges over
a wide extent of literary effort--over play and
poem, over essay and novel, over maxim and epigram,
over memoir and diary. There is pun, and
there is parody; there is satire, and there is sarcasm.
In a word, the little book may say, with
Lafontaine, "Diversite c'est ma devise." There is
diversity even in the arrangement, which consists
merely of a general alternation of the prose and
verse. For the rest, the quips and quiddities are
in intentional disorder.

Let it be added that, though there are a few
anonymous passages, most are duly attributed to
their writers, together with references to the
volumes from which they have been taken. In
this, every care has been exercised to arrive at
accuracy. The idea of completeness is, of course,
foreign to a selection of this sort, and it may be
mentioned that the Editor has been specially
anxious to avoid as much as possible the ground
covered by Mr. Leigh in his "Jeux d'Esprit," and
by Mr. Dobson in his "Literary Frivolities." His
aim, indeed, has been to take the freshest and least
hackneyed of the passages in his collection, though
he has not hesitated to include a venerable saying
when it has seemed to him as good as it is venerable.

In conclusion, the Compiler desires to express
in the most hearty manner his indebtedness to
those numerous living writers whose bright and
airy fancies form, in his opinion, one of the chief
attractions of the book. He ought, perhaps, to
apologize to those writers for presenting their
fancies in a manner so generally fragmentary and
disconnected. But that the contents of the book
should be thus disconnected and fragmentary was
part and parcel of its plan and origin, and, that
being the case, the Editor hopes to be excused.
He may state that, in those few cases where a
piece of verse is given entire, it is distinguished
by the presence of a heading. The epigrams,
maxims, and anecdotes are, of course, reproduced
as written--being, in their very nature, of the
brevity essential to a quip.

Further: on the principle that no book, however
unpretending, should be without an Index, the
Compiler has supplied one for the present volume.

  When Miss Callender, afterwards Mrs. Sheridan,
  published a novel, the hero of which commits
  forgery, that wicked wit, Sydney Smith, said he
  knew she was a Callender, but did not know till then
  that she was a Newgate Calendar.

  Bobus was very amusing. He is a great authority
  on Indian matters. We talked of the insects
  and the snakes, and he said a thing which
  reminded me of his brother Sydney: "Always, sir,
  manage to have at your table some fleshy blooming
  young writer or cadet, just come out, that the mosquitoes
  may stick to him, and leave the rest of the company
  alone."

  who wrote it?"

  A lady from China who was dining with the

  Robert Smith (brother of Sydney, and familiarly
  called "Bobus") was a lawyer and an
  ex-Advocate-General, and happened on one
  occasion to be engaged in argument with an excellent
  physician touching the merits of their respective professions.
  "You must admit," urged Dr. ----, "that
  your profession does not make angels of men." "No,"
  was the retort, "there you have the best of it; yours
  certainly gives them the first chance."

  The merits of a certain American diplomatist being
  on the _tapis_, [Washington Irving] said, in allusion

  Black is a great fact. Want of fashion in the cut;
  want of richness in the material; want of _chic_

  There's a sentiment about it which appeals to the feelings,
  and it is becoming to the skin.

  Unto usage nought denying,

  "Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail,
  "There's the porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
  But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance,
  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

  Now Darwin proves as clear as mud,
  That, endless ages ere the Flood,
  The Coming Man's primeval form
  Was simply an Ascidian worm:

  He keeps it still, and shows full well
  That Man--was--once----a leather bottel.

  "The ancients," quoth Paul, "were very great
  men, Mr. MacGrawler."
  "They were so, sir," returned the critic;
  "we make it a rule in our profession to assert that fact."
  "But, sir," said Paul, "they are wrong now and then."
  "Never, Ignoramus, never."
  "They praised poverty, Mr. MacGrawler," said Paul,
  with a sigh.
  "Hem," quoth the critic, a little staggered; but presently
  recovering his characteristic acumen, he observed,
  "It is true, Paul, but that was the poverty of other
  people."

  One day in the country [Sheridan Knowles] said to
  Abbot, with whom he had been acting there,
  "My dear fellow, I'm off to-morrow. Can I

  Abbot; "but where are you going to?" "_I haven't
  made up my mind._"

  _BLUE STOCKINGS._

  The newspapers lately have taught us to know
  How some strong-minded hens are beginning to crow.
  But, dear ladies, beware: take the word of a friend,
  That when rivalry comes, all affection must end.
  With the brightest of _spoons_ would be war to the _knife_
  In political contests 'twixt husband and wife;
  And the sentence of doom might be sudden and brief
  If a feminine subaltern jilted her chief.
  We men take a pride in concealing our chains,
  And would like to be thought to monopolize brains;
  So I'll give you this maxim, my counsels to crown--
  _If the stockings are blue, keep the petticoats down._

        _Once a Week._


  Talking of Kean, I mentioned his having told
  me that he had eked out his means of living,
  before he emerged from obscurity, by teaching
  dancing, fencing, elocution, and boxing. "Elocution
  and boxing!" (repeated Bobus Smith)--"a word and a
  blow."

  Fontaine, the architect, who built the triumphal

  Napoleon, comme de raison_." Upon which Talleyrand
  said, "_Le char l'attend_."

  'Tis doubtless well to be sometimes awake--
    Awake to duty, and awake to truth,--
  But when, alas! a nice review we take
    Of our best deeds and days, we find, in sooth,
  The hours that leave the slightest cause to weep
  Are those we passed in childhood or asleep!

  She thought "Wives and Daughters" "_so_ jolly;"
    "Had I read it?" She knew that I had:

  "Like Browning?" "But so-so." His proof lay
    Too deep for her frivolous mood,
  That preferred your mere metrical _souffle_

  There's somewhat on my breast, father,
    There's somewhat on my breast;
  The livelong day I sigh, father,
    And at night I cannot rest.
  'Tis not the lack of gold, father,
    Nor want of worldly gear;
  My lands are broad, and fair to see,
    My friends are kind and dear.

  'Tis not that Janet's false, father,
    'Tis not that she's unkind;

  'Tis past all bearing, when a husband slights his bride,
  Who last Christmas still was blushing at her elder sister's side;
  Still on some minute allowance finding collars, boots, and gloves,

  Still by stern domestic edict charged on no account to read

  I differ from all the ordinary biographers of

  One morning [Jerrold and Compton] proceeded
  together to view the pictures in the Gallery of
  Illustration. On entering the ante-room, they
  found themselves opposite to a number of very long
  looking-glasses. Pausing before one of these, [Compton]
  remarked to Jerrold, "You've come here to admire
  works of art! Very well, first feast your eyes on that
  work of nature!"--pointing to his own figure reflected
  in the glass; "look at it, there's a picture for you!"
  "Yes," said Jerrold, regarding it intently, "very fine,
  very fine indeed!" Then, turning to his friend: "Wants
  hanging, though!"

  Sing for the garish eye,
    When moonless brandlings cling!
  Let the froddering crooner cry,

  For bratticed wrackers are singing aloud,
    And the throngers croon in May!

  Kerchief in hand I saw them stand;
    In every kerchief lurked a lunch;
  When they unfurl'd them it was grand
    To watch bronzed men and maidens crunch
  The sounding celery-stick, or ram
  The knife into the blushing ham.

  Dash'd the bold fork through pies of pork;
    O'er hard-boil'd eggs the saltspoon shook;
  Leapt from its lair the playful cork:
    Yet some there were, to whom the brook
  Seemed sweetest beverage, and for meat
  They chose the red root of the beet.

  If thou wouldst stand on Etna's burning brow,
  With smoke above, and roaring flames below;
  And gaze adown that molten gulf reveal'd
  Till thy soul shudder'd, and thy senses reel'd;--
  If thou wouldst beard Niagara in his pride,
  Or stem the billows of Propontic tide;
  Scale all alone some dizzy Alpine _haut_,
  And shriek "Excelsior!" amidst the snow;--
  Wouldst tempt all deaths, all dangers that may be,
  Perils by land, and perils on the sea,--
  This vast round world, I say, if thou wouldst view it,
  Then why the dickens don't you go and do it?

  An ape with a pliable thumb and big brain,

  But I'm sadly afraid, if we do not take care,
  A relapse to low life may our prospects impair,
  So of beastly propensities let us beware,
                          Which nobody can deny.

  Their lofty position our children may lose,

  What mistress half so dear as mine,
    Half so well dressed, so pungent, fragrant,
  Who can such attributes combine,
    To charm the constant, fix the vagrant?
  Who can display such varied arts,
    To suit the taste of saint and sinner,
  Who go so near to touch their hearts,
    As thou, my darling dainty dinner?

  Still my breast holds a rival queen,
    A bright-eyed nymph of sloping shoulders,
  Whose ruddy cheeks and graceful mien
    Entrance the sense of all beholders.
  Oh! when thy lips to mine are pressed,
    What transports titillate my throttle!
  My love can find new life and zest,
    In thee, and thee alone, my bottle!

  Seeing O. Smith, the popular melodramatic actor,

  rushed across the road, seized him by the hand,

  He lived in a cave by the seas,
    He lived upon oysters and foes,
  But his list of forbidden degrees
    An extensive morality shows;
  Geological evidence goes
    To prove he had never a pan,

  He worshipped the rain and the breeze,
    He worshipped the river that flows,
  And the dawn, and the moon, and the trees,
    And bogies, and serpents, and crows;
  He buried his dead with their toes

  Till their knees came right under their nose,--

  My dear, when you have a clergyman in your

  end without them.

  In courtship suppose you can't sing
    Your Cara, your Liebe, your Zoe,
  A kiss and a sight of the ring
    Will more quickly prevail with your Chloe.

  A purse with less learning and lungs
    Would bring them much nearer your throttle.

  Should yours (kind heaven, avert the omen!)
  Like the cravats of vulgar, low men,
  Asunder start--and, yawning wide,
  Disclose a chasm on either side;
  Or should it stubbornly persist
  To take some awkward tasteless twist,
  Some crease, indelible, and look
  Just like a dunce's dog-eared book,
  How would you parry the disgrace?
  In what assembly show your face?
  How brook your rival's scornful glance,
  Or partners' titter in the dance?
  How in the morning dare to meet
  The quizzers of the park and street?
  Your occupation's gone; in vain
  Hope to dine out, or flirt again.
  The ladies from their lists would put you,
  And even _I_, my friend, must cut you!

  I am lying, we'll say, in the nook I love,

  There was a Presbyterian minister who married a

  Another friend assured me it was policy to
  "feed a cold and starve a fever." I had both.
  So I thought it best to feed myself up for the
  cold, and then keep dark and let the fever starve awhile.
  In a case of this kind, I seldom do things by halves.
  I ate pretty heartily. I conferred my custom upon a
  stranger who had just opened his restaurant that morning.
  He waited near me in respectful silence, until I had
  finished feeding my cold, when he inquired if the people
  about Virginia were much afflicted with colds? I told
  him I thought they were. He then went out and took in
  his sign.

  Nearly one hundred years ago, my grandfather,
  Captain William Locker, was at dinner, and a
  servant-boy, lately engaged, was handing him a
  tray of liqueurs, in different-sized glasses. Being in the
  middle of an anecdote to his neighbour, he mechanically
  held out his hand towards the tray, but, as people often
  do when they are thinking of something else, he did not
  take a glass. The boy thought he was hesitating which
  liqueur he would have, and, like a good fellow, wishing
  to help his master, he pointed to one particular glass,
  and whispered, "That's the biggest, sir."

  The Dowager-Duchess of Richmond went one Sunday
  with her daughter to the Chapel Royal at
  St. James's, but, being late, they could find no

  At one period of his boyhood, Macaulay's fancy

  oyster-shells, which a maid one day threw away as rubbish.
  He went straight to the drawing-room, where his
  mother was entertaining some visitors, walked into the

    Unsightly though it be--
  In spite of all the cold world's scorn,
    It may be much to thee.

  Those eyes--among thine elder friends
    Perhaps they pass for blue;
  No matter--if a man can see,
    What more have eyes to do?
  Thy mouth--that fissure in thy face,
    By something like a chin,
  May be a very useful place
    To put thy victuals in.

  A lovely young lady I mourn in my rhymes:
  She was pleasant, good-natured, and civil sometimes.
  Her figure was good: she had very fine eyes,
  And her talk was a mixture of foolish and wise.
  Her adorers were many, and one of them said,
  "She waltzed rather well! It's a pity she's dead!"

  What the mischief do you suppose you want with a

  other localities, would not be likely to _get_ through, you
  must perceive at once; and that would make trouble for
  us all. No; don't bother about a post-office at your

  being considered a sort of time-server:
  "There goes Georgius," said some one. "Not Georgium
  Sidus?" replied Keeley. "Yes," added Power, "Georgium
  _Any_-sidus."

  I'm weary, and sick, and disgusted
    With Britain's mechanical din;
  Where I'm much too well known to be trusted,
    And plaguily pestered for tin;
  Where love has two eyes for your banker,
    And one chilly flame for yourself;
  Where souls can afford to be franker,
    But where they're well garnished with pelf.

  I'm sick of the whole race of poets,
    Emasculate, misty, and fine;
  They brew their small beer, and don't know its
    Distinction from full-bodied wine.
  I'm sick of the prosers, that house up
    At drowsy St. Stephen's--ain't you?
  I want some strong spirits to rouse up
    A good resolution or two!

  "On one occasion," said Brummell, "I called to
  inquire after a young lady who had sprained
  her ankle. Lewis, on being asked how she
  was, had said in the black's presence, 'The doctor has
  seen her, put her legs straight, and the poor chicken is
  doing well.' The servant, therefore, told me, with a very
  mysterious and knowing look, 'Oh, sir, the doctor has
  been here; she has laid eggs, and she and the chickens
  are doing well.'"

  A Scottish clergyman had some years since
  been cited before the Ecclesiastical Assembly
  at Edinburgh, to answer to a charge brought
  against him of great irreverence in religious matters, and
  Sir Walter [Scott] was employed by him to arrange his
  defence. The principal fact alleged against him was his
  having asserted, in a letter which was produced, that "he
  considered Pontius Pilate to be a very ill-used man, as
  he had done more for Christianity than all the other _nine
  Apostles_ put together." The fact was proved, and suspension
  followed.

  In Logic a woman may seldom excel;

  Fair Portia will show woman's talent for law,

  She could leave things to Nature as well as the best,

  Conscience, in most souls, is like an English

  We were sitting in the green-room one evening
  during the performance, chatting and laughing,
  she [Mrs. Nesbitt] having a book in her hand
  which she had to take on the stage with her in the next
  scene, when Brindal, a useful member of the company,

  to the door, and, leaning against it, in a sentimental
  manner drawled out,--
    "If to her share some female errors fall,
     Look in her face----"

  He paused. She raised her beautiful eyes to him, and

  It was known that Lord St. Jerome gave at his

  at his dinners, and that was of the highest class:
  in short, a patriot. We talk with wondering execration
  of the great poisoners of past ages, the Borgias, the
  inventor of Aqua tofana, and the amiable Marchioness
  de Brinvilliers; but Pinto was of opinion that there
  were more social poisoners about in the present day than
  in the darkest and most demoralized periods, and then
  none of them are punished; which is so strange, he
  would add, as they are all found out.

  First love is a pretty romance,
    But not half so sweet as 'tis reckoned;
  And when one wakes from the trance,
    There's a vast stock of bliss in the second.

  And e'en should a second subside,
    A lover should never despair;
  The world is uncommonly wide,
    And the women uncommonly fair.

  The poets their raptures may tell,

  A first love is all very well,
    But, believe me, the last love's the best.

  I've nothing to say again' her piety, my dear; but

  Good little girls ought not to make mouths at

  If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust,
  while one of your more fortunate little playmates

  would justify you in it, and you know you are able to
  do it.

  If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to

  dictates of your better judgment.

  Would it were wind and wave alone!
  The terrors of the torrid zone,
  The indiscriminate cyclone,
                  A man might parry;
  But only faith, or "triple brass,"
  Can help the "outward-bound" to pass
  Safe through that eastward-faring class
                  Who sail to marry.

  For him fond mothers, stout and fair,
  Ascend the tortuous cabin stair
  Only to hold around his chair
                  Insidious sessions;
  For him the eyes of daughters droop
  Across the plate of handed soup,
  Suggesting seats upon the poop,
                  And soft confessions.

  The authoress of the "Wild Irish Girl," Lady
  Morgan, justly proud of her gifted sister Olivia,
  was in the habit of addressing every new-comer
  with, "I must make you acquainted with my Livy." She
  once used this form of words to a gentleman who had
  just been worsted in an encounter of wits with the lady
  in question. "Yes, ma'am," was the reply; "I happen
  to know your _Livy_, and I would to Heaven your _Livy_
  was _Tacitus_."

  "Rise with the lark, and with the lark to bed,"
    Observes some solemn, sentimental owl;
  Maxims like these are very cheaply said;
    But e'er you make yourself a fool or fowl,
  Pray just inquire about his rise and fall,
  And whether larks have any bed at all!

  The "time for honest folks to be in bed"
    Is in the morning, if I reason right;
  And he who cannot keep his precious head
    Upon its pillow till it's fairly light,
  And so enjoy his forty morning winks,
  Is up to knavery; or else--he drinks!

  I've read the poets of our land,
    Who sing of beauty and of love,
  Who rave about a dimpled hand,
    And write sweet sonnets on a glove.
  But sweeter far than maiden's kiss,
    And fairer far than Jouvin's best,
  Is one red-labelled quart, I wis,
    With Bass's well-known mark imprest.

  And years may come, and years may go,
    And fortune change as fortune will,
  But may my Burton fountain flow,
    In shade and sunshine clearly still,

  The liquor that I sing to-day--
    My childhood's friend! my Bass's beer!

  Women are much more like each other than men;

  "After all, are not women necessary to your

  different modes of rendering us miserable."

  I love you! ay! it seems absurd,
    Altho' to prove it I was sedulous;
  The _ink_ is _black_ that writes the word,
    Yet you will read it all _inc-red_-ulous.
  Where was my sense, once so acute,
    To dream myself a hopeful suitor?
  I should have been much more _astute_;
    I came to you, you know, _as tutor_!
  My passion on an instant grew--
    (Spontaneous love is scarce a crime!).
  How swift those early minutes flew!
    And, _odd_ to say, 'twas _even_-time!
  Maddened with love, I penned a note,
    And placed it where 'twould catch your sight;
  Alas for me! but when I _wrote_,
  Of course I thought that I _did right_!

  There's one Thomas Buckle, a London youth,
      Who taught that the world was blind

  I heard an anecdote at Oxford, of a porter encountering
  on his rounds two undergraduates,
  who were without their gowns, or out of bounds,
  or out of hours. He challenged one: "Your name and

  pray, sir, what might your name be?" "Julius Caesar,"
  was the reply. "What, sir, do you mean to say your

  it is, but what it _might_ be."

  had passed, "They telt me, Admiral, that ye had

  replied, "Why, Bailie, I am getting on; I'm not so young
  as I was, you see, and none of the girls will have me."
  On which the Bailie, with perfect good faith and simplicity,
  replied, "'Deed, Admiral, I was na evenin' yer to

          Then her white hand I clasped,

  For, said he, of all evils that compass the globe,
  A bad wife would most try the patience of Job.
  The Best, then, he chose, and made bone of his bone,

  on him one day in his writing office, Sir Walter
  Scott said, "Why, Joseph, this place is as hot as
  an oven." "Well," quoth Gillon, "and isn't it here that
  I make my bread?"

  Forever! 'tis a single word!
    Our rude forefathers deem'd it two;
  Can you imagine so absurd
              A view?
  Forever! what abysms of woe
    The word reveals, what frenzy, what
  Despair! For ever (printed so)
              Did not.
  And nevermore must printer do
    As men did longago; but run
  "For" into "ever," bidding two
              Be one.
  Forever! passion-fraught, it throws
    O'er the dim page a gloom, a glamour:
  It's sweet, it's strange, and I suppose
              It's grammar.

  Walking down St. James's Street, Lord Chelmsford

  he passed on.

  To charm the girls he never spoke--
    Although his voice was fine;
  He found the most convenient way
    Was just to drop a line.

  And many a gudgeon of the pond,

  Would own, with grief, this angler had
    A mighty "taking" way.

  Money makes a man laugh. A blind fiddler
  playing to a company, and playing but scurvily,
  the company laughed at him. His boy that led
  him, perceiving it, cried, "Father, let us begone; they
  do nothing but laugh at you." "Hold peace, boy," said
  the fiddler; "we shall have their money presently, and
  then we will laugh at them."

  In candent ire the solar splendour flames;
  The foles, languescent, pend from arid rames;

  How dulce to vive occult from mortal eyes,
  Dorm on the herb with none to supervise,
  Carp the suave berries from the crescent vine,
  And bibe the flow from longicaudate kine!

  Me wretched! Let me curr to quercine shades!
  Effund your albid hausts, lactiferous maids!
  Oh, might I vole to some umbrageous clump,--
  Depart--be off--exude--evade--erump!

  He [Samuel Beazley] suffered considerably a short
  time before his decease, and, his usual spirits
  occasionally forsaking him, he one day wrote
  so melancholy a letter that the friend to whom it was
  addressed, observed, in his reply, that it was "like the
  first chapter of Jeremiah." "You are mistaken, my
  dear fellow," retorted the wit; "it is the last chapter of
  Samuel."

  No one can perceive, as I'm a sinner,
  A very marked improvement in the dinner.
  We still consume, with mingled shame and grief,
  Veal that is tottering on the verge of beef,
  Veal void of stuffing, widowed of its ham,
  Or the roast shoulder of an ancient ram.

  Upon the cabin stairs we met, the voyage nearly over;

  "Come here, my boy, hould up your head,
    And look like a jintleman, sir;
  Jist tell me who King Jonah was;
    Now tell me, if you can, sir."

  A little incident Charlotte Cushman once related
  to me. She said a man in the gallery of
  a theatre made such a disturbance that the play
  could not proceed. Cries of "Throw him over" arose
  from all parts of the house, and the noise became furious.
  All was tumultuous above until a sweet and gentle female
  voice was heard in the pit, exclaiming, "No! I pray
  you, don't throw him over! I beg of you, dear friends,
  don't throw him over, but--_kill him where he is_."

        J. T. FIELDS, _Yesterdays with Authors_.


  With all his conscience and one eye askew,
  So false, he partly took himself for true;
  Whose pious talk, when most his heart was dry,
  Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye;
  Who, never naming God except for gain,
  So never took that useful name in vain;
  Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool,
  And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool;
  Nor deeds of gift, but deeds of grace he forged,
  And snake-like slimed his victim ere he gorged;
  And oft at Bible meetings, o'er the rest
  Arising, did his holy oily best,
  Dropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven,
  To spread the Word by which himself had thriven.

  The cup with trembling hands he grasps,
  Close to his thirsty lips he clasps,

  [Dr. Busby] was once invited, during a residence at
  Deal, by an old Westminster--who, from being
  a very idle, well-flogged boy, had, after a course
  of distinguished service, been named to the command
  of a fine frigate in the Downs--to visit him on board
  his ship. The doctor accepted the invitation; and,
  after he had got up the ship's side, the captain piped all
  hands for punishment, and said to the astonished doctor,
  "You d--d old scoundrel, I am delighted to have the
  opportunity of paying you off at last. Here, boatswain,
  give him three dozen."

  _GOOD AND BAD LUCK._

  Good Luck is the gayest of all gay girls;
    Long in one place she will not stay:
  Back from your brow she strokes the curls,
    Kisses you quick and flies away.

  But Madame Bad Luck soberly comes
    And stays--no fancy has she for flitting--
  Snatches of true-love songs she hums,
    And sits by your bed, and brings her knitting.

  Why, the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding,

  Tell me, in this night of snow,
  Of happy Almack's, or the Row!
  Say in what carriages what fair
  Consume the ice in Berkeley Square;

  Explore the silks they never buy;
  And how the hair is dressed in town,
  And what the shape of boot and gown?

  Snow-mantled shadow, would you know
  The fashions of the world below?
  Still the coiled chignon starward towers,
  Still false back-hair falls down in showers;
  But now all subtle souls revert
  To the abbreviated skirt,
  Whose velvet _paniers_ just denote
  The gown, that else were petticoat.
  Nor is such _naive_ attire enough:
  Elizabeth's archaic ruff
  Rings every neck; besides, they rival,
  With a High-Gothic-Hat-Revival,
  Old Mother Hubbard, and renew
  Arcadianly the buckled shoe,
  To show, what's just a trifle shocking,
  The dimple of a snowy stocking.

  I hope I appreciate the value of children. We
  should soon come to nothing without them.
  Without them the common school would languish.
  But the problem is, what to do with them in a
  garden. For they are not good to eat, and there is a law
  against making away with them. The law is not very
  well enforced, it is true; for people do thin them out
  with constant dosing, paregoric, and soothing-syrups, and
  scanty clothing. But I, for one, feel it would not be
  right, aside from the law, to take the life, even of the
  smallest child, for the sake of a little fruit, more or less,
  in the garden. I may be wrong; but these are my sentiments,
  and I am not ashamed of them.

  Shortly before his death, being visited by a

  Of Diggle, Barham used to tell many absurd stories.
  The most amusing of his practical jokes was one
  in which Barham had a share. The two boys
  having, in the course of one of their walks, discovered a
  Quakers' meeting-house, forthwith procured a penny tart
  of a neighbouring pastry-cook; furnished with this,
  Diggle marched boldly into the building, and, holding up
  the delicacy in the midst of the grave assembly, said with
  perfect solemnity, "Whoever speaks first shall have this
  pie." "Friend, go thy way," commenced a drab-coloured
  gentleman, rising, "go thy way, and----" "The pie's
  yours, sir!" exclaimed Master Diggle, politely, and
  placing it before the astounded speaker, hastily effected
  his escape.

  Brigham Young has two hundred wives. He
  loves not wisely, but two hundred well. He's

  I ever saw in my life. He says that all he wants now is
  to live in peace for the remainder of his days, and have
  his dying pillow soothed by the loving hands of his
  family. Well, that's all right, I suppose; but if all his
  family soothe his dying pillow, he'll have to go out-doors
  to die.

  When first my old, old love I knew,
    My bosom swelled with joy;
  My riches at her feet I threw,--
    I was a love-sick boy!
  No terms seemed too extravagant
    Upon her to employ--
  I used to mope, and sigh, and pant,
    Just like a love-sick boy!

  But joy incessant palls the sense,
    And love, unchanged, will cloy,
  And she became a bore intense
    Unto her love-sick boy!
  With fitful glimmer burnt my flame,
    And I grew cold and coy,
  At last, one morning, I became
    Another's love-sick boy!

    Have got me into messes;
  I've seen the sky through prison bars,

    My face, nor care a stiver;
  For trades are brisk and trades are slow,
    But mine goes on for ever.

  Virginia city--the wild young metropolis of the

  A clergyman had commenced an able discourse,
  when one of the hearers exclaimed,
  "That's Tillotson!" This was allowed to pass;
  but very soon another exclamation followed, "That's
  Paley." The preacher then addressed the disturber: "I
  tell you, sir, if there is to be a repetition of such conduct,
  I shall call on the churchwarden to have you removed
  from the church." "That's your own," was the ready
  reply.

  Werther had a love for Charlotte
    Such as words could never utter;
  Would you know how first he met her?
    She was cutting bread and butter.

  So he sighed and pined and ogled,
    And his passion boiled and bubbled,
  Till he blew his silly brains out,
    And no more was by it troubled.

  Charlotte, having seen his body
    Borne before her on a shutter,
  Like a well-conducted person,
    Went on cutting bread and butter.

  Perhaps the best illustration I can give of
  [Bagehot's] more sardonic humour, was his
  remark to a friend who had a church on the

  "Yes, my dear curate," said the Professor, "what
  I am enjoying is the champagne that you
  drink, and what you are enjoying is the champagne
  that I drink. This is altruism; this is benevolence;
  this is the sublime outcome of enlightened
  modern thought. The pleasures of the table, in themselves,
  are low and beastly ones; but if we each of us
  are only glad because the others are enjoying them, they
  become holy and glorious beyond description."

  do. I will drink another bottle for your sake."

  Lettuce is like conversation; it must be fresh,
  and crisp, so sparkling that you scarcely notice
  the bitter in it. Lettuce, like conversation,
  requires a good deal of oil, to avoid friction, and

  dash of pepper; a quantity of mustard and vinegar, by
  all means, but so mixed that you will notice no sharp
  contrasts; and a trifle of sugar.

  Shut up a party who uses "Reliable"
  When he means "Trustworthy;" 'tis undeniable
  That his excuses are flimsy and friable,
  And his conceptions of grammar most pliable.
  No doubt he'd pronounce this line's last word "enviable:"
  Invent, for bad fish (which he'd sell) the word "criable,"
  Say that his faded silk hat might be dyeable,
  And accent French vilely--allude to _le diable_.

  It's the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever

  It's a story got up, because the women

  I tell you there isn't a thing under the sun that needs to

  And filled with such books as could never be read
  Save by readers of proofs, forced to do it for bread,--
  Such books as one's wrecked on in small country taverns,
  Such as hermits might mortify over in caverns,
  Such as Satan, if printing had then been invented,
  As a climax of woe, would to Jove have presented,
  Such as Crusoe might dip in, although there are few so
  Outrageously cornered by fate as poor Crusoe.

  Home they brought her sailor son,
    Grown a man across the sea,
  Tall and broad and black of beard,
    And hoarse of voice as man may be.

  Hand to shake and mouth to kiss,
    Both he offered ere he spoke;
  And she said--"What man is this

  Lord Allen, being rather the worse for drinking
  too much wine at dinner, teased Count D'Orsay,
  and said some very disagreeable things, which
  irritated him; when suddenly John Bush entered the

  "Voila, la difference entre une bonne _bouche_ et une mauvaise
  _haleine_."

  When lovely woman, Lump of Folly,
    Would show the world her vainest trait;
  Would treat herself as child her dolly,
    And warn each man of sense away;
  The surest method she'll discover
    To prompt a wink from every eye,
  Degrade a spouse, disgust a lover,
    And spoil a scalp-skin, is--to dye.

  The bean is a graceful, confiding, engaging vine;
  but you can never put beans into poetry, nor
  into the highest sort of prose. Corn is the child
  of song. It waves in all literature. But mix it with
  beans, and its high tone is gone. The bean is a vulgar
  vegetable, without culture, or any flavour of high society
  among vegetables.

  As a boy, George Washington gave no promise of
  the greatness he was one day to achieve. He
  was ignorant of the commonest accomplishments
  of youth. He could not even lie. But then he
  never had any of those precious advantages which are
  within the reach of the humblest of the boys of the
  present day. Any boy can lie now. I could lie before
  I could stand.

  Don't you see a hint of marriage
    In his sober-sided face,
  In his rather careless carriage
    And extremely rapid pace?

  If he's not committed treason,
    Or some wicked action done,
  Can you see the faintest reason
    Why a bachelor should run?

  Why should he be in a flurry?
    But a loving wife to greet,
  Is a circumstance to hurry
    The most dignified of feet!

  "Gentle, modest little flower,

  Love me but for half an hour,
    Love me, love me, little fay."
  Sentences so swiftly flaming
    In your tiny shell-like ear,
  I should always be exclaiming
    If I loved you, Phoebe dear:

  "Smiles that thrill from any distance
    Shed upon me while I sing!
  Please ecstaticize existence,
    Love me, oh thou, fairy thing!"
  Words like these outpouring sadly
    You'd perpetually hear,
  If I loved you fondly, madly;--
    But I do not, Phoebe dear.

  On one occasion, when Power the actor was

  I dreamed that somebody was dead. It was a
  private gentleman, and a particular friend; and
  I was greatly overcome when the news was
  broken to me (very delicately) by a gentleman in a
  cocked hat, top boots, and a sheet. Nothing else.
  "Good God!" I said, "is he dead?" "He is as dead,
  sir," rejoined the gentleman, "as a door nail. But we
  must all die, Mr. Dickens, sooner or later, my dear sir."
  "Ah!" I said; "yes, to be sure. Very true. But
  what did he die of?" The gentleman burst into a flood
  of tears, and said, in a voice broken by emotion, "He
  christened his youngest child, sir, with a toasting fork!"

  The late Bishop of Exeter and Baron Alderson

  After the usual toasts had been drunk, the

  and not having heard the toast distinctly, got up. On
  which the late bishop whispered to Baron Alderson,
  "What is Campbell about? What is he returning thanks

  Thy winds and rains for ever are at strife;
  Like thee the termagants their blustering try,
  And, when they can no longer scold, they cry.

        AARON HILL (1685-1750).


  Went with Lamb to Richman's. Richman produced
  one of Chatterton's forgeries. In one
  manuscript there were seventeen different kinds
  of e's. "Oh," said Lamb, "that must have been written
  by one of the--
      'Mob of gentlemen who write with _ease_.'"

  To have a thing is little, if you're not allowed to show it,
  And to know a thing is nothing, unless others know you know it.

        LORD NEAVES.


  You're at an evening party, with
    A group of pleasant folks,--
  You venture quietly to crack
    The least of little jokes,--
  A lady doesn't catch the point,
    And begs you to explain,--
  Alas! for one who drops a jest
    And takes it up again!

  You drop a pretty _jeu-de-mot_
    Into a neighbour's ears,
  Who likes to give you credit for
    The clever things he hears;
  And so he hawks your jest about,
    The old, authentic one,
  Just breaking off the point of it,
    And leaving out the pun!

        JOHN GODFREY SAXE, _Poems_.


  [Montrond's] death was a very wretched one.
  Left alone to the tender mercies of a well-known
  "lorette" of those days, Desiree R----,
  as he lay upon his bed, between fits of pain and drowsiness,
  he could see his fair friend picking from his shelves
  the choicest specimens of his old Sevres china, or other
  articles of _vertu_. Turning to his doctor, he said, with a
  gleam of his old fun, "Qu'elle est attachante, cette
  femme-la!"

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  We love thee, Ann Maria Smith,
    And in thy condescension
  We see a future full of joys
    Too numerous to mention.

  There's Cupid's arrow in thy glance,
    That by thy love's coercion
  Has reached our melting heart of hearts,
    And asked for one insertion.

  There's music in thy honest tone,
    And silver in thy laughter;
  And truth--but we will give the full
    Particulars hereafter.

  "Of course you know the three reasons which take
  men into society in London?" I said, after a
  pause.

  "No, I don't. What are they?"

  "Either to find a wife, or to look after one's wife, or
  to look after somebody else's."

        L. OLIPHANT, _Piccadilly_.


  _ON ONE WHO HAD A LARGE NOSE AND SQUINTED._

  The reason why Doctor Dash squints, I suppose,

  _ON THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES._

  Sturdy Tom Paine, biographers relate,
  Once with his friends engaged in warm debate.
  Said they, "Minorities are always right;"
  Said he, "The truth is just the opposite."
  Finding them stubborn, "Frankly, now," said he,
  "In this opinion do ye all agree;
  All, every one, without exception?" When
  They thus affirmed unanimously, "Then,
  Correct," said he, "my sentiment must be,
  For I myself am the minority."

  When the enterprising burglar's not a-burgling,
    When the cut-throat isn't occupied with crime
  He loves to hear the little brook a-gurgling,
    And listen to the merry village chime.
  When the coster's finished jumping on his mother,
    He loves to lie a-basking in the sun--
  Oh! take one consideration with another,
    The policeman's lot is not a happy one!

  The young girl said: "The gentleman must be very

  a similar manner: "The man must be very
  learned, for he is very tiresome."

  And he chirped and sang, and skipped about, and
    laughed with laughter hearty,
  He was so wonderfully active for so very stout
    a party.

  And I said, "O gentle pie-man, why so very, very merry?
  Is it purity of conscience, or your one-and-seven sherry?"

  He remembers the ball at the Ferry,
   And the ride, and the gate, and the vow,
  And the rose that you gave him--that very
    Same rose he is treasuring now
  (Which his blanket he's kicked on his trunk, Miss,
    And insists on his legs being free;
  And his language to me from his bunk, Miss,
    Is frequent and painful and free).

  _FRENCH AND ENGLISH._

  The French excel us very much in millinery;
  They also bear the bell in matters culinary.
  The reason's plain: French beauty and French meat
  With English cannot of themselves compete.
  Thus, an inferior article possessing,
  Our neighbours help it by superior dressing;
  They dress their dishes, and they dress their dames,
  Till Art, almost, can rival Nature's claims.

  The then Duke of Cumberland (the foolish Duke,
  as he was called) came one night into Foote's
  green-room at the Haymarket Theatre. "Well,

  your good things." "Upon my soul," replied Foote,
  "your Royal Highness must have an excellent digestion,
  for you never bring any up again."

  Examining one of the Sunday school boys at
  Addington, I asked him what a prophet was.
  He did not know. "If I were to tell you what
  would happen to you this day twelve month, and it should
  come to pass, what would you call me then, my little
  man?" "A fortune-teller, sir."

  [Donne] was asked to write a motto for the

  Critics tell me, soon
  There'll be no singing in a song,
    No melody in tune.
  But birds will warble in the trees,

    We yet may find some air.

  Mr. Bentley proposed to establish a periodical
  publication, to be called "The Wits' Miscellany."
  [James] Smith objected that the title promised
  too much. Shortly afterwards the publisher came to
  tell him he had profited by the hint, and resolved to call
  it "Bentley's Miscellany." "Isn't that going a little too
  far the other way?" was the remark.

  Break, break, break!

  It is well for the china-shop man
    Who gets a fresh order each day;
  And it's deucedly well for yourself,
    Who are in the said china-man's pay.

  And my stately vases go
    To your uncle's, I ween, to be cashed;
  And it's oh for the light of my broken lamp,
    And the tick of my clock that is smashed.

  Break, break, break!
    At the foot of my stairs in glee;
  But the coin I have spent in glass that is cracked
    Will never come back to me.

  Croly said very smart things, and with surprising
  readiness. I was at his table one day when one
  of the guests inquired the name of a pyramidal

  "To give a _Philip_ to the appetite," said Croly.

  Mrs. Posh was one of those incomparable wives
  who have a proper command of tongue, who
  never reply to angry words at the moment, and

  off every angry word by an amiable sting at the right
  moment.

  When last the Queen was about to be confined,
  the Prince Consort said to one of his little boys,
  "I think it very likely, my dear, that the Queen

  I think, if it is all the same to mamma, I should
  prefer a pony."

  Follow the light of the old-fashioned Presbyterians
  that I've heard sing at Glasgow. The
  preacher gives out the Psalm, and then everybody
  sings a different tune, as it happens to turn up in
  their throats. It's a domineering thing to set a tune
  and expect everybody else to follow it. It's a denial of
  private judgment.

  shown a picture of Joseph and Potiphar's wife,

  _THE LATEST DECALOGUE._

  Thou shalt have one God only: who
  Would be at the expense of two?
  No graven images may be
  Worshipped, except the currency:
  Swear not at all; for, for thy curse,
  Thine enemy is none the worse:
  At church on Sunday to attend
  Will serve to keep the world thy friend:
  Honour thy parents; that is, all
  From whom advancement may befall:
  Thou shalt not kill; but needst not strive
  Officiously to keep alive:
  Do not adultery commit;
  Advantage rarely comes of it:
  Thou shalt not steal; an empty feat,
  When it's so lucrative to cheat:
  Bear not false witness; let the lie
  Have time on its own wings to fly:
  Thou shalt not covet, but tradition
  Approves all forms of competition.

  Mr. MacCulloch, the eminent political
  economist, in dining with us, a few days after
  [an aeronautical friend had made an ascent],
  was most anxious to learn where he had descended
  on this occasion. The answer was, "Amongst the flats
  of Essex." "A most appropriate locality," said my
  distinguished countryman, "and one which shows how
  true it is that 'birds of a feather flock together.'"

  He said that I was proud, mother,--that I looked for rank and gold;
  He said I did not love him,--he said my words were cold;
  He said I kept him off and on, in hopes of higher game,--
  And it may be that I did, mother; but who hasn't done the same?

  You may lay me in my bed, mother,--my head is throbbing sore;
  And, mother, prithee, let the sheets be duly aired before;
  And if you'd do a kindness to your poor desponding child,
  Draw me a pot of beer, mother--and, mother, draw it mild!

  Why mourns my Eugene? In his dark eye of blue
  Why trembles the tear-drop to sympathy due?
  Ah, why must a bosom so pure and refin'd

    Where woods are a-tremble, with rifts atween;

  Thro' God's own heather we wonn'd together,
    I and my Willie (O love, my love!):
  I need hardly remark it was glorious weather,
    And flitter-bats waver'd alow, above.

  Boats were curtsying, rising, bowing
    (Boats in that climate are so polite),
  And sands were a ribbon of green endowing,
    And O the sun-dazzle on bark and bight.

  Thro' the rare red heather we danced together,
    (O love, my Willie!) and smelt for flowers:
  I must mention again it was glorious weather,
    Rhymes are so scarce in this world of ours.

  'Tis ridiculous for a lord to print verses. It is well

  a bandstring, or play with a rush, then all the boys in

    Their song is everywhere--
  Their notes are lovely (though they're out
    So often in the air).

  The zephyr, dancing through the tops
    Of ash and poplar, weaves
  Low melodies, and scarcely stops

  It was a grand scene, Mr. Artemus Ward standing
  on the platform; many of the audience sleeping
  tranquilly in their seats; others leaving the
  room and not returning; others crying like a child at
  some of the jokes,--all, all formed a most impressive scene,
  and showed the powers of this remarkable orator. And
  when he announced that he should never lecture in that
  town again, the applause was absolutely deafening.

  _THE REASONS FOR DRINKING._

  If all be true that I do think,
  There are five reasons we should drink:
  Good wine; a friend; or being dry;
  Or lest we should be by-and-by;
  Or any other reason why.

  [Barham] having expressed himself in terms of
  abhorrence of a piece of baseness and treachery
  which came under his notice, he was addressed
  by the delinquent with--"Well, sir, perhaps some day
  you may come to change your opinion of me!" "Perhaps
  I may, sir," was the reply; "for if I should find
  any one who holds a more contemptible opinion of you
  than I do myself, I should lay down my own and take up
  his."

  I'm told that virgins augur some

  On one occasion the late Lady Holland took
  [Luttrell] a drive in her carriage over a rough
  road; and as she was very nervous, she insisted
  on being driven at a foot's pace. This ordeal lasted
  some hours, and when he was at last released, poor
  Luttrell, perfectly exasperated, rushed into the nearest
  club-house, and exclaimed, clenching his teeth and
  hands, "The very funerals passed us!"

  Perchance it was her eyes of blue,
    Her cheeks that might the rose have shamed,
  Her figure in proportion true
    To all the rules by artists framed;

  Perhaps her name, or wealth, or birth,--
    I cannot tell--I do not know.

  He may have had a rival, who

  Left _him_ despairing, conquer'd, spurned,--
    I cannot tell--I do not know.

  It is of no use to tell a neighbour that his hens
  eat your tomatoes: it makes no impression on
  him, for the tomatoes are not his. The best
  way is to casually remark to him that he has a fine lot of
  chickens, pretty well grown, and that you like spring
  chickens broiled. He will take them away at once.

  Charles Kemble used to tell a story about
  some poor foreigner, dancer or pantomimist in
  the country, who, after many annual attempts
  to clear his expenses, came forward one evening with a
  face beaming with pleasure and gratitude, and addressed
  the audience in these words:--"Dear Public! moche
  oblige. Ver good benefice--only lose half-a-crown. I
  come again!"

  "Let's show," said M'Clan, "to this Sassenach loon
  That the bag-pipes _can_ play him a regular tune.

  "'In my Cottage' is easy--I'll practise at that."

  He blew at his "Cottage," and blew with a will,
  For a year, seven months, and a fortnight, until
  (You'll hardly believe it) M'Clan, I declare,
  Elicited something resembling an air.

  It was wild--it was fitful--as wild as the breeze--
  It wandered about into several keys;
  It was jerky, spasmodic, and harsh, I'm aware;
  But still it distinctly suggested an air.

  At the Duke of Wellington's funeral, the little child
  of a friend of mine was standing with her mother
  at Lord Ashburton's window to see the mournful
  pageant. During the passage of the procession, she
  made no remark until the duke's horse was led by, its

  when she looked up in her mother's face and said,
  "Mamma, when we die, will there be nothing left of us
  but boots?"

  "I mean what I say," the Mock Turtle replied, in an

  O how unlike our shores,
  Where with ten thousand tongues each city roars!
  There to all men, whate'er their age or walk,
  Life's one great solemn business is to talk.
  There what the penny press by morning write
  Is echoed for a halfpenny at night:
  There stump young Ministers; old Maids debate;
  There loud Professors scold like Billingsgate:
  There, as the World into the Church expands,
  A moral Atheist spouts in parson's bands;
  And poets, doubtful of the parts of speech,
  Desperate of rhyme, acquire the art to preach.

  You are a woman; you must never speak what

  you are handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter
  you; and you must think yourself more charming than

  Now brim your glass, and plant it well

  The sacred slow harmonium bring,
    The gentler pianette,
  The cymbals, with sonorous ring,
    The dulcet flageolet.

  Nor be the voice of glory dumb,
    Of conquest and of strife,
  Bring forth the stirring trump and drum,
    The shrill and piercing fife.

  Ay, bring them all, my soul with glee

  Bring all--for all are one to me,--

  We sometimes hate those who differ from us in
  opinion worse than we should for an attempt to
  injure us in the most serious point. A favourite
  theory is a possession for life; and we resent any attack
  upon it proportionably.

        W. HAZLITT, _Characteristics_.


  When Mrs. M'Gibbon was preparing to act Jane
  Shore, at Liverpool, her dresser, an ignorant
  country girl, informed her that a woman had
  called to request two box orders, because she and her
  daughter had walked four miles on purpose to see the
  play. "Does she know me?" inquired the mistress.
  "Not at all," was the reply. "What a very odd request!"
  exclaimed Mrs. M'G. "Has the good woman got her
  faculties about her?" "I think she have, ma'am, for I
  see she ha' got summut tied up in a red silk handkercher."

  I shouldn't like to be a man--to cough so
  loud, and stand straddling about on a wet day,
  and be so wasteful with meat and drink. They're
  a coarse lot, I think.

        _Denner_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Felix Holt_.


  Once the mastodon was: pterodactyls were common as cocks:
  Then the Mammoth was God: now is He a prize ox.

  Parallels all things are: yet many of these are askew:
  You are certainly I: but certainly I am not you.

  Springs the rock from the plain, shoots the stream from the rock:
  Cocks exist for the hen: but hens exist for the cock.

  God, whom we see not, is: and God, who is not, we see:

  I've studied human nature, and I know a thing or two;
  Though a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many do:
  A feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall
  When she looks upon his body chopped particularly small.

        W. S. GILBERT, _Bab Ballads_.


  The Bishop of Exeter, in the course of conversation
  at a dinner-party, mentioned that many
  years since, while trout-fishing, he lost his watch
  and chain, which he supposed had been pulled from his
  pocket by the bough of a tree. Some time afterwards,
  when staying in the same neighbourhood, he took a
  stroll by the side of the river, and came to the secluded
  spot where he supposed he had lost his valuables, and
  there, to his surprise and delight, he found them under a
  bush. The anecdote, vouched for by the word of a
  bishop, astonished the company; but this was changed
  to amusement by his son's inquiring whether the watch,
  when found, was going. "No," replied the bishop;
  "the wonder was that it was not gone."

  Fortune, they say, doth give too much to many:
  And yet she never gave enough to any.

        SIR JOHN HARYNGTON (1561-1612).


  I do not speak of this mole in any tone of complaint.
  I desire to write nothing against him
  which I should wish to recall at the last,--nothing
  foreign to the spirit of that beautiful saying of
  the dying boy, "He had no copybook, which, dying, he
  was sorry he had blotted."

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  Know, then, that when that touching scene
   Had reached its tenderest pitch,
  When all was pathos, calm, serene,
    _His nose began to itch_.

  'Twas sad, but so it came to pass,
    The knight might chafe and frown,
  But could not reach it, for alas!
    _He wore his vizor down_.

        _Songs of Singularity._


  I remember asking [Bagehot] if he had enjoyed
  a particular dinner which he had rather expected
  to enjoy, but he replied, "No, the sherry was
  bad; tasted as if L---- had dropped his h's into it."

        W. H. HARRISON, _University Magazine_.


  Always seem to be modest and bashful, yet wise;
  Remember the value of using your eyes;
  Recollect, too, that money's not easily met,
  And always accept every offer you get;
  Be polite to all--grandmammas, sisters, and mothers,
  For they've all of them grandsons, or own sons or brothers;
  And never forget the chief object in life
  Is to quickly be settled--a well-to-do wife.

  In a conversation which happened to turn on railway

  And day again declines;
  In shadow sleep the vines,
  And the last ray thro' the pines
          Feebly glows,
  Then sinks behind yon ridge;
  And the usual evening midge
  Is settling on the bridge
          Of my nose.

  And keen's the air and cold,
  And the sheep are in the fold,
  And Night walks stable-stoled
          Thro' the trees;
  And on the silent river
  The floating star-beams quiver;--
  And now, the saints deliver
          Us from fleas.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Verses and Translations_.


  Tommy Townshend, a violent, foolish fellow,
  who was always talking strong language, said in
  some debate, "Nothing will satisfy me but to
  have the noble Lord [North]'s head; I will have his
  head." Lord North said, "The honourable gentleman
  says he will have my head. I bear him no malice in
  return, for though the honourable gentleman says he will
  have my head, I can assure him I would on no account
  have his."

  Said the Gryphon, "Do you know why it's called
  a whiting?"

  "I never thought about it," said Alice.
  "Why?"

  "_It does the boots and shoes_," the Gryphon replied
  very solemnly.

  Alice was thoroughly puzzled. "Does the boots and
  shoes?" she repeated in a wondering tone.

  "Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?" said the
  Gryphon. "I mean, what makes them so shiny?"

  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little
  before she gave her answer. "They're done with blacking,
  I believe."

  "Boots and shoes under the sea," the Gryphon went
  on in a deep voice, "are done with whiting. Now you
  know."

  Ask me no more: I've had enough Chablis;
      The wine may come again, and take the shape,
      From glass to glass, of "Mountain" or of "Cape;"
  But, my dear boy, when I have answered thee,
                                      Ask me no more.

  Ask me no more: what answer should I give?
      I love not pickled pork nor partridge pie;
      I feel if I took whisky I should die;
  Ask me no more--for I prefer to live:
                                      Ask me no more.

  Ask me no more: unless my fate is sealed,
      And I have striven against you all in vain:
      Let your good butler bring me Hock again:
  Then rest, dear boy. If for this once I yield,

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
