Book 43 John

001:001 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
        and the Word was God.

001:002 He was in the beginning with God.

001:003 All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him
        nothing that exists came into being.

001:004 In Him was Life, and that Life was the Light of men.

001:005 The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has
        not overpowered it.

001:006 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

001:007 He came as a witness, in order that he might give testimony
        concerning the Light--so that all might believe through him.

001:008 He was not the Light, but he existed that he might give
        testimony concerning the Light.

001:009 The true Light was that which illumines every man by its coming
        into the world.

001:010 He was in the world, and the world came into existence through Him,
        and the world did not recognize Him.

001:011 He came to the things that were His own, and His own people
        gave Him no welcome.

001:012 But all who have received Him, to them--that is, to those who
        trust in His name--He has given the privilege of becoming
        children of God;

001:013 who were begotten as such not by human descent, nor through
        an impulse of their own nature, nor through the will of a
        human father, but from God.

001:014 And the Word came in the flesh, and lived for a time in our midst,
        so that we saw His glory--the glory as of the Father's only Son,
        sent from His presence.  He was full of grace and truth.

001:015 John gave testimony concerning Him and cried aloud, saying,
        "This is He of whom I said, `He who is coming after me has
        been put before me,' for He was before me."

001:016 For He it is from whose fulness we have all received,
        and grace upon grace.

001:017 For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came
        through Jesus Christ.

001:018 No human eye has ever seen God:  the only Son, who is in
        the Father's bosom--He has made Him known.

001:019 This also is John's testimony, when the Jews sent to him
        a deputation of Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
        him who he was.

001:020 He avowed--he did not conceal the truth, but avowed, "I am
        not the Christ."

001:021 "What then?" they inquired; "are you Elijah?"  "I am not," he said.
        "Are you the Prophet?"  "No," he answered.

001:022 So they pressed the question.  "Who are you?"
        they said--"that we may take an answer to those who sent us.
        What account do you give of yourself?"

001:023 "I am the voice," he replied, "of one crying aloud,
        `Make straight the Lord's way in the Desert,' fulfilling the words
        of the Prophet Isaiah."

001:024 They were Pharisees who had been sent.

001:025 Again they questioned him.  "Why then do you baptize," they said,
        "if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?"

001:026 "I baptize in water only," John answered, "but in your midst
        stands One whom you do not know--

001:027 He who is to come after me, and whose sandal-strap I am not
        worthy to unfasten."

001:028 This conversation took place at Bethany beyond the Jordan,
        where John was baptizing.

001:029 The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and exclaimed,
        "Look, that is the Lamb of God who is to take away the sin
        of the world!

001:030 This is He about whom I said, `After me is to come One who has
        been put before me, because He was before me.'

001:031 I did not yet know Him; but that He may be openly shown to Israel
        is the reason why I have come baptizing in water."

001:032 John also gave testimony by stating:  "I have seen the Spirit
        coming down like a dove out of Heaven; and it remained upon Him.

001:033 I did not yet know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water
        said to me, "`The One on whom you see the Spirit coming down,
        and remaining, He it is who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'

001:034 "This I have seen, and I have become a witness that He is
        the Son of God."

001:035 Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,

001:036 when he saw Jesus passing by, and said, "Look! that is
        the Lamb of God!"

001:037 The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.

001:038 Then Jesus turned round, and seeing them following He asked them,
        "What is your wish?"  "Rabbi," they replied--`Rabbi'
        means `Teacher'--"where are you staying?"

001:039 "Come and you shall see," He said.  So they went and saw where He
        was staying, and they remained and spent that day with Him.
        It was then about ten o'clock in the morning.

001:040 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard
        John's exclamation and followed Jesus.

001:041 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him,
        "We have found the Messiah!"--that is to say, the Anointed One.

001:042 He brought him to Jesus.  Jesus looked at him and said,
        "You are Simon, son of John:  you shall be called Cephas"--
        that is to say, Peter (or `Rock').

001:043 The next day, having decided to leave Bethany and go
        into Galilee, Jesus found Philip, and invited him to follow Him.

001:044 (Now Philip came from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.)

001:045 Then Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have
        found him about whom Moses in the Law wrote, as well as
        the Prophets--Jesus, the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth."

001:046 "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" replied Nathanael.
        "Come and see," said Philip.

001:047 Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, and said of him, "Look! here
        is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceitfulness!"

001:048 "How do you know me?"  Nathanael asked.  "Before Philip called you,"
        said Jesus, "when you were under the fig-tree I saw you."

001:049 "Rabbi," cried Nathanael, "you are the Son of God,
        you are Israel's King!"

001:050 "Because I said to you, `I saw you under the fig-tree,'"
        replied Jesus, "do you believe?  You shall see greater
        things than that."

001:051 "I tell you all in most solemn truth," He added, "that you
        shall see Heaven opened wide, and God's angels going up,
        and coming down to the Son of Man."

002:001 Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee,
        and the mother of Jesus was there,

002:002 and Jesus also was invited and His disciples.

002:003 Now the wine ran short; whereupon the mother of Jesus said
        to Him, "They have no wine."

002:004 "Leave the matter in my hands," He replied; "the time for me
        to act has not yet come."

002:005 His mother said to the attendants, "Whatever he tells you
        to do, do it."

002:006 Now there were six stone jars standing there (in accordance
        with the Jewish regulations for purification), each large
        enough to hold twenty gallons or more.

002:007 Jesus said to the attendants, "Fill the jars with water."
        And they filled them to the brim.

002:008 Then He said, "Now, take some out, and carry it to the President
        of the feast."

002:009 So they carried some to him.  And no sooner had the President
        tasted the water now turned into wine, than--not knowing where it
        came from, though the attendants who had drawn the water knew--
        he called to the bridegroom

002:010 and said to him, "It is usual to put on the good wine first,
        and when people have drunk freely, then that which is inferior.
        But you have kept the good wine till now."

002:011 This, the first of His miracles, Jesus performed at Cana
        in Galilee, and thus displayed His glorious power; and His
        disciples believed in Him.

002:012 Afterwards He went down to Capernaum--He, and His mother,
        and His brothers, and His disciples; and they made a
        short stay there.

002:013 But the Jewish Passover was approaching, and for this Jesus
        went up to Jerusalem.

002:014 And He found in the Temple the dealers in cattle and sheep
        and in pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.

002:015 So He plaited a whip of rushes, and drove all--both sheep
        and bullocks--out of the Temple.  The small coin of the brokers
        He upset on the ground and overturned their tables.

002:016 And to the pigeon-dealers He said, "Take these things away.
        Do not turn my Father's house into a market."

002:017 This recalled to His disciples the words of Scripture, "My zeal
        for Thy House will consume me."

002:018 So the Jews asked Him, "What proof of your authority do you
        exhibit to us, seeing that you do these things?"

002:019 "Demolish this Sanctuary," said Jesus, "and in three days I
        will rebuild it."

002:020 "It has taken forty-six years," replied the Jews, "to build
        this Sanctuary, and will you rebuild it in three days?"

002:021 But He was speaking of the Sanctuary of His body.

002:022 When however He had risen from among the dead, His disciples
        recollected that He had said this; and they believed
        the Scripture and the teaching which Jesus had given them.

002:023 Now when He was in Jerusalem, at the Festival of the Passover,
        many became believers in Him through watching the miracles
        He performed.

002:024 But for His part, Jesus did not trust Himself to them,
        because He knew them all,

002:025 and did not need any one's testimony concerning a man,
        for He of Himself knew what was in the man.

003:001 Now there was one of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus--
        a ruler among the Jews.

003:002 He came to Jesus by night and said, "Rabbi, we know that you
        are a teacher from God; for no one can do these miracles
        which you are doing, unless God is with him.

003:003 "In most solemn truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that unless
        a man is born anew he cannot see the Kingdom of God."

003:004 "How is it possible," Nicodemus asked, "for a man to be born
        when he is old?  Can he a second time enter his mother's womb
        and be born?"

003:005 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that unless
        a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter
        the Kingdom of God.

003:006 Whatever has been born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever
        has been born of the Spirit is spirit.

003:007 Do not be astonished at my telling you, `You must all
        be born anew.'

003:008 The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear its sound,
        but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going.
        So is it with every one who has been born of the Spirit."

003:009 "How is all this possible?" asked Nicodemus.

003:010 "Are you," replied Jesus, "`the Teacher of Israel,' and yet
        do you not understand these things?

003:011 In most solemn truth I tell you that we speak what we know,
        and give testimony of that of which we were eye-witnesses,
        and yet you all reject our testimony.

003:012 If I have told you earthly things and none of you believe me,
        how will you believe me if I tell you of things in Heaven?

003:013 There is no one who has gone up to Heaven, but there is One
        who has come down from Heaven, namely the Son of Man whose
        home is in Heaven.

003:014 And just as Moses lifted high the serpent in the Desert,
        so must the Son of Man be lifted up,

003:015 in order that every one who trusts in Him may have the Life
        of the Ages."

003:016 For so greatly did God love the world that He gave His only Son,
        that every one who trusts in Him may not perish but may have
        the Life of Ages.

003:017 For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world,
        but that the world might be saved through Him.

003:018 He who trusts in Him does not come up for judgement.
        He who does not trust has already received sentence, because he has
        not his trust resting on the name of God's only Son.

003:019 And this is the test by which men are judged--the Light has
        come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than they
        loved the Light, because their deeds were wicked.

003:020 For every wrongdoer hates the light, and does not come to the light,
        for fear his actions should be exposed and condemned.

003:021 But he who does what is honest and right comes to the light,
        in order that his actions may be plainly shown to have been
        done in God.

003:022 After this Jesus and His disciples went into Judaea;
        and there He made a stay in company with them and baptized.

003:023 And John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there were
        many pools of water there; and people came and received baptism.

003:024 (For John was not yet in prison.)

003:025 As the result, a discussion having arisen on the part of John's
        disciples with a Jew about purification,

003:026 they came to John and reported to him, "Rabbi, he who was
        with you on the other side of the Jordan and to whom you
        bore testimony is now baptizing, and great numbers of people
        are resorting to him."

003:027 "A man cannot obtain anything," replied John, "unless it has
        been granted to him from Heaven.

003:028 You yourselves can bear witness to my having said, `I am not
        the Christ,' but `I am His appointed forerunner.'

003:029 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; and the bridegroom's
        friend who stands by his side and listens to him,
        rejoices heartily on account of the bridegroom's happiness.
        Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.

003:030 He must grow greater, but I must grow less.

003:031 He who comes from above is above all.  He whose origin
        is from the earth is not only himself from the earth,
        his teaching also is from the earth.  He who comes from Heaven
        is above all.

003:032 What He has seen and heard, to that He bears witness;
        but His testimony no one receives.

003:033 Any man who has received His testimony has solemnly declared
        that God is true.

003:034 For He whom God has sent speaks God's words; for God does
        not give the Spirit with limitations."

003:035 The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything
        to His hands.

003:036 He who believes in the Son has the Life of the Ages;
        he who disobeys the Son will not enter into Life, but God's
        anger remains upon him.

004:001 Now as soon as the Master was aware that the Pharisees
        had heard it said, "Jesus is gaining and baptizing more
        disciples than John"--

004:002 though Jesus Himself did not baptize them, but His disciples did--

004:003 He left Judaea and returned to Galilee.

004:004 His road lay through Samaria,

004:005 and so He came to Sychar, a town in Samaria near the piece
        of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

004:006 Jacob's Well was there:  and accordingly Jesus,
        tired out with His journey, sat down by the well to rest.
        It was about six o'clock in the evening.

004:007 Presently there came a woman of Samaria to draw water.
        Jesus asked her to give Him some water;

004:008 for His disciples were gone to the town to buy provisions.

004:009 "How is it," replied the woman, "that a Jew like you
        asks me, who am a woman and a Samaritan, for water?"
        (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

004:010 "If you had known God's free gift," replied Jesus, "and who it
        is that said to you, `Give me some water,' you would have
        asked Him, and He would have given you living water."

004:011 "Sir," she said, "you have nothing to draw with, and the well
        is deep; so where can you get the living water from?

004:012 Are you greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well,
        and himself drank from it, as did also his sons and his cattle?"

004:013 "Every one," replied Jesus, "who drinks any of this water
        will be thirsty again;

004:014 but whoever drinks any of the water that I shall give him
        will never, never thirst.  But the water that I shall give
        him will become a fountain within him of water springing up
        for the Life of the Ages."

004:015 "Sir," said the woman, "give me that water, that I may never
        be thirsty, nor continually come all the way here to draw
        from the well."

004:016 "Go and call your husband," said Jesus; "and come back."

004:017 "I have no husband," she replied.  "You rightly say that you
        have no husband," said Jesus;

004:018 "for you have had five husbands, and the man you have at
        present is not your husband.  You have spoken the truth
        in saying that."

004:019 "Sir," replied the woman, "I see that you are a Prophet.

004:020 Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say
        that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem."

004:021 "Believe me," said Jesus, "the time is coming when you will
        worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.

004:022 You worship One of whom you know nothing.  We worship One whom
        we know; for salvation comes from the Jews.

004:023 But a time is coming--nay, has already come--when the true
        worshippers will worship the Father with true spiritual worship;
        for indeed the Father desires such worshippers.

004:024 God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must bring Him
        true spiritual worship."

004:025 "I know," replied the woman, "that Messiah is coming--`the Christ,'
        as He is called.  When He has come, He will tell us everything."

004:026 "I am He," said Jesus--"I who am now talking to you."

004:027 Just then His disciples came, and were surprised to find Him
        talking with a woman.  Yet not one of them asked Him, "What is
        your wish?" or "Why are you talking with her?"

004:028 The woman however, leaving her pitcher, went away to the town,
        and called the people.

004:029 "Come," she said, "and see a man who has told me everything
        I have ever done.  Can this be the Christ, do you think?"

004:030 They left the town and set out to go to Him.

004:031 Meanwhile the disciples were urging Jesus.  "Rabbi," they said,
        "eat something."

004:032 "I have food to eat," He replied, "of which you do not know."

004:033 So the disciples began questioning one another.  "Can it be,"
        they said, "that some one has brought Him something to eat?"

004:034 "My food," said Jesus, "is to be obedient to Him who sent me,
        and fully to accomplish His work.

004:035 Do you not say, `It wants four months yet to the harvest'?
        But look round, I tell you, and observe these plains--
        they are already ripe for the sickle.

004:036 The reaper gets pay and gathers in a crop in preparation
        for the Life of the Ages, that so the sower and the reapers
        may rejoice together.

004:037 For it is in this that you see the real meaning of the saying,
        `The sower is one person, and the reaper is another.'

004:038 I sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your
        own labours.  Others have laboured, and you are getting
        benefit from their labours."

004:039 Of the Samaritan population of that town a good many believed
        in Him because of the woman's statement when she declared,
        "He has told me all that I have ever done."

004:040 When however the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him on
        all sides to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.

004:041 Then a far larger number of people believed because of
        His own words,

004:042 and they said to the woman, "We no longer believe in Him simply
        because of your statements; for we have now heard for ourselves,
        and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world."

004:043 After the two days He departed, and went into Galilee;

004:044 though Jesus Himself declared that a Prophet has no honour
        in his own country.

004:045 When however He reached Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed
        Him eagerly, having been eye-witnesses of all that He had
        done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for they also had been
        to the Festival.

004:046 So He came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made
        the water into wine.  Now there was a certain officer
        of the King's court whose son was ill at Capernaum.

004:047 Having heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee,
        he came to Him and begged Him to go down and cure his son;
        for he was at the point of death.

004:048 "Unless you and others see miracles and marvels," said Jesus,
        "nothing will induce you to believe."

004:049 "Sir," pleaded the officer, "come down before my child dies."

004:050 "You may return home," replied Jesus; "your son has recovered."
        He believed the words of Jesus, and started back home;

004:051 and he was already on his way down when his servants met him
        and told him that his son was alive and well.

004:052 So he inquired of them at what hour he had shown improvement.
        "Yesterday, about seven o'clock," they replied,
        "the fever left him."

004:053 Then the father recollected that that was the time at
        which Jesus had said to him, "Your son has recovered,"
        and he and his whole household became believers.

004:054 This is the second miracle that Jesus performed, after coming
        from Judaea into Galilee.

005:001 After this there was a Festival of the Jews, and Jesus went
        up to Jerusalem.

005:002 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool,
        called in Hebrew `Bethesda.' It has five arcades.

005:003 In these there used to lie a great number of sick persons,
        and of people who were blind or lame or paralyzed.

005:004 []

005:005 And there was one man there who had been an invalid
        for thirty-eight years.

005:006 Jesus saw him lying there, and knowing that he had been a long
        time in that condition, He asked him, "Do you wish to have
        health and strength?"

005:007 "Sir," replied the sufferer, "I have no one to put me into
        the pool when the water is moved; but while I am coming
        some one else steps down before me."

005:008 "Rise," said Jesus, "take up your mat and walk."

005:009 Instantly the man was restored to perfect health, and he took
        up his mat and began to walk.

005:010 That day was a Sabbath.  So the Jews said to the man who had
        been cured, "It is the Sabbath:  you must not carry your mat."

005:011 "He who cured me," he replied, "said to me, `Take up your
        mat and walk.'"

005:012 "Who is it," they asked, "that said to you, `Take up your
        mat and walk'?"

005:013 But the man who had been cured did not know who it was;
        for Jesus had passed out unnoticed, there being a crowd
        in the place.

005:014 Afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple and said to him,
        "You are now restored to health.  Do not sin any more,
        or a worse thing may befall you."

005:015 The man went and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had restored
        him to health;

005:016 and on this account the Jews began to persecute Jesus--
        because He did these things on the Sabbath.

005:017 His reply to their accusation was, "My Father works unceasingly,
        and so do I."

005:018 On this account then the Jews were all the more eager to put
        Him to death--because He not only broke the Sabbath,
        but also spoke of God as being in a special sense His Father,
        thus putting Himself on a level with God.

005:019 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that the Son
        can do nothing of Himself--He can only do what He sees
        the Father doing; for whatever He does, that the Son does
        in like manner.

005:020 For the Father loves the Son and reveals to Him all that He Himself
        is doing.  And greater deeds than these will He reveal to Him,
        in order that you may wonder.

005:021 For just as the Father awakens the dead and gives them life,
        so the Son also gives life to whom He wills.

005:022 The Father indeed does not judge any one, but He has entrusted
        all judgement to the Son,

005:023 that all may honour the Son even as they honour the Father.
        The man who withholds honour from the Son withholds honour
        from the Father who sent Him.

005:024 "In most solemn truth I tell you that he who listens to my
        teaching and believes Him who sent me, has the Life of the Ages,
        and does not come under judgement, but has passed over out
        of death into Life.

005:025 "In most solemn truth I tell you that a time is coming--
        nay, has already come--when the dead will hear the voice
        of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live.

005:026 For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has also given
        to the Son to have life in Himself.

005:027 And He has conferred on Him authority to act as Judge,
        because He is the Son of Man.

005:028 Wonder not at this.  For a time is coming when all who are
        in the graves will hear His voice and will come forth--

005:029 they who have done what is right to the resurrection of Life,
        and they whose actions have been evil to the resurrection
        of judgement.

005:030 "I can of my own self do nothing.  As I am bidden, so I judge;
        and mine is a just judgement, because it is not my own will
        that guides me, but the will of Him who sent me.

005:031 "If I give testimony concerning myself, my testimony
        cannot be accepted.

005:032 There is Another who gives testimony concerning me, and I know
        that the testimony is true which He offers concerning me.

005:033 "You sent to John, and he both was and still is a witness
        to the truth.

005:034 But the testimony on my behalf which I accept is not from man;
        though I say all this in order that you may be saved.

005:035 He was the lamp that burned and shone, and for a time you
        were willing to be gladdened by his light.

005:036 "But the testimony which I have is weightier than that of John;
        for the work the Father has assigned to me for me to
        bring it to completion--the very work which I am doing--
        affords testimony concerning me that the Father has sent me.

005:037 And the Father who sent me, *He* has given testimony concerning me.
        None of you have ever either heard His voice or seen what
        He is like.

005:038 Nor have you His word dwelling within you, for you refuse
        to believe Him whom *He* has sent.

005:039 "You search the Scriptures, because you suppose that in them
        you will find the Life of the Ages; and it is those Scriptures
        that yield testimony concerning me;

005:040 and yet you are unwilling to come to me that you may have Life.

005:041 "I do not accept glory from man,

005:042 but I know you well, and I know that in your hearts you do
        not really love God.

005:043 I have come as my Father's representative, and you do not
        receive me.  If some one else comes representing only himself,
        him you will receive.

005:044 How is it possible for you to believe, while you receive glory
        from one another and have no desire for the glory that comes
        from the only God?

005:045 "Do not suppose that I will accuse you to the Father.
        There is one who accuses you, namely Moses, on whom
        your hope rests.

005:046 For if you believe Moses, you would believe me;
        for he wrote about me.

005:047 But if you disbelieve his writings, how are you to believe my words?"

006:001 After this Jesus went away across the Lake of Galilee (that is,
        the Lake of Tiberias).

006:002 A vast multitude followed Him, because they witnessed the miracles
        on the sick which He was constantly performing.

006:003 Then Jesus went up the hill, and sat there with His disciples.

006:004 The Jewish Festival, the Passover, was at hand.

006:005 And when He looked round and saw an immense crowd coming
        towards Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread
        for all these people to eat?"

006:006 He said this to put Philip to the test, for He Himself knew
        what He was going to do.

006:007 "Seven pounds' worth of bread," replied Philip, "is not enough
        for them all to get even a scanty meal."

006:008 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,
        said to Him,

006:009 "There is a boy here with five barley loaves and a couple of fish:
        but what is that among so many?"

006:010 "Make the people sit down," said Jesus.  The ground was
        covered with thick grass; so they sat down, the adult men
        numbering about 5,000.

006:011 Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He
        distributed them to those who were resting on the ground;
        and also the fish in like manner--as much as they desired.

006:012 When all were fully satisfied, He said to His disciples,
        "Gather up the broken portions that remain over, so that
        nothing be lost."

006:013 Accordingly they gathered them up; and with the fragments
        of the five barley loaves--the broken portions that remained
        over after they had done eating--they filled twelve baskets.

006:014 Thereupon the people, having seen the miracle He had performed,
        said, "This is indeed the Prophet who was to come into the world."

006:015 Perceiving, however, that they were about to come and carry
        Him off by force to make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again up
        the hill alone by Himself.

006:016 When evening came on, His disciples went down to the Lake.

006:017 There they got on board a boat, and pushed off to cross
        the Lake to Capernaum.  By this time it had become dark,
        and Jesus had not yet joined them.

006:018 The Lake also was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.

006:019 When, however, they had rowed three or four miles, they saw
        Jesus walking on the water and coming near the boat.

006:020 They were terrified; but He called to them.  "It is I," He said,
        "do not be afraid."

006:021 Then they were willing to take Him on board; and in a moment
        the boat reached the shore at the point to which they were going.

006:022 Next morning the crowd who were still standing about on
        the other side of the Lake found that there had been but one
        small boat there, and they had seen that Jesus did not go
        on board with His disciples, but that His disciples went
        away without Him.

006:023 Yet a number of small boats came from Tiberias to the neighbourhood
        of the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord
        had given thanks.

006:024 When however the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples
        were there, they themselves also took boats and came to Capernaum
        to look for Jesus.

006:025 So when they had crossed the Lake and had found Him,
        they asked Him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"

006:026 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that you
        are searching for me not because you have seen miracles,
        but because you ate the loaves and had a hearty meal.

006:027 Bestow your pains not on the food which perishes,
        but on the food that remains unto the Life of the Ages--
        that food which will be the Son of Man's gift to you;
        for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal."

006:028 "What are we to do," they asked, "in order to carry out the things
        that God requires?"

006:029 "This," replied Jesus, "is above all the thing that God requires--
        that you should be believers in Him whom He has sent."

006:030 "What miracle then," they asked, "do you perform for us to see
        and become believers in you?  What do you *do*?

006:031 Our forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, as it is written,
        `He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat'."

006:032 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that Moses
        did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but my Father
        is giving you the bread--the true bread--out of Heaven.

006:033 For God's bread is that which comes down out of Heaven and gives
        Life to the world."

006:034 "Sir," they said, "always give us that bread."

006:035 "I am the bread of Life," replied Jesus; "he who comes to me shall
        never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never, never thirst.

006:036 But it is as I have said to you:  you have seen me and yet
        you do not believe.

006:037 Every one whom the Father gives me will come to me, and him
        who comes to me I will never on any account drive away.

006:038 For I have left Heaven and have come down to earth not to seek
        my own pleasure, but to do the will of Him who sent me.

006:039 And this is the will of Him who sent me, that of all that He
        has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it
        to life on the last day.

006:040 For this is my Father's will, that every one who fixes his gaze
        on the Son of God and believes in Him should have the Life
        of the Ages, and I will raise him to life on the last day."

006:041 Now the Jews began to find fault about Him because of His
        claiming to be the bread which came down out of Heaven.

006:042 They kept asking, "Is not this man Joseph's son?
        Is he not Jesus, whose father and mother we know?  What does
        he mean by now saying, `I have come down out of Heaven'?"

006:043 "Do not thus find fault among yourselves," replied Jesus;

006:044 "no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him;
        then I will raise him to life on the last day.

006:045 It stands written in the Prophets, `And they shall all of them
        be taught by God'.  Every one who listens to the Father
        and learns from Him comes to me.

006:046 No one has ever seen the Father--except Him who is from God.
        He has seen the Father.

006:047 "In most solemn truth I tell you that he who believes has
        the Life of the Ages.

006:048 I am the bread of Life.

006:049 Your forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, and they died.

006:050 Here is the bread that comes down out of Heaven that a man
        may eat it and not die.

006:051 I am the living bread come down out of Heaven.
        If a man eats this bread, he shall live for ever.
        Moreover the bread which I will give is my flesh given
        for the life of the world."

006:052 This led to an angry debate among the Jews.  "How can this man,"
        they argued, "give us his flesh to eat?"

006:053 "In most solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus, "that unless
        you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood,
        you have no Life in you.

006:054 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has the Life of the Ages,
        and I will raise him up on the last day.

006:055 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.

006:056 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me,
        and I remain in union with him.

006:057 As the ever-living Father has sent me, and I live because of
        the Father, so also he who eats me will live because of me.

006:058 This is the bread which came down out of Heaven; it is unlike
        that which your forefathers ate--for they ate and yet died.
        He who eats this bread shall live for ever."

006:059 Jesus said all this in the synagogue while teaching at Capernaum.

006:060 Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard it, said,
        "This is hard to accept.  Who can listen to such teaching?"

006:061 But, knowing in Himself that His disciples were dissatisfied
        about it, Jesus asked them,

006:062 "Does this seem incredible to you?  What then if you were to see
        the Son of Man ascending again where He was before?

006:063 It is the spirit which gives Life.  The flesh confers no
        benefit whatever.  The words I have spoken to you are spirit
        and are Life.

006:064 But there are some of you who do not believe."  For Jesus
        knew from the beginning who those were that did not believe,
        and who it was that would betray Him.

006:065 So He added, "That is why I told you that no one can come
        to me unless it be granted him by the Father."

006:066 Thereupon many of His disciples left Him and went away,
        and no longer associated with Him.

006:067 Jesus therefore appealed to the Twelve.  "Will you go also?"
        He asked.

006:068 "Master," replied Simon Peter, "to whom shall we go?
        Your teachings tell us of the Life of the Ages.

006:069 And we have come to believe and know that *you* are indeed
        the Holy One of God."

006:070 "Did not I choose you--the Twelve?" said Jesus, "and even of you
        one is a devil."

006:071 He alluded to Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot.
        For he it was who, though one of the Twelve, was afterwards
        to betray Him.

007:001 After this Jesus moved from place to place in Galilee.
        He would not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were seeking
        an opportunity to kill Him.

007:002 But the Jewish Festival of the Tent-Pitching was approaching.

007:003 So His brothers said to Him, "Leave these parts and go into Judaea,
        that not only we but your disciples also may witness the miracles
        which you perform.

007:004 For no one acts in secret, desiring all the while to be
        himself known publicly.  Since you are doing these things,
        show yourself openly to the world."

007:005 For even His brothers were not believers in Him.

007:006 "My time," replied Jesus, "has not yet come, but for you any
        time is suitable.

007:007 It is impossible for the world to hate you; but me it does hate,
        because I give testimony concerning it that its conduct is evil.

007:008 As for you, go up to the Festival.  I do not now go up
        to this Festival, because my time is not yet fully come."

007:009 Such was His answer, and He remained in Galilee.

007:010 When however His brothers had gone up to the Festival,
        then He also went up, not openly, but as it were privately.

007:011 Meanwhile the Jews at the Festival were looking for Him
        and were inquiring, "Where is he?"

007:012 Among the mass of the people there was much muttered debate
        about Him.  Some said, "He is a good man."  Others said, "Not so:
        he is imposing on the people."

007:013 Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke out boldly about Him.

007:014 But when the Festival was already half over, Jesus went up
        to the Temple and commenced teaching.

007:015 The Jews were astonished.  "How does this man know anything
        of books," they said, "although he has never been at any
        of the schools?"

007:016 Jesus answered their question by saying, "My teaching does
        not belong to me, but comes from Him who sent me.

007:017 If any one is willing to do His will, he shall know about
        the teaching, whether it is from God or originates with me.

007:018 The man whose teaching originates with himself aims at his own glory.
        He who aims at the glory of Him who sent him teaches the truth,
        and there is no deception in him.

007:019 Did not Moses give you the Law?  And yet not a man of you
        obeys the Law.  Why do you want to kill me?"

007:020 "You are possessed by a demon," replied the crowd; "no one wants
        to kill you."

007:021 "One deed I have done," replied Jesus, "and you are all
        full of wonder.

007:022 Consider therefore.  Moses gave you the rite of circumcision
        (not that it began with Moses, but with your earlier forefathers),
        and even on a Sabbath day you circumcise a child.

007:023 If a child is circumcised even on a Sabbath day, are you bitter
        against me because I have restored a man to perfect health
        on a Sabbath day?

007:024 Do not form superficial judgements, but form the judgements
        that are just."

007:025 Some however of the people of Jerusalem said, "Is not this
        the man they are wanting to kill?

007:026 But here he is, speaking openly and boldly, and they say nothing
        to him!  Can the Rulers really have ascertained that this
        man is the Christ?

007:027 And yet we know this man, and we know where he is from;
        but as for the Christ, when He comes, no one can tell where
        He is from."

007:028 Jesus therefore, while teaching in the Temple, cried aloud,
        and said, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from.
        And yet I have not come of my own accord; but there is One who has
        sent me, an Authority indeed, of whom you have no knowledge.

007:029 I know Him, because I came from Him, and He sent me."

007:030 On hearing this they wanted to arrest Him; yet not a hand
        was laid on Him, because His time had not yet come.

007:031 But from among the crowd a large number believed in Him.
        "When the Christ comes," they said, "will He perform more
        miracles than this teacher has performed?"

007:032 The Pharisees heard the people thus expressing their various
        doubts about Him, and the High Priests and the Pharisees sent
        some officers to apprehend Him.

007:033 So Jesus said, "Still for a short time I am with you,
        and then I go my way to Him who sent me.

007:034 You will look for me and will not find me, and where I am
        you cannot come."

007:035 The Jews therefore said to one another, "Where is he about
        to betake himself, so that we shall not find him?
        Will he betake himself to the Dispersion among the Gentiles,
        and teach the Gentiles?

007:036 What do those words of his mean, `You will look for me,
        but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come'?"

007:037 On the last day of the Festival--the great day--Jesus stood
        up and cried aloud.  "Whoever is thirsty," He said, "let him
        come to me and drink.

007:038 He who believes in me, from within him--as the Scripture has said--
        rivers of living water shall flow."

007:039 He referred to the Spirit which those who believed in Him
        were to receive; for the Spirit was not bestowed as yet,
        because Jesus had not yet been glorified.

007:040 After listening to these discourses, some of the crowd began
        to say, "This is beyond doubt the Prophet."

007:041 Others said, "He is the Christ."  But others again, "Not so,
        for is the Christ to come from Galilee?

007:042 Has not the Scripture declared that the Christ is to come
        of the family of David and from Bethlehem, David's village?"

007:043 So there was a violent dissension among the people on His account.

007:044 Some of them wanted at once to arrest Him, but no one laid
        hands upon Him.

007:045 Meanwhile the officers returned to the High Priests and Pharisees,
        who asked them, "Why have you not brought him?"

007:046 "No mere man has ever spoken as this man speaks,"
        said the officers.

007:047 "Are *you* deluded too?" replied the Pharisees;

007:048 "has any one of the Rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?

007:049 But this rabble who understand nothing about the Law are accursed!"

007:050 Nicodemus interposed--he who had formerly gone to Jesus,
        being himself one of them.

007:051 "Does our Law," he asked, "judge a man without first hearing
        what he has to say and ascertaining what his conduct is?"

007:052 "Do you also come from Galilee?" they asked in reply.
        "Search and see for yourself that no Prophet is
        of Galilaean origin."

007:053 [So they went away to their several homes;

008:001 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

008:002 At break of day however He returned to the Temple, and there
        the people came to Him in crowds.  He seated Himself;

008:003 and was teaching them when the Scribes and the Pharisees brought
        to Him a woman who had been found committing adultery.
        They made her stand in the centre of the court, and they put
        the case to Him.

008:004 "Rabbi," they said, "this woman has been found in the very act
        of committing adultery.

008:005 Now, in the Law, Moses has ordered us to stone such women to death.
        But what do you say?"

008:006 They asked this in order to put Him to the test,
        so that they might have some charge to bring against Him.
        But Jesus leant forward and began to write with His finger
        on the ground.

008:007 When however they persisted with their question, He raised
        His head and said to them, "Let the sinless man among you
        be the first to throw a stone at her."

008:008 Then He leant forward again, and again began to write
        on the ground.

008:009 They listened to Him, and then, beginning with the eldest,
        took their departure, one by one, till all were gone.
        And Jesus was left behind alone--and the woman in the centre
        of the court.

008:010 Then, raising His head, Jesus said to her, "Where are they?
        Has no one condemned you?"

008:011 "No one, Sir," she replied.  "And *I* do not condemn you either,"
        said Jesus; "go, and from this time do not sin any more."]

008:012 Once more Jesus addressed them.  "I am the Light of the world,"
        He said; "the man who follows me shall certainly not walk
        in the dark, but shall have the light of Life."

008:013 "You are giving testimony about yourself," said the Pharisees;
        "your testimony is not true."

008:014 "Even if I am giving testimony about myself," replied Jesus,
        "my testimony is true; for I know where I came from and where I
        am going, but you know neither of these two things.

008:015 You judge according to appearances:  I am judging no one.

008:016 And even if I do judge, my judgement is just; for I am not alone,
        but the Father who sent me is with me.

008:017 In your own Law, too, it is written that the testimony of two
        men is true.

008:018 I am one giving testimony about myself, and the Father who sent
        me gives testimony about me."

008:019 "Where is your Father?" they asked.  "You know my Father
        as little as you know me."  He replied; "if you knew me,
        you would know my Father also."

008:020 These sayings He uttered in the Treasury, while teaching
        in the Temple; yet no one arrested Him, because His time
        had not yet come.

008:021 Again He said to them, "I am going away.  Then you will try
        to find me, but you will die in your sins.  Where I am going,
        it is impossible for you to come."

008:022 The Jews began to ask one another, "Is he going to kill himself,
        do you think, that he says, `Where I am going, it is impossible
        for you to come'?"

008:023 "You," He continued, "are from below, I am from above:
        you are of this present world, I am not of this present world.

008:024 That is why I told you that you will die in your sins;
        for, unless you believe that I am He, that is what will happen."

008:025 "You--who are you?" they asked.  "How is it that I am speaking
        to you at all?" replied Jesus.

008:026 "Many things I have to speak and to judge concerning you.
        But He who sent me is true, and the things which I have heard
        from Him are those which I have come into the world to speak."

008:027 They did not perceive that He was speaking to them of the Father.

008:028 So Jesus added, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man,
        then you will know that I am He.  Of myself I do nothing;
        but as the Father has taught me, so I speak.

008:029 And He who sent me is with me.  He has not left me alone:
        for I do always what is pleasing to Him."

008:030 As He thus spoke, many became believers in Him.

008:031 Jesus therefore said to those of the Jews who had now believed
        in Him, "As for you, if you hold fast to my teaching,
        then you are truly my disciples;

008:032 and you shall know the Truth, and the Truth will make you free."

008:033 "We are descendants of Abraham," they answered,
        "and have never at any time been in slavery to any one.
        What do those words of yours mean, `You shall become free'?"

008:034 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that every
        one who commits sin is the slave of sin.

008:035 Now a slave does not remain permanently in his master's house,
        but a son does.

008:036 If then the Son shall make you free, you will be free indeed.

008:037 You are descendants of Abraham, I know; but you want to kill me,
        because my teaching gains no ground within you.

008:038 The words I speak are those I have learnt in the presence
        of the Father.  Therefore you also should do what you have
        heard from your father."

008:039 "Our father is Abraham," they said.  "If you were Abraham's children,"
        replied Jesus, "it is Abraham's deeds that you would be doing.

008:040 But, in fact, you are longing to kill me, a man who has
        spoken to you the truth which I have heard from God.
        Abraham did not do that.

008:041 You are doing the deeds of your father."  "We," they replied,
        "are not illegitimate children.  We have one Father, namely God."

008:042 "If God were your Father," said Jesus, "you would love me;
        for it is from God that I came and I am now here.
        I have not come of myself, but *He* sent me.

008:043 How is it you do not understand me when I speak?
        It is because you cannot bear to listen to my words.

008:044 The father whose sons you are is the Devil; and you desire to do
        what gives him pleasure.  *He* was a murderer from the beginning,
        and does not stand firm in the truth--for there is no truth in him.
        Whenever he utters his lie, he utters it out of his own store;
        for he is a liar, and the father of lies.

008:045 But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.

008:046 Which of *you* convicts me of sin?  If I speak the truth,
        why do you not believe me?

008:047 He who is a child of God listens to God's words.
        You do not listen to them:  and why?  It is because you are
        not God's children."

008:048 "Are we not right," answered the Jews, "in saying that you
        are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?"

008:049 "I am not possessed by a demon," replied Jesus.
        "On the contrary I honour my Father, and you dishonour me.

008:050 I, however, am not aiming at glory for myself:  there is One
        who aims at glory for me--and who judges.

008:051 In most solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall have
        obeyed my teaching he shall in no case ever see death."

008:052 "Now," exclaimed the Jews, "we know that you are possessed
        by a demon.  Abraham died, and so did the Prophets,
        and yet *you* say, `If any one shall have obeyed my teaching,
        he shall in no case ever taste death.'

008:053 Are you really greater than our forefather Abraham?  For he died.
        And the prophets died.  Who do you make yourself out to be?"

008:054 "Were I to glorify myself," answered Jesus, "I should have no
        real glory.  There is One who glorifies me--namely my Father,
        who you say is your God.

008:055 You do not know Him, but I know Him perfectly; and were I to deny
        my knowledge of Him, I should resemble you, and be a liar.
        On the contrary I do know Him, and I obey His commands.

008:056 Abraham your forefather exulted in the hope of seeing my day:
        and he saw it, and was glad."

008:057 "You are not yet fifty years old," cried the Jews, "and have
        you seen Abraham?"

008:058 "In most solemn truth," answered Jesus, "I tell you that before
        Abraham came into existence, I am."

008:059 Thereupon they took up stones with which to stone Him,
        but He hid Himself and went away out of the Temple.

009:001 As He passed by, He saw a man who had been blind from his birth.

009:002 So His disciples asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned--this man
        or his parents--that he was born blind?"

009:003 "Neither he nor his parents sinned," answered Jesus,
        "but he was born blind in order that God's mercy might be
        openly shown in him.

009:004 We must do the works of Him who sent me while there is daylight.
        Night is coming on, when no one can work.

009:005 When I am in the world, I am the Light of the world."

009:006 After thus speaking, He spat on the ground, and then,
        kneading the dust and spittle into clay, He smeared the clay
        over the man's eyes and said to him,

009:007 "Go and wash in the pool of Siloam"--the name means `Sent.'
        So he went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.

009:008 His neighbours, therefore, and the other people to whom he had
        been a familiar object because he was a beggar, began asking,
        "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"

009:009 "Yes it is," replied some of them.  "No it is not,"
        said others, "but he is like him."  His own statement was,
        "I am the man."

009:010 "How then were your eyes opened?" they asked.

009:011 "He whose name is Jesus," he answered, "made clay and smeared
        my eyes with it, and then told me to go to Siloam and wash.
        So I went and washed and obtained sight."

009:012 "Where is he?" they inquired, but the man did not know.

009:013 They brought him to the Pharisees--the man who had been blind.

009:014 Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened the man's
        eyes was the Sabbath.

009:015 So the Pharisees renewed their questioning as to how he had
        obtained his sight.  "He put clay on my eyes," he replied,
        "and I washed, and now I can see."

009:016 This led some of the Pharisees to say, "That man has not come
        from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath."  "How is it
        possible for a bad man to do such miracles?" argued others.

009:017 And there was a division among them.  So again they asked the once
        blind man, "What is your account of him?--for he opened your eyes."
        "He is a Prophet," he replied.

009:018 The Jews, however, did not believe the statement concerning him--
        that he had been blind and had obtained his sight--until they
        called his parents and asked them,

009:019 "Is this your son, who you say was born blind?  How is it then
        that he can now see?"

009:020 "We know," replied the parents, "that this is our son and that
        he was born blind;

009:021 but how it is that he can now see or who has opened his
        eyes we do not know.  Ask him himself; he is of full age;
        he himself will give his own account of it."

009:022 Such was their answer, because they were afraid of the Jews;
        for the Jews had already settled among themselves that if any
        one should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be
        excluded from the synagogue.

009:023 That was why his parents said, "He is of full age:
        ask him himself."

009:024 A second time therefore they called the man who had been blind,
        and said, "Give God the praise:  we know that that man
        is a sinner."

009:025 "Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know," he replied;
        "one thing I know--that I was once blind and that now I can see."

009:026 "What did he do to you?" they asked; "how did he open your eyes?"

009:027 "I have told you already," he replied, "and you did
        not listen to me.  Why do you want to hear it again?
        Do you also mean to be disciples of his?"

009:028 Then they railed at him, and said, "You are that man's disciple,
        but we are disciples of Moses.

009:029 We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this fellow we
        do not know where he comes from."

009:030 "Why, this is marvellous!" the man replied; "you do not know
        where he comes from, and yet he has opened my eyes!

009:031 We know that God does not listen to bad people, but that if any
        one is a God-fearing man and obeys Him, to him He listens.

009:032 From the beginning of the world such a thing was never heard
        of as that any one should open the eyes of a man blind
        from his birth.

009:033 Had that man not come from God, he could have done nothing."

009:034 "You," they replied, "were wholly begotten and born in sin,
        and do *you* teach *us*?"  And they put him out of the synagogue.

009:035 Jesus heard that they had done this.  So having found him,
        He asked him, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"

009:036 "Who is He, Sir?" replied the man.  "Tell me, so that I may
        believe in Him."

009:037 "You have seen Him," said Jesus; "and not only so:
        He is now speaking to you."

009:038 "I believe, Sir," he said.  And he threw himself at His feet.

009:039 "I came into this world," said Jesus, "to judge men,
        that those who do not see may see, and that those who do see
        may become blind."

009:040 These words were heard by those of the Pharisees who were present,
        and they asked Him, "Are *we* also blind?"

009:041 "If you were blind," answered Jesus, "you would have no sin;
        but as a matter of fact you boast that you see.
        So your sin remains!"

010:001 "In most solemn truth I tell you that the man who does not enter
        the sheepfold by the door, but climbs over some other way,
        is a thief and a robber.

010:002 But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

010:003 To him the porter opens the door, and the sheep hear his voice;
        and he calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out.

010:004 When he has brought out his own sheep--all of them--
        he walks at the head of them; and the sheep follow him,
        because they know his voice.

010:005 But a stranger they will by no means follow, but will run away
        from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."

010:006 Jesus spoke to them in this figurative language, but they did
        not understand what He meant.

010:007 Again therefore Jesus said to them, "In most solemn truth I
        tell you that I am the Door of the sheep.

010:008 All who have come before me are thieves and robbers;
        but the sheep would not listen to them.

010:009 I am the Door.  If any one enters by me, he will find safety,
        and will go in and out and find pasture.

010:010 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy:
        I have come that they may have Life, and may have it in abundance.

010:011 "I am the Good Shepherd.  A good shepherd lays down his very life
        for the sheep.

010:012 The hired servant--one who is not a shepherd and does not own
        the sheep--no sooner sees the wolf coming than he leaves
        the sheep and runs away; and the wolf worries and scatters them.

010:013 For he is only a hired servant and cares nothing for the sheep.

010:014 "I am the Good Shepherd.  And I know my sheep and my sheep know me,

010:015 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I am
        laying down my life for the sheep.

010:016 I have also other sheep--which do not belong to this fold.
        Those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice;
        and they shall become one flock under one Shepherd.

010:017 For this reason my Father loves me, because I am laying down
        my life in order to receive it back again.

010:018 No one is taking it away from me, but I myself am laying it down.
        I am authorized to lay it down, and I am authorized to receive
        it back again.  This is the command I received from my Father."

010:019 Again there arose a division among the Jews because of these words.

010:020 Many of them said, "He is possessed by a demon and is mad.
        Why do you listen to him?"

010:021 Others argued, "That is not the language of a demoniac:
        and can a demon open blind men's eyes?"

010:022 The Dedication Festival came on in Jerusalem.  It was winter,

010:023 and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon's Portico,

010:024 when the Jews gathered round Him and kept asking Him, "How long
        do you mean to keep us in suspense?  If you are the Christ,
        tell us so plainly."

010:025 "I have told you," answered Jesus, "and you do not believe.
        The deeds that I do in my Father's name--they give
        testimony about me.

010:026 But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.

010:027 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

010:028 I give them the Life of the Ages, and they shall never,
        never perish, nor shall any one wrest them from my hand.

010:029 What my Father has given me is more precious than all besides;
        and no one is able to wrest anything from my Father's hand.

010:030 I and the Father are one."

010:031 Again the Jews brought stones with which to stone Him.

010:032 Jesus remonstrated with them.  "Many good deeds," He said,
        "have I shown you as coming from the Father; for which of them
        are you going to stone me?"

010:033 "For no good deed," the Jews replied, "are we going to stone you,
        but for blasphemy, and because you, who are only a man,
        are making yourself out to be God."

010:034 "Does it not stand written in your Law," replied Jesus, "`I said,
        you are gods'?

010:035 If those to whom God's word was addressed are called gods
        (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),

010:036 how is it that you say to one whom the Father consecrated
        and sent into the world, `You are blaspheming,' because I said,
        `I am God's Son'?

010:037 If the deeds I do are not my Father's deeds, do not believe me.

010:038 But if they are, then even if you do not believe me,
        at least believe the deeds, that you may know and see clearly
        that the Father is in me, and that I am in the Father."

010:039 This made them once more try to arrest Him, but He withdrew
        out of their power.

010:040 Then He went away again to the other side of the Jordan,
        to the place where John had been baptizing at first;
        and there He stayed.

010:041 Large numbers of people also came to Him.  Their report was,
        "John did not work any miracle, but all that John said about
        this Teacher was true."

010:042 And many became believers in Him there.

011:001 Now a certain man, named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill--
        Bethany being the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

011:002 (It was the Mary who poured the perfume over the Lord and wiped
        His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.)

011:003 So the sisters sent to Him to say, "Master, he whom you hold
        dear is ill."

011:004 Jesus received the message and said, "This illness is not
        to end in death, but is to promote the glory of God,
        in order that the Son of God may be glorified by it."

011:005 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

011:006 When, however, He heard that Lazarus was ill, He still remained
        two days in that same place.

011:007 Then, after that, He said to the disciples, "Let us
        return to Judaea."

011:008 "Rabbi," exclaimed the disciples, "the Jews have just been trying
        to stone you, and do you think of going back there again?"

011:009 "Are there not twelve hours in the day?" replied Jesus.
        "If any one walks in the daytime, he does not stumble--
        because he sees the light of this world.

011:010 But if a man walks by night, he does stumble, because the light
        is not in him."

011:011 He said this, and afterwards He added, "Our friend Lazarus
        is sleeping, but I will go and wake him."

011:012 "Master," said the disciples, "if he is asleep he will recover."

011:013 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought He referred
        to the rest taken in ordinary sleep.

011:014 So then He told them plainly,

011:015 "Lazarus is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there,
        in order that you may believe.  But let us go to him."

011:016 "Let us go also," Thomas, the Twin, said to his fellow disciples,
        "that we may die with him."

011:017 On His arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been
        three days in the tomb.

011:018 Bethany was near Jerusalem, the distance being a little less
        than two miles;

011:019 and a considerable number of the Jews were with Martha and Mary,
        having come to express sympathy with them on the death
        of their brother.

011:020 Martha, however, as soon as she heard the tidings, "Jesus is coming,"
        went to meet Him; but Mary remained sitting in the house.

011:021 So Martha came and spoke to Jesus.  "Master, if you had been here,"
        she said, "my brother would not have died.

011:022 And even now I know that whatever you ask God for,
        God will give you."

011:023 "Your brother shall rise again," replied Jesus.

011:024 "I know," said Martha, "that he will rise again at the resurrection,
        on the last day."

011:025 "I am the Resurrection and the Life," said Jesus; "he who believes
        in me, even if he has died, he shall live;

011:026 and every one who is living and is a believer in me shall never,
        never die.  Do you believe this?"

011:027 "Yes, Master," she replied; "I thoroughly believe that you are
        the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."

011:028 After saying this, she went and called her sister Mary privately,
        telling her, "The Rabbi is here and is asking for you."

011:029 So she, on hearing that, rose up quickly to go to Him.

011:030 Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still
        at the place where Martha had met Him.

011:031 So the Jews who were with Mary in the house sympathizing with her,
        when they saw that she had risen hastily and had gone out,
        followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb
        to weep aloud there.

011:032 Mary then, when she came to Jesus and saw Him, fell at His
        feet and exclaimed, "Master, if you had been here, my brother
        would not have died."

011:033 Seeing her weeping aloud, and the Jews in like manner weeping
        who had come with her, Jesus, curbing the strong emotion
        of His spirit,

011:034 though deeply troubled, asked them, "Where have you laid him?"
        "Master, come and see," was their reply.

011:035 Jesus wept.

011:036 "See how dear he held him," said the Jews.

011:037 But others of them asked, "Was this man who opened the blind
        man's eyes unable to prevent this man from dying?"

011:038 Jesus, however, again restraining His strong feeling,
        came to the tomb.  It was a cave, and a stone had been laid
        against the mouth of it.

011:039 "Take away the stone," said Jesus.  Martha, the sister of the
        dead man, exclaimed, "Master, by this time there is a foul smell;
        for it is three days since he died."

011:040 "Did I not promise you," replied Jesus, "that if you believe,
        you shall see the glory of God?"

011:041 So they removed the stone.  Then Jesus lifted up His eyes
        and said, "Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard me.

011:042 I know that Thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd
        standing round I have said this--that they may believe
        that Thou didst send me."

011:043 After speaking thus, He called out in a loud voice,
        "Lazarus, come out."

011:044 The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in cloths,
        and his face wrapped round with a towel.  "Untie him,"
        said Jesus, "and let him go free."

011:045 Thereupon a considerable number of the Jews--namely those
        who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds--
        became believers in Him;

011:046 though some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them
        what He had done.

011:047 Therefore the High Priests and the Pharisees held a meeting of
        the Sanhedrin.  "What steps are we taking?" they asked one another;
        "for this man is performing a great number of miracles.

011:048 If we leave him alone in this way, everybody will believe
        in him, and the Romans will come and blot out both our city
        and our nation."

011:049 But one of them, named Caiaphas, being High Priest that year,
        said, "You know nothing about it.

011:050 You do not reflect that it is to your interest that one man
        should die for the people rather than the whole nation perish."

011:051 It was not as a mere man that he thus spoke.  But being
        High Priest that year he was inspired to declare that Jesus
        was to die for the nation,

011:052 and not for the nation only, but in order to unite into one
        body all the far-scattered children of God.

011:053 So from that day forward they planned and schemed in order
        to put Him to death.

011:054 Therefore Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews,
        but He left that neighbourhood and went into the district
        near the Desert, to a town called Ephraim, and remained there
        with the disciples.

011:055 The Jewish Passover was coming near, and many from that district
        went up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.

011:056 They therefore looked out for Jesus, and asked one another
        as they stood in the Temple, "What do you think?--will he come
        to the Festival at all?"

011:057 Now the High Priests and the Pharisees had issued orders
        that if any one knew where He was, he should give information,
        so that they might arrest Him.

012:001 Jesus, however, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany,
        where Lazarus was whom He had raised from the dead.

012:002 So they gave a dinner there in honour of Jesus, at which
        Martha waited at table, but Lazarus was one of the guests
        who were with Him.

012:003 Availing herself of the opportunity, Mary took a pound weight
        of pure spikenard, very costly, and poured it over His feet,
        and wiped His feet with her hair, so that the house was filled
        with the fragrance of the perfume.

012:004 Then said Judas (the Iscariot, one of the Twelve--the one
        who afterwards betrayed Jesus),

012:005 "Why was not that perfume sold for 300 shillings and the money
        given to the poor?"

012:006 The reason he said this was not that he cared for the poor,
        but that he was a thief, and that being in charge of the money-box,
        he used to steal what was put into it.

012:007 But Jesus interposed.  "Do not blame her," He said, "allow her
        to have kept it for the time of my preparation for burial.

012:008 For the poor you always have with you, but you have not me always."

012:009 Now it became widely known among the Jews that Jesus was there;
        but they came not only on His account, but also in order
        to see Lazarus whom He had brought back to life.

012:010 The High Priests, however, consulted together to put Lazarus
        also to death,

012:011 for because of him many of the Jews left them and became
        believers in Jesus.

012:012 The next day a great crowd of those who had come to the Festival,
        hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

012:013 took branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him,
        shouting as they went, "God save him!  Blessings on him who
        comes in the name of the Lord--even on the King of Israel!"

012:014 And Jesus, having procured a young ass, sat upon it,
        just as the Scripture says,

012:015 "Fear not, Daughter of Zion!  See, thy King is coming riding
        on an ass's colt."

012:016 The meaning of this His disciples did not understand at the time;
        but after Jesus was glorified they recollected that this
        was written about Him, and that they had done this to Him.

012:017 The large number of people, however, who had been present when He
        called Lazarus out of the tomb and brought him back to life,
        related what they had witnessed.

012:018 This was also why the crowd came to meet Him, because they
        had heard of His having performed that miracle.

012:019 The result was that the Pharisees said among themselves,
        "Observe how idle all your efforts are!  The world is
        gone after him!"

012:020 Now some of those who used to come up to worship at the
        Festival were Greeks.

012:021 They came to Philip, of Bethsaida in Galilee, with the request,
        "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."

012:022 Philip came and told Andrew:  Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

012:023 His answer was, "The time has come for the Son of Man
        to be glorified.

012:024 In most solemn truth I tell you that unless the grain of wheat
        falls into the ground and dies, it remains what it was--
        a single grain; but that if it dies, it yields a rich harvest.

012:025 He who holds his life dear, is destroying it; and he who makes
        his life of no account in this world shall keep it to the Life
        of the Ages.

012:026 If a man wishes to be my servant, let him follow me;
        and where I am, there too shall my servant be.
        If a man wishes to be my servant, the Father will honour him.

012:027 Now is my soul full of trouble; and what shall I say?
        Father, save me from this hour.  But for this purpose I
        have come to this hour.

012:028 Father, glorify Thy name."  Thereupon there came a voice from
        the sky, "I have glorified it and will also glorify it again."

012:029 The crowd that stood by and heard it, said that there had
        been thunder.  Others said, "An angel spoke to him."

012:030 "It is not for my sake," said Jesus, "that that voice came,
        but for your sakes.

012:031 Now is a judgement of this world:  now will the Prince of this
        world be driven out.

012:032 And I--if I am lifted up from the earth--will draw all men to me."

012:033 He said this to indicate the kind of death He would die.

012:034 The crowd answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that
        the Christ remains for ever.  In what sense do you say that
        the Son of Man must be lifted up?  Who is that Son of Man?"

012:035 "Yet a little while," He replied, "the light is among you.
        Be faithful to the light that you have, for fear darkness
        should overtake you; for a man who walks in the dark does
        not know where he is going.

012:036 In the degree that you have light, believe in the Light,
        so that you may become sons of Light."  Jesus said this,
        and went away and hid Himself from them.

012:037 But though He had performed such great miracles in their presence,
        they did not believe in Him--

012:038 in order that the words of Isaiah the Prophet might
        be fulfilled, "Lord, who has believed our preaching?
        And the arm of the Lord--to whom has it been unveiled?"

012:039 For this reason they were unable to believe--because Isaiah
        said again,

012:040 "He has blinded their eyes and made their minds callous,
        lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their minds,
        and should turn, and I should heal them."

012:041 Isaiah uttered these words because he saw His glory;
        and he spoke of Him.

012:042 Nevertheless even from among the Rulers many believed in Him.
        But because of the Pharisees they did not avow their belief,
        for fear they should be shut out from the synagogue.

012:043 For they loved the glory that comes from men rather than
        the glory that comes from God.

012:044 But Jesus cried aloud, "He who believes in me, believes not
        so much in me, as in Him who sent me;

012:045 and he who sees me sees Him who sent me.

012:046 I have come like light into the world, in order that no one
        who believes in me may remain in the dark.

012:047 And if any one hears my teachings and regards them not,
        I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world,
        but to save the world.

012:048 He who sets me at naught and does not receive my teachings
        is not left without a judge:  the Message which I have spoken
        will judge him on the last day.

012:049 Because I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father
        who sent me, Himself gave me a command what to say and in
        what words to speak.

012:050 And I know that His command is the Life of the Ages.
        What therefore I speak, I speak just as the Father has bidden me."

013:001 Now just before the Feast of the Passover this incident took place.
        Jesus knew that the time had come for Him to leave this world
        and go to the Father; and having loved His own who were
        in the world, He loved them to the end.

013:002 While supper was proceeding, the Devil having by this time
        suggested to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, the thought
        of betraying Him, Jesus,

013:003 although He knew that the Father had put everything into His hands,
        and that He had come forth from God and was now going to God,

013:004 rose from the table, threw off His upper garments, and took
        a towel and tied it round Him.

013:005 Then He poured water into a basin, and proceeded to wash
        the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel
        which He had put round Him.

013:006 When He came to Simon Peter, Peter objected.  "Master," he said,
        "are *you* going to wash my feet?"

013:007 "What I am doing," answered Jesus, "for the present you do
        not know, but afterwards you shall know."

013:008 "Never, while the world lasts," said Peter, "shall you
        wash my feet."  "If I do not wash you," replied Jesus,
        "you have no share with me."

013:009 "Master," said Peter, "wash not only my feet, but also my hands
        and my head."

013:010 "Any one who has lately bathed," said Jesus, "does not
        need to wash more than his feet, but is clean all over.
        And you my disciples are clean, and yet this is not true
        of all of you."

013:011 For He knew who was betraying Him, and that was why He said,
        "You are not all of you clean."

013:012 So after He had washed their feet, put on His garments again,
        and returned to the table, He said to them, "Do you understand
        what I have done to you?

013:013 You call me `The Rabbi' and `The Master,' and rightly so,
        for such I am.

013:014 If I then, your Master and Rabbi, have washed your feet,
        it is also your duty to wash one another's feet.

013:015 For I have set you an example in order that you may do what I
        have done to you.

013:016 In most solemn truth I tell you that a servant is not superior
        to his master, nor is a messenger superior to him who sent him.

013:017 If you know all this, blessed are you if you act accordingly.

013:018 I am not speaking of all of you.  I know whom I have chosen,
        but things are as they are in order that the Scripture may
        be fulfilled, which says, `He who eats my bread has lifted
        up his heel against me.'

013:019 From this time forward I tell you things before they happen,
        in order that when they do happen you may believe that I am He.

013:020 In most solemn truth I tell you that he who receives whoever
        I send receives me, and that he who receives me receives Him
        who sent me."

013:021 After speaking thus Jesus was troubled in spirit and said
        with deep earnestness, "In most solemn truth I tell you
        that one of you will betray me."

013:022 The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know
        to which of them He was referring.

013:023 There was at table one of His disciples--the one Jesus loved--
        reclining with his head on Jesus's bosom.

013:024 Making a sign therefore to him, Simon Peter said, "Tell us
        to whom he is referring."

013:025 So he, having his head on Jesus's bosom, leaned back and asked,
        "Master, who is it?"

013:026 "It is the one," answered Jesus, "for whom I shall dip this
        piece of bread and to whom I shall give it."  Accordingly He
        dipped the piece of bread, and took it and gave it to Judas,
        the son of the Iscariot Simon.

013:027 Then, after Judas had received the piece of bread, Satan entered
        into him.  "Lose no time about it," said Jesus to him.

013:028 But why He said this no one else at the table understood.

013:029 Some, however, supposed that because Judas had the money-box
        Jesus meant, "Buy what we require for the Festival,"
        or that he should give something to the poor.

013:030 So Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went out.
        And it was night.

013:031 So when he was gone out, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of
        Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.

013:032 Moreover God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify
        Him without delay.

013:033 Dear children, I am still with you a little longer.
        You will seek me, but, as I said to the Jews, `Where I am
        going you cannot come,' so for the present I say to you.

013:034 A new commandment I give you, to love one another; that as I
        have loved you, you also may love one another.

013:035 It is by this that every one will know that you are my disciples--
        if you love one another."

013:036 "Master," inquired Simon Peter, "where are you going?"
        "Where I am going," replied Jesus, "you cannot be my follower now,
        but you shall be later."

013:037 "Master," asked Peter again, "why cannot I follow you now?
        I will lay down my life on your behalf.

013:038 "You say you will lay down your life on my behalf!" said Jesus;
        "in most solemn truth I tell you that the cock will not crow
        before you have three times disowned me."

014:001 "Let not your hearts be troubled.  Trust in God:
        trust in me also.

014:002 In my Father's house there are many resting-places. Were
        it otherwise, I would have told you; for I am going to make
        ready a place for you.

014:003 And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will return
        and take you to be with me, that where I am you also may be.

014:004 And where I am going, you all know the way."

014:005 "Master," said Thomas, "we do not know where you are going.
        In what sense do we know the way?"

014:006 "I am the Way," replied Jesus, "and the Truth and the Life.
        No one comes to the Father except through me.

014:007 If you--all of you--knew me, you would fully know my Father also.
        From this time forward you know Him and have seen Him."

014:008 "Master," said Philip, "cause us to see the Father:
        that is all we need."

014:009 "Have I been so long among you," Jesus answered, "and yet you,
        Philip, do not know me?  He who has seen me has seen the Father.
        How can *you* ask me, `Cause us to see the Father'?

014:010 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and that the Father
        is in me?  The things that I tell you all I do not speak on
        my own authority:  but the Father dwelling within me carries
        on His own work.

014:011 Believe me, all of you, that I am in the Father and that the Father
        is in me; or at any rate, believe me because of what I do.

014:012 In most solemn truth I tell you that he who trusts in me--
        the things which I do he shall do also; and greater things
        than these he shall do, because I am going to the Father.

014:013 And whatever any of you ask in my name, I will do, in order
        that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

014:014 If you make any request of me in my name, I will do it.

014:015 "If you love me, you will obey my commandments.

014:016 And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate
        to be for ever with you--the Spirit of truth.

014:017 That Spirit the world cannot receive, because it does not see
        Him or know Him.  You know Him, because He remains by your
        side and is in you.

014:018 I will not leave you bereaved:  I am coming to you.

014:019 Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you
        will see me:  because I live, you also shall live.

014:020 At that time you will know that I am in my Father, and that you
        are in me, and that I am in you.

014:021 He who has my commandments and obeys them--he it is who loves me.
        And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will
        love him and will clearly reveal myself to him."

014:022 Judas (not the Iscariot) asked, "Master, how is it that you
        will reveal yourself clearly to us and not to the world?"

014:023 "If any one loves me," replied Jesus, "he will obey my teaching;
        and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make
        our home with him.

014:024 He who has no love for me does not obey my teaching;
        and yet the teaching to which you are listening is not mine,
        but is the teaching of the Father who sent me.

014:025 "All this I have spoken to you while still with you.

014:026 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send
        at my request, will teach you everything, and will bring
        to your memories all that I have said to you.

014:027 Peace I leave with you:  my own peace I give to you.
        It is not as the world gives its greetings that I give you peace.
        Let not your hearts be troubled or dismayed.

014:028 "You heard me say to you, `I am going away, and yet I am coming
        to you.'  If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I
        am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I am.

014:029 I have now told you before it comes to pass, that when it has
        come to pass you may believe.

014:030 In future I shall not talk much with you, for the Prince
        of this world is coming.  And yet in me he has nothing;

014:031 but it is in order that the world may know that I love the Father,
        and that it is in obedience to the command which the Father
        gave me that I thus act.  Rise, let us be going."

015:001 "I am the Vine--the True Vine, and my Father is the vine-dresser.

015:002 Every branch in me--if it bears no fruit, He takes away;
        and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may
        bear more fruit.

015:003 Already you are cleansed--through the teaching which I
        have given you.

015:004 Continue in me, and let me continue in you.  Just as the branch
        cannot bear fruit of itself--that is, if it does not continue
        in the vine--so neither can you if you do not continue in me.

015:005 I am the Vine, you are the branches.  He who continues in me
        and in whom I continue bears abundant fruit, for apart from me
        you can do nothing.

015:006 If any one does not continue in me, he is like the unfruitful
        branch which is at once thrown away and then withers up.
        Such branches they gather up and throw into the fire and
        they are burned.

015:007 "If you continue in me and my sayings continue in you,
        ask what you will and it shall be done for you.

015:008 By this is God glorified--by your bearing abundant fruit
        and thus being true disciples of mine.

015:009 As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you:
        continue in my love.

015:010 If you obey my commands, you will continue in my love, as I
        have obeyed my Father's commands and continue in His love.

015:011 "These things I have spoken to you in order that I may have joy
        in you, and that your joy may become perfect.

015:012 This is my commandment to you, to love one another as I
        have loved you.

015:013 No one has greater love than this--a man laying down his life
        for his friends.

015:014 You are my friends, if you do what I command you.

015:015 No longer do I call you servants, because a servant does not
        know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends,
        because all that I have heard from the Father I have made
        known to you.

015:016 It is not you who chose me, but it is I who chose you and
        appointed you that you might go and be fruitful and that your
        fruit might remain; so that whatever petition you present
        to the Father in my name He may give you.

015:017 "Thus I command you to love one another.

015:018 If the world hates you, remember that it has first had me
        as the fixed object of its hatred.

015:019 If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own property.
        But because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen
        you out of the world--for that reason the world hates you.

015:020 Bear in mind what I said to you, `A servant is not superior
        to his master.'  If they have persecuted me, they will
        also persecute you:  if they have obeyed my teaching,
        they will obey yours also.

015:021 But they will inflict all this suffering upon you on account
        of your bearing my name--because they do not know Him
        who sent me.

015:022 "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin;
        but as the case stands they are without excuse for their sin.

015:023 He who hates me hates my Father also.

015:024 If I had not done among them, as I have, such miracles as no
        one else ever did, they would have had no sin; but they
        have in fact seen and also hated both me and my Father.

015:025 But this has been so, in order that the saying may be fulfilled
        which stands written in their Law, `They have hated me
        without any reason.'

015:026 "When the Advocate is come whom I will send to you from
        the Father's presence--the Spirit of Truth who comes forth
        from the Father's presence--He will be a witness concerning me.

015:027 And you also are witnesses, because you have been with me
        from the first.

016:001 "These things I have spoken to you in order to clear
        stumbling-blocks out of your path.

016:002 You will be excluded from the synagogues; nay more, the time
        is coming when any one who has murdered one of you will suppose
        he is offering service to God.

016:003 And they will do these things because they have failed
        to recognize the Father and to discover who I am.

016:004 But I have spoken these things to you in order that when
        the time for their accomplishment comes you may remember them,
        and may recollect that I told you.  I did not, however, tell you
        all this at first, because I was still with you.

016:005 But now I an returning to Him who sent me; and not one of you
        asks me where I am going.

016:006 But grief has filled your hearts because I have said all
        this to you.

016:007 "Yet it is the truth that I am telling you--it is to your
        advantage that I go away.  For unless I go away, the Advocate
        will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.

016:008 And He, when He comes, will convict the world in respect of sin,
        of righteousness, and of judgement;--

016:009 of sin, because they do not believe in me;

016:010 of righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you
        will no longer see me;

016:011 of judgement, because the Prince of this world is under sentence.

016:012 "I have much more to say to you, but you are unable at present
        to bear the burden of it.

016:013 But when He has come--the Spirit of Truth--He will guide
        you into all the truth.  For He will not speak as Himself
        originating what He says, but all that He hears He will speak,
        and He will make known the future to you.

016:014 He will glorify me, because He will take of what is mine
        and will make it known to you.

016:015 Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said
        that the Spirit of Truth takes of what is mine and will make
        it known to you.

016:016 "A little while and you see me no more, and again a little
        while and you shall see me."

016:017 Some of His disciples therefore said to one another, "What does
        this mean which He is telling us, `A little while and you
        do not see me, and again a little while and you shall see me,'
        and `Because I am going to the Father'?"

016:018 So they asked one another repeatedly, "What can that `little while'
        mean which He speaks of?  We do not understand His words."

016:019 Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask Him, and He said,
        "Is this what you are questioning one another about--
        my saying, `A little while and you do not see me, and again
        a little while and you shall see me'?

016:020 In most solemn truth I tell you that you will weep aloud
        and lament, but the world will be glad.  You will mourn,
        but your grief will be turned into gladness.

016:021 A woman, when she is in labour, has sorrow, because her
        time has come.  But when she has given birth to the babe,
        she no longer remembers the pain, because of her joy at a child
        being born into the world.

016:022 So you also now have sorrow; but I shall see you again,
        and your hearts will be glad, and your gladness no one will
        take away from you.

016:023 You will put no questions to me then.  "In most solemn truth
        I tell you that whatever you ask the Father for in my name
        He will give you.

016:024 As yet you have not asked for anything in my name:  ask, and you
        shall receive, that your hearts may be filled with gladness.

016:025 "All this I have spoken to you in veiled language.
        The time is coming when I shall no longer speak to you
        in veiled language, but will tell you about the Father
        in plain words.

016:026 At that time you will make your requests in my name;
        and I do not promise to ask the Father on your behalf,

016:027 for the Father Himself holds you dear, because you have held me
        dear and have believed that I came from the Father's presence.

016:028 I came from the Father and have come into the world.
        Again I am leaving the world and am going to the Father."

016:029 "Ah, now you are using plain language," said His disciples,
        "and are uttering no figure of speech!

016:030 Now we know that you have all knowledge, and do not need to be
        pressed with questions.  Through this we believe that you
        came from God."

016:031 "Do you at last believe?" replied Jesus.

016:032 "Remember that the time is coming, nay, has already come, for you
        all to be dispersed each to his own home and to leave me alone.
        And yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

016:033 "I have spoken all this to you in order that in me you
        may have peace.  In the world you have affliction.
        But keep up your courage:  *I* have won the victory
        over the world."

017:001 When Jesus had thus spoken, He raised his eyes towards Heaven
        and said, "Father, the hour has come.  Glorify Thy Son
        that the Son may glorify Thee;

017:002 even as Thou hast given Him authority over all mankind,
        so that on all whom Thou hast given Him He may bestow the Life
        of the Ages.

017:003 And in this consists the Life of the Ages--in knowing Thee
        the only true God and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.

017:004 I have glorified Thee on earth, having done perfectly the work
        which by Thine appointment has been mine to do.

017:005 And now, Father, do Thou glorify me in Thine own presence,
        with the glory that I had in Thy presence before the world existed.

017:006 "I have revealed Thy perfections to the men whom Thou gavest me
        out of the world.  Thine they were, and Thou gavest them to me,
        and they have obeyed Thy message.

017:007 Now they know that whatever Thou hast given me is from Thee.

017:008 For the truths which Thou didst teach me I have taught them.
        And they have received them, and have known for certain that I
        came out from Thy presence, and have believed that Thou
        didst send me.

017:009 "I am making request for them:  for the world I do not make
        any request, but for those whom Thou hast given me.
        Because they are Thine,

017:010 and everything that is mine is Thine, and everything that is
        Thine is mine; and I am crowned with glory in them.

017:011 I am now no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I
        am coming to Thee.  "Holy Father, keep them true to Thy name--
        the name which Thou hast given me to bear--that they may be one,
        even as we are.

017:012 While I was with them, I kept them true to Thy name--the name
        Thou hast given me to bear--and I kept watch over them, and not
        one of them is lost but only he who is doomed to destruction--
        that the Scripture may be fulfilled.

017:013 "But now I am coming to Thee, and I speak these words while I
        am in the world, in order that they may have my gladness
        within them filling their hearts.

017:014 I have given them Thy Message, and the world has hated them,
        because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not
        belong to the world.

017:015 I do not ask that Thou wilt remove them out of the world,
        but that Thou wilt protect them from the Evil one.

017:016 They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong
        to the world.

017:017 Make them holy in the truth:  Thy Message is truth.

017:018 Just as Thou didst send me into the world, I also have sent them;

017:019 and on their behalf I consecrate myself, in order that they
        may become perfectly consecrated in truth.

017:020 "Nor is it for them alone that I make request.
        It is also for those who trust in me through their teaching;

017:021 that they may all be one, even as Thou art in me, O Father,
        and I am in Thee; that they also may be in us; that the world
        may believe that Thou didst send me.

017:022 And the glory which Thou hast given me I have given them,
        that they may be one, just as we are one:

017:023 I in them and Thou in me; that they may stand perfected in one;
        that the world may come to understand that Thou didst send me
        and hast loved them with the same love as that with which Thou
        hast loved me.

017:024 "Father, those whom Thou hast given me--I desire that where I
        am they also may be with me, that they may see the glory--
        my glory--my gift from Thee, which Thou hast given me because
        Thou didst love me before the creation of the world.

017:025 And, righteous Father, though the world has failed to
        recognize Thee, I have known Thee, and these have perceived
        that Thou didst send me.

017:026 And I have made known Thy name to them and will make it known,
        that the love with which Thou hast loved me may be in them,
        and that I may be in them."

018:001 After offering this prayer Jesus went out with His
        disciples to a place on the further side of the Ravine
        of the Cedars, where there was a garden which He entered--
        Himself and His disciples.

018:002 Now Judas also, who at that very time was betraying Him,
        knew the place, for Jesus had often resorted there
        with His disciples.

018:003 So Judas, followed by the battalion and by a detachment
        of the Temple police sent by the High Priests and Pharisees,
        came there with torches and lamps and weapons.

018:004 Jesus therefore, knowing all that was about to befall Him,
        went out to meet them.  "Who are you looking for?"
        He asked them.

018:005 "For Jesus the Nazarene," was the answer.  "I am he," He replied.
        (Now Judas who was betraying Him was also standing with them.)

018:006 As soon then as He said to them, "I am he," they went backwards
        and fell to the ground.

018:007 Again therefore He asked them, "Who are you looking for?"
        "For Jesus the Nazarene," they said.

018:008 "I have told you," replied Jesus, "that I am he.
        If therefore you are looking for me, let these my disciples
        go their way."

018:009 He made this request in order that the words He had spoken
        might be fulfilled, "As for those whom Thou hast given me,
        I have not lost one."

018:010 Simon Peter, however, having a sword, drew it, and, aiming at
        the High Priest's servant, cut off his right ear.
        The servant's name was Malchus.

018:011 Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put back your sword.
        Shall I refuse to drink the cup of sorrow which the Father
        has given me to drink?"

018:012 So the battalion and their tribune and the Jewish police closed in,
        and took Jesus and bound Him.

018:013 They then brought Him to Annas first; for Annas was the father-in-law
        of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.

018:014 (It was this Caiaphas who had advised the Jews, saying, "It is
        to your interest that one man should die for the People.")

018:015 Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so also was
        another disciple.  The latter was known to the High Priest,
        and went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest's palace.

018:016 But Peter remained standing outside the door, till the disciple
        who was acquainted with the High Priest came out and induced
        the portress to let Peter in.

018:017 This led the girl, the portress, to ask Peter, "Are you also
        one of this man's disciples?"  "No, I am not," he replied.

018:018 Now because it was cold the servants and the police had lighted
        a charcoal fire, and were standing and warming themselves;
        and Peter too remained with them, standing and warming himself.

018:019 So the High Priest questioned Jesus about His disciples
        and His teaching.

018:020 "As for me," replied Jesus, "I have spoken openly to the world.
        I have continually taught in some synagogue or in the Temple
        where all the Jews are wont to assemble, and I have said
        nothing in secret.

018:021 Why do you question me?  Question those who heard what it was I
        said to them:  these witnesses here know what I said."

018:022 Upon His saying this, one of the officers standing by struck Him
        with his open hand, asking Him as he did so, "Is that the way
        you answer the High Priest?"

018:023 "If I have spoken wrongly," replied Jesus, "bear witness to it
        as wrong; but if rightly, why that blow?"

018:024 So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.

018:025 But Simon Peter remained standing and warming himself, and this
        led to their asking him, "Are you also one of his disciples?"
        He denied it, and said, "No, I am not."

018:026 One of the High Priest's servants, a relative of the man
        whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you
        in the garden with him?"

018:027 Once more Peter denied it, and immediately a cock crowed.

018:028 So they brought Jesus from Caiaphas's house to the Praetorium.
        It was the early morning, and they would not enter the Praetorium
        themselves for fear of defilement, and in order that they
        might be able to eat the Passover.

018:029 Accordingly Pilate came out to them and inquired, "What accusation
        have you to bring against this man?"

018:030 "If the man were not a criminal," they replied, "we would
        not have handed him over to you."

018:031 "Take him yourselves," said Pilate, "and judge him by your Law."
        "We have no power," replied the Jews, "to put any man to death."

018:032 They said this that the words might be fulfilled in which Jesus
        predicted the kind of death He was to die.

018:033 Re-entering the Praetorium, therefore, Pilate called Jesus
        and asked Him, "Are *you* the King of the Jews?"

018:034 "Do you say this of yourself, or have others told it you
        about me?" replied Jesus.

018:035 "Am I a Jew?" exclaimed Pilate; "it is your own nation
        and the High Priests who have handed you over to me.
        What have you done?"

018:036 "My kingdom," replied Jesus, "does not belong to this world.
        If my kingdom did belong to this world, my subjects would have
        resolutely fought to save me from being delivered up to the Jews.
        But, as a matter of fact, my kingdom has not this origin."

018:037 "So then *you* are a king!" rejoined Pilate.  "Yes," said Jesus,
        "you say truly that I am a king.  For this purpose I
        was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world--
        to give testimony for the truth.  Every one who is a friend
        of the truth listens to my voice."

018:038 "What is truth?" said Pilate.  But no sooner had he spoken
        the words than he went out again to the Jews and told them,
        "I find no crime in him.

018:039 But you have a custom that I should release one prisoner
        to you at the Passover.  So shall I release to you the King
        of the Jews?"

018:040 With a roar of voices they again cried out, saying, "Not this man,
        but Barabbas!"  Now Barabbas was a robber.

019:001 Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.

019:002 And the soldiers, twisting twigs of thorn into a wreath,
        put it on His head, and threw round Him a crimson cloak.

019:003 Then they began to march up to Him, saying in a mocking voice,
        "Hail King of the Jews!"  And they struck Him with the palms
        of their hands.

019:004 Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "See, I am
        bringing him out to you to let you clearly understand that I
        find no crime in him."

019:005 So Jesus came out, wearing the wreath of thorns and the
        crimson cloak.  And Pilate said to them, "See, there is the man."

019:006 As soon then as the High Priests and the officers saw Him,
        they shouted "To the cross!  To the cross!"  "Take him
        yourselves and crucify him," said Pilate; "for I, at any rate,
        find no crime in him."

019:007 "We," replied the Jews, "have a Law, and in accordance with that
        Law he ought to die, for having claimed to be the Son of God."

019:008 More alarmed than ever, Pilate no sooner heard these words
        than he re-entered the Praetorium and began to question Jesus.

019:009 "What is your origin?" he asked.  But Jesus gave him no answer.

019:010 "Do you refuse to speak even to me?" asked Pilate; "do you
        not know that I have it in my power either to release you
        or to crucify you?"

019:011 "You would have had no power whatever over me,"
        replied Jesus, "had it not been granted you from above.
        On that account he who has delivered me up to you is more
        guilty than you are."

019:012 Upon receiving this answer, Pilate was for releasing Him.
        But the Jews kept shouting, "If you release this man,
        you are no friend of Caesar's. Every one who sets himself up
        as king declares himself a rebel against Caesar."

019:013 On hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus out, and sat down
        on the judge's seat in a place called the Pavement--
        or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

019:014 It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about six o'clock
        in the morning.  Then he said to the Jews, "There is your king!"

019:015 This caused a storm of outcries, "Away with him!  Away with him!
        Crucify him!"  "Am I to crucify your king?"  Pilate asked.
        "We have no king, except Caesar," answered the High Priests.

019:016 Then Pilate gave Him up to them to be crucified.
        Accordingly they took Jesus;

019:017 and He went out carrying His own cross, to the place
        called Skull-place--or, in Hebrew, Golgotha--

019:018 where they nailed Him to a cross, and two others at the same time,
        one on each side and Jesus in the middle.

019:019 And Pilate wrote a notice and had it fastened to the top of
        the cross.  It ran thus:  JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

019:020 Many of the Jews read this notice, for the place where Jesus
        was crucified was near the city, and the notice was in
        three languages--Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

019:021 This led the Jewish High Priests to remonstrate with Pilate.
        "You should not write `The King of the Jews,'" they said,
        "but that he claimed to be King of the Jews."

019:022 "What I have written I have written," was Pilate's answer.

019:023 So the soldiers, as soon as they had crucified Jesus, took His
        garments, including His tunic, and divided them into four parts--
        one part for each soldier.  The tunic was without seam,
        woven from the top in one piece.

019:024 So they said to one another, "Do not let us tear it.
        Let us draw lots for it."  This happened that the Scripture
        might be fulfilled which says, "They shared my garments
        among them, and drew lots for my clothing."  That was just
        what the soldiers did.

019:025 Now standing close to the cross of Jesus were His mother and His
        mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.

019:026 So Jesus, seeing His mother, and seeing the disciple whom He
        loved standing near, said to His mother, "Behold, your son!"

019:027 Then He said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!"
        And from that time the disciple received her into his own home.

019:028 After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was now brought
        to an end, said--that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
        "I am thirsty."

019:029 There was a jar of wine standing there.  With this wine they
        filled a sponge, put it on the end of a stalk of hyssop,
        and lifted it to His mouth.

019:030 As soon as Jesus had taken the wine, He said, "It is finished."
        And then, bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.

019:031 Meanwhile the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation
        for the Passover, and in order that the bodies might not remain
        on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was one
        of special solemnity), requested Pilate to have the legs
        of the dying men broken, and the bodies removed.

019:032 Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first
        man and also of the other who had been crucified with Jesus.

019:033 Then they came to Jesus Himself:  but when they saw that He
        was already dead, they refrained from breaking His legs.

019:034 One of the soldiers, however, made a thrust at His side
        with a lance, and immediately blood and water flowed out.

019:035 This statement is the testimony of an eye-witness, and it is true.
        He knows that he is telling the truth--in order that you
        also may believe.

019:036 For all this took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled
        which declares, "Not one of His bones shall be broken."

019:037 And again another Scripture says, "They shall look on Him whom
        they have pierced."

019:038 After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus,
        but for fear of the Jews a secret disciple, asked Pilate's permission
        to carry away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave.
        So he came and removed the body.

019:039 Nicodemus too--he who at first had visited Jesus by night--
        came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, in weight about
        seventy or eighty pounds.

019:040 Taking down the body they wrapped it in linen cloths along
        with the spices, in accordance with the Jewish mode of
        preparing for burial.

019:041 There was a garden at the place where Jesus had been crucified,
        and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.

019:042 Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation for
        the Jewish Passover, and the tomb was close at hand,
        they put Jesus there.

020:001 On the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark,
        Mary of Magdala came to the tomb and saw that the stone had
        been removed from it.

020:002 So she ran, as fast as she could, to find Simon Peter
        and the other disciple--the one who was dear to Jesus--
        and to tell them, "They have taken the Master out of the tomb,
        and we do not know where they have put Him."

020:003 Peter and the other disciple started at once to go to the tomb,
        both of them running,

020:004 but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached it
        before he did.

020:005 Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying there
        on the ground, but he did not go in.

020:006 Simon Peter, however, also came, following him, and entered the tomb.
        There on the ground he saw the cloths;

020:007 and the towel, which had been placed over the face of Jesus,
        not lying with the cloths, but folded up and put by itself.

020:008 Then the other disciple, who had been the first to come to the tomb,
        also went in and saw and was convinced.

020:009 For until now they had not understood the inspired teaching,
        that He must rise again from among the dead.

020:010 Then they went away and returned home.

020:011 Meanwhile Mary remained standing near the tomb, weeping aloud.
        She did not enter the tomb, but as she wept she stooped
        and looked in,

020:012 and saw two angels clothed in white raiment, sitting one at
        the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.

020:013 They spoke to her.  "Why are you weeping?" they asked.
        "Because," she replied, "they have taken away my Lord,
        and I do not know where they have put him."

020:014 While she was speaking, she turned round and saw Jesus
        standing there, but did not recognize Him.

020:015 "Why are you weeping?"  He asked; "who are you looking for?"
        She, supposing that He was the gardener, replied, "Sir, if you
        have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I
        will remove him."

020:016 "Mary!" said Jesus.  She turned to Him.  "Rabboni!" she cried
        in Hebrew:  the word means `Teacher!'

020:017 "Do not cling to me," said Jesus, "for I have not yet ascended
        to the Father.  But take this message to my brethren:
        `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God
        and your God.'"

020:018 Mary of Magdala came and brought word to the disciples.
        "I have seen the Master," she said.  And she told them that He
        had said these things to her.

020:019 On that same first day of the week, when it was evening and,
        for fear of the Jews, the doors of the house where the
        disciples were, were locked, Jesus came and stood in their midst,
        and said to them, "Peace be to you!"

020:020 Having said this He showed them His hands and also His side;
        and the disciples were filled with joy at seeing the Master.

020:021 A second time, therefore, He said to them, "Peace be to you!
        As the Father sent me, I also now send you."

020:022 Having said this He breathed upon them and said,
        "Receive the Holy Spirit.

020:023 If you remit the sins of any persons, they remain remitted to them.
        If you bind fast the sins of any, they remain bound."

020:024 Thomas, one of the twelve--surnamed `the Twin'--was not among
        them when Jesus came.

020:025 So the rest of the disciples told him, "We have seen
        the Master!"  His reply was, "Unless I see in his hands
        the wound made by the nails and put my finger into the wound,
        and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it."

020:026 A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas
        was with them, when Jesus came--though the doors were locked--
        and stood in their midst, and said, "Peace be to you."

020:027 Then He said to Thomas, "Bring your finger here and feel my hands;
        bring you hand and put it into my side; and do not be ready
        to disbelieve but to believe."

020:028 "My Lord and my God!" replied Thomas.

020:029 "Because you have seen me," replied Jesus, "you have believed.
        Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

020:030 There were also a great number of other signs which Jesus
        performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not
        recorded in this book.

020:031 But these have been recorded in order that you may believe that He
        is the Christ, the Son of God, and that, through believing,
        you may have Life through His name.

021:001 After this, Jesus again showed Himself to the disciples.
        It was at the Lake of Tiberias.  The circumstances were as follows.

021:002 Simon Peter was with Thomas, called the Twin, Nathanael of
        Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zabdi, and two others of
        the Master's disciples.

021:003 Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing."  "We will go too,"
        said they.  So they set out and went on board their boat;
        but they caught nothing that night.

021:004 When, however, day was now dawning, Jesus stood on the beach,
        though the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

021:005 He called to them.  "Children," He said, "have you any
        food there?"  "No," they answered.

021:006 "Throw the net in on the right hand side," He said, "and you
        will find fish."  So they threw the net in, and now they
        could scarcely drag it along for the quantity of fish.

021:007 This made the disciple whom Jesus loved say to Peter, "It is
        the Master."  Simon Peter therefore, when he heard the words,
        "It is the Master," drew on his fisherman's shirt--
        for he had not been wearing it--put on his girdle, and sprang
        into the water.

021:008 But the rest of the disciples came in the small boat (for they
        were not far from land--only about a hundred yards off),
        dragging the net full of fish.

021:009 As soon as they landed, they saw a charcoal fire burning there,
        with fish broiling on it, and bread close by.

021:010 Jesus told them to fetch some of the fish which they
        had just caught.

021:011 So Simon Peter went on board the boat and drew the net ashore
        full of large fish, 153 in number; and yet, although there
        were so many, the net had not broken.

021:012 "Come this way and have breakfast," said Jesus.  But not one
        of the disciples ventured to question Him as to who He was,
        for they felt sure that it was the Master.

021:013 Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave them some,
        and the fish in the same way.

021:014 This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed Himself
        to the disciples after He had risen from among the dead.

021:015 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon,
        son of John, do you love me more than these others do?"
        "Yes, Master," was his answer; "you know that you are dear to me."
        "Then feed my lambs," replied Jesus.

021:016 Again a second time He asked him, "Simon, son of John,
        do you love me?"  "Yes, Master," he said, "you know that you
        are dear to me."  "Then be a shepherd to my sheep," He said.

021:017 A third time Jesus put the question:  "Simon, son of John,
        am I dear to you?"  It grieved Peter that Jesus asked him
        the third time, "Am I dear to you?"  "Master," he replied,
        "you know everything, you can see that you are dear to me."
        "Then feed my much-loved sheep," said Jesus.

021:018 "In most solemn truth I tell you that whereas, when you were young,
        you used to put on your girdle and walk whichever way you chose,
        when you have grown old you will stretch out your arms
        and some one else will put a girdle round you and carry you
        where you have no wish to go."

021:019 This He said to indicate the kind of death by which that disciple
        would bring glory to God; and after speaking thus He said
        to him, "Follow me."

021:020 Peter turned round and noticed the disciple whom Jesus
        loved following--the one who at the supper had leaned
        back on His breast and had asked, "Master, who is it that
        is betraying you?"

021:021 On seeing him, Peter asked Jesus, "And, Master, what about him?"

021:022 "If I desire him to remain till I come," replied Jesus,
        "what concern is that of yours?  You, yourself, must follow me."

021:023 Hence the report spread among the brethren that that disciple
        would never die.  Yet Jesus did not say, "He is not to die,"
        but, "If I desire him to remain till I come, what concern
        is that of yours?"

021:024 That is the disciple who gives his testimony as to these matters,
        and has written this history; and we know that his
        testimony is true.

021:025 But there are also many other things which Jesus did--so vast
        a number indeed that if they were all described in detail,
        I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books
        that would have to be written.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
