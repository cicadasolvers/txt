Transcriber's note:

      This text file is intended for users whose text readers cannot
      display the Unicode/UTF-8 version. The oe-ligature is displayed
      as "oe." One Greek phrase is shown in transliteration between
      number signs (#IES. Chrs.#).

      The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six
      volumes. Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further
      divided into two e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume I, the
      General Introduction, will be released after all other volumes,
      matching the original publication order.

      Except for footnotes and sidenotes, all brackets are in the
      original, as are parenthetical question marks and (_sic_)
      notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are shown
      as in the printed original.

      The year was shown in a sidenote at the top of each page; this
      has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
      Letter or Abstract.

      A carat character is used to denote superscription. The
      character(s) following the carat is superscripted (example:
      vj^ti). Braces { } are used only when the superscripted
      text is immediately followed by non-superscripted letters
      or period (full stop). Subscripts (rare) are shown with
      single lines _.Errata and other transcriber's notes are
      shown in [[double brackets]].

      Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page
      number to make them usable with the full Index. They are
      grouped at the end of each Letter or Abstract.

      Typographical errors are listed at the end of each Letter,
      after the footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
      corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing
      italics, or mechanical, such as u-for-n misprints. Italic
      "d" misprinted as "a" was a recurring problem, especially
      in Volume IV. The word "invisible" means that there is
      an appropriately sized blank space, but the letter or
      punctuation mark itself is missing. The form "corrected
      by author" refers to the Errata printed at the end of the
      Letters, in Volume VI.

      Specifics: The spelling "Jhon" is not an error. Gresham and
      Tresham are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent
      spelling of the name "Lipyate" or "Lipgate" in footnotes is
      unchanged.

      Note that the printed book used z to represent original small
      letter yogh. This has not been changed for the e-text.

SIR JOHN PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[1-1]

_To John Paston, Esquyer, be thys lettre delyveryd, or to my mestresse,
hys wyffe, at Norwych, to delyver to hym._

[Sidenote: 1478 / AUG. 25]

Brother John, I recomaund me to yow, and I thanke God, my sustr yowr

wetyng ther off; I hadde knowlege by ffootemen, or ever ye kowde ffynde
any messenger on horsbak to brynge me worde theroff.

Sir, it is soo, that the Duke off Bokyngham shall come on pilgrymage to
Walsyngham, and so to Bokenham Castell to my lady hys sustr;[1-2] and
then it is supposyd that he shalle to my Lady off Norffolk.[1-3] And myn
oncle William comythe with hym; and he tellyth me, that ther is like to
be troble in the maner off Oxenhed; wherffor I praye yow take hedde
lesse that the Duke off Suffolk councell pley therwith now at the
vacacion[1-4] off the beneffyse, as they ded with the beneffice off
Drayton, whyche by the helpe off Mr. John Salett and Donne hys man, ther
was a qweste made by the seyde Donne, that ffownde that the Duke off
Suffolk was verrye patrone, whyche was ffalse, yitt they ded it ffor an
evydence; but nowe iff any suche pratte scholde be laboryd, it is I hope
in bettr case, ffor suche a thynge most needs be ffownde byffor Master
John Smyth, whyche is owr olde ffreende; wherffor I praye yow labor hym,
that, iff neede bee, he maye doo use a ffreends torne therin.

Item, bothe ye and I most neds take thys mater as owr owne, and it weer
ffor noon other cawse butt ffor owr goode grawnt dames sake;
neverthelesse ye woote well, thatt ther is an other entresse longyng to
usse afftr her dyscease; iffe ther be any suche thynge begune ther by
suche a fryer or prest, as it is seyde, I mervayle that ye sente me no
worde ther off; butt ye have nowe wyffe and chyld, and so moche to kar
ffor, thatt ye fforgete me.

As for tydyngs her, I her telle that my cosyn Sir Robert Chamberleyn
hathe entyrd the maner of Scolton uppon yowr bedffelawe[2-1] Conyerse,
wheroff ye sende me no worde.

Item, yonge William Brandon is in warde and arestyd ffor thatt he

yitt was nott therwith easyd, butt swyvyd hyr oldest dowtr, and than
wolde have swyvyd the other sustr bothe; wherffor men sey ffowle off
hym, and that he wolde ete the henne and alle hyr chekynnys; and som
seye that the Kynge entendyth to sitte uppon hym, and men seye he is
lyke to be hangyd, ffor he hathe weddyd a wedowe.

Item, as ffor the pagent that men sey that the Erle off Oxenforde[2-2]
hathe pleyid atte Hammys, I suppose ye have herde theroff; itt is so
longe agoo, I was nott in thys contre when the tydyngs come, therfor I
sent yow no worde theroff.

But ffor conclusion, as I her seye, he lyepe the wallys, and wente to
the dyke, and in to the dyke to the chynne; to whatt entent I can nott
telle; some sey, to stele awey, and some thynke he wolde have drownyd
hymselffe, and so it is demyd.

No mor, but I ame nott sertayne whether I shall come home in haste or

    either did not attempt to disturb her right; or at least did not
    succeed, if he endeavoured to do it.--F. It will be seen by No.
    935 that before presenting William Barthulmew she presented Dr.
    Richard Lyncoln.]

ABSTRACT[3-2]

WILLIAM PASTON TO NICHOLAS GOLDEWELL

[Sidenote: 1478 / OCT. 9]

Spoke to him on Sunday about a clerk presented by William Paston's
mother to the Church of Oxnead, and not admitted, though the
presentation was delivered to Master John Bulman, my lord's deputy,
within the time limited by law. Requests him to get the Bishop to do him
justice. The living is of small value, and the delay can be of little
benefit to my lord. Desires an answer by the bearer, Sir William Upgate,
Vicar of Castre.

Norwich, 9 Oct.

ABSTRACT[3-3]

WILLIAM PASTON TO WILLIAM POPE OF BACTON

[Sidenote: 1478 / OCT. 17]

Cannot be at the Court at Paston on Monday next. Bids him warn the
tenants to keep the Court on Friday instead, and to bring their rents,
for he will be there himself. He is also to warn the tenants of Bakton
to-morrow openly in the church of the said Court to be kept on Friday
next; also the tenants of Swaffeld, Mundesley,[4-1] Edyngthorpe, and
Wytton.

  Rughton.']

    [Footnote 3-3: _Ibid._]

    [Footnote 4-1: This name is very ill written, and looks more like
    'Maxsley'; but Mundesley is the only place in the neighbourhood
    that seems at all probable.]

    [Footnote 4-3: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] William Paston, the writer
    of this letter, was a younger son of old John Paston, and brother
    of the John Paston to whom the letter is addressed. He was born,
    as Fenn tells us, in 1459, and it will be seen by what is said of
    him in Letter 842 that he could not possibly be older. He was now
    at Eton finishing his education, and we have a letter from him
    written there on the 23rd of February 1479, which gives good
    reason for attributing this to the November immediately before.]

    [Footnote 6-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Walter Paston, to whom
    this letter refers, died in August 1479. This letter was probably
    written in the beginning of the same year. The date certainly
    cannot be 1478, if No. 926 has been assigned to the right year,
    for it will be seen that the writer was then in London, and so
    much occupied that he had little prospect of visiting Norfolk for
    some time.]

    [Footnote 6-2: James Goldwell was consecrated by Pope Sextus IV.
    Bishop of Norwich in 1472. He resided much at his manor of Hoxne,

WILLIAM PASTON, JUNIOR, TO JOHN PASTON[7-2]

_To his worchepfull broder, John Paston, be thys delivered in hast._

Quaeritur, Quomodo non valet hora, valet mora? Unde dicitur?

    Arbore jam videas exemplum. Non die possunt,
      Omnia suppleri; sed tamen illa mora.[8-1]

And thes too verse afore seyde be of myn own makyng.

No more to yow at thys tyme, but God have yow in Hys kepyng.

    [Footnote 7-2: [From Fenn, i. 296.] This letter was written on the
    23rd of February, and the Monday following the date was the first
    Monday of Lent. These particulars prove the letter to have been
    written in 1479, when William Paston was between nineteen and
    twenty years of age.]

PARSONAGE OF OXNEAD[9-1]

[Sidenote: 1479]

Memorandum.--The day that the lapse went out, which is such day vj.
monethes as the seid parson died, was on Tewesday, Our Lady Day, the
Nativite, the viij^te day of Septembre last past, anno xviij^o.

The day of vj. monethes affter Our seide Lady Day, the Nativite was on
Seint Mathes Day[9-2] the Apostell, last past, whiche was the xxiiij.
day of Februare, and so I deme eyther the Bisshoppe of Norwiche hath
presented or els it is in the gifft of my Lord Cardinall[9-3] nowe.
Inquere this mater, for the Bisshoppe of Norwich lythe in London, and
shall doo till Our Ladys Day this Lenton, as it is said here.

My moder delivered Sir William Holle his presentacion the xiij. day of
August, anno xviij^o, which was nere a monethe or the day of the vj.
monethes went out and past. Wherfore the Bisshoppe ought to present my
moders clarke. Neverthelesse the Bisshoppys officeres aunsware this
sayng, that if sondry persones deliver ij. sondrye presentacions for to
diverse clarkes to the Bisshoppes officers for one benefice, that then
the seid partyes shuld sue to the Bisshop at ther cost to have out an
inquerre to inquere _de vero patrono_, sayng forther more, that if they
sue nat out this inquerre with affect, and that the lapse fall, than it
is lefull for the Bisshop to present, and it is told me that the lawe is
this, that the Bisshoppe, be his office with out any sute of the
parties, shall call an inquerre afore hym to inquere _de vero patrono_,
and he shall assign them a day to bryng in a verdett, and he shall warne
bothe partyes to be ther at, and he shall amytte his clarke that is
founde patron.

Yet the Bisshopp useth nat to do this, but there as bothe partyes that
present are myghty [and wher as he thynketh it were a jopardy to
hym][10-1] to sue the Bisshoppe if he did them any wrong, and wher as
ther is a doubtable mater; but in this case the prest that troubleth my
moder is but a simple felowe, and he is _appostata_, for he was somtyme
a White Frere, and of simple repetacyon, and of litill substans, as my
moder can tell, wherfore Bisshoppys use nat in suche litill casys to
take so streyte an inquerre, and specyally wher as one hath contynued
patron with out interupcion so long as my moder hath done, for she hath
contynued more than l. wynter; wherfore I pray yow shewe my cousyn
Lovell this bill, and fynde some meanes to intrete the Bisshopp by the
meane of James Hobard,[10-2] which is grete with the Bisshopp, and is
nowe Reder of Lyncoln Inne this Lent. And late my lady speke to James
Hobard in the mater. If it please my moder ther is a prest callde Sir
----[10-3] which is thought by the tenauntes of Oxned a metely man to be
parson ther; the most thyng that I dowte, bicause Sir William Holle,
whom my moder presented, is ronne away, and if the Bisshop will nat
present my moders clarke in her title, than I wold that the labour myght
be made to the Bisshopp, that he myght present my moders clarke, suche
on as shoe will name, in his one title.

Ric. Lee, like as ze may understand be this writing, where as I
understod that the Bisshopp myght have kept the benefice but vj.
monethes after the patrons vj. monethes war worn out, now I understand
the contrary, for I understand he may kepe it a twelmo[nethe] and a day
. . . . [_several lines lost_] . . . . . .

Also, if ze knew any yong preste in London that setteth billis upon
Powlys dorr per aventure wold be glad to have it, and woll be glad also
to serve my lady and my moder for it for a season, I can no more say but
purvay a mean to the Bisshopp, that som mon may be put in by my moders
title.

. . . . . of the consistore in Norwich, and he hath a broder in the
Tower, is master of the Mynt under Brice, called Bartilmew Rede, and a

Billinges gate, a brue hous, for the sei[d] gold smyth hath maried a
bruewyf, and kepeth the brue hous, (?) and he can good skylle to helpe
in this mater of the benefice of Oxned.

Also, Ric. Lee, who so ever shalbe [presented to the] benefice of Oxned,
he muste tell hym, I must pay xiiij. marc to the frutes, and ther for
shall he have [da]yes of payment to pay a marc azey[n] if he d[o] gete

[Sidenote: 1479 / JULY 19]

Harry Waryns, I grete you well, and I thanke you for youre labour. And
as for the tenauntez of Knapton, I understand by youre writing that they
take non oder consideration to my sendyng but that I call so fast on my
fee, for cause they thynke that I am aferd lest I shuld have it no
longer; and as for that, I pray yow tell them for ther ungentilnes I
woll have my fee of them, and in that maner and in non oder place; and
ferthermor I shall fynd the mene that they shall paye it more hastely
here after. And as for the money that they offyr to pay at the fest of
Advincula Sancti Petri, receyve ye it off them and I shall assign one to
receyve it azen of yow. As for the delivere of the catell, I fele be
zowr wrytyng they will non sounar pay it thow ther catell shuld dye ffor
ffawte off mete. Wer for, affor the money be paid I putt that in zour
discresseon wheder ze will deliver them or nay; as ze do I hold me
content.

Also as for Thomas Child, I understand be zour wrytyng he will not seale
the indenture be cawse ther is no some of mony sertayne ne days of
payment sett in the indentur; and as for that, I will neyther sett some
nor days after his will; and if he will nat seale that, he shall never
seale none for me; and at last I am sure he shall sell. I send zow azen
the same indenture that ze sent me, that ze may kepe it still as long as
Thomas Chyld abyde now at Paston, in aventure the casse may hap that he
will sell yt herafter; and yff he be on departid, than send me both the
indenture[s] to London be some massenger. As for Waryn Kynge, wer I
understand be zour wrytyn that he seyth he delyver me all evydens,
I understand not that; and as for rentall I am sure he deliver me none,
and yff so be that he can make the rentall be hart, I wold he did make
on [_one_], for it war necessare for me; for I understand be zow that
ther was no rent gaderid this xv. ar xvj. zer for defallte off a

_To the ryght worshypfull mestresse, Margret Paston, be thys delyveryd._

[Sidenote: 1479 / OCT. 29]

Please it yow to weet, that I have ben heer at London a xiiij. nyght,
wheroff the ffyrst iiij. dayes I was in suche ffeer off the syknesse,
and also ffownde my chambr and stuffe nott so clene as I demyd, whyche
troblyd me soor; and as I tolde yow at my departyng, I was nott weell
monyed, ffor I hadde nott paste x. marke, wheroff I departyd xl_s._ to
be delyveryd off my olde bedfelawe; and then I rode be yonde Donstaple,
and ther spake with on off my cheffe witnessis, whyche promysed me to
take labor, and to gete me wryghtyngs towchyng thys mater bytwyen me and
the Duke of Suffolk,[21-2] and I rewardyd hym xx_s._; and then, as I

replegge owte my gowne off velwett and other geer.

And then I hopyd to have borowyd some off Townesend, and he hath ffoodyd

Item, I undrestande that myn oncle William hathe made labor to th'

helpe off the Exchetor all myght be as beste is; and iff my brother and
Lomnor take labor her in, I shal recompence ther costs.

Wretyn in haste with schort advisement on the Frydaye next Seynt Symonds

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[23-1]

_To Syr John Paston, Knyght._

[Sidenote: 1479 / NOV. 6]

Syr, aftyr all dwtes of recomendacyon, pleasyt to undyrstand, that,
acordyng to your lettre sent me by Wyllson, Lomnore and I mett at
Norwyche and drew ought a formable bylle ought of your, and send it ayen
to th'Exchetore Palmer by my brodyr Edmund, whyche had an other erand in
to that contre to spek with H. Spylman, to get hys good wyll towardes
the bargayn lyek to be fynyshed hastyly betwyx Mastres Clyppysby and
hym. And, syr, at the delyvere of the bylle of inquisicyon to
th'Exchetour, my brodyr Edmund told hym that accordyng to your wryghtyng
to me, I spak with myn oncle William, and told hym that I undyrstood by
yow that my Lord of Elye had aswell desyred hym in wryghtyng as you by
mouthe, that non of you shold swe to have the inquisycion fond aftyr
your intentys tyll other weyes of pese wer takyn betwyx you; wherfor my
brodyr Edmund desyred hym that with ought myn oncle labord to have it
fond for hym, ellys that he shold not procede for yow; but th'Exchetour
answerd hym that he wold fynd it for you, aftyr your byll, of hys owne
autorite; and so it was fond. But, syr, ye must remembre that my Lord of
Ely desyred myn oncle as well as you to surcease, as I put myn oncle in
knowlage, and myn oncle at the fyrst agreid that he wold make no more
sute a bought it, in trust that ye wold do the same, acordyng to my Lord
of Elys desyer; wherfor ye had ned to be ware that th'Exchetor skyppe
not from you, when he comyth to London, and sertyfye it, or ye spek with
hym. Th'Exchetor shalbe at London by Twysdaye or Wednysday next comyng,
at John Leeis house, for he shall ryd forwardys as on Monday next comyng
be tymys, &c.

Syr, your tenauntes at Crowmer sey that they know not who shalbe ther
lord; they marvayll that ye nor no man for yow hathe not yet ben there.
Also, when I was with myn oncle, I had a longe pystyll of hym, that ye
had sent Pekok to Paston, and comandyd the tenauntes ther that they
shold pay non areragys to hym, but if [_unless_] they wer bond to hym by
obligacyon for the same; myn oncle seythe it was other wyse apoyntyd be
for the arbytrorys; they thought, he seythe, as well my Mastyr
Fytzwalter as other, that he shold receyve that as it myght be gadryd;
but now he seythe, that he wottyth well some shall renne away, and some
shall wast it, so that it is nevyr lyek to be gadryd, but lost, and so I
trow it is lyek to be of some of the dettors, what for casuelte of dethe
and thes other causes befor rehersyd; wherfor me thynkyth if it were
apoyntyd befor the arbytrors that he shold receyve theym, as he seythe,
it wer not for you to brek it, or ellys if he be pleyn executor to my
grauntdam, then also he ought to have it. I spek lyek a blynd man, do ye
as ye thynk, for I was at no syche apoyntment befor th'arbytrors, nor I
know not whethyr he is executor to my grauntdam or not, but by hys
seying.

Also, syr, ye must of ryght, consyderyng my brodyr Edmundys diligence in
your maters, sythe your departyng, helpe hym forwardys to myn oncle Syr
George Brown, as my brodyr Edmund preyid yow in hys lettyr that he sent
on to yow by Mondys sone of Norwyche, dwellyng with Thomas Jenney, that
myn oncle Syr George may gett to my brodyr Edmund of the Kyng the
wardshepp of John Clyppysby, son and heyer to John Clyppysby,[24-1] late
of Owby, in the conte of Norffolk, Sqwyr, dwryng the nonnage of my Lord
and Lady of York,[24-2] thow it cost iiij. or v. mark the swte. Let myn
oncle Syr George be clerk of the haniper, and kepe the patent, if it be
grantyd, tyll he have hys mone, and that shall not be longe to.

Myn oncle Syr George may enforme the Kyng for trowthe, that the chyld
shall have no lond duryng hys yong modyrs lyff, and ther is no man her
that wyll mary with hym withought they have some lond with hym, and so
the gyft shall not be gret that the Kyng shold geve hym; and yet I trow
he shold get the modyr by that meane, and in my conseyt the Kyng dothe
but ryght if he graunt my brodyr Edmund Clyppysbys son in recompense for
takyng my brodyr Edmundes son, otherwyse callyd Dyxsons, the chyldys
fadyr being alyve. Dyxson is ded, God have hys sowle, Whom I beseche to
send you your most desyred joye.

Wretyn at Norwyche, on Seynt Leonardes Day.

  J. PASTON.

Syr, it is told me that Nycolas Barlee, the Scyuer, hathe takyn an axion
of dett ayenst me thys terme. I prey yow let Whetley or some body spek
with hym, and lete hym wet that if he swe me softly thys terme, that he
shall be payed or the nexte terme be at an end. It is a bought vj_li._,
and in feythe he shold have had it or thys tyme, and our threshers of
Sweynsthorp had not dyed upp; and if I myght have payed it hym a yer
ago, as well as I trust I shall sone aftyr Crystmass, I wold not for
xij_li._ have brokyn hym so many promessys as I have.

Also, syr, I prey yow send me by the next man that comyth fro London ij.
pottys of tryacle of Jenne,--they shall cost xvj_d._,--for I have spent
ought that I had with my yong wyf, and my yong folkys, and my sylff, and
I shall pay hym that shall bryng hem to me, and for hys caryage. I pray
you lett it be sped.

The pepyll dyeth sore in Norwyche, and specyally abought my house, but
my wyff and my women come not ought, and fle ferther we can not; for at
Sweynsthorpe, sythe my departyng thens, they have dyed, and ben syke nye
in every house of the towne.

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[28-1]

_To my ryght worchepfull modyr, Margaret Paston, at Seynt Peter of

[Sidenote: 1479 / NOV.]

Ryght worchepfull modyr, aftyr all dwtes of humble recomendacyon, as
lowly as I can, I beseche yow of your dayly blyssyng and preyeres. And,
moder, John Clement, berer heroff, can tell yow, the mor pite is, if it
pleasyd God, that my brodyr is beryed in the Whyghte Fryers at London;
whych I thought shold not have ben, for I supposyd that he wold have ben
beryed at Bromholme, and that causyd me so sone to ryd to London to have
purveyd hys brynging hom, and if it had ben hys wylle to have leyn at
Bromholm, I had purposyd all the wey as I have redyn to have brought hom
my grauntdame[28-2] and hym to gedyrs; but that purpose is voyd as now.
But thys I thynke to do when I com to London to spek with my Lord
Chamberleyn,[28-3] and to wynne by hys meanys my Lord of Ely,[28-4] if I
can; and if I may by eny of ther meanys cause the Kyng to take my
servyse and my quarrell to gedyrs, I wyll, and I thynk that Sir George
Brown, Sir Jamys Radclyff, and other of myn aqueyntance, whyche wayte
most upon the Kyng, and lye nyghtly in hys chamber, wyll put to ther
good wyllys. Thys is my wey as yet. And, modyr, I beseche yow, as ye may
get or send eny messengers, to send me yowr avyse and my cosyn Lomeners
to John Leeis hows, taylere, with in Ludgate. I have myche more to
wryght, but myn empty hed wyll not let me remembre it.

Also, modyr, I prey that my brodyr Edmond may ryd to Marlyngforthe,
Oxenhed, Paston, Crowmer, and Caster, and all thes maners to entre in my
name, and to lete the tenants of Oxenhed and Marlyngfor know that I sent
no word to hym to take no mony of theym but ther attornement; wherfor he
wyll not, tyll he her fro me ayen, axe hem non, but lete hym comand
theym to pay to servaunts of myn oncles, nor to hymsylff, nor to non
othyr to hys use, in peyne of payment ayen to me. I thynk if ther shold
be eny money axid in my name, peraventure it wold make my Lady of
Norfolk ayenst me, and cause hyr to thynk I dellt more contrary to hyr
plesure than dyd my brodyr, whom God pardon of Hys gret mercy. I have
sent to entre at Stansted and at Orwellbery, and I have wretyn a bylle
to Anne Montgomery and Jane Rodon to make my Lady of Norffolk, if it
wyll be.

[Sidenote: 1479 / NOV. 28]

My Master Paston, I recomaunde me to yow, preyyng God to have mercy on
my master your brother sowle, to whom ye ar heyre, and also to my
mastras your grauntdam. Wherfore be th'avyse of my mastras your carful
moder, your brothere Edmund, on Sunday next before Sent Andrew, rod to
Marlyngforth, and before alle the tenauntez, examynid on James, kepere
ther for Will. Paston, where he was the weke next before Sent Andrew,
and there he seyd that he was not at Marlingforth from the Monday unto
the Thorday at evyn, and soo there was no man there but your brothers
man at the tyme of his decese; so be that your brothere dyyd sesid, and
your brothere E. bad your man kepe possession to your behoffe, and
warned the tenauntez to pay noo man, til ye hadde spoke them. So
mesemyth that ys a remyttir to your old taylyd titell; comon with your
concell. Forther, at afternoon he was at Oxned to understande how they
had doo, and Peris kepyd your brotheres possession at that tyme; and
your oncle his man was not there, but he assyned anothere pore man to be
ther. Whethere that contynuid the possession of W. Paston or not be
remembrid, &c.

And after the decese, &c., W. Paston sent the man that kepyd possession
to fore to entre and kepe possession, wheche was noo warent be tha
poyntment, for ye stande at your liberte as for ony apoyntment or
comunycacion hadde before, and soo men seme it wer good for yow to
stande at large til ye here more; yf ye myght have my Lord Chamberleyns
good faver and lordship, it were ryght expedyent. As for my Lord of Ely,
dele not wyth hym be owr avyse, for he woll move for trete, and elles be
displesid. Your brother Edmund sent to John Wymond, and he sent word he
wolle be a mene of trete, but wold take noo parte, and as I sopose that
was be Heydons avyse; for your uncle sent to me to be with hym, and also
the same man rodd to Heydon and Wymondham, &c. The brenger of this
letter can tell, for he was with your brothere E. at these placez.

Forther, my mastras your moder gretyth yow well, and sendyth yow her
blessyng, requiryng yow to come oute of that here [_air_] alsone as ye
may; and your brothere E. comaundid hym to yow, and he doth hys
dylygens, and parte for yow full well and saddely yn many behalvys, and
hath brought my maistras your wife to Topcrofte on Friday last, and they
fare all well there; and he yntendith to see my Master Fitz Water, whech
lythe at Freton, ner Long Stratton. And God be your gide yn all your
maters, and brenge yow sone home.

Wretyn at Norwyche, on Sonday at nyght next before Sent Andrew, and

paid his fee, according to the promise made by him and Fouke of Knapton,
when they were with him at Norton. I had a distress and left it for your
sake, but you show no consideration for me, etc.

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[31-2]

_To my ryght worchepfull and most kynd modyr, Margarett Paston._

[Sidenote: 1479 / DEC.]

Ryght werchepfull modyr, aftyr all dutes of humble recomendacyon, as
lowly as I can, I beseche yow of your dayly blessyng and preyer. Pleasyt
yow to undyrstand that wher as ye wyllyd me by Poiness to hast me ought
of the heyer that I am in, it is so that I must pwt me in God, for her
must I be for a season, and in good feyth I shall never, whyll God
sendyth me lyff, dred mor dethe than shame; and thankyd be God, the
sykness is well seasyd here, and also my besyness puttyth awey my fere.
I am drevyn to labore in lettyng of th'execucyon of myn unkynd onclys
entent, wher in I have as yet non other dyscorage, but that I trust in
God he shall fayle of it.

I have spokyn with my Lord of Ely[32-1] dyvers tymys, whyche hathe put
me in serteynte by hys woord, that he wyll be with me ayenst myn oncle
in iche mater that I can shewe that he entendyth to wrong me in; and he
wold fayne have a resonable end betwyx us, wher to he wyll helpe, as he
seythe. And it is serteyn my brodyr, God have hys soule, had promysed to
a byde the reule of my Lord Chamberleyn[32-2] and of my Lord Ely; but I
am not yett so far forthe, nor not wyll be, tyll I know my Lord
Chamberleyns intent, and that I purpose to do to morow, for then I thynk
to bewith hym, with Godes leve. And sythe it is so that God hathe
purveyd me to be the solysytore of thys mater, I thank Hym of Hys grace
for the good lordes, mastrys, and frendys that He hathe sent me, whyche
have perfytely promysyd me to take my cause as ther owne, and those
frendes be not a fewe.

And, modyr, as I best can and may, I thank yow and my cosyn Lomenore of
the good avyse that ye have sent me, and I shall aplye me to do ther
aftyr. Also, modyr, I beseche you on my behalf to thank myn cosyn
Lomnorre for the kindness that he hathe shewyd on to me in gevyng of hys
answer to myn onclys servaunt, whyche was with hym.

Modyr, I wryght not so largely to yow as I wold do, for I have not most
leyser; and also when I have ben with my Lord Chamberleyn, I purpose not
to tery longe aftyr in London, but to dresse me to yow wardes; at whyche
tyme I trust I shall brynge yow more serteynte of all the fordell
[_advantage_] that I have in my besyness then I can as yett wryght.

I am put in serteynte by my most specyall good mastyr, my Mastyr of the
Rollys,[32-3] that my Lord of Ely is, and shal be bettyr lord to me then
he hathe shewyd as yet, and yet hathe he delt with me ryght well and
honourably.

Modyr, I beseche yow that Pekok may be sent to purvey me as myche money
as is possybyll for hym to make ayenst my comyng home, for I have myche
to pay her in London, what for the funerall costes, dettes, and legattes
that must be content in gretter hast then shalbe myn ease. Also I wold
the ferme barly in Flegge, as well as at Paston, if ther be eny, wer
gadryd, and iff it may be resonably sold, then to be sold or putt to the
maltyng; but I wold at Caster that it were ought of the tenauntes handys
for thynges that I here (kepe ye consell thys fro Pekok and all folkys),
whyche mater I shall appese, if God wyll geve me leve.

    [Footnote 31-2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] It is evident from the
    contents that this letter was written shortly after the death of
    Sir John Paston. The year 1479 was a year of great mortality, in
    which the Paston family lost three of its members. The letter is
    not signed, but is in John Paston's hand.]

JOHN PASTON TO ----[34-2]

[Sidenote: 1479-80]

Sir, I pray yow that ye will send sum chyld to my Lord of Bukingham
place, and to the Crown, wich as I conseive is called Gerardes Hall, in
Bred Stret, to inquere whedir I have any answer of my letter sent to
Caleys, whech ye know off; and that ye will remembre my brotheris ston,
so that it myth be mad er I cumm ageyn, and that it be klenly wrowgth.
It is told me that the man at Sent Bridis is no klenly portrayer;
[the]rfor I wold fayn it myth be portrayed be sum odir man, and he to
grave it up.

Sir, it is informyd sum personis in this cuntre that ye know that the
frere will sew a nodir delegaci fro Rome, direkt to sum byschop of
Ingland, to amend his mater, &c.; and how be it that it may not gretly
hurt, yet the seyd persones, &c., wold not he shuld have his entent, in
asmoch as his suggestion is untrew, but rather they wold spend mony to
lette it. I suppose the Abbot of Bery shuld labor for him rather than
anodir, becawse the sey Abbot is a perteynor to the lord that is the
freris mayntener, &c.; wherefor, ser, my moder and I pray yow enquere
after a man callid Clederro, whych is solisitor and attorne with Master
Will. Grey, that late was the Kingges proktor at Rome, and the seyd
Clederro sendith matiers and letters owth of Ingelond to his seyd master
ever[y] monith, &c. He is well knowe in London, and among the Lumbardes,
and with the Bischop of Winchesteris men, but I wot not wher he dwellit
in London, and I suppos if ye speke with him, he knowith me. Plese yow
to comone with him of this mater, but let him not wete of the mater
atwix my modir and him; but desir him to wryth to his master to lett
this, if it may be, or elles to se the best wey that he have not his
intent, and to comon with the proktor of the Whith Freris at Rome to hep
forth, for the freris here have laborid to my moder, and praid her to
lette his ontrewe intent, and have wrete to her proketor befor this. And
I suppose if ye speke to the prior of the freris at London, he will
writh to her seyd proktor, &c., but tell the prior no word that I know
[ther]of, but let him wete if he will wryth to his proktor, odir men
shall help forth.

More over, that ye will tell Cledero that I am not seker that the frere
laborith thus, but be talis of freris and odir; nevertheles let him
writh to his master that [for] whatsomevyr he do herin, he shall be
truly content for his labor and costes. And if ye think that Cledro will
writh effectually herin, geff hym j. noble, [bid] hym let his master
know that my Lord of Wynchester[35-1] and Danyell ow godwill to the part
that he shall labor for. And if thar be fown no sech sewth be the seyd
[fre]re, yet wold I have sum thing fro Rome to anull the old bull, &c.,
or to apeyr [_impair_] it [if] it myth be do esily, &c., and tyding
wheder ther be any sech sute, &c.

  Your own, &c.

[For] how beit that it may nowthir avayl ner hurt, yet my moder will
this be do. [I] send yow the copi of the bull, and how execucion was do,
and informacion of the mater imparte, &c. And, sir, I sha content your
noble, &c. And I pray yow red it over, and spede yow homeward, and bring
this letter home with yow, &c.

    [Footnote 34-2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] As this letter refers to
    the making of a tombstone for Sir John Paston, it may be presumed
    to have been written either at the end of the year 1479, or in the
    course of the year 1480. The MS. is a rough draft, apparently in
    the hand of Edmund Paston. It has been slightly mutilated, and
    apparently since the letter was printed in Fenn's fifth volume.]

ABSTRACT[39-2]

WILLIAM PASTON TO HIS BROTHER EDMUND PASTON

[Sidenote: After 1479]

Encloses the will of his father, 'such as my brother hath'; who says he
had it out of the register. My business is no further advanced since I
left you, except that my brother has got a pardon of the alienation made
by the Bishop of Winchester. Can get no estate in it except according to
his father's will, viz. to himself and his heirs-male. My brother's will
is that I should have Runham, which is L8 a year at least, in recompense
of the 10 marks out of Sporle, if he would release all his right in that
manor. There is nothing touching you in my brother's[40-1] will, for I
read it over and will write it also; 'so that I woll have the same for
my copy that he wrote with his own hand.'

Recommend me heartily to my sister your wife.

  London, 22 Feb.

  [The writer of this was William, the son of the eldest John Paston,
  not that uncle William with whom the two younger John Pastons had so
  many disputes. I see nothing to fix the date beyond the fact that
  the letter was written after Sir John Paston's death.]

    after Sir John Paston's death.]

    [Footnote 41-3: [From Fenn, iii. 400.] On the date of this letter
    Fenn remarks as follows:--'John Titleshale was prior of Bromholm
    from 1460 for about twenty years. This letter must have been
    written therefore either on the 14th October 1460, or on the same
    day in 1465, as Edward IV. married in that year, and J. Paston
    died in May 1466. If it was written in the former, the request
    [for timber] must have been to Queen Margaret; if in the latter,
    to Elizabeth, the Queen of Edward IV.' In these observations Fenn
    overlooks the possibility of the letter having been addressed to
    any other John Paston than the first of that name; and neither of
    the two years, which alone suit that supposition, has much
    internal probability. It is inconceivable that the letter could
    have been written in 1460, when Queen Margaret had retired into
    Wales after the battle of Northampton, and it is almost equally
    improbable that the date could have been 1465, when John Paston,
    the father, was in prison. We have very little doubt that the
    letter was addressed to John Paston the youngest, called of
    Gelston, long after his father's death, and after that of his
    brother Sir John also. John Tytleshale, who was Prior of Bromholm
    in 1460, was succeeded, at what date we are not informed, by John
    Macham; and after him John Underwood, Bishop of Chalcedon,
    suffragan of the Bishop of Norwich, was prior in 1509. The date of
    this letter, however, must lie between 1480 and 1487, in which
    latter year John Paston the youngest was created a knight for his
    services at the battle of Stoke.]

    [Footnote 43-2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] There is nothing to show
    the date of this letter, except the fact that William Paston did
    not come of age before the year 1481, so that it is not likely to
    be earlier. Perhaps it may be a few years later, in which case the
    widow would not have been very much his senior; but that
    circumstance was not likely, in those days, to have been greatly
    regarded in the matter.]

    [Footnote 44-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Fenn dates this letter
    1479-80, suggesting that it must have been written very soon after
    Edmund Paston's marriage with the widow of William Clippesby, as
    it seems to imply that he had not yet carried his bride to pay her
    duty to his mother. I do not, for my part, know the date of this
    marriage, and I suspect Fenn had no other clue to it than the fact
    that William Clippesby, the lady's first husband, died on the 24th
    September 1479; but I presume his widow was still unmarried when
    she proved his will on the 18th May 1480 (_see_ Blomefield, xi.
    144). I consider, therefore, that the letter must have been
    written between the years 1481 and 1484, as Margaret Paston died
    in November of the latter year.]

_To my right worshipfull master, John Paston, in haste._

[Sidenote: 1482(?) / NOV. 1]

Right reverent and worshipfull sir, in my moste umble vice, I recomaunde

Alexander Qwharteyn, John Fille, with the parson and the newe myller of

Twesday last past, caryed a wey from Merlyngforth in to the place at
Seint Edmondes in Norwich, xij. of yowr greete plankes, of the weche
they made vj. loodes, beryng a bowte the seide cartes, bowes and gleves,
for feere of takyng a wey. Sir, as for yowr servauntes of Marlyngforth,
they withholde her catell and hem selfe bothe from the coorte, and come
not within the lordship, nor make noon attornment, exept Thom' Davy and
John Water, weche absentyng of the tenauntes is to them a greet hurt and
los, for lak of sedyng ther londes with ther wynter corn; besechyng you
for Godes sake to remembre som remedy for them.

My Lady Caltorp hath ben at Geppeswich on pilgry mache, and came homward
be my Lady of Norffolk, and ther was moche communicacion of yowr mater
be twix you and myn uncle, seyng to my Lady Caltorp, ye nede not a gonne

Caltorp of the mocion that he made towchyng the maner of Sporle,
promyttyng to my lady to abyde that, and to write and seale as largely
as any man wol desire hym. And at his departyng from my lady he was not
mery, what the cauce was I wot not [but he was not mery of your
departyng].[57-2] My Lady Calthorp desireth me to write to yow to have
ende, for he intendes largely to have a peace with yow, as he seth; but
truste hym not to moche, for he is not goode.

My mother in lawe thynketh longe she here no word from you. She is in

Sir, I prey yow, if ye tary longe at London, that it wil plese to sende
for me, for I thynke longe sen I lay in yowr armes.

    [Footnote 56-2: _Ibid._ This letter, it will be seen, must have
    been written before the death of Margaret Paston in 1484, and from
    what is stated in No. 953, it is certainly not earlier than 1479.
    The date, moreover, must be between 1480 and 1482, for it is
    stated that the outrages here complained of occurred on the Monday
    and Tuesday before the letter was written; and in the next letter
    we find that there was a new outrage of the same description on
    Friday. If Hallowmas Day, the date of this letter, was a
    Wednesday, the year must be 1480, if a Thursday 1481, and if
    Friday 1482. We are rather inclined to think it was the latter.]

MARGERY PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[58-1]

_To my ryght wurchupfull mayster, John Paston, Esquyer, be this letter
delyverd in hast._

[Sidenote: 1482 / NOV. [3]]

Myne owyn swete hert, in my most humylwyse, I recomaund me on to you,
desyryng hertly to here of your welfar, the wheche I beseche Alle myghty
God preserve and kepe to His plesur, and your hertes desyer.

Ser, the cause of my wrytyng to you at this tyme: on Friday att nyght
last past come Alexander Wharton, John Hous, and John Fille, with ij.
good carts well mannyd and horsyd with hem to Marlyngford, and there at
the maner of Malyngford and at the mille lodyn bothe cartes with
mestlyon[58-2] and whete, and betymys on Saturday, in the mornyng, they
departyd fro Marlyngford towardes Bongey, as it is seyd; for the seyd
cartes come fro Bongey, as I soppose, by the sendynge of Bryon, for he
goth hastyly over the se, as it is seyd. And as I suppose he wyll have
the mestlyon over with hym, for the most part of the cart loodes was
mestlyon, &c.

Item, ser, on Saturday last past, I spacke with my cosyn Gornay, and he
seyd, if I wold goo to my Lady of Norffolk, and beseche hyr good grace
to be your good and gracyous lady, she wold so be, for he seyd that one
word of a woman should do more than the wordes of xx. men, yiffe I coude
rewyll my tonge, and speke non harme of myn unkyll. And if ye comaund me
so for to do, I trist I shuld sey nothynge to my ladys displesure, but
to your profyt; for me thynkyth bi the wordes of them and of your good
fermore of Oxned, that thei wyll sone drawe to an ende. For he cursyth
the tyme that ever he come in the ferme of Oxned, for he seyth that he
wotyth well that he shall have a grette losse, and yet he wyll not be a
knowyn wheder he hathe payd or nought; but whan he sethe his tyme, he
wyll sey trowth.

I understond by my seyd cosyn Gornay that my lady is nere wery of hyr
parte, and he seyth my lady shal come on pylgremage in to this towne,
but he knowth not wheder afore Cristmes or aftyr; and if I wold thanne
gete my Lady Calthorpe, my moder in lawe, and my moder, and myselfe, and
come before my lady, besechyng hyr to be your good and gracyous lady, he
thynkyth ye shull have an ende; for fayne she wold be redde of it with
hyr onowr savyd, but yette money she wold have.

No more to you at this tyme, butte I mervell sore that I have no letter
from you, but I prey God preserve you, and send me good tydynges from
you, and spede you well in your materes. And as for me, I have gotyn me
anothyr logyn felawe, the ferst letter of hyr name is Mastras Byschoppe.
She recomaundyth hyr to you by the same tokyn that ye wold have had a
tokyn to my Mayster Bryon.

Att Norwych, the Sonday next after the Fest of All Seyntes.

  Be yowr servaunt and bedewoman,

    [Footnote 61-1: [Add. Charter 17,256, B.M.] This declaration was
    drawn up after the death of William Worcester, and perhaps after
    that of William Paston also. The exact date of Worcester's death
    is uncertain. We only know that he was alive as late as 1480, when
    he visited Oxford on his travels and measured some of the churches
    there (_see_ his _Itinerarium_, 296), and that he was dead in
    Richard III.'s time. The document, however, may be conveniently
    placed at the end of the reign of Edward IV. The original MS. is a
    sheet of paper mutilated on the right-hand side towards the end.
    The seals of William Barker and Margaret Worcester are attached by
    tails of parchment to a parchment binding at the bottom. On the
    back is written in a more modern hand:--'A Testymonyall that
    William Paston, Gent., was kinsman to Sir Jo. Fastolf, and other
    matters within concernyng the landes somtyme Holhams in Caster,
    afterwardes the sayd William Paston.']

ABSTRACT[65-1]

W. BARKER TO [MARGARET PASTON?]

Begs her 'maystrasshipp' to inform his rightworshipful master of the
conduct of Master Keche at Wetyng, who on Monday means to be there with
a great fellowship.

  [This letter is unimportant, but as being written by William Barker
  it may conveniently be placed after the last No., although probably
  addressed to Margaret Paston, and if so, most likely during the life
  of her husband. It appears by inquisition _post-mortem_, 1 Edw. IV.,
  No. 46, that Elizabeth, Countess of Oxford, held the manor of Weting
  in Feltwell of the Duke of Norfolk.]

    [Footnote 65-2: [From Fenn, ii. 300.] This is a catalogue of the
    books either of John Paston the younger or of John Paston, Knight,
    most probably the former, drawn up in the reign of Edward IV., but
    owing to the decay of the original MS. we cannot tell in what
    year. It certainly could not have been earlier than 1475, when
    _The Game and Play of the Chess_ was first printed by Caxton. It
    is in itself a remarkable thing that the expression 'in print'
    should have got into use even during the reign of Edward IV.; but
    one may suppose that such an expression could hardly have been
    current for at least a year or two after the first printed book
    appeared. We therefore, without deciding the year, place the paper
    at the end of King Edward's reign.]

VERSES BY A LADY[67-1]

_Verses written by a Lady in the reign of Henry VI. or Edward IV. to an
absent Lord with whom she was in love._


  My ryght good lord, most knyghtly gentyll knyght,
  On to your grace in my most humbyll wyse,
  I me comand, as it is dew and ryght,
  Besechyng yow at leyser to advise
  Upon thys byll, and pardon myn empryse,
  Growndyd on foly, for lak of provydence,
  On to your lordshep to wryght with owght lycence.

  But wher a man is with a fevyr shake,
  Now hot, now cold, as fallyth by aventure,
  He in hys mynd conjecte wyll, and take
  The nyghest meane to worche hys cuyre,
  More pacyently hys peynys to endure;
  And ryght so I, so it yow not dysplease,
  Wryght in thys wyse my peynys to apease.

  For when I cownt and mak a reknyng
  Betwyx my lyfe, my dethe, and my desyer,
  My lyfe, alas! it servyth of no thyng
  Sythe with your partyng, depertyd my plesyer.
  Wyshyng your presence setyth me on fyer;
  But then your absence dothe my hert so cold,
  That for the peyne I not[68-1] me wher to hold.

  O owght on absence, ther foolys have no grace,
  I mene mysylf, nor yet no wytt to gwye
  Theym owt of peyne to com on to that place,
  Wher as presence may shape a remedye;
  For al dysease, now fye on my folye,
  For I dyspeyryd am of your soone metyng,
  That God I prey me to your presence bryng.

  Farwell, my lord, for I may wryght no more,
  So trowblyd is my hert with hevynesse;
  Envye also, it grewyth me most sore,
  That thys rude byll shall put hym sylf in presse[68-2]
  To se your lordshepe of hys presumptuousnesse
  Er I my sylf; but yett ye shall not mysse
  To have my hert to for my byll, I wys.

  Whyche I comytt and all my hole servyse
  Into your hands, demeane it as you lyst;
  Of it I kepe[68-3] to have no more franchyse
  Then I hertlesse swyrly me wyst,
  Savyng only that it be as tryst,[68-4]
  And to yow trew as evyr was hert, and pleyn
  Tyll cruell dethe depart yt up on tweyn.

  Adew dysport, farwell good companye,
  In all thys world ther is no joye I weene;
  For ther as whyleom I sye with myn iee,
  A lusty lord leepyng upon a grene,
  The soyle is soole, no knyghts ther be seen,
  No ladyse walk ther they wer wont to doone;
  Alas, some folk depertyd hense to soone.

  Some tyme also men myght a wageor make,
  And with ther bowys a ffeld have it tryed,
  Or at the Paame ther, ther plesure for to take,
  Then wer they loose, that now stand as tyed,
  I not[69-1] wher to thys world may be aplyed;
  For all good cher on evyn and on morow,
  Whyche then was made, now tornyth me to sorow.

    [Footnote 67-1: [From Fenn, ii. 304.] It is not apparent by whom
    these verses were written, or to what lord they were addressed.
    They may have been from the Countess of Oxford to her husband
    after he escaped abroad in 1471 (_see_ vol. v., No. 775). Or they
    may have been the production of Lydgate writing in the name of a
    lady parted from her lord. We place them, as Fenn did, for
    convenience, at the end of the letters of Edward's time.]

J. PASTON [OF GELSTON] TO RICHARD CROFT

Will not venture to ride in this weather, not being well at ease. Sends
three bills of John Calle and Robert Salle's receipts and payments
brought by the former. Cannot find the new fermall of Caster here, so he
has given the bearer the key of his coffer at Yarmouth. If you would
ride with him, I think you will find it there. Agrees to John Wynne's
bills, desiring to be allowed L5 for Byshoppis of Yarmouth, and for
herring delivered to my cousin Loveday; but John Wynne must not sell my
farm barley to pay them, as I wish all the barley in his charge malted
for my Lord Mountjoy. I send a warrant for the sheriff to warn the
persons in Flegge and Yarmouth impanelled between the King and me to be
at Thetford assizes on Wednesday next. Give it to Simon Garrard.

Heylisdon, Thursday before Lady Day the Nativity.[69-3]

Is a simple servant of his mother and miller of Wood Mill. Complains of
Will. Sybbeson, whom Edmund Paston well knows to have been 'defawtyf in
many other thyngs,' and who embezzles wheat and rye, and prevents him
getting any good of a close he holds of Paston's mother.

RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, TO LORD NEVILL[71-1]

_To my Lorde Nevyll, in hast._

[Sidenote: 1483 / JUNE 11]

My Lorde Nevyll, I recommaunde me to you as hartely as I can; and as
ever ye love me, and your awne weale and securty, and this Realme, that
ye come to me with that ye may make, defensably arrayde, in all the hast
that ys possyble, and that ye wyll yef credence to . . . . . Richarde
Ratclyff, thys beerrer, whom I nowe do sende to you, enstructed with all
my mynde and entent.

And, my lord, do me nowe gode servyce, as ye have always befor don, and
I trust nowe so to remember you as shalbe the makyng of you and yours.
And God sende you goode fortunes.

Wrytten att London, xj. day of Jun, with the hande of your hertely
lovyng cousyn and master,

  R. GLOUCESTER.

    [Footnote 71-1: [From Fenn, v. 302.] This letter was not a part of
    the Paston correspondence, but was printed by Fenn in the series
    as a letter of much historical interest from a copy given him by
    the Rev. John Brand, secretary to the Society of Antiquaries. The
    following memoranda accompanied the copy:--

    'Extract from an ancient MS. of pedigrees, etc., in quarto, late
    in the possession of Sir Walter Blackett, Bart., and now the
    property of John Erasmus Blackett, Esq., Alderman of
    Newcastle-upon-Tyne; p. 333, under title of "_A Coppie of some
    Letters which were found in Rabie Castle after the Rebellion, to
    shew the fashion . . . . of those times_." The above MS. is of the
    date of James I., though there are several continuations in a more
    modern hand.

    'This copy has doubtless been a transcript of an original letter
    of the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards King Richard III., and
    written just before his seizure of the crown.

    'Raby Castle is in the county of Durham.'

    Fenn adds that it does not appear clearly who this Lord Nevill
    was. But as the letter was found in Raby Castle after the great
    rebellion of the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, in
    1569, it was evidently addressed to one of that family of Nevills,
    the heads of which were Earls of Westmoreland. In 1483 the Earl of
    Westmoreland's name was Ralph Nevill, but he died in the year
    following, and was succeeded in the title by Ralph, son and heir
    of his brother, John, Lord Nevill, who was slain at Towton. It was
    this Ralph, then heir-presumptive to the earldom, who is here
    called Lord Nevill. He had got his father's attainder reversed in
    1472, and his title of Lord Nevill was recognised. _See_ G. Ele's
    _Peerage_, viii. 112.]

ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF SUFFOLK, TO JOHN PASTON[72-1]

_On to Jan Paston, in haste._

iij. or foro days tyl I may be porved of anodyr, and I schal do as
musche to yowr plesyr. For Godys sake, say me not nay; and I pray yow
rekomaund me to my Lord Chambyrleyn.

  Yowr frend,

  ELIZABETH.

    [Footnote 72-1: [From Fenn, ii. 292.] This is a holograph letter
    of Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk, the sister of Edward IV. There
    can be little doubt that the Lord Chamberlain referred to is the
    Lord Hastings who has been very frequently mentioned in this
    correspondence; and if so, the letter cannot be later than 1483,
    as he was beheaded in that year on the 13th June, by order of the
    Protector Richard, Duke of Gloucester. We may therefore place it
    for convenience among the letters of Edward V.'s time, though
    undoubtedly it may be a few years earlier. Facsimiles of the
    original, both back and front, are given by Fenn. It is endorsed
    in the hand of John Paston, the younger (certainly not in that of
    his brother Sir John, as Fenn supposed)--'Littra Ducisse Suff.']

    a series of insurrections were about to take place in different
    counties, of which the Duke of Buckingham was the principal
    leader. It was on the 12th October, just two days after this

    [Footnote 78-1: [From Fenn, ii. 330.] Fenn supposes with great
    probability that this letter was written in 1484, the year of
    Margaret Paston's death. No earlier date is possible, seeing that
    even in 1484 John Paston's eldest son was only in his seventh
    year, and he had at the date of this letter two sons capable of
    being sent on messages; so that, if anything, we should be
    inclined to put it later. But we know of no later death in the
    family that could have occasioned the writing of such a letter,
    and the time of Margaret Paston's death and of the proving of her
    will agree very well with Fenn's hypothesis. From the calendar
    prefixed to an old MS. missal in the possession of the late Mr. C.

ABSTRACT[79-4]

STANSTED AND HARWELLBURY

[Sidenote: 1484(?)]

The manor of Stansted is in the county of Suffolk. The estate of this
manor passed not by the deed that the estate was taken by at
Huntingfeld, in Norf.,[80-1] but I claim this manor by my mother's gift.
'This manor is but a mile from Clopton's and not far from Smalbrigge,
where your Grace is now.' John Barell is farmer of this manor, who, when
I came to your Grace just after my mother's death, confessed before your
servants, Piers Rumbold and William Smyth, that he was privy of mine
estate in my mother's days, and took the farm of me at that time.
'Madam, this is the man ye sent your servant W. Smyth to, for to keep
the possession there; and after he had tarried there awhile he took a
promise of the farmer that he should pay no money to nobody without
commandment from your Grace; contrary to which promise, by the favour of
some folks that your Grace can deem, he hath paid my nephew a L10 or
L20.' I think, Madam, you need send no man to keep possession there; but
your Grace might send a servant thither to show the tenants your
displeasure, inasmuch as he hath broken his promise with your Grace, and
threaten to distrain.

The manor of Harwellbury is in Hertfordshire, four miles from your manor
of Weston Baldok[80-2] and two from Roiston. This manor also passed not
by the estate taken in Norfolk, not being in the same shire. Of this
manor 'he'[80-3] received no money, for the farmers are true and fear
not his threats. The manor is worth L8.

    [Footnote 79-4: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This is a paper of notes
    relating to the manors of Stansted in Suffolk and Harwellbury in
    Herts, addressed to a lady who is styled 'Madam' and 'your Grace,'
    and who, though not named, was undoubtedly the Duchess of Norfolk.
    Compare No. 962. The writer is perhaps John Paston of Gelston; in
    which case the date must be after 1484, as he speaks of his mother
    as being dead. More probably it was his uncle William, and John
    Paston is the nephew referred to in the paper itself. But even in
    that case the document cannot be five years earlier, as Agnes
    Paston died in 1479.]

    [Footnote 80-1: Should be Suffolk.]

    [Footnote 80-2: The Dukes of Norfolk of the family of Mowbray
    owned this manor.]

    [Footnote 80-3: The writer's nephew?]

PROCLAMATION AGAINST HENRY TUDOR[81-1]

R. R.

Ricardus, etc. salutem. Precipimus tibi, etc.

[Sidenote: 1485 / JUNE 23]

Forasmoche as the Kyng our sovereign Lord hath certeyn knowlege that
Piers, Bisshop of Exeter,[81-2] Jasper Tydder,[81-3] son of Owen Tydder,
callyng hymself Erle of Pembroke, John, late Erle of Oxon,[81-4] and Sir
Edward Wodevyle,[81-5] with other dyvers his rebelles and traytours,
disabled and atteynted by the auctorite of the High Court of Parlement,
of whom many be knowen for open murdrers, advoutrers [_adulterers_], and
extorcioners, contrary to the pleasure of God, and a yenst all trouth,
honour, and nature, have forsakyn there naturall contrey, takyng them
first to be under th'obeisaunce of the Duke of Bretayn,[81-6] and to hym
promysed certeyn thyngs whiche by him and his counsell were thought
thynggs to gretly unnaturall and abominable for them to graunt, observe,
kepe, and perfourme, and therfore the same utterly refused.

The seid traytours,[82-1] seyng[82-2] the seid Duke and his counsell
wolde not aide nor socour theym ner folowe there wayes, privily departed
oute of his contrey in to Fraunce, and[82-3] there takyng theym to be
under the obeisaunce of the Kynggs auncient enemy, Charlys,[82-4]
callyng hymself Kyng of Fraunce, and to abuse and blynde the comons of
this seid Realme, the seid rebelles and traitours have chosyn to be
there capteyn one Henry Tydder,[82-5] son of Edmond Tydder, son of Owen
Tydder,[82-6] whiche of his ambicioness and insociable[82-7]
covetise[82-8] encrocheth[82-9] and usurpid[82-10] upon hym the name and
title of royall astate of this Realme of Englond, where unto he hath no
maner interest, right, title, or colour, as every man wele
knowyth;[82-11] for he is discended of bastard blood bothe of ffather
side and of mother side, for the seid Owen the graunfader was bastard
borne, and his moder was doughter unto John, Duke of Somerset, son unto
John, Erle of Somerset, sone unto Dame Kateryne Swynford, and of
ther[82-12] indouble[82-13] avoutry [_adultery_] gotyn, wherby it
evidently apperith that no title can nor may [be][82-14] in hym, which
fully entendeth to entre this Reame, purposyng a conquest. And if he
shulde atcheve his fals entent and purpose, every man is lif, livelod,
and goddes shulde be in his hands, liberte, and disposicion, wherby
sholde ensue the disheretyng and distruccion of all the noble and
worshipfull blode of this Reame for ever, and to the resistence and
withstondyng wherof every true and naturall Englishman born must ley to
his hands for his owen suerte and wele.

And to th'entent that the seid Henry Tydder myght the rather atcheve his
fals intent and purpose by the aide, supporte, and assistence of the
Kynggs seid auncient enemy of Fraunce,[83-1] hath covenaunted and
bargayned with hym and all the counsell of Fraunce to geve up and relese
inperpetuite all the right, title, and cleyme that the Kyng[es] of
Englond have, had, and ought to have, to the Crowne and Reame of
Fraunce, to gether with the Duchies of Normandy, Anjoy, and Maygne,
Gascoyn and Guyne, castell[es] and townys of Caleys, Guysnes, Hammes,
with the marches apperteynyng to the same,[83-2] and discevir and
exclude the armes of Fraunce oute of the armes of Englond for ever.

And in more prove and shewing of his seid purpose of conquest, the seid
Henry Tidder hath goven as well to dyvers of the seid Kynggs enemys as
to his seid rebelles and traitours, archebisshoprikes, bisshoprikes, and
other dignitees spirituels, and also the ducheez, erledomez, baronyes,
and other possessions and inheritaunces of knyghts, squyres, gentilmen,
and other the Kynggs true subjetts withynne the Reame, and entendith
also to chaunge and subverte the lawes of the same, and to enduce and
establisse newe lawes and ordenaunces amongez the Kynggs seid
subjetts.[83-2] And over this, and beside the alienacions of all the
premyssez into the possession of the Kynggs seid auncient enemys to the
grettest anyntisshment,[83-3] shame, and rebuke that ever myght falle to
this seid land, the seid Henry Tydder and others, the Kynggs rebelles
and traitours aforeseid, have extended [_intended_] at there comyng, if
they may be of power,[84-1] to do the most cruell murdrers, slaughterys,
and roberys, and disherisons that ever were seen in eny Cristen reame.

For the wich, and other inestymable daungers to be escheuved, and to
th'entent that the Kynggs seid rebelles, traitours, and enemys[84-2] may
be utterly put from there seid malicious and fals purpose[84-3] and sone
discomforted,[84-4] if they enforce to land,[84-5] the Kyng our
soveraign Lord[84-6] willith, chargeth, and comaundith all and everyche
of the naturall and true subgetts of this his Reame to call the
premyssez to there mynds, and like gode and true Englishmen to endover
themselfs with all there powers for the defence of them, there wifs,
chylderyn, and godes, and heriditaments ayenst the seid malicious
purposes and conspiracions which the seid auncient enemes[84-7] have
made with the Kynggs seid rebelles and traitours[84-8] for the fynall
distruccion of this lande as is aforesaid. And our said soveraign Lord,
as a wele willed, diligent, and coragious Prynce, wel put his moost
roiall persone to all labour and payne necessary in this behalve for the
resistence and subduyng of his seid enemys, rebells, and traitours[84-9]
to the moost comforte, wele, and suerte of all[84-10] his true and
feithfull liege men and subgetts.

And over this, our seid soveraign Lord willith and comaundith all his
seid subgetts to be redy in there most defensible arraye to do his
Highnes servyce of werre, when thy be opyn proclamacion, or otherwise
shall be comaunded so to do, for the resistence of the Kynggs seid
rebelles, traitours, and enemyes. Et hoc sub periculo, &c.--T. me ipso

    suos ad resistendum Henr' Tydder, postea Regem Angliae ac
    declarantis a quo idem Henricus descendebat.' Another but
    imperfect copy of this proclamation will be found in the Harleian
    MS., No. 433, f. 220 b. A similar proclamation had been issued on
    the 7th December 1484, of which a copy will also be found in the
    same Harleian volume at folio 273 b. Sir Henry Ellis has also
    printed in his _Original Letters_ (2 Ser. i. 162) a copy of this
    proclamation as set forth in the original warrant for issuing it,
    which the King addressed to the Bishop of Lincoln as Chancellor.
    The MS. followed by Ellis was a transcript from one of the records
    formerly in the Tower. I have compared these different texts
    throughout with that printed by Fenn, and noted all variations
    that are of any consequence. The two Harleian texts I have called

    [Footnote 87-2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter must have

    which latter year also John Paston, to whom this letter is
    addressed, was knighted at the battle of Stoke on the 16th June.

proclamed:--And that all maner men able to do the King service, as well
knights, esquiers, and gentlemen, as townships and hundreds, as well
within franchesse and libertes as without, within the counties of
Suffolk and Norffolk, and that they be charged to be redy at all tymes
uppon an howre warnyng, and ordered according to the last comission

receyve no mony of the revenowse of my lyvelod afore Mydsommer; and also
I have payd accordyng to my promise to Sir William Cabell a great
payment, the which ye knowe wel was due to be payde, so that I can not
be of power to content therfore, for the which I am right sory, for I
know well I shall never have such a bargane.

Also my doghtyr Lovell[92-1] makith great sute and labour for my sone

From London, the xxiiij^th day of February.

  Your loving moder,

  ALISE, LADY FITZHUGH.

    [Footnote 91-1: [From Fenn, ii. 336.] There is a difficulty in
    dating this letter only from the address being to Sir John Paston.
    It has every appearance of having been written in the year 1486,
    when Francis, Viscount Lovel, lay concealed shortly before his
    outbreak with Humphrey and Thomas Stafford. But in that case the
    prefix 'Sir' before John Paston's name must not be taken as
    indicating that he was then a knight; for he was not knighted till
    the battle of Stoke in June 1487.

    The writer of this letter was the widow of Henry, Lord Fitzhugh,
    who died on the 12th June 1472. She was the daughter of Richard
    Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, and sister of Warwick the Kingmaker.]

    [Footnote 91-2: I find no evidence of any real relationship

    [Footnote 92-2: [From Fenn, ii. 338.] The date of this is quite
    certain from the subject to which it refers, as well as from the
    fact of John Paston being at the time Sheriff of Norfolk and
    Suffolk. Francis, Viscount Lovel, was one of the principal
    adherents of Richard III., and was attainted after the accession
    of Henry VII. in 1485. For some time he lay concealed, but in the
    spring of 1486 he attempted to raise an insurrection along with
    Humphrey and Thomas Stafford, who had broken out of their
    sanctuary at Colchester. He is said to have been drowned in the
    Trent in 1487, in endeavouring to escape after the battle of
    Stoke. But according to another story he lived in concealment for
    some time after.]

And it is so that many yeres aftir the decesse of the seide William,
Justice, ther were many men lyvyng bothe of olde brethern of oures afore
rehersyd, and of other that cowde aborne witnesse in this mater, and
that knewe the mynde of the seide William Paston, Justice, that it was
his last will, of whiche men many now be deceassed; and no merveill, for
it is upon a xliij. yere past sithen the seide William, Justice, deyed.
And also the seide Annes that was hys wif lyved more thanne xxx. wynter
aftir hir husbonde, and was in singuler trust with her husbonde, and one
of his executours, and wele knowen in this cuntre, a woman of vertuos
lyvyng and disposicion, and of goode discrecioun and conscience, and
knewe hir husbondes mynde and last will as wele as ony lyvyng creature;
she witnessed alway that it was hire husbondes last will to have this
perpetuall messe, and called on it all the dayes of hir lyfe, and also
atte her decesse; and sche seide that [it] was the will of her husbonde
that the annuyte schulde go oute of the seide maner of Swaynesthorpe.
The seide John Paston decessed wolde have hadde it graunted owte of the
seide maner of Cressyngham; and summe of the executours wolde have hadde
the seide messe to a contynued but for the terme of iiij^xx. yere, and
wolde have made writyng accordyng; but the seide Annes wolde not ther
of, but seide alway that it was the last will of hir husbonde to have
the messe made perpetuall, and the executours schewid to us that they
wolde se the wyll perfourmed; and ther upon the executours, be ther
comon assent, lefte a cofre with a grete substaunce of money of the
goodes of the seide William, Justice, to be kepte with inne our
monastery, and tolde and schewed to us that the seide gode schuld never
be departid nor hadde oute of our place till we wer made sure of the
seide annuyte. And duryng all that season that the seide cofer with the
goodes was with ynne our monastery, it was alway schewid to us that the
seide annuyte schulde be mortaysed in perpetuyte, and duryng all that
season that the seid cofer was in our place, we hadde money yerly yoven
us to pray for his soule to kepe [his obytt][97-1]; and be menys devysed
with oute the knowleche of the seide Annes, or of ony of our brethern,
all the goode that was in the seide cofre was conveyed oute of our
monastery, and after that dede done, ther was no more money yoven us,
nowther to kepe the seide obit, ner to pray for the soull of the seide
William, as be the seide executours, savyng that the seide Annes, duryng
her lyve, yaff us of hir owne cost yerly to remembre the soule, and that
that hath be done sythen, hath be don of our owne devocion, and this
many zerys ther hath no thing be yoven us, notwithstondyng of our own
devocion we have rehersid his name in oure bede rolle every Sonday.

And now it is informed us that as wele the seide William as the seide
John hath putt all ther title and interest, as wele in and of all the
seide maners, londes, and tenementys as of the seide goodes in the

And in this mater we hertily pray yow to take remembraunce and speciall
labour, so that we may trust that it schall not askape your handes, nowe
that the mater is putte in yowe; and all our monastery schall pray for
you, and also rewarde you to your plesur, and over that, ze schall do

that every man owghte to wayte and go with them. Wherto yt was answerd
that oure master,[99-3] nexte the Kynge, havynge hys commysshon, muste
nedys have the jentylmen and the contre to a wayte up on hym by the

Thetforde in to Kente ward, but they returnyd in to Norffolk a geyne;
I thynke they wull not goo thys jorney, yff the Kynge nede. Ser Harry
was at Attylborow on Saterday. I wene he had a vyce there to turne a

jentylmen intende to goo, and be assuryd to go together, that I may have

Wysman, he seythe he wull be off the same, but I can have no holde.

Furthermore, cosyn, yt ys seyd that after my lordys departyng to the

And, nexte to the Kynge, I answerd pleynly I was bownde to do him

powere, by the grace off God, Who ever preserve you to Hys plesur.

    [Footnote 100-2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The MS. from which this

    enclosed in the preceding. Fenn supposes with great probability
    that the writer was the Earl of Oxford, but the MS. being only a
    copy, there is no signature attached. Commissions of array were
    issued on the 7th April 1487 for the counties of Suffolk, Norfolk,
    and Essex, with special instructions for repairing and guarding
    the beacons for fear of an invasion. The Commissioners for the
    County of Norfolk were John, Duke of Suffolk, John, Earl of
    Oxford, John Radcliff, Lord Fitzwalter, and fifteen others, among
    whom was John Paston.--See _Patent Roll_, 2 Hen. VII., p. 2, m. 6,

    beginning are the end of a list of knights bannerets made upon the
    field. Then follow the names of those who were merely dubbed
    knights; but this list, too, is imperfect, not merely by the
    mutilation of some names, but because another leaf would certainly
    have been required to give them all. Compare another copy of these
    lists in Leland's _Collectanea_, iv. 214-15, where the names in
    the second list stand in a different order. Several of the
    mutilated names here have been filled in from Leland; but,
    curiously enough, that list gives no Sir Gregory and no Sir Simon.
    Since this was in type the Editor has found a complete list, more
    accurate than Leland's, which will be printed at the end of these
    letters.]

    [Footnote 103-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The date of this letter
    is nearly as indefinite as that of the last, but it certainly lies
    between the year 1487, when Sir John Paston was knighted, and
    1489, when William Brews died. If the latter part of the letter
    refers to the levying of a subsidy, in which the Bishop of Chester
    may have been one of the King's agents, the date is probably about
    the end of the year 1488. Sir Thomas Brews, the writer's husband,
    died in 1482.]

    [Footnote 107-1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 48.] The letter here
    referred to from the Queen to the Earl of Oxford seems undoubtedly
    to be No. 1020; and the date must accordingly be between 1487 and
    1502. The reference to the Queen's confinement does not help us to
    much greater precision, for the time of year does not agree with
    any known occasion. But some years are distinctly excluded, and
    the only possible ones are 1487, 1488, 1490, or from 1493 to 1497

ABSTRACT[108-2]

R[OBERT] CLERE TO SIR JOHN PASTON, KNIGHT

[Sidenote: Not before 1487]

Your farmer of Mauteby has not given surety and paid poundage for his
cattle, as he pretends. I hope you will not encourage him, when he tells
you he owes me no duty, and that he took not my 'merch' for twenty
years, but only so long as he continued in Heryngby farm. I denied him
the replevin, because the ground of my farm is parcel of ancient
demesne. Your tenants complain of me without cause. I hope you will not
be displeased if I ask them simply for what is due to me. I never said
'that ye shuld hang upon many bushes.' I have always been glad to say or
do my best for you, as any poor gentleman in Norfolk. I pray you bring
forth my accuser that I may come to my answer, and know who would make
variance between us.

Ormesby, 24 Oct.

  [The writer of this letter was Robert Clere of Ormesby, who was
  knighted in 1494, and was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1501.
  The expression 'your' farmer of Mauteby, shows that it was written
  after the death of Margaret Paston, and that the Sir John addressed
  must have been her second son, to whom the manor of Mauteby
  descended. The date is, therefore, not earlier than 1487 when this
  Sir John was knighted, and may be many years later.]

And where I am enformed that ye have takyn a disthresse within the

it within the said Duchy of noon auncyen demene holdyn upon the King;
for there be places inow to gadir it upon without the said auncyen
demene, and so ye cannot lose it. And also, cosyn, I am enformed that it
is paied alredy to oon John Burnam, which is of sufficyency inow. For
whiche cause mesemythe it werne resone to levey it upon hym than ther
where as is noon auctorite to levey it upon. Wherfore, cosyn, I pray you
to be good mastir for my sake to thies pore men, whiche be the Kingz

    [Footnote 109-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Sir John Paston had been
    sheriff in the year 1485-6, but he did not receive his knighthood
    till June 1487 at the battle of Stoke, so that this letter cannot
    be earlier than 1488. It is, however, not unlikely to have been
    written in that year, or one or two years later. The writer, Lord
    Fitzwalter, was beheaded and attainted in 1495 as an adherent of
    Perkin Warbeck.]

Also, where as it was seyde that my Lord Woddevyle and other schulde

Sowthehamton with the schype, to cawse the Frenchemen to be the more
gladder to medyll with them; and soo the Frencheman burdyd them, and
then they that were undyr the hetches came up, and soo toke the
Frencheman, and caryed the men, schyppe, and all in to Breaten.

Also, ther was ther an inbacetour fro the Kynge of Schottes,[112-1] who

Syr, as I came homewerde be London, I spake there with Emonde Dormand,
and he seyd that he had wretyn onto yow, but he had none aunswere;
wherfor he prayd me that if I knew ony man comynge towerdes Norwhyche,
and I wold wrythe on to yow that he ferythe, if ye see none other
dyreccion, that he schall be comittyd to the Flete.

Also, he schewyd me that Herry Wyott wholde fynde the mene to have yow

to save yow fro the condemnacion, tyl that he herythe otherwyse from

    unauthorised expedition into Brittany in the spring of 1488, which
    is alluded to in No. 1026, no succours were sent by Henry for the
    relief of the Duchy till after the crushing defeat of Duke Francis
    at the battle of St. Aubin (July 28, 1488). The Duke died on the
    9th September following, and his daughter Anne became Duchess of
    Brittany. Commissions to raise archers for the relief of Brittany
    were issued in December, and musters were commanded to be taken in
    February 1489.]

WILLIAM PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[120-1]

_To hys broder, Sir John Paston, be thys letter delyvered._

[Sidenote: 1489 / MARCH 7]

Sir, I recomaunde me to yow, letynge yow wete that . . . . . .
. . .[120-2]

As for my Lord Treserer,[120-3] he was not with the Kynge of all the
counsell tyme, the whyche was endyd on the iij^de day of Marche. And

departyd the even afore the makyng of thys letter, and hath endentyd
with the Kynge for the kepynge owt of the Schottys and warrynge on them,
and schall have large money, I can not telle the some for certeyn.

Also ther is an rover takyn at Brystowe, on [_one_] Cowper, as I wene,
and he is lyke to be hanged, and he confessythe more of hys felawis.
Also Edward Heestowe of Dovere is apechyd of treson of many straunge
poynts; and hys accuser and he were bothe afore the Kynge, and then they
were takyn apert. And he hymselfe confessyd it that hys accusere accusyd
hym of, and many other thyngs more than he was accusyd of. And he had
many lords and gentylmen to aunswere for hys trowthe and his demenynge
afore tyme, for, as I hard sey, bothe the Kynge in a maner, nor non of
the tother lords nor gentylmen belevyd not hys accuser, tyl that he
confessyd it hym selfe; and so he is in the Towre and lyke to be dede.

As for the Kynges comynge into the contre. On Monday come fortenyght he
well lye at the Abbey of Stratteforde and so to Chelmnsford, than to Syr
Thomas Mongehombrey, than to Hevenyngham,[121-1] than to Colchestyr,
than to Ipswyche, than to Bery, than to Dame Anne Wyngfelds, and so to
Norwych; and there woll he be on Palme Sunday Evyn,[121-2] and so tary
there all Ester, and than to Walsyngham. Wherefore ye had nede to warne
Wylliam Gogyne and hys felaws to purvey them of wyne i now, for every
man berythe me on hande[121-3] that the towne schalbe dronkyn drye as
Yorke was when the Kynge was there.

Syr, Mayster Sampson recomaunde hym on to yow, and he hathe sende yow a
rynge be Edmonde Dorman, and besydys that he requeryd me to wryte on to
yow that it were best for yow to purvey yow of some gentyl meny thynges

noo grete lady ther abowte ageyns the Kyngs comyng, for my lorde hathe
made grete boste of the fayre and goode gentylwomen of the contre, and
so the Kynge seyd he wolde see them sure.

Syr, my lorde hathe sente on to the most parte of the gentyl men of
Essex to wayte upon hym at Chelmnysford, where as he entendythe to mete
with the Kynge, and that they be well apoyntyd, that the Lankeschere men
may see that ther be gentylmen of as grete sobestaunce that thei be able
to bye alle Lankeschere. Men thynke that ye amonge yow wol doo the same.
Your contre is gretely bostyd of, and also the inabytors of the same.
I beseche you to remembr my hors that ye promisyd me. God kepe yow.

your brodyr,

    [Footnote 120-1: [From Fenn, ii. 158.] This letter was
    unquestionably written in the reign of Henry VII., and not in that
    of Edward IV., to which Fenn assigned it. The writer, William
    Paston, was only born in the year 1459, and was still pursuing his
    studies at Eton so late in Edward's reign as the year 1479, in the
    end of which year his eldest brother, Sir John Paston, died. The
    Sir John Paston to whom this is addressed must therefore be the
    second son of John Paston, Esquire, who was knighted at the battle
    of Stoke in 1487, and died in 1503. The year in which the letter
    was written is, however, still doubtful. I do not find by the
    Privy Seal dates of Henry VII. that such a progress as is here
    spoken of was ever carried out. Apparently it was intended that,
    beginning on Monday fortnight after the date of the letter, the
    King should occupy a fortnight on the way from London to Norwich,
    and arrive there on Palm Sunday Eve. The year must therefore have
    been one in which Palm Sunday Eve fell between the 5th and the
    11th of April, and Easter Day between the 13th and 19th April. The
    earliest year that will suit these conditions is 1489, when Easter
    fell on the 19th April; and that this was the true date of the
    letter is made probable by several other circumstances. In 1489
    the King was staying at Sheen during March. A great council had
    certainly met in the end of the year 1488 about the affairs of
    Brittany, and is very likely to have prolonged its meetings or
    renewed them from time to time to the 3rd March following.
    Moreover, if our date be correct, it supplies an interesting and
    highly probable fact with regard to Henry, Earl of Northumberland,
    the fourth of the line of Percy, who was slain in an insurrection
    in the north in April following, showing that he was with the King
    at Sheen in the beginning of March, and had undertaken by
    indenture to protect the Borders against the Scots, not long
    before he found himself called upon to put down the King's
    rebellious subjects in Yorkshire.]

    [Footnote 123-1: [From Fenn, iv. 310.] This letter is dated from
    Heningham, or Hedingham, one of the places which, as we have seen
    in No. 1031, the King was to have visited on his intended journey
    northwards in 1489. I have little doubt, therefore, that it was
    written in that year. The writer, according to Fenn, was William
    Paston, Sir John's uncle; but it is remarkable that in this same
    year William Paston, Sir John's brother, writes to him from
    Heningham, and as the signatures of the two Williams were not very
    unlike each other, one may fairly suspect that Fenn has here made
    an error. This suspicion is, moreover, confirmed by the fact that
    Mautby was the property of Margaret Paston, who died in 1484, and
    that it could not possibly have descended to her brother-in-law
    William, though her son William may have had an interest in it.]

    [Footnote 123-2: Fenn prints the name 'Hokkys,' but as the reading
    in the modernised version is Cocks, I presume this is a printer's

    [Footnote 124-1: [Douce MS. 393, f. 81.] A portion of the lands of
    Thomas, Lord Scales, whose widow, Elizabeth, married Anthony
    Woodville, Earl of Rivers,--and among others the manor called
    Scales's Manor in Hockwold,--descended after the death of this
    Elizabeth to William Tyndale, who was knighted at the coronation
    of Arthur, Prince of Wales, on the 30th November 1489. (See
    Blomefield, ii. 180, and Leland's _Collectanea_, iv. 250-2.) As
    this letter must have been written after the accession of Henry
    VII., when the Earl of Oxford returned from banishment, and before
    William Tyndale was made a knight, the date is between 1486 and

HENRY VII. TO THE EARL OF OXFORD[125-3]

[Sidenote: 1489 / APRIL 22]

Right trusty and entierly beloved cousin, we grete you well. Inasmuch as
it hath liked God to sende us good tidinges oute of Bretayn, such as we
dought not but that ye be desirous to undrestonde, we wryte unto you of
them as thay be comen to our knowlage, and as foloueth.

The Lord Malpertuis, now late with us in ambassade from our dere
cousine, the Duchesse of Bretayne, shippid at our porte of Dortmouth,
and arrived at Saynt Powle de Lyon, in Bretayn, on Palme Sonday,[126-1]
at iiij. after noone, from whens he wrote us the disposicion and the
state of the countre there, and of the landyng and the demeanyng of oure
armee. We received his wrytyng on Monday last, at evynsong tyme; and be
cause he was of Bretayn borne, and favorable to that partie, we ne gave
such trust to his tidinges, as was thought to us surete to wryte to you
theruppon.

This daye, aftre High Masse, comyth unto us from oute of Bretayne
forsaid, and with a new ambassade from our said cousine, Fawcon, oon of
our pursivantes, that ratifieth the newes of the seid Lord Malpertuis,
which ben these.

After the garysson of Frenshmen in the towne of Gyngham[126-2] had
certeinte of the landyng of our armee, thei drewe downe the
fabours[126-3] of Gyngham, and made thayme mete to defende a siege; but
assone as thei undirstode that our said armee jornayned towardes theim,
thei left the same Gyngham, where our said armee arrived the Thursday
next before Palme Sonday, and was received with procession, logged and
received, refreshed in the town iiij. dayes. And goyng towardes the said
Duchesse, thei must passe to the castell and borugh of Monconter. In
that castell was also a garnisson of Frenshemen, which incontinently,
upon worde that our said armee drwe towardes theym, the Frenshmen did
cast downe gret parte of the walles, and fled from thens; in that
castell and borugh our seid armee kept thair Estre. The castell of
Chawson, adjoyning nere to the towne of Saynt Bryak, was also garnisond
with Frenshmen; that castell they set on fire, and soo fled in the
townes of Henebone and Vannes[126-4] were garnisond with Frenshmen,
which breke downe the walles of the townes, and putte them selff to
fligth. Th'inhabitantes a bought Brest have layd siege therunto, and
goten the Base Courte of the Frenshmen or the departyng of our said
pursivaunt. The garnson of the towne of Concarnewe, which is oon of the
grettest strenghes of all Bretayn, was besieged in like wyse, and drevyn
to that necessite that thei with in offerid, ar his said departyng, to
avoyde the towne with staffe in hande; how that is takyn, or what is
more done sithens, he cannot telle.

Oure said cousine, the Duchesse, is in her citee of Raynes; and our
right trusti knyght and counsellour, Sir Richard Eggecombe, there also,
havyng cheeff rule abowte her; and the Marchall of Bretayn arredieth hym
to joyne with them in alle haste with a gode band of men. Mony noble men
of that countree repair to our said armee to take their partie.

These premisses in substaunce we have be wrytyng, aswell from the cheff
capytaynes of our said armee, as from our comptrollour[127-1] forsaid.
And that our said armee, blessid be God, hath among theyme selfe kepte
such love and accorde, that no maner of fray or debate hath bene bitwene
theym sithens the tyme of thair departing out this our Reame. Yoven
under our signed, at our castell at Hartford, the xxij. day of Aprill.

To be knowyn to all the northe partes of England, to every lorde,
knyght, esquyer, gentylman, and yeman that they schalbe redy in ther
defensable aray, in the est parte, on Tuysday next comyng, on Aldyrton
More, and in the west parte on Gateley More, the same day, upon peyne of
losyng of ther goodes and bodyes, for to geynstonde suche persons as is
abowtward for to dystroy oure suffereyn Lorde the Kynge and the Comowns
of Engelond, for suche unlawfull poyntes as Seynt Thomas of Cauntyrbery
dyed for; and thys to be fulfyllyd and kept by every ylke comenere upon
peyn of dethe.

And thys is in the name of Mayster Hobbe Hyrste, Robyn Godfelaws brodyr
he is, as I trow.

    [Footnote 129-2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] It is evident that this
    letter was written shortly after the preceding, which is dated the
    6th May. In that letter Paston is desired to be at Cambridge on
    the Tuesday following to do the King service, and here we find
    that it was intended by the King himself to have been there,
    leading an army against some Northern rebels in person. The
    expressions in the beginning of this letter leave very little
    doubt that the insurrection referred to was that in which the Earl
    of Northumberland was slain on the 28th April 1489.--_See_
    Leland's _Collectanea_, iv. 246.]

    [Footnote 132-3: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter was printed
    in volume v. of the original edition, p. 380. I do not know Sir
    John Fenn's reason for considering it to have been written 'about
    1490,' but as I see nothing to the contrary, I keep it under his
    date. The writer was probably one of the German merchants of the
    Hanse, and the name with which he signs the letter seems to have
    been a little Anglicised. It is endorsed by Sir John, 'Lumen
    Henrikson.']

SIR JOHN PASTON TO [LORD FITZWALTER][133-1]

[Sidenote: About 1490(?)]

John Paston, more kayteff than knyght, that it may please you of your
specyall grace to dyrect ought your lettres, sygned with your hand and
sealid with your seall, to the dreedfull man, Jamys Radcliff of
Byllingforth, Sqwyer, fermour of your wareyn ther, ought of wheys wareyn
no maner of man nor vermyn dare take on hym, for dought of your seyd
dredfull [man], to take or carye awey eny of your game ther, for fere
[of being] hangyd up among other mysdoers and forfaytours, as wesellis,
lobsters [_stoats_], polkattys, bosartys [_hawks_], and mayne
currys,--that the seyd Jamys shall, upon the syght of your seyd

besechers at Oxenhed, more lyeke a pynnefold than a parke. And your seyd
besecher shall daylye prey to God for the preservacyon of your noble
estate longe t'endure.

    [Footnote 133-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This humorous petition,
    though it bears no address, was certainly drawn up for
    presentation to Sir John Radcliff, Lord Fitzwalter, the writer of
    Letters 1024 and 1025, for he was lord of the manor of Billingford
    in Norfolk, and James Radcliff, the farmer of his warren, was
    evidently his kinsman. The date is probably, as Fenn suggests,
    'about 1490,' certainly before 1495, when Lord Fitzwalter was
    beheaded. The MS. is a rough draft in Paston's hand.]

THE EARL OF SURREY TO SIR JOHN PASTON[134-1]

_To my right worshipfull cousine, Sir John Paston, Knyght._

Right worshipfull cousine, in right harty wyse I commaunde me unto you.

herof, hath been putt to grete vexacion and trouble by oon Thomas Hogan,
scomaker, of Norwiche, and that I perceyve ye have harde the matier
depending in travers bitwixt the saide parties; I therfore desire you
that, in the right of the forsayd Thomas Hartford, ye wolbe unto hym
gode maistir, and the bettir for this myn instaunce, as my singler trust
is in you.

And where I conceyve also that the same Thomas is noysed in Norffolk for
a Scotesman borne, ye shall understande that I perceyve wele, by suche
honest folkes as I have hard speke within the citie of York, that the
saide Thomas was borne their, and his fathir there inhabityng, and his
god fathirs and mothers, the which bee right honest persones; and for
that this is true, and not feyned, ye shall understand the Maiour of the
citie of York and his brethern hath made grete instaunce unto me to writ
for the saide Thomas, for whom I must nedes do, because thaye arre my
nye neighbours, as our Lord knoweth, Who have you in His blissid
saufegard.

Written in the castell of Shirefhoton, the xxiiij^th day of Aprill.

  Your lovyng cousin,

  THOMAS SURREY.

    [Footnote 134-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Thomas Howard, Earl of
    Surrey, the writer of this letter, fought for Richard III. at the
    battle of Bosworth, and was taken prisoner. He was, however, after
    some years' confinement, liberated from the Tower, and taken into
    favour. In 1489 the King sent him into the North to put down the
    rebellion in which the Earl of Northumberland was slain, and
    afterwards made him his lieutenant-general north of Trent; and for
    ten years he resided continually in those parts. The date of this
    letter, therefore, cannot be earlier than 1490, though it may be
    several years later.]

    English in Iceland, of which mention is made in the last letter.]

    says Fenn, 'respecting corporation business, made by the men of
    Yarmouth, through Sir John Paston and Lord Oxford's attention to
    them, received the King's assent by his Attorney-General in 1491.
    It was for their activity in those matters, I presume, that this
    letter of thanks, etc. was addressed to Sir John.' The time of
    year appears by the letter itself to be about Michaelmas.]

WILLIAM PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[143-2]

_To the ryght worchepfull Sir John Paston, Knyght._

[Sidenote: 1492 / FEB. 18]

Aftyr all dew recomendacion, lyke it yow to undyrstond that Syr Herry
Heydon schewyd me that it is agreyd be Syr Edmond Bedyngfeld, that the
mater betwyx hym and my brodyr Yelverton[143-3] schalbe comynd at
Norwyche, and there a dyreccion to be takyn in the same mater, mete for
them bothe.

Syr, the Kyng sendythe ordynaunce dayly to the see syde, and hys tentes
and alys [_pavilions_] be a makyng faste, and many of them be made; and
there is also grete provysyon made be gentylmen that scholde goo wythe
Hys Grace for hors, harnese, tents, halys, gardyvyans [_knapsacks_],
cartes, and othyr thynges that scholde serve them for thys jurney that
the Kynge entendythe to take on hand, soo that belykelyod Hys Grace
wolbe goyng sone upon Ester. And so I entende, aftyr that I here
heaftyr, to goo to Caleys to purvey me of harneys, and suche thynges as
I schall nede besydes hors, undyr that forme that my costes schalbe payd
fore.

Syr, I am as yet no bettyr horsyd than I was whan I was wythe yow, nor I
wote not where to have none, for hors flesche is of suche a price here
that my purce is schante [_scarce_] able to bye one hors; wherfor I
beseche yow to herkyn [_hearken_] for some in yowre contre. Syr, my
cosyn, John Heydon, tolde me that the Prior of Waburnes horse was rially
amendyd, and that the Abott of Seynt Benetes schewed hym there was a bay
hors of a persons nyght onto Seynt Benetis, and that the abot wolde gete
hym for my cosyn Heydon at a resonable price. Syr, my cosyn, John
Heydon, woll geve me hys entrest in that hors, if the abot have bowght
hym, and so ye may lete the abot have knowlege; and if he have not
bowght hym, I beseche yow sende to see hym, for I wote not how to do
withowt yowre helpe aswell in horsyng of me as in other thynges.

At the makyng of thys lettyr, I cannot acerteyn yow what person it is
that owythe thys hors. If I can know, I wolle send yow worde in a bylle
I sende to Thomas Jullys be the berer herof.

Syr, as towardes my jurney to Caleys, the whyche I entende [_intended_]
to have tane at my laste beyng with yow, it was so, I was dysapoyntyd of
Thomas Dey and an other man I scholde have had be hys menys, as ye have
had knowlege of or now; and also I had went [_thought_] to have had
folkys a mette with me at Hedyngham, whyche ded nott. My lorde,[144-1]
seyng me dysesyd, and also none otherwyse purveyd, wyllyd me in ony wyse
to tary on tyl hys comyng to London, and sent myn excuse to my Lorde
Dawbeney undyr thys forme how that I was sore disesyd; notwythestondyng
I was welewyllyd to have come to fulfyll my promesse, but he cowde not
sofyr me, seyng me soo dysesyd; and so my Lord Dawbeney was sory of my
dysese and content that I taryd.

Syr, I beseche yow to holde me excusyd for kepyng of Thomas Lynsted,
yowr servaunt, and hym bothe. It is soo that he and I bothe have ben in
hand with my unkyll[145-1] for hys mater, and yett wee have hym at noo
good poynt; but I troste we schall have. Syr, if I take thys jurney to
Caleys, I moste beseche yow to forbere hym lenger, and if I goo not to
Caleys, thow I be lothe to forbere hym, yet I schall brynge hym with me
schortly in to Norfolke, ye to have hym, if ye lyste, with the grace of
God, Who have yow in kepyng.

_To the ryght wurshupfull Sir John Paston, Knyght, be this delyvered._

[Sidenote: Before 1493]

Ryght wurshypfull Sir, I recomawnd me to zow. As zesterday I was with my

own mocyon he mevyd to me of the maryage of my nevew zour soon, and as
glad foolkes woold be to bargayn as ever ze wyste, and soo hathe shewyd
me that ze shuld have as myche as Sir E. Bedyngfelld, whyche was v. C.
marke. Moore over he shewyd that he woold depart with it to Sir Roger
T.[148-4] or to Harry Colett, whyche he shewyd ze woold not of, but to
have the mony at zour dysposyssyon; and me semys be hys report that he

suerte that the mony that he shuld depart with shuld goo to the redemyng
of zour landes, and other zowr dawngeres. More over he shewyd me that
the mony whyche ze skyftyd of H. Colett was th[oug]ht be Sir Harry H.
that Sir R. Townesend shuld have ben contentte with it, whyche is knowyn
the contrary, and causyd hym to geve delay in that be halffe to zow.
I know well this jantylman berythe zow as good mynde as any man alyve,
my mastres hys mother,[148-7] and allso my mastres hys wyve in lyeke
wyesse; and me semys he makys not the dowghttes to delyver zow hys mony
that other men do of the delyverye of thers. Foor trowthe, he shewythe
me hys mynde, whyche is thus: yf ze wyll putt lande in feffement for
zeres, to the full contentacyon of Townesend, Colett, and of my uncle,
whyche he and all men thynke ze muste be charged to, or ever ze goo
thorow, and that zour next frendes have the receyte of it tyll it be
full contente and payed, thus, or suche a suer weye to be had for the
well of all parteys, I darre say he is not alyve wyll indevour hym with
better wyll to deele with zow, and, as my mynde servys me, streytte
hymsylffe, as it may be booryn, be syde my mastes hys modyrs v. C. My
mastres hys wyffe, on my feythe I darr say, the moste harty body to zow
wordes in this be halffe that is alyve, and the fayneeste body woold be
to have it accomplyshyd.

Syr, I thenke ze be to wardes London, and well I woot zowre mynde is to
ease zour sylffe as hastely as ze may; I pray God ze do to zour honur,
and to zour moste well to gederys.

Marchandes or new jantylmen I deme wyll proferr large; noon other
dyspreysed, ze know the contynewance of this man, and how he is alyed.
Well I woott yf ze depart to London, ze shall have proferes large; yf
zour jornay be not but to ease yow in that be halfe, be my poor avyce
slake for iij. or iiij. days, for ever me semys I shuld not have ben
brokyn to so largely, but that they entende it hastely to say to zow.
Sythe I was ther, I undyr stande yf it had not happyd me to have seyne
them as zester day, she wold this day have made her cowntenance to have
seyn her nes, Bothas (?) dowter, wyche is at Pallynges for fere of the
plage, and have comyn seyne [_come and seen_] my wyffve, and specyally
to have de syrid us to meve zow towardes them, and in trowthe so she
hasse.

I pray God ze do as well to zour honur as I woold do my sylfe. Yf ze
wyll tery thys lytell season be foor rehersyd, yf ze lyste, I woott well
ze may have the mater moor largely comyned; and yf ze tary tyll Monday,
I wyll awayte on zow to Hynengham, with Godes grace, Who ever preserve
zow and zours.

conscience. In eschuenge wherof, I desire and pray you as hertely as I
can, that it wull leeke you to be so good maistyrs to the seid Thomas
as, by your wisdams and discrecion, the seid Sire Harry, by you or some

have regard to the seid right, and not to do eny thyng that shuld be
disheryson to his seid nevewe, and to have the more tender consideracion
to your mocion, for that the seid Thomas is to dyverse of you of kynne

And for the consideracion that I have, that the seid Sire Harry and
Thomas his nevewe, were of my lordes nere blode, whoes soule Jesu pardon

    [Footnote 155-3: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The writer of this
    letter was the widow of John Mowbray, the last Duke of Norfolk of
    that name, who died in 1475. She survived her husband many years,
    and Fenn says, though I know not on what authority, that she was
    alive in 1496. Sir Harry Grey, it appears, made his will on the
    28th September 1492 (Blomefield, v. 93), and one might imagine
    this letter was written in the same month and year. The
    inquisition upon his death, however, was only taken on the 26th
    October, 12 Hen. VII. (1496), and it does not state the day on
    which he died. The jurors found Thomas Martyn, who was then thirty
    years old and over, to be his kinsman and next heir, but that
    Ketteringham Hall was devised to the use of his wife Jane and of
    others after her death. It is certain, moreover, that this letter
    could not have been written before the year 1495 when Sir Robert
    Clere was knighted; and that is probably the very year, as Sir
    Harry Grey was dead at least in October 1496, and most likely a
    month or two earlier.]

    [Footnote 157-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Fenn says, I cannot tell
    on what grounds, that this letter must have been written between
    1491 and 1495. At the earlier of these dates the writer could not
    have been more than twelve years old, but as lads were sent to the
    university at a much earlier age in those days than in ours, even
    the earlier of these dates is not impossible. The style of the
    letter, however, is not boyish, and I should have been inclined to
    place it a year or two later even than Fenn's latest date, but
    that there is no clear evidence to go by. The sweating sickness
    was prevalent in England at different times during the reign of
    Henry VII.; and there is no particular record of its visiting
    Cambridge.]

Paston, Esquier, their late fader deceassed, which lands ye by mighty

hereof now shortly to ride to the court to the said arbitrators, now

their names fully authorized, to abide such final ende and conclusion in
the premisses as shall be consonant with the said agrement, without
further troubles or busines therin hereafter to be had; and that ye will

    Paston, the uncle of the two Sir Johns, died in 1496, and this
    letter must have been written either in the year following or
    between that date and 1503, when Sir Reginald Bray died. William
    Paston's will, which will be found in the Appendix, was dated 7th
    September 1496, and proved on the 28th November following. He
    married Anne Beaufort, daughter of Edmond, Duke of Somerset, and
    was therefore uncle to the writer of this letter, Margaret,
    Countess of Richmond, the mother of King Henry VII. The person to
    whom the letter is addressed is not named, but it is not unlikely
    to have been Sir John Paston the second.]

[Sidenote: Before 1503]

Plesitht it your mastership to remembre, I shewyd onto you in Lente that
I had bought Baktons place. Sir, it is so that John Bakton graunted to
John Trovy hes sone in lawe, hes mese with all the londes and tenements,
&c., takyng of the seide John Trovy viij. marke of annuyte yerly, terme
of hes lyf; wherupon endenture were made and a state delyverd. Upon the
weche I bargeyned with Trovy, payng to hym for hes parte c. marke and
x., wherof he hadde in hande iiij_li._ vj_s._ viij_d._ and xv_li._
xiij_s._ iiij_d._ shulde be payd at such tyme as I had a lawfull astate,
weche was apoynted before Michelmes last past; weche is not yet done.
Wherfore he hath forfeted an obligacion of xl_li._ that he was bounde in
to me for the same astate; ther was no defaute in me, for my money was
there redy. And, sir, in the same weke after your mastership departed
out of this contre, Bakton and the seide Trovy come to Bakton, and sent
for me, and there were we appoynted for the same bargeyn and accorded,
wenynge to me and to all tho that were there it had ben fully
concl[uded] . . . . . my suertes and for all other thynges. And sodenly
Bakton departed hem be the avice of [the Prior of Bro]mholme, and John
Bowle and other, weche meved Bakton that I shulde not have my bargein;
and so they entende to putte me from my bergein. And master Fitzlawes,
Kn[i]ght, of Esex, hath sent me a letter, weche I sende you closed
herin; and at hes enstaunce I have graunted Trovy an ende for vj_li._

all thes money payd onto me within xiiij. dayes after Cristemas, I wol

I suppose Mr. Lawes woll speke to you of thes mater. I beseche you that
ye wol be goode master to me herin, for I am lothe to be putte from my
bergein. I am in suerte there is no man wol geve so moche for it as I
wolde, and they nede not to fere them of ther payment, for I ofer them
iiij. suertes, the worste of them is worthe all the lande; yet Bakton
mystrustes me, and nede not. If I had it, I wolde truste to make it a

    [Footnote 162-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] From the mention of
    'Master Fitzlewes, Knight of Essex,' I am inclined to think this
    letter must be of the reign of Henry VII., and addressed to the
    later Sir John. Sir Lewis Fitzlewes of West Horndon, in Essex, was
    attainted as a Lancastrian in 1471, but the manor was restored to
    his son, Sir Richard, by Henry VII., who presented to the living
    from 1494 to 1519. The letter, however, must of course be earlier
    than 1503, the year in which Sir John Paston died.]

[RICHARD CALLE] TO [SIR JOHN PASTON?]

[Sidenote: Year uncertain]

Reminds him that four or five years ago he received from the writer
'certain wainscoat' and certain fish for his household, a hogshead of
wine, spars, 'clapholt,' etc. in full discharge of all former debts.
Will always be ready to repay what his correspondent has paid for him to
the King. Received of him a millstone, price L3, for which Calle gave a
ryall in earnest, and delivered 1 quarter cod to Philip Loveday. I am
grateful for the pains taken by 'your mastership' on my account, etc.

  [The handwriting of this letter seems to be that of Richard Calle,
  but much older looking than that of most of his letters. As there is
  no distinct evidence of date, we place it after another letter of
  his, which seems to be late.]

Mastyrs bothe, I recomand me to yow, and send yow closid herin a booke
of the seying of dyvers folkis, whiche testyfiee ayenst Thomas Rutty and
other. I prey yow shewe it to my lordys[166-2] good lordshepe, and that
I may know hys plesur ferther in as hasty wyse as may be, that I may

in prison at Norwyche with the Shrevys of Norwych. The woman seythe he
is as bold a theffe as eny is in Ingland; but he wyll nowghte confesse,
nor I handelyd hym not sore to cause hym to confesse. But and Ruty knewe
that he and the woman be in hold, and hathe told talis, I thynke it wyll
cause Rutty to shewe the pleynesse.

Clerk and Roger Heron are endightid at this sessyons at Norwyche, last
holdyn on Twysday last past, for robbing of the pardoner; and so is
Rotty and all his felawshepe that the woman hathe apechid. According to
hir apechement, Raff Taylour is over the see; Robert Fenne is dede; John
Baker and William Taylour ar yett untakyn. If my lord send for T. Bange
or the woman, some of my lordis servauntes had need to come for theym;
for I can not do in the cause for lake of men and horse, for my wyff
ridith this next week in to Kente, to the wydow, hir doughtir Leghe.

And as for Ramesey, liek a prowde, lewde, obstynat foole, he wyll not

Bayly gret wronge in his reknynges.

    [Footnote 166-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is
    anonymous, but is in the handwriting of Sir John Paston, the
    younger of that name. From the mention of his wife and 'the widow,
    her daughter Leghe,' it was evidently written not during the life
    of Margery Brews, his first wife, who must have died about the
    year 1495, but after his marriage to another. This second wife was
    Agnes, daughter of Nicholas Morley, Esq., of the well-known family
    at Glynd, in Sussex, and had already been twice married before her
    marriage with Sir John. Her first husband was John Hervey, Esq. of
    Thurleigh, Beds, Usher of the Chamber to King Edward IV. Her
    second was John Isley of Sundridge, Kent. By the former she had a
    daughter, Isabel, married to John Leghe or Alyghe, Esq. of
    Addington, Surrey, who proved his father-in-law's will in 1494.
    She herself survived her own third husband, Sir John Paston, and
    died in 1510. Her will, in which she calls herself 'Dame Agnes
    Paston,' is at the principal registry at Somerset House, dated the
    31st May in that year, and proved on the 19th June following. For
    these particulars I was indebted to the genealogical researches of
    the late Colonel Chester, and _Notes and Queries_, 5th S. ix. 326,

    [Footnote 167-1: [From Douce MS. 393, f. 86.] This letter is
    probably later in date than the last, as it would appear that when
    the last was written, William Paston was still in the Earl of
    Oxford's service.]

THE EARL OF OXFORD'S STEWARD TO THE 'BLACK KNIGHT'[168-1]

_Sinescallus Comitis Oxoniae Nigro Militi._

  Non decet Sinescallo tam magni Comitis
    Ut Comes Oxoniae verbis in Anglicis
  Scrittere epistolas, vel suis in nuncijs
    Aliquid proponere si non in Latinis.

  Igitur ille pauperculus praedicti Comitis
    Magnus Sinescallus magni Comitatis
  Nuncupatur Norff. Latinis in verbis
    Apud Knapton in curia in forma Judicis.

  Tibi nigro militi salutem, et omnibus
    Notifico, quod Langdon ille homunculus
  Nullam pecuniam liberare vult gentibus,
    Quod est magnum impedimentum nostris operibus.

  Idcirco tibi mando sub poena contemptus,
    Quod tu indilate proprijs manubus
  Scribas tuas lettras, quod ille homunculus
    Copiam pecuniae deliberet gentibus.

  Sin autem per littras has nostras patentes
    Ego et operarij, qui sunt consentientes
  Omnes una voce promemus suos dentes
    Nisi liberet pecuniam, cum simus egentes.

  Teste meipso apud Knapton praedicta,
    Est et michi testis Maria Benedicta,
  Quod vicesimo die Julij non inde relicta
    Erat summa solidi, res haec non est ficta.

    [Footnote 168-1: [From Fenn, iv. 458.] The 'Black Knight,' to whom
    this facetious doggrel was addressed, seems to me to have been
    most probably the later Sir John Paston, whose services the Earl
    of Oxford, as the reader is aware, continually made use of. The
    manor of Knapton came to John, 12th Earl of Oxford, who died in
    1462, by his marriage with Elizabeth, grand-daughter of Sir John
    Howard.]

ARCHBISHOP WARHAM TO WILLIAM PASTON[170-1]

by the which I have undrestand of the deth of my cousyn your fadre,
whose soule Jesu assoile. I wol counsaile and exhorte you to take it as

not entremedyll in any wise with th'admynystring of any parte of your

as at your comyng hudre ye shal knowe more.

whom I pray you to have me recommendyd. Thus fare ye hertily wel.

From London, the vj^th day of Septembre.

  Your,

  WILLIAM, ELECTE OF LONDON.

    [Footnote 170-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The writer of this
    letter was William Warham, who was first Bishop of London, and
    afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. According to the signature,
    he was Bishop-elect of London at the time it was written, but we
    are persuaded that it is a slip of the pen. He was elected Bishop
    of London in 1502, and was consecrated on the 5th October; but it
    is clear from the preceding No. that Sir John Paston was alive as
    late as the beginning of February 1503. In the year 1503, however,
    Warham was translated to Canterbury. The bull for his translation
    was issued on the 29th November 1503, but doubtless he was elected
    some time before; and it is quite intelligible how, being actually
    Bishop of London, he should have written 'Elect of London' in
    place of 'Elect of Canterbury.' Moreover, the allusion to the
    business of the administration agrees entirely with this
    supposition.]

JOHN KENDAL TO [WILLIAM PASTON?][171-1]

[Sidenote: 1503, or later (?)]

Your pore servaunt and bedeman, John Kendale, be secheth your good and
gracious masterschepp, at the reverence of God and in the wey of
charyte, to remembre that my maister your fader, on whos soule God have
mercy, had fro me x. acres of free londe that I bout of the executours
of Nicholas Pekeryng of Filby for xx. marc paid on j. day, to pay to
executours of Edmonde Norman for purchase of ij. partes of Holm Halle,
somtyme Edmonde Norman.

Also my seide maister, your fader, had fro John Kendale the croppe of
the seide x. acres londe, sowen with barly and peson, wherof v. acres
were weel somerlayde[171-2] to the seid barly, the whiche croppe the
seide John Kendale schulde a made worth to hym iiij_li._ xiij_s._
iiij_d._, althow ther had be but xx. quarteres barly growyng on viij.
acres and half of londe, that is to seyn up on an acre ij. quarter,
iiij. busshelz, and the half acre in avayle, besyde j. acre and an half
of peson, for the seide John Kendale solde his malt at Ormesby mad of
the barly growyng the same yer that the foreseid croppe was taken fro
hym, for iiij_s._ viij_d._ a quartere; and so he myght a solde the same
and meche more if he had had it.

Also my seid maister, your fader, hath caused the foreseid John Kendale
to a foreborne the ferme of the seide x. acres of londe be the space of
ix. yer, be the yer xvj_s._ & viij_d._, that is, the ferme of j. acre
xx_d._, wherof the somme conteyneth vij_li._ x_s._ beside j. yer
receyved of Hagh.[172-1]

    [Footnote 171-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] If this petition was
    addressed to any member of the Paston family, I should think it
    must have been William Paston, the son of the later Sir John. That
    would make the date at least as late as the year 1503, when his
    father died. If it was either of the two Sir Johns, 'my master
    your father' would be John Paston, Esquire, who died in 1466. But
    Nicholas Pickering of Filby is said to have been buried in the
    steeple of Filby church in the year 1466, and it is evident that
    'my master your father' survived him more than nine years.

    Edmund Norman, whose executors are here spoken of, died as far
    back as 1444. Blomefield says he was seised of two parts of the
    manor of Filby, but does not mention him as being also owner of
    two parts of Holm Hale. The two parts of Filby were afterwards
    held in trust by Sir John Fastolf; but William Pickering and
    Cecily, his wife, were lords of the whole manor and settled it on
    John Paston, who released it to Nicholas Pickering in
    1450.--Blomefield, xi. 218, 221.]

ye schall have knowlege.

From Wyndesouer this Saterday, at v. of the cloke.

    [Footnote 172-3: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter gives an
    account of the meeting of Henry VII. and Philip, King of Castile,
    near Windsor, during the time when the latter was detained in
    England in the beginning of the year 1506. It is well known how
    after setting out from the Low Countries to take possession of his
    kingdom of Castile, Philip met with a storm, and was driven to
    land on our coast, and how, on hearing of it, Henry invited him to
    visit him at his Court, where he staid for some time while the
    damage done to his fleet was being repaired.]

some seid in yower ship, and some seid ayein your wyll ye were departed;
of wych departyng my lord Steward hadde knowleche and comaunded a noon
after your old servaunt Rychard Fitzwater to ryde to Norwich, and so to
Yermoth, to knowe the trowth. And at Norwich I spoke with your seid
servaunt, and ther he shewed vonto me that my lord hadde send another of
his servauntis vonto my Lord of Oxynford to shew vonto his lordship of
your departyng, &c., and fferthermore he shewed vonto me prevyly that my
Lord hath imagyned and purposed many grevous thyngis ayens your

  T. BALKEY.

    [Footnote 183-1: [Add. MS. 33,597, f. 10.] There is nothing in the
    rest of the Paston correspondence to throw any light upon this
    letter, either as to the date at which it was written, or as to
    the person addressed, whether it be John Paston the eldest or the
    younger of the two Johns, his sons.]

ANONYMOUS TO MASTER PASTON[184-1]

Maister Paston, it is so that my Lord desireth to have his lyverey as
for this yere to be of the colour that he hadde him self a demye gowne
of, and his childern hadde of the same ayenst Cristmasse laste was;
I wot never whether ye remembre it or nay. Yt was a medelled tawney, som
what rede, and it was bought at Watkyn Stalworthes. I pray you assaye
among the clothe makers in your countre howe a man may bye a cloth of
them. Ye muste remembre the gentilmen muste have better than the yomen,
and the yomen better than the gromes. And ye knowe well that ye and I
the laste yere pourvoied my lord of the gentilmenes lyverey and the
yomens for iij_s._ a yerde, one with a nother, and the gromes for ij_s._
viij_d._, and boughte all at the drapers in London. Wherfore my Lord
woll thinke to be served of better clothe and lesse price at the clothe
makers. I wolde have sente you an example but I can not gette it.

    [Footnote 184-1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 148.] This letter contains a
    great many uncertainties. The writer is anonymous, the person
    addressed is by no means clear, and the lord referred to cannot be
    determined. Neither is there any means of arriving at an
    approximate date.]

    [Footnote 184-2: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 181.] It is difficult to

    [Footnote 186-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] I cannot tell by whom
    this memorandum was drawn up, nor do I know to what it refers. But
    as the MS. appears to belong to the Paston collection, and is of
    the period, I have not thought it right to omit it. The name
    'Vyall' which is written on the back of the paper occurs in No.

1085-8

ABSTRACTS[186-2]

The following letters are probably all of the time of Henry VII. They
are all addressed to a Mr. William Paston, but perhaps not all to the
same person. The first two are apparently to William Paston, the brother
of the two Sir Johns. The third is doubtful. The last may be to the son
of the second Sir John.

  1085.--John Wryght to Master William Paston at Hynnyngham.--Has
  received from him a bill with 3_s._ 6_d._, part payment of the
  cotton russet. 'The rest we shall drink when ye come to London.'
  Does not understand Paston's order for other 9 yards. Does he wish
  frieze, cotton or plain blanket?--London, St. Catherine's Even.

  1086.--John Breton of Hadley to Master William Paston.--Desires him
  to be good master to the bearer, 'a poor kinsman of mine,' to whom
  my lord[186-3] has written sharply, that he may come before my lord
  for his answer.

  1087.--Petyr Marham to his master, William Paston.--Desires his
  advice, as Robert Gaunley, sometime his 'prentice, has taken an
  action against him at the common law.

  1088.--William Ocley to Master William Paston.--Has spoken with
  young Wyndam in Master Digby's presence. He was grateful to Paston
  for his loving mind towards him, and said he would receive 'the two
  riall' himself, and buy no new gear till he knew the King's pleasure
  touching his pardon.--London, 3 Sept.

NOTE TO NO. 1016.

  As stated in the footnote at p. 101, since the above document was in
  type the Editor came upon a complete copy of this list of knights
  made at the battle of Stoke, which, being also more accurate than
  that in Leland's _Collectanea_, is here printed in full. It is
  apparently the original MS. of which No. 1016 is a mutilated copy,
  and is written on two flyleaves of the copy of Caxton's _Game and
  Play of Chess_ in the King's Library in the British Museum.

defunctorum septem de nac' (?). Item, lego Roberto nunc priori ecclesiae
Sancti Andreae de Bromholm quadraginta solidos; et cuilibet monacho
ejusdem ecclesiae conventus de Bromholm sex solidos et octo denarios; et
executoribus testamenti Ricardi Causton, nuper vicarii ecclesiae de
Paston, viginti solidos; et executoribus testamenti Adae, nuper vicarii
ecclesiae de Bakton, sex solidos et octo denarios; ita quod remittant et
relaxent in conscientiis suis animabus praedictis si quae per earum
aliquam sibi debita fuerint. Et si hoc remittere et relaxare
recusaverint, de praedictis legatis nihil habeant, sed in omnibus quae
sibi per animas praedictas vel earum aliquam deberi rationabiliter aut
evidenter, in conscientia vel aliter, juxta discretionem executorum
meorum, aut majoris partis eorundem, probaverint aut verificaverint,
sibi satisfaciant executores mei. Residuum vero bonorum meorum omnium
non legatorum do et lego Agneti uxori meae, Johanni filio meo, Willelmo
Bakton et Johanni Damme de Sustede, quos ordino et constituo executores
hujus testamenti mei, ut ipsi inde disponant pro[ut] in justis
conscientiis suis magis viderint Deo placere et animabus praedictis
prodesse. In cujus rei testimonium praesentibus sigillum meum apposui.
Datum decimo die Januarii anno regni Regis Henrici Sexti post Conquestum

patrem et dominum, dominum Willelmum Lincolniensem Episcopum[190-1]
ordino et constituo supervisorem.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
