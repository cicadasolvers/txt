  Of a fairy-haunted wood.
  Here and there, in light and shade,
  Ill-assorted couples strayed:
  "Lord," said Puck, in elfish glee,
  "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"_

 _Now he sings the self-same tune
  Underneath an older moon.
  Life to him is, plain enough,
  Still a game of blind man's buff.
  If we listen we may hear
  Puckish laughter always near,
  And the elf's apostrophe,
  "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"_

Foreword

By Henry B. Fuller


Bert Leston Taylor (known the country over as "B. L. T.") was the first
of our day's "colyumists"--first in point of time, and first in point of
merit. For nearly twenty years, with some interruptions, he conducted "A
Line-o'-Type or Two" on the editorial page of the Chicago _Tribune_. His
broad column--broad by measurement, broad in scope, and a bit broad, now
and again, in its tone--cheered hundreds of thousands at the
breakfast-tables of the Middle West, and on its trains and trolleys. As
the "Column" grew in reputation, "making the Line" became almost a
national sport. Whoever had a happy thought, whoever could handily turn
a humorous paragraph or tune a pointed jingle, was only too glad to
attempt collaboration with B. L. T. Others, possessing no literary
knack, chanced it with brief reports on the follies or ineptitudes of
the "so-called human race." Some of them picked up their matter on their
travels--these were the "Gadders." Others culled oddities from the
provincial press, and so gave further scope to "The Enraptured
Reporter," or offered selected gems of _gaucherie_ from private
correspondence, and thus added to the rich yield of "The Second Post."
Still humbler helpers chipped in with queer bits of nomenclature,
thereby aiding the formation of an "Academy of Immortals"--an
organization fully officered by people with droll names and always
tending, as will become apparent in the following pages, to enlarge and
vary its roster.

All these contributors, as well as many other persons who existed
independently of the "Line," lived in the corrective fear of the
"Cannery," that capacious receptacle which yawned for the trite word and
the stereotyped phrase. Our language, to B. L. T., was an honest, living
growth: deadwood, whether in thought or in the expression of thought,
never got by, but was marked for the burning. The "Cannery," with its
numbered shelves and jars, was a deterrent indeed, and anyone who
ventured to relieve himself as "Vox Populi" or as a conventional
versifier, did well to walk with care.

Over all these aids, would-be or actual, presided the Conductor himself,
furnishing a steady framework by his own quips, jingles and
philosophizings, and bringing each day's exhibit to an ordered unity.
The Column was more than the sum of its contributors. It was the sum of
units, original or contributed, that had been manipulated and brought to
high effectiveness by a skilled hand and a nature wide in its sympathies
and in its range of interests.

Taylor had the gift of opening new roads and of inviting a willing
public to follow. Or, to put it another way, he had the faculty of
making new moulds, into which his helpers were only too glad to pour
their material. Some of these "leads" lasted for weeks; some for months;
others persisted through the years. The lifted wand evoked, marshalled,
vivified, and the daily miracle came to its regular accomplishment.

Taylor hewed his Line in precise accord with his own taste and fancy.
All was on the basis of personal preference. His chiefs learned early
that so rare an organism was best left alone to function in harmony with
its own nature. The Column had not only its own philosophy and its own
aesthetics, but its own politics: if it seemed to contravene other and
more representative departments of the paper, never mind. Its conductor
had such confidence in the validity of his personal predilections and in
their identity with those of "the general," that he carried on things
with the one rule of pleasing himself, certain that he should find no
better rule for pleasing others. His success was complete.

His papers and clippings, found in a fairly forward state of
preparation, gave in part the necessary indications for the completion
of this volume. The results will perhaps lack somewhat the typographical
effectiveness which is within the reach of a metropolitan daily when
utilized by a "colyumist" who was also a practical printer, and they can
only approximate that piquant employment of juxtaposition and contrast
which made every issue of "A Line-o'-Type or Two" a work of art in its
way. But no arrangement of items from that source could becloud the
essential nature of its Conductor: though "The So-Called Human Race"
sometimes plays rather tartly and impatiently with men's follies and
shortcomings, it clearly and constantly exhibits a sunny, alert and airy
spirit to whom all things human made their sharp appeal.

_Motto: Hew to the Line, let the quips fall where they may._


SIMPLE

  My readers are a varied lot;
    Their tastes do not agree.
  A squib that tickles A is not
    At all the thing for B.

  What's sense to J, is folderol
    To K, but pleases Q.
  So, when I come to fill the Col,
    I know just what to do.

It is refreshing to find in the society columns an account of a quiet
wedding. The conventional screams of a groom are rather trying.

A man will sit around smoking all day and his wife will remark: "My
dear, aren't you smoking too much?" The doctor cuts him down to three
cigars a day, and his wife remarks: "My dear, aren't you smoking too
much?" Finally he chops off to a single after-dinner smoke, and when he
lights up his wife remarks: "John, you do nothing but smoke all day
long." Women are singularly observant.

       *       *       *

NO DOUBT THERE ARE OTHERS.

speaks of the parlor in his house as the lobby. E. C. M.

With the possible exception of Trotzky, Mr. Hearst is the busiest person

Ancestor worship is not peculiar to any tribe or nation. We observed
last evening, on North Clark street, a crowd shaking hands in turn with
an organ-grinder's monkey.

"In fact," says an editorial on Uncongenial Clubs, "a man may go to a
club to get away from congenial spirits." True. And is there any more
uncongenial club than the Human Race? The service is bad, the membership
is frightfully promiscuous, and about the only place to which one can
escape is the library. It is always quiet there.

_THE GIRL OF THE PERIOD._

 _She formerly talked of the weather,
    The popular book, or the play;
      Her old line of chat
      Was of this thing or that
    In the fashions and fads of the day._

 _But now she discusses eugenics,
    And things that a pundit perplex;
      She knocks you quite flat
      With her new line of chat,
    And her "What do you think about sex?"_

       *       *       *

"Are we all to shudder at the name of Rabelais and take to smelling
salts?" queries an editorial colleague. "Are we to be a wholly lady-like
nation?" Small danger, brother. Human nature changes imperceptibly, or
not at all. The objection to most imitations of Rabelais is that they
lack the unforced wit and humor of the original.

       *       *       *

A picture of Dr. A. Ford Carr testing a baby provokes a frivolous reader
to observe that when the babies cry the doctor probably gives them a
rattle.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN "ALMOST"!

[From the Cedar Rapids Republican.]

The man who writes a certain column in Chicago can always fill
two-thirds of it with quotations and contributions. But that may be
called success--when they bring the stuff to you and are almost willing
to pay you for printing it.

WE'LL TELL THE PLEIADES SO.

Sir: "I'll say she is," "Don't take it so hard," "I'll tell the world."
These, and other slangy explosives from our nursery, fell upon the
sensitive auditory nerves of callers last evening. I am in a quandary,
whether to complain to the missus or write a corrective letter to the
children's school teachers, for on the square some guy ought to bawl the
kids out for fair about this rough stuff--it gets my goat.

Did you think "I'll say so" was new slang? Well, it isn't. You will find
it in Sterne's "Sentimental Journey."

WHERE 'VANGIE LIES.

_Rondeau Sentimental to Evangeline, the Office Goat._

  Where 'Vangie lies strown folios
  Like Vallambrosan leaves repose,
    The sad, the blithe, the quaint, the queer,
    The good, the punk are scattered here--
  A pile of poof in verse and prose.

  And none would guess, save him who strows,
  How much transcendent genius goes
    Unwept, unknown, into the smear
                          Where 'Vangie lies.

  With every opening mail it snows
  Till 'Vangie's covered to her nose.
    Forgetting that she is so near,
    I sometimes kick her in the ear.
  Then sundry piteous ba-a-a's disclose
                          Where 'Vangie lies.

THE SECOND POST.

(_Letter from an island caretaker._)

Dear Sir: Your letter came. Glad you bought a team of horses. Hilda is
sick. She has diphtheria and she will die I think. Clara died this eve.
She had it, too. We are quarantined. Five of Fisher's family have got
it. My wife is sick. She hain't got it. If this thing gets worse we may
have to get a doctor. Them trees are budding good. Everything is O. K.

Just as we started to light a pipe preparatory to filling this column,
we were reminded of Whistler's remark to a student who was smoking: "You
should be very careful. You know you might get interested in your work
and let your pipe go out."

       *       *       *

It is odd, and not uninteresting to students of the so-called human
race, that a steamfitter or a manufacturer of suspenders who may not
know the difference between the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution--who may not, indeed, know anything at all--is nevertheless
a bubbly-fountain of political wisdom; whereas a writer for a newspaper
is capable of emitting only drivel. This may be due to the greater
opportunity for meditation enjoyed by suspender-makers and
steamfitters.

"It is with ideas we shall conquer the world," boasts Lenine. If he
needs a few more he can get them at the Patent Office in Washington,

HEARD IN THE BANK.

A woman from the country made a deposit consisting of several items.
After ascertaining the amount the receiving teller asked, "Did you foot
it up?" "No, I rode in," said she.

The fact that Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and other great
departed whose names are taken in vain every day by small-bore
politicians, do not return and whack these persons over the heads with a
tambourine, is almost--as Anatole France remarked in an essay on
Flaubert--is almost an argument against the immortality of the soul.

Harper's Weekly refrains from comment on the shipping bill because, says
its editor, "we have not been able to accumulate enough knowledge."
Well! If every one refrained from expressing an opinion on a subject
until he was well informed the pulp mills would go out of business and a
great silence would fall upon the world.

       *       *       *

It is pleasant to believe the sun is restoring its expended energy by
condensation, and that the so-called human race is in the morning of its
existence; and it is necessary that the majority should believe so, for
otherwise the business of the world would not get done. The happiest
cynic would be depressed by the sight of humanity sitting with folded
hands, waiting apathetically for the end.

  I would not seem to slam our valued planet,--
    Space, being infinite, may hold a worse;
  Nor would I intimate that if I ran it

  Within our solar system, or without it,
    May be a world less rationally run;
  There may be such a geoid, but I doubt it--
    I can't conceive of one.

  If from the time our sphere began revolving
    Until the present writing there had been
  A glimmer of a promise of resolving
    The muddle we are in:

  If we could answer "Whither are we drifting?"
    Or hope to wallow out of the morass--
  I might continue boosting and uplifting;
    But as it is, I pass.

  So on your way, old globe, wherever aiming,

  As far away the prospect of reclaiming

dreamed are as a book that is sealed to most of those who put them upon
programmes; for these do not merely play them badly, they do not play
them at all. Thus they cannot be spoiled for us, nor can our ear be

it would be a relief to everybody if a board, or commission, or other

appalling situation arose, this group could be appalled for the rest of
us. And we, knowing that the board would be properly appalled, should
not have to worry.

We lived high, dressed expensively (for Manchester), and always had
money for Wine and Song. How did we manage it? Blessed if we can

The soi-disant human race appears to its best advantage, perhaps its

over-bright, having only enough wit to scrape along with. Work is the

existence disappears.

labors were entirely within our control we should write exclusively for
children. They are more intelligent than adults, have a quicker
apprehension, and are without prejudices. In addressing children, one
may write quite frankly and sincerely. In addressing grown-ups the only
safe medium of expression is irony.

O WILD! O STRANGE!

"That wild and strange thing, the press."--H. G. Wells.

  It's now too late, I fear, to change,

  I've always been a little strange,
    And just a little wild.

  I never knew the reason why,
    But now the cause I guess--
  What Mr. Wells, the author, calls
    "That wild, strange thing, the press."

  I've worked for every kind of pape
    In journalism's range,
  And some were tame and commonplace,
    But most were wild and strange.

  I ran a country paper once--
    Or, rather, it ran me;
  It was the strangest, wildest thing
    That ever you did see.

  Some years ago I settled down
    And thought to find a cure
  By writing books and plays and sich,
    That class as litrachoor.

  And for a time I lived apart,
    In abject happiness;
  Yet all the while I hankered for
    That strange, wild thing, the press.

  Its fatal fascination I
    Could not resist for long;
  I fled the path of litrachoor,
    And once again went wrong.

  I resurrected this here Col,
    By which you are beguiled.
  I fear you find it strange sometimes,
    And always rather wild.

We quite agree with Mr. Masefield that great literary work requires
leisure. Lack of leisure is handicapping us in the writing of a romance.
We compose it while waiting for trains, while shoveling snow and coal,
while riding on the L, while shaving; and we write it on the backs of
envelopes, on the covering of packages, on the margins of newspapers.
The best place to write a book is in jail, where Cervantes wrote Don
Quixote; but we can't find time to commit a greater misdemeanor than
this column, and there is no jail sentence for that. The only
compensation for the literary method we are forced to adopt is that
there is a great deal of "go" in it.

THE BABES IN THE WOOD.


I

Once upon a time there dwelt in a small but very expensive cottage on
the outskirts of a pine forest a gentleman with his wife and two
children. It was a beautiful estate and the neighborhood was the very
best. Nobody for miles around was worth less than five million dollars.

One night the gentleman tapped at his wife's boudoir, and receiving
permission to enter, he said: "Pauline, I have been thinking about our
children. I overheard the governess say to-day that they are really
bright and interesting, and as yet unspoiled. Perhaps if they had a fair
chance they might amount to something."

"Reginald," replied his wife, "you are growing morbid about those
children. You will be asking to see them next." She shrugged her
gleaming shoulders, and rang for the maid to let down her hair.

"Remember our own youth and shudder, Pauline," said the gentleman. "It's
a shame to allow Percival and Melisande to grow up in this atmosphere."

"Well," said the lady petulantly, "what do you suggest?"

"I think it would be wise and humane to abandon them. The butler or the
chauffeur can take them into the wood and lose them and some peasant may
find and adopt them, and they may grow up to be worthy citizens. At
least it is worth trying."

"Do as you please," said the lady. "The children are a collaboration;
they are as much yours as mine."

This conversation was overheard by little Melisande, who had stolen down
from her little boudoir in her gold-flowered nightdress for a peep at
her mamma, whom she had not seen for a long, long time. The poor child
was dreadfully frightened, and crept upstairs weeping to her brother.

"Pooh!" said Percival, who was a brave little chap. "We shall find our
way out of the wood, never fear. Give me your pearl necklace,
Melisande."

The wondering child dried her eyes and fetched the necklace, and
Percival stripped off the pearls and put them in the pocket of his
velvet jacket. "They can't lose us, sis," said he.


II

In the morning the butler took the children a long, long way into the
woods, pretending that he had discovered a diamond mine; and, bidding
them stand in a certain place till he called, he went away and did not
return. Melisande began to weep, as usual, but Percival only laughed,
for he had dropped a pearl every little way as they entered the wood,
and the children found their way home without the least difficulty.
Their father was vexed by their cleverness, but their mamma smiled.

"It's fate, Reginald," she remarked. "They were born for the smart set,
and they may as well fulfill their destinies."

"Let us try once more," said the gentleman. "Give them another chance."

When the servant called the children the next morning Percival ran to
get another pearl necklace, but the jewel cellar was locked, and the
best he could do was to conceal a four-pound bunch of hothouse grapes
under his jacket. This time they were taken twice as far into the wood
in search of the diamond mine; and alas! when the butler deserted them
Percival found that the birds had eaten every grape he had dropped along
the way. They were now really lost, and wandered all day without coming
out anywhere, and at night they slept on a pile of leaves, which
Percival said was much more like camping out than their summer in the
Adirondacks. All next day they wandered, without seeing sign of a road
or a chateau, and Melisande wept bitterly.

"I am so hungry," exclaimed the poor child. "If we only could get a few
_marrons glaces_ for breakfast!"

"I could eat a few macaroons myself," said Percival.


III

On the afternoon of the third day Percival and Melisande came to a
strange little cottage fashioned of gingerbread, but as the children had
never tasted anything so common as gingerbread they did not recognize
it. However, the cottage felt soft and looked pretty enough to eat, so
Percival bit off a piece of the roof and declared it was fine. Melisande
helped herself to the doorknob, and the children might have eaten half
the cottage had not a witch who lived in it come out and frightened them
away. The children ran as fast as their legs could work, for the witch
looked exactly like their governess, who tried to make them learn to
spell and do other disagreeable tasks.

Presently they came out on a road and saw a big red automobile belonging
to nobody in particular. It was the most beautiful car imaginable. The
hubs were set with pigeon blood rubies and the spokes with brilliants;
the tires were set with garnets to prevent skidding, and the hood was
inlaid with diamonds and emeralds. Even Percival and Melisande were
impressed. One door stood invitingly open and the children sprang into
the machine. They were accustomed to helping themselves to everything
that took their fancy; they had inherited the instinct.

Percival turned on the gas. "Hang on to your hair, sis!" he cried, and
he burnt up the road all the way home, capsizing the outfit in front of
the mansion and wrecking the automobile.

Their mamma came slowly down the veranda steps with a strange gentleman
by her side. "These are the children, Edward," she said, picking them
up, uninjured by the spill. "Children, this is your new papa."

The gentleman shook hands with them very pleasantly and said he hoped
that he should be their papa long enough to get really acquainted with
them. At which remark the lady smiled and tapped him with her fan.

And they lived happily, after their fashion, ever afterward.




LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.


I

Once upon a time there was a little girl who was the prettiest creature
imaginable. Her mother was excessively fond of her, and saw her as
frequently as possible, sometimes as often as once a month. Her
grandmother, who doted on her even more, had made for her in Paris a
little red riding hood of velvet embroidered with pearl passementerie,
which became the child so well that everybody in her set called her
Little Red Riding-Hood.

One day her mother said to her: "Go, my dear, and see how your
grandmother does, for I hear she has been ill with indigestion. Carry
her this filet and this little pot of foie gras."

The grandmother lived in a secluded and exclusive part of the village,
in a marble cottage situated in the midst of a wooded park. Little Red
Riding-Hood got out of the motor when she came to the park, telling the
chauffeur she would walk the rest of the way. She hardly passed the
hedge when she met a Wolf.

"Whither are you going?" he asked, looking wistfully at her.

"I am going to see my grandmother, and carry her a filet and a little
pot of foie gras from my mamma."

"Well," said the Wolf, "I'll go see her, too. I'll go this way and you
go that, and we shall see who will be there first."

The Wolf ran off as fast as he could, and was first at the door of the
marble cottage. The butler informed him that Madame was not at home, but
he sprang through the door, knocking the servant over, and ran upstairs
to Madame's boudoir.

"Who's there?" asked the grandmother, when the Wolf tapped at the door.

"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood," replied the Wolf,
counterfeiting the child's voice, "who has brought you a filet and a
little pot of foie gras."


II

The good grandmother, who had eaten nothing for two days except a
mallard, with a pint of champagne, cried out hungrily, "Come in, my
dear."

The Wolf ran in, and, falling upon the old lady, ate her up in a hurry,
for he had not tasted food for a whole week. He then got into the bed,
and presently Little Red Riding-Hood tapped at the door.

The Wolf pitched his voice as high and unpleasant as he could, and
called out, "What is it, Hawkins?"

"It isn't Hawkins," replied Little Red Riding-Hood. "It is your
grandchild, who has brought you a filet and a little pot of foie gras."

"Come in, my dear," responded the Wolf. And when the child entered he
said: "Put the filet and the little pot of foie gras on the gold
tabouret, and come and lie down with me."

Little Red Riding-Hood did not think it good form to go to bed so very,
very late in the morning, but as she expected to inherit her
grandmother's millions she obediently took off her gold-flowered frock,
and her pretty silk petticoat, and her dear little diamond stomacher,
and got into bed, where, amazed at the change for the better in her
grandmother's appearance, she said to her:

"Grandmother, how thin your arms have got!"

"I have been dieting, my dear."

"Grandmother, how thin your legs have got!"

"The doctor makes me walk every day."

"Grandmother, how quiet you are!"

"This isn't a symphony concert hall, my dear."

"Grandmother, what has become of your diamond-filled teeth?"

"These will do, my dear."

And saying these words the wicked Wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood
and ate her all up.




JACK AND THE BEANSTALK.


I

Once upon a time there was a very wealthy widow who lived in a marble
cottage approached by a driveway of the same stone, bordered with
rhododendrons. She had an only son, Jack--a giddy, thoughtless boy, but
very kindhearted, as many a hard-working chorus girl had reason to
remember. Jack was an idle fellow, whose single accomplishment was
driving an automobile, in which he displayed remarkable skill and
recklessness; there was hardly a day he did not run over something or
somebody. One day he bumped a very heavy workingman, whose remains
messed up the car so badly that Jack's mother lost patience with him.
"My dear," she said, "why don't you put your skill and energy to some
use? If only you would slay the giant Ennui, who ravages our country,
you would be as great a hero in our set as St. George of England was in
his."

Jack laughed. "Let him but get in the way of my car," said he, "and I'll
knock him into the middle of next month."

The boy set out gaily for the garage, to have the motor repaired, and on
the way he met a green-goods grocer who displayed a handful of beautiful
red, white, and blue beans. Jack stopped to look at what he supposed was
a new kind of poker chip, and the man persuaded the silly youth to
exchange the automobile for the beans.

When he brought home the "chips" his mother laughed loudly. "You are
just like your father; he didn't know beans, either," she said. "Dig a
hole in the tennis court, Jack, and plant your poker chips, and see what
will happen."

Jack did as he was told to do, and the next morning he went out to see
whether anything had happened. What was his amazement to find that a
mass of twisted stalks had grown out of his jackpot and climbed till
they covered the high cliff back of the tennis court, disappearing above
it.


II

Jack came of a family of climbers. His mother had climbed into society
and was still climbing. The funny thing about climbers is that they
never deceive anybody; every one knows just what they are up to. As Jack
had inherited the climbing passion he began without hesitation to ascend
the beanstalk, and when he reached the top he was as tired as if he had
spent the day laying bricks or selling goods behind a counter; but he
perked up when he beheld a fairy in pink tights who looked very much
like a coryphee in the first row of "The Girly Girl."

"Is this a roof garden?" asked Jack, looking about him curiously.

"No, kid," replied the Fairy, tapping him playfully with her spear. "You
are in the Land of Pleasure, and in yonder castle lives a horrid Giant
called Ennui, who bores everybody he catches to death."

Jack put on a brave face and lighted a cigarette. "Has he ever caught
you, little one?" he asked.

"No," she laughed, "but I'm knocking wood. Fairies don't get bored until
they grow old, or at least middle-aged."

"It's a wonder," said Jack, "that the Giant doesn't bore himself to
death some day."

"He might," said the Fairy, "if it were not for his wonderful talking
harp, which keeps harping upon Socialism, and the single tax, and the
rights of labor, and a lot of other mush; but you see it keeps Ennui
stirred up, so that he is never bored entirely stiff."

"Well," said Jack, "me for that harp, if I die for it!" And thanking
Polly Twinkletoes for her information, and promising to buy her a supper
when he got his next allowance, he sauntered toward the castle. As he
paused before the great gate it was opened suddenly by a most unpleasant
looking giantess.

"Ho! ho!" she cried, seizing Jack by the arm, "you're the young scamp
who sold me that lightning cleaner last week. I'll just keep you till
you take the spots out of my husband's Sunday pants. If you don't, he'll
knock the spots out of _you_!"


III

While the Giantess spoke she dragged Jack into the castle. "Into this
wardrobe," said she; "and mind you don't make the smallest noise, or my
man will wring your neck. He takes a nap after dinner, and then you'll
have a chance to demonstrate that grease-eradicator you sold me last
week."

The wardrobe was as big as Jack's yacht, and the key-hole as big as a
barrel, so the boy could see everything that took place without.
Presently the castle was shaken as if by an earthquake, and a great
voice roared: "Wife! wife! I smell gasoline!"

Jack trembled, remembering that in tinkering around his car that morning
he had spilled gas on his clothes.

"Be quiet!" replied the Giantess. "It's only the lightning-cleaner which
that scamp of a peddler sold me the other day."

The Giant ate a couple of sheep; then, pushing his plate away, he called
for his talking harp. And while he smoked, the harp rattled off a long
string of stuff about the equal liability of all men to labor, the
abolition of the right of inheritance, and kindred things. Jack resolved
that when he got hold of the harp he would serve it at a formal
dinner, under a great silver cover. What a sensation it would cause
among his guests when it began to sing its little song about the
abolition of the right of inheritance!

In a short time the Giant fell asleep, for the harp, like many
reformers, became wearisome through exaggeration of statement. Jack
slipped from the wardrobe, seized the harp, and ran out of the castle.

"Master! Master!" cried the music-maker. "Wake up! We are betrayed!"

Glancing back, Jack saw the Giant striding after him, and gave himself
up for lost; but at that moment he heard his name called, and he saw the
Fairy, Polly Twinkletoes, beckoning to him from a taxicab. Jack sprang
into the machine and they reached the beanstalk a hundred yards ahead of
the giant. Down the stalk they slipped and dropped, the Giant lumbering
after. Once at the bottom, Jack ran to the garage and got out his
man-killer, and when the Giant reached ground he was knocked, as Jack
had promised, into the middle of the proximate month.

Our hero married the Fairy, much against his mother's wishes; she knew
her son all too well, and she felt certain that she should soon come to
know Polly as well, and as unfavorably. Things turned out no better than
she had expected. After a month of incompatibility, and worse, Polly
consented to a divorce in consideration of one hundred thousand dollars,
and they all lived happily ever afterward.

There are exceptions. The author of "Set Down in Malice" mentions a

gone to heaven; (3) still, anyhow, the poor old boy's dead."

Our readers, we swear, know everything. One of them writes from La

Canopus, but refers to the ancient Egyptian city of that name. Mebbe so
(we should like proof of it), but what of it?--as Nero remarked when
they told him Rome was afire. The Debussy music does as well for the
star as for the city. It is ethereal, far away, and it leaves off in
mid-air. There is a passage in "Orpheus and Eurydice" which is wedded to
words expressing sorrow; but, as has been pointed out, the music would
go as well or better with words expressing joy.

ourself unable to share their apprehension. We do not worry about lead,

flatten it, as in Russia; you can bend, and twist, and pound it into
various forms, but you cannot decompose it. And so the "new order,"

THE DELIRIOUS CRITIC.

[From the Sheridan, Wyo., Enterprise.]

Replete with fine etherially beautiful melody and graceful
embellishments, it represents Mozart at his best, expressing in a form
as clear and finely finished as a delicate ivory carving that mood of
restful, sunny, impersonal optimism which is the essence of most of his
musical creations. It is like some finely wrought Greek idyl, the
apotheosis of the pastoral, perfect in detail, without apparent effort,
gently, tenderly emotional, without a trace of passionate intensity or
restless agitation, innocent and depending, as a mere babe. It is the
mood of a bright, cloudless day on the upland pastures, where happy
shepherds watch their peaceful flocks, untroubled by the storm and
stress of our modern life, a mood so foreign to the hearts and
environment of most present day human beings, that it is rarely
understood by player or hearer, and still more rarely enjoyed. It seems
flat and insipid as tepid water to the fevered lips of the young
passion-driven, ambition-goaded soul in its first stormy period of
struggle and achievement; but later, it is welcomed as the answer to
that inarticulate, but ever increasingly frequent, sign for peace and
tranquil beauty.

Considering the pictorial advertisements, A. B. Walkley finds that that
triumphant figure of the active, bustling world, the business man,
divides his day somewhat as follows: He begins with his toilet, which
seems to center in or near his chin, which is prominent, square, firm,
and smooth; even the rich, velvety lather cannot disguise it. The
business man collects safety razors; he collects collars, too. He seems
to be in the habit of calling in his friends to see how perfectly his
shirt fits at the neck. Once dressed, he goes to his office and is to be
found at an enormous desk bristling with patent devices, pleasantly
gossiping with another business man. You next find him in evening dress
at the dinner table, beaming at the waiter who has brought him his
favorite sauce. Lastly you have a glimpse of him in pajamas, discoursing
with several other business men in pajamas, all sitting cross-legged and
smoking enormous cigars. This is the end of a perfect business day.

Self-interest is the core of human nature, and before that core could be

I.--DOCTOR MAYHEW'S SHOP.

Stibbs the Grocer zigzagged like a dragon-fly about his crowded store.
Within the hour the supplies for our woodland cruise were packed in
boxes and tagged, and ready for transportation. It was a brisk
transaction; for Stibbs it was only one incident in a busy day. Outside
the trolley clanged, and a Saturday crowd footed the main street of the
Canadian city by the falls of the Saint Mary. It was hard to realize
that solitude and a primal hush were only a few hours away.

I contrasted the activity in the store of Stibbs with the drowse that
hung over another shop in the North Country where, in earlier years, I
used to buy my supplies. Doctor Mayhew kept the shop, which flourished
until a pushing Scandinavian set up a more pretentious establishment;
after which the Doctor's shop faded away like the grin of Puss of
Cheshire. One could not buy groceries of the Doctor in a hurry; one had
no wish to. I always allowed the forenoon, as there was much foreign
gossip to exchange between items, and the world's doings to be
discussed. The Doctor was interested in the remotest subjects. The
pestilences of the Orient and the possibility of their spreading to our
shores, and eventually to the North Country, gave him much concern; the
court life at St. James's and the politics of Persia absorbed
him;--local matters interested him not at all.

"Ten pounds of flour?"... The Doctor would pause, scoop in hand; then,
abruptly reminded of a bit of unfinished business at the warehouse, he
would leave the flour trembling in the balance and shuffle off, while I
perched on the counter and swung my heels, and discussed packs with Ted
Wakeland, another pioneer, who, spitting vigorously, averred that
packing grub through the brush was all right for an Indian, but no fit
task for a white man. Through the open door I could see the gentle
swells of the Big Water washing along the crescent of the beach and
heaping the sand in curious little crescent ridges. The sun beat hotly
on the board walk. There were faint sounds in the distance, from the
Indian village up the shore and the fishing community across the bay.
Life in this parish of the Northland drifted by like the fleece of
summer's sky.

"And three pounds of rice?"

The Doctor was back at the scales, and the weighing proceeded in
leisurely and dignified fashion. Haste, truly, were unseemly. But at
last the supplies were stowed in the brown pack, there were handshakings
all round, and a word of advice from old heads, and I marched away with
a singing heart.

Outfitting in the Doctor's shop was an event, a ceremonial, a thing to
be housed in memory along with camps and trails.


II.--THE RIVER.

He who has known many rivers knows that every watercourse has an
individuality, which is no more to be analyzed than the personality of
one's dearest friend. Two rivers may flow almost side by side for a
hundred miles, separated only by a range of hills, and resemble each
other no more than two women. You may admire the one, and grant it
beauty and charm; but you will love the other, and dream of it, and
desire infinite acquaintance of it.

These differences are too subtle for definition. Superficially, two
rivers in the North Country are unlike only in this respect, that one
has cut a deep valley through the hills and flows swiftly and shallowly
to its sea, and the other has kept to the plateaus and drops leisurely
by a series of cascades and short rapids, separated by long reaches of
deep water. Otherwise their physical aspects coincide. The banks of
archaic rock are covered with a thin soil which maintains so dense a
tangle that the axe must clear a space for the smallest camp; their
overhanging borders are of cedar and alder and puckerbush and osier;
their waters are slightly colored by the juices of the swampland;
following lines of minimum resistance, they twist gently or sharply
every little way, and always to the voyager's delight, for the eye is
unprepared for a beautiful vista, as the ear for a sudden and exquisite
modulation in music.

So winds the Delectable River--

  "_through hollow lands and hilly lands_"--

idly where the vale spreads out, quickly where the hills close in; black
and mysterious in the deep places, frank and golden in the shoal. In one
romantic open, where the stream flows thinly over a long stretch of
sand, the bed is of an almost luminous amber, as if its particles had
imprisoned a little of the sunlight that had fallen on them through the
unnumbered years.

The River was somewhat low when I dipped paddle in it, and the ooze at
the marge was a continuous chronicle of woodland life. Moose and deer,
bear and beaver, mink and fisher, all the creatures of the wild had
contributed to the narrative. Even the water had its tale: a line of
bubbles would show that a large animal, likely a moose, had crossed a
few minutes before our canoes rounded the bend. There were glimpses of
less wary game: ducks and herons set sail at the last moment, and
partridges, perching close at hand, cocked their foolish heads as we
went by; two otters sported on a bit of beach; trout leaped every rod
of the way.

And never a sign of man or mark of man's destructiveness; nor axe nor
fire had harmed a single tree. A journey of unmarred delight through a
valley of unending green.


III.--SMUDGE.

"This," you say, as you step from the canoe and help to fling the cargo
ashore, "this looks like good camping ground."

The place is more open than is usual, comparatively level, and a dozen
feet above the river, which, brawling over a ledge, spreads into an
attractive pool. The place also faces the west, where there is promise
of a fine sunset; a number of large birches are in sight, and an
abundance of balsam. "And," you remark, stooping to untie the tent-bag,
"there are not many flies."

Instantly a mosquito sings in your ear, and as you still his song you
recall a recent statement by the scientist Klein, that an insect's wings
flap four hundred times in a second. The mind does not readily grasp so
rapid a motion, but you accept the figures on trust, as you accept the
distances of interstellar spaces.

Very soon you discover that you were in error about the fewness of the
flies. They are all there--mosquitoes, black-flies, deer-flies, and
punkies, besides other species strictly vegetarian. So you drop the
tent-bag and build a smudge. Experience has taught you to make a small
but hot fire, and when this is well under way you kick open a rotted,
moss-grown cedar and scoop up handfuls of damp mould. This, piled on and
banked around the fire, provides a smudge that is continuous and
effective. We built smudges morning, noon, and night. Whenever a halt
was called, if only for five minutes, I reached mechanically for a strip
of birchbark and a handful of twigs. At one camping place the ring of
smudges suggested the magic fire circle in "Die Walkuere." Brunhilde lay
in her tent, in a reek of smoke, while Wotan, in no humor for song,
heaped vegetable tinder upon the defending fires. More than once the
darkening forest and the steel-gray sky of a Canadian twilight have set
me humming the motives of "The Ring," and I shall always remember a
pretty picture in an earlier cruise. "Jess" was a stable boy who drove
our team to the point where roads ceased, and during a halt in the
expedition this exuberant youth reclined upon a log, and with a pipe
fashioned from a reed sought to imitate responsively the song of the
white-throated sparrow. He looked for all the world like Siegfried in
his forest.

"Smudge." It is not a poetic word--mere mention of it would distress Mr.
Yeats; but it is potent as "Sesame" to unlock the treasures of memory.
And before the laggard Spring comes round again many of us will sigh for
a whiff of yellow, acrid smoke, curling from a smoldering fire in the
heart of the enchanted wood.


IV.--"BOGWAH."

We have been paddling for more than an hour, through dark and slowly
moving water. Two or three hundred yards has been the limit of the view
ahead, as the stream swerves gracefully from the slightest rise of land,
and flows now east, now north, now east, now south again. So long a
stretch of navigable water is not common on the Delectable River, and we
make the most of it, moving leisurely, and prisoning the everchanging
picture with the imperfect camera of the eyes. Presently a too-familiar
sound is heard above the dipping of the paddles, and the Indian at the
stern announces, "Bogwah!"--which word in the tongue of the Chippewa
signifies a shallow. And as we round the next bend we see the swifter
water, the rocks in midstream, and the gently slanting line of treetops.

"Bogwah" spells work--dragging canoes over sandy and pebbly
river-bottom, or unloading and carrying around the foam of perilous
rapids. For compensation there is the pleasure of splashing ankle-deep
and deeper in the cool current, and casting for trout in the "laughing
shallow," which I much prefer to the "dreaming pool." They who choose it
may fish from boat or ledge: for me, to wade and cast is the poetry of
angling.

Assured that the "bogwah" before us extends for half a mile or more, we
decide for luncheon, and the canoes are beached on an island, submerged
in springtime, but at low water a heap of yellow sands. And I wish I
might reconstruct for you the picture which memory too faintly outlines.
Mere words will not do it, and yet one is impelled to try. "All
literature," says Mr. Arnold Bennett, in one of his stimulating essays,
"is the expression of feeling, of passion, of emotion, caused by a
sensation of the interestingness of life. What drives a historian to
write history? Nothing but the overwhelming impression forced upon him
by the survey of past times. He is forced into an attempt to
reconstitute the picture for others."

And so you are to imagine a marshy, brushy open, circular in shape, from
which the hills and forest recede for a considerable distance, and into
which a lazy brook comes to merge with the Delectable River; a place to
which the moose travel in great numbers, as hoofmarks and cropped
vegetation bear witness; a wild place, that must be wonderful in mist
and moonlight. Now it is drenched with sunrays from a vaporless sky,
and the white-throat is singing all around us--not the usual three sets
of three notes, but seven triplets. Elsewhere on the River, days apart,
I heard that prolonged melody, and although I have looked in the bird
books for record of so sustained a song, I have not found it.


V.--FINE FEATHERS.

There is a certain school of anglers that go about the business of
fishing with much gravity. You should hear the Great Neal discourse of
their profundities. Lacking that privilege, you may conceive a pair of
these anglers met beside a river, seeking to discover which of the many
insects flying about is preferred by the trout on that particular
morning. There is disagreement, or there is lack of evidence. It is
decided to catch a trout, eviscerate him, and obtain internal and
indisputable evidence. For the cast any fly is used, and when the trout
is opened it is learned that he has been feeding on a small black
insect; whereupon our anglers tie a number of flies to resemble that
insect, and proceed solemnly with their day's work. Though the trout
scorn their fine feathers, they will not fish with any fly.

With the subtleties of this school I have no sympathy. They might be of
profit on waters that are much fished, but they are wasted on the
wilderness, where the trout will rise to almost any lure. When I make an
expedition I take along two or three dozen flies, for the mere pleasure
of looking at them, and rearranging them in the fly-book; but I wet
less than half a dozen. On the Delectable River we cast only when trout
are needed for the frypan. You are to picture canoes drawn up on a
sandbar, and a ribbon of black smoke curling from a strip of birch bark
that marks the beginning of a fire. It is time to get the fish. So I set
up my rod and walk upstream perhaps a hundred yards, casting on the
current where it cuts under the farther bank. Almost every cast evokes a
trout; this one takes the tail fly, a Silver Doctor, the next one
strikes the Bucktail dropper; any other flies would serve. The largest
fish is taken on my return, from under the stern of one of the canoes.
Where trout are so plentiful and so unwary, there is no call for the
preparatory work of the evisceration school of anglers.

My reason for using a dropper fly is not to offer the trout two
counterfeit insects differing in shape or color; as commonly attached to
the leader, the dropper swims with the tail fly. "Sir," said the Great
Neal, in the manner of Samuel Johnson, "when the dropper is properly
attached, as I attach it, two aspects of the lure are presented to the
fish, the one fly moving through the water, the other dancing an inch
or so above. This, Sir, is how I tie it."

And sitting at the Oracle's feet, ye learn "all ye need to know."


VI.--THALASSA!

Trails there are that one remembers from their beginnings to their ends,
because of the variety and charm of the pictures offered along the way.
Monotony marks the trails that fade from memory; they represent hours of
marching through timber of a second growth, or skirting hills where dead
sticks stand forlorn and only the fireweed blooms. Of rememberable roads
the last stage of our journey to the Great Water is the one I have now
in mind. It is the longest carry, two miles or less, sharply down hill,
though less precipitate than the river, which, after many days of
idling, now flings itself impatiently toward the shore. We linger where
it makes its first great leap. Many have come thus far from the south,
and, looking on the shallow pool beyond, have decided that there is no
profit in going farther; or they have explored a bit and, encountering
_bogwah_, have reached the same conclusion. Who would conjecture that
past the shallows lie leagues of deep and winding waters, reserved by
nature as a reward for the adventurer who counts a glimpse of the
unknown worth all the labor of the day? We who have come from the
headwaters know that nature has as wisely screened the river's source.
Where the lake ends is a forbidding tangle of water shrubs and timber;
the outlet is an archipelago of sharp rocks, and the stream, if found,
is seen to be small and turbulent.

The last carry keeps the Delectable River in view; foam, seen through
the firs, marks its plunging flight. And then we draw away from it for a
space, and cross an open thickly strewn with great stones, a sunlit
place, where berries and a few flowers are privileged to exist. A little
time is spent here in picking up the trail, which has spilled itself
among the stones; then, the narrow footway regained, we drop as quickly
as the river, and presently our feet touch sand. We break through a
fringe of evergreens and cry out as the Greeks cried out when they saw
the sea. The lake at last!--

 _The river, done with wandering,
  The silver, silent shore._

ARMS AND THE COLYUM.

  I sing of arms and heroes, not because
  I'm thrilled by what these heroes do or die for:
  The Colyum's readers think they make its laws,
  And I make out to give them what they cry for.

  And since they cry for stuff about the war,
  Since war at this safe distance not to _them_'s hell,
  I have to write of things that I abhor,
  And far, strange battlegrounds like Ypres and Przemysl.

  War is an almost perfect rime for bore;
  And, 'spite my readers (who have cursed and blessed me),
  Some day I'll throw the war junk on the floor,
  And write of things that really interest me:

  Of books in running brooks, and wilding wings,
  Of music, stardust, children, casements giving
  On seas unvext by wars, and other things
  That help to make our brief life worth the living.

  I sing of arms and heroes, just because
  All else is shadowed by that topic fearful;
  But I've a mind to chuck it [Loud applause],
  And tune my dollar harp to themes more cheerful.

said. Don't try to send me your refuss, I am sending them back. I ain't
color blind or a jack ass, you shouldn't treat me as that. I understand
your wife is making coats for ladies now. Have her make one (dark) for
my wife who is a stout 42 with a fer neck. Now send me what I asked for,
the old woman is perticular. The trousers you sent wouldn't slip over my
head. Ever faithful, etc.

"THOSE FLAPJACKS OF BROWN'S."

  Three cupfuls of flour will do nicely,

  Next add baking powder, precisely

  Of sugar two tablespoons, heaping--

  Then mix it with strokes that are sweeping,
    And stir like the Deil.

  Three eggs. (Tho' the missus may sputter,
    You'll pay to her protest no heed.)
  A size-of-an-egg piece of butter,

  Now mix the whole mess with a beater;
    Don't get it too thick or too thin.
  (And I pause to remark that this meter
    Is awkward as sin.)

  Of course there are touches that only
    A genius like Brown can impart;
  And genius is everywhere lonely,
    And no one but Brown has the art.

When all the world is safe for democracy, only the aristocracy of taste
will remain, and this will cover the world. There is hardly a town so
small that it does not contain at least one member. All races belong to
it, and its passwords are accepted in every capital. Its mysteries are
Rosicrucian to persons without taste. And no other aristocracy was ever,

Equator. This the man denied vigorously. He avowed that he loved the
Monroe Doctrine, that he was willing to fight for it, and, if
necessary, to die for it. All he had said was that he didn't know what
it was about.

The pessimist is not concerned over the so-called yellow peril--at least

A city is known by the newspapers it keeps. They reflect the tastes of
the community, and if they are lacking in this or that it is because the
community is lacking. And so it is voxpoppycock to complain that a
newspaper is not what a small minority thinks it ought to be. The fault,
dear Brutus, is not in our journals, but in ourselves, that we are
underlings.

"Graduation from the worst to the best stuff," is Mr. W. L. George's
method of acquiring literary taste. Something can be said for the
method, and Mr. George says it well, and we are sorry, in a manner of
speaking, not to believe a word of it; unless, as is possible, we both
believe the same thing fundamentally. Taste, in literature and music,
and in other things, is, we are quite sure, natural. It can be trained,
but this training is a matter of new discoveries. A taste that has to be
led by steps from Owen Meredith to George Meredith, which could not
recognize the worth of the latter before passing through the former, is
no true taste. Graduation from the simple to the complex is compatible
with a natural taste, but this simple may be first class, as much music
and literature is. New forms of beauty may puzzle the possessor of
natural taste, but not for long. He does not require preparation in
inferior stuff.

       *       *       *

Speaking of George Meredith, we are told again (they dig the thing up
every two or three years) that, when a reader for Chapman & Hall, he
turned down "East Lynne," "Erewhon," and other books that afterward
became celebrated. What of it? Meredith may not have known anything
about literature, but he knew what he liked. Moreover, he was a marked
and original writer, and as that tolerant soul, Jules Lemaitre, has
noted, the most marked and original of writers are those who do not
understand everything, nor feel everything, nor love everything, but
those whose knowledge, intelligence, and tastes have definite
limitations.

BUT WOULD IT NOT REQUIRE A GEOLOGIC PERIOD?

Sir: You are kind enough to refer to my lecture on "Literary Taste and
How to Acquire It." I venture to suggest that your summary--viz.: "It is
to read only first-class stuff," not only fails to meet the problem, but
represents exactly the view that I am out to demolish. If, as I presume,
you mean that the ambitious person who now reads Harold Bell Wright
should sit down to the works of Shakespeare, I can tell you at once that
the process will be a failure. My method is one of graduation from the
worst to the best stuff.

We do not wish to crab W. L. George's act, "Literary Taste and How to
Acquire It," but we know the answer. It is to read only first-class
stuff. Circumstances may oblige a man to write second-class books, but
there is no reason why he should read such.

THE EIGHTH VEIL.

(_By J-mes Hun-k-r._)

There was a wedding under way. From the bright-lit mansion came the
evocations of a loud bassoon. Ulick Guffle, in whom the thought of
matrimony always produced a bitter nausea, glowered upon the house and
spat acridly upon the pave. "Imbeciles! Humbugs! Romantic rot!" he
raged.

Three young men drew toward the scene. Ulick barred their way, but two
of the trio slipped by him and escaped. The third was nailed by Guffle's
glittering eye. Ulick laid an ineluctable hand upon the stranger's arm.
"Listen!" he commanded. "Matrimony and Art are sworn and natural foes.
Ingeborg Bunck was right; there are no illegitimate children; all
children are valid. Sounds like Lope de Vega, doesn't it? But it isn't.
It is Bunck. Whitman, too, divined the truth. Love is a germ; sunlight
kills it. It needs l'obscurite and a high temperature. As Baudelaire
said--or was it Maurice Barres?--dans la nuit tous les chats sont gris.
Remy de Gourmont..."

The wedding guest beat his shirtfront; he could hear the bassoon
doubling the cello. But Ulick continued ineluctably. "Woman is a sink of
iniquity. Only Gounod is more loathsome. That Ave Maria--Grand Dieu! But
Frederic Chopin, nuance, cadence, appoggiatura--there you have it. En
amour, les vieux fous sont plus fous que les jeunes. Listen to
Rochefoucauld! And Montaigne has said, C'est le jouir et non le posseder
qui rend heureux. And Pascal has added, Les affaires sont les affaires.
As for Stendhal, Flaubert, Nietzsche, Edgar Saltus, Balzac, Gautier,
Dostoievsky, Rabelais, Maupassant, Anatole France, Bourget, Turgenev,
Verlaine, Renan, Walter Pater, Landor, Cardinal Newman and the Brothers
Goncourt..."

Ulick seized his head with both hands, and the wedding guest seized the
opportunity to beat it, as the saying is. "Swine!" Ulick flung after
him. "Swine, before whom I have cast a hatful of pearls!" He spat even
more acridly upon the pave and turned away. "After all," he growled,
"Stendhal was right. Or was it Huysmans? No, it was neither. It was
Cambronne."

Our opinion, already recorded, is that if Keats had spent fifteen or
twenty minutes more on his Grecian Urn, all of the stanzas would be as
good as three of them. And so we think that if A. B. had put in, say, a
half hour more on her sonnet she would not have rhymed "worldliness" and
"moodiness." Of the harmony, counterpoint, thoroughbass, etc., of verse
we know next to nothing--we play on _our_ tin whistle entirely by
ear--but there are things which we avoid, perhaps needlessly. One of
these is the rhyming of words like utterly, monody, lethargy, etc.;
these endings seem weak when they are bunched. Our assistants will
apprehend that we are merely offering a suggestion or two, which we hope
they will follow up by exploring the authorities.

Music like Brahms' Second Symphony is peculiarly satisfying to the
listener. The first few measures disclose that the composer is in
complete control of his ideas and his expression of them. He has
something to say, and he says it without uncertainty or redundancy. Only
a man who _has_ something to say may dare to say it only once.

Those happy beings who "don't know a thing about art, but know what they
like," are restricted to the obvious because of ignorance of form; their
enjoyment ends where that of the cultivated person begins. Take music.
The person who knows what he likes takes his pleasure in the tune, but
gets little or nothing from the tune's development; hence his favorite
music is music which is all tune.

We recall a naive query by the publisher of a magazine, at a musicale in
Gotham. Our hostess, an accomplished pianist, had played a Chopin
Fantasia, and the magazine man was expressing his qualified enjoyment.
"What I can't understand," said he, "is why the tune quits just when
it's running along nicely." This phenomenon, no doubt, has mystified
thousands of other "music lovers."

Mr. Frederick Harrison at 89 observes: "May my end be early, speedy, and
peaceful! I regret nothing done or said in my long and busy life. I
withdraw nothing, and, as I said before, am not conscious of any change
in mind. In youth I was called a revolutionary; in old age I am called
a reactionary; both names alike untrue.... I ask nothing. I seek
nothing. I fear nothing. I have done and said all that I ever could have
done and said. There is nothing more. I am ready, and await the call."

A very good prose version of Henley's well known poem. As for regretting
nothing, a man at forty would be glad to unsay and undo many things. At
seventy, and decidedly at eighty-nine, these things have so diminished
in importance that it is not worth while withdrawing them.

"_Mr. Hearst is the home brew; no other hope._"
                              --_The Trib._

  At his usual hour Lord Did-More rose--
  Renewed completely by repose--
  His pleasant duty to rehearse
  Of oiling up the universe.

  Casting a glance aloft, he saw
  That, yielding to a natural law,
  The sun obediently moved
  Precisely as he had approved.

  If mundane things would only run
  As regularly as the Sun!
  But Earth's affairs, less nicely planned,
  Require Lord Did-More's guiding hand.

  This day, outside Lord Did-More's door,
  There waited patiently a score
  Of diplomats from far and near
  Who sought his sympathetic ear.

  Each brought to him, that he might scan,
  The latest governmental plan,
  And begged of him a word or two
  Approving what it hoped to do.

  Lord Did-More nodded, smiled or frowned,
  Some word of praise or censure found,
  Withheld or added his "O. K."
  And sent the ministers away.

  These harmonized and sent away,
  Lord Did-More finished up his day
  By focusing his cosmic brain
  On our political campaign.

  And night and morning, thro' the land,
  The public prints at his command
  Proclaimed, in type that fairly burst,
  The doughty deeds of Did-More Hearst.

boys and would be a good drawing card in small towns. I beleave we could
make 1000 feet of it by showing me driveing into the field with my extra
made wagon. then show them my style and speed of husking and perheps let
a common husker husk a while. I could also give my exibition on the
stage in a theater includeing the playing of six or eight different

sprained an ankle.




Alice in Cartoonland.


I.

"Hello!" said the Hatter. "I haven't seen you for a long time."

"No," said Alice; "I've been all over--in Wonderland, in Bookland, in
Stageland, and forty other lands. People must be tired of my adventures.
Where am I now? I never know."

"In Cartoonland," said the Hatter.

"And what are _you_ doing here?" inquired Alice.

"I'm searching for an original cartoon idea," replied the Hatter. "Would
you like to come along?"

"Ever so much," said Alice.

"The first thing we have to do is to get across that chasm," said the
Hatter, pointing.

Alice saw a huge legend on the far wall of the chasm, and spelled it
out--"O-b-l-i-v-i-o-n."

"Yes, Oblivion," said the Hatter. "That's where they dump defeated
candidates and other undesirables. Come on, we can cross a little below
here."

He indicated a thin plank that lay across the Chasm of Oblivion.

"Will it hold us?" said Alice.

"It has held the G. O. P. Elephant and the Democratic Donkey, and all
sorts of people and things. Let's hurry over, as here comes the
Elephant now, with Mr. Taft riding it, and the plank _might_ give way."


II.

"By the way," said the Hatter, "here is my hat store."

There were only two kinds in the window--square paper caps and high silk
hats. Alice had never seen paper caps before.

"They're worn by the laboring man," said the Hatter; "but you never see
them outside of Cartoonland. The plug hats are for Capitalists. I also
keep whiskers; siders for Capital and ordinary for Labor."

"O, there's a railroad train!" said Alice, suddenly.

"No use taking that train," said the Hatter; "it doesn't go. Did you
ever see an engine like that outside Cartoonland? And even if it did
work we shouldn't get very far, as the rock Obstruction is always on the
track."

"I'd just as soon walk," said Alice.


III.

"Mercy! there's a giant!" exclaimed Alice.

"Don't be alarmed," said the Hatter; "he's perfectly good natured."

"What an awful-looking creature!" said Alice.

"He's awfully out of drawing," said the Hatter, critically; "but, then,
almost everything in Cartoonland is. It's the idea that counts."

"You said you were searching for an original idea," Alice reminded him.

"But I don't expect to find one," the Hatter replied. "You see, it
wouldn't be any use; nobody would understand it. People like the old
familiar things, you know."

"Still, we might happen on one," said Alice. "Let's walk along."


IV.

Suddenly a door opened, and a great quantity of rubbish was swept
briskly into the street.

"That's the New Broom," said the Hatter. "There's been another election.
Evidently the Democrats won, as there goes the Donkey, waving his ears
and hee-hawing."

"Oh, is that a fruit store?" asked Alice.

"No; the Republican headquarters," replied the Hatter. "That huge
cornucopia you see is a symbol of Prosperity. Prosperity in Cartoonland
is always represented by a horn of plenty with a pineapple in the
muzzle. You've heard the expression, 'The pineapple of prosperity.'"

"No," said Alice, "but I've heard about the 'pineapple of politeness.'"

"That," said the Hatter, "is something else again."


V.

Presently they came to a collection of factories, the tall chimneys of
which poured out smoke in great volume.

"Those are the Smoking Stacks of Industry," said the Hatter.

"What do they manufacture here?" asked Alice.

"Cartoonatums," said the Hatter. "A cartoonatum," he explained, "is a
combination of wheels, rods, cogs, hoppers, cranks, etc., which
sometimes looks like a sausage grinder and sometimes like a
try-your-weight machine. It couldn't possibly go, any more than the
locomotives in Cartoonland."

"Why don't the Cartoonlanders have machines that _can_ go?" inquired
Alice.

"That," replied the Hatter, "would require a little study and
observation."


VI.

As Alice and the Hatter walked along they passed many curious things,
such as Wolves in Sheep's Clothing, the skin of a Tiger nailed to a barn
door, St. George and the Dragon, Father Knickerbocker, barrels of
political mud, a huge serpent labeled "Anarchy," a drug store window
full of bottles of Political Dope and boxes of Political Pills, an
orchard of Political Plum Trees, and other objects which the Hatter said
were as old as the hills. "I'm afraid there's nothing to hold us here,"
he declared.

Alice's attention was suddenly attracted by a little girl in a thin and
ragged dress who, with an empty basket on her arm, was gazing wistfully
at the goodies in a bakeshop window.

"She represents Poverty," said the Hatter. "When she isn't staring at a
bakeshop she's looking at a proclamation by the ice trust, or something
like that."

Alice spoke to the child and learned that she was one of a large family.
Her father, she said, was a New York cartoonist who one day had been
visited by an Original Idea.

"Where is he?" cried the Hatter excitedly.

"He dropped dead!" replied the child, weeping bitterly.

"Good night!" said the Hatter, and walked away.




A LINE-O'-TYPE OR TWO

_Quicquid agunt homines nostri est farrago libelli._
                              --_Juvenal._


Question:

  Who is this Juvenal wheezer?
    Readers inquire every day.
  Give us a line on the geezer--
    What is he trying to say?
  Do you expect us to get stuff
    That is clear over our bean?
  What is that "_Quicquid_, et cet." stuff?
    What does the gibberish mean?


Reply:

  If you're too lazy to look for
    Juvenal's name in the Dic,
  Why should _I_ go to the book for
    Such a cantankerous kick?
  Still, to avoid all dissension,
    And my good nature to prove,
  I am quite willing to mention
    One or two things about Juve.

  Juve was a Roman humdinger,
    Writer of satires and sich.
  He was consid'rable stinger--
    Rare were his sallies and rich.
  High his poetic position,
    Lofty his manner and brow;
  Lived in the time of Domitian;--
    That's all I think of just now.

  As for that "_Quicquid_, and so forth,"
    I have but space to advise
  If you'd decipher it go forth,
    Look in the Dic and be wise.
  Make it a point, in your reading,
    Always to look up what's new.
  That is a simple proceeding:
    Why not adopt it? _I_ do.

to withstand the extremes of climate? May I not suggest that the

"The military salute," says our neighbor on the left, "is a courtesy of

THE TRUTH AT LAST!

Sir: Socrates and Epictetus did not learn Greek at 81--they were Greeks.
It was the Roman Cato who began to study Greek at 80.

       *       *       *

Now that we all know it was neither Socrates nor Epictetus who learned
Greek at 81 (because, you see, being Greeks they did not have to study
the language), you may like to know something about Julius Caesar. He
was, narrates a high school paper, "the noblest of English kings. He
learned Latin late in life in order to translate an ecclesiastical work
into the vernaculary of the common people."

       *       *       *

We are reminded by our learned friend, W. F. Y., that Socrates began at
64 to study English, but had to give it up as a bad job. "The fact," he
says, "is interestingly set forth in Montefiori's 'Eccentricities of
Genius.'"

       *       *       *

The attitude of our universities and other quasi-educational
institutions toward Greek is that 81 is the proper age for beginning the
study of it.

A frequent question since the war began is, "Why are there so many damn
fools in the faculties of American universities?" Chancellor Williams
of Wooster turns light on the mystery. Eminent educators who are also
damn fools are hypermorons, who are intellectual but not truly
intelligent. He says of these queer beings:

"The hypermoron may laugh in imitation of others, but he has no original
humor and very little original wit. The cause for this is that original
wit and humor require unusual combinations of factors; but the very
nature of the hypermoron is that he does not arrange and perceive such
combinations. When the hypermoron does cause laughter from some speech
or action, usually he resents it. But when a normal man unconsciously
does or says something laughable, he himself shares in making sport of
himself. Though at times amiable, the hypermoron invariably takes
himself so seriously as in a long acquaintance to become tiresome."

Fired by liquor, men maltreat their wives. These wretches deserve public
flogging; hanging were a compliment to some of them. On the other hand,
men made emotional by liquor have conceived an extravagant fondness for
their wives. We have not read about liquor floating the matrimonial bark
over the shallows of domestic discord; yet men who have fared homeward
with unsteady footsteps under the blinking stars, know that in such
moments they are much more humane than in sober daylight; they are
appalled by their own unworthiness, and thinking of their wives moves
them almost to tears--quite, not infrequently. They resolve to become
better husbands and fathers. The spirit of the wine in them captains "an
army of shining and generous dreams," an army that is easily routed, an
army that the wife too often puts to flight with an injudicious
criticism. It is said that since Prohibition came in the cases of
cruelty to wives have increased greatly in number. We do not disbelieve
this. Bluebeard was a dry.

The Witch's Holiday.

A TALE FOR CHILDREN ONLY.


I.

Matters had gone ill all the day; and, to cap what is learnedly called
the perverseness of inanimate things, it came on to rain just as the
Boy, having finished his lessons, was on the point of setting out for a
romp in the brown fields.

"Isn't it perfectly mean, Mowgli?" he complained to his dog. The water
spaniel wagged a noncommittal tail and stretched himself before the wood
fire with a deep drawn sigh. The rain promised to hold, so the Boy took
down a book and curled up in a big leather chair.

It was a very interesting book--all about American pioneers, trappers,
and Indians; and although the writer of it was a German traveler, no
American woodsman would take advantage of a worthy German globe trotter
and tell him things which were not exactly so. For example, if you and a
trapper and a dog were gathered about a campfire, and the dog were
asleep and dreaming in his sleep, and the trapper should affirm that if
you tied a handkerchief over the head of a dreaming dog and afterwards
tied it around your own head, you would have the dog's dream,--if the
trapper should tell you this with a perfectly serious face, you
naturally would believe him, especially if you were a German traveler.

The Boy got up softly and began the experiment. Mowgli opened an
inquiring eye, stretched himself another notch, and fell asleep again.
His master waited five minutes, then unloosed the handkerchief and
knotted it under his own chin.

For a while Mowgli's slumbers were untroubled as a forest pool, his
breathing as regular as the tick-tock of the old wooden clock under the
stair. Out of doors the rain fell sharply and set the dead leaves
singing. The wood fire dwindled to a glow. Tick-tock! tick-tock! drummed
the ancient timepiece. The Boy yawned and settled deeper in the leather
chair.

Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

Mowgli was breathing out of time. He was twitching, and making funny
little smothered noises, which, if he were awake, would probably be
yelps. Something exciting was going on in dreamland.

Tick-tock! Tick----

+Hullo!+ There goes a woodchuck!


II.

The Boy gave chase across the fields, only to arrive, out of breath, at
the entrance to a burrow down which the woodchuck had tumbled. He had
not a notion where he was. He seemed to have raced out of the world that
he knew into one which was quite unfamiliar. It was a broad valley
inclosed by high hills, through which a pleasant little river ran; and
the landscape wore an odd aspect--the hills were bluer than hills
usually are, the trees were more fantastically fashioned, and the waving
grass and flowers were more beautiful than one commonly sees.

"Good morning, young sir!"

On the other side of the stream stood a tall man wrapped in a cloak and
leaning with both hands upon a staff. He was well past the middle years,
as wrinkles and a beard turned gray gave evidence; but his eyes were
youthful and his cheeks as ruddy as a farm lad's. His clothing was worn
and dust-laden, but of good quality and unpatched, and there was an air
about him that said plainly, "Here is no common person, I can tell you."

"You are wondering who I may be," he observed. "Well, then, I am known
as the Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare."

"A queer sort of knight, this!" thought the Boy.

"And you--may I ask whither you are bound?" said the stranger. "We may
be traveling the same road."

The Boy made answer that he had set forth to chase a woodchuck, and
that having failed to catch it he had no better plan than to return
home.

At the word "home" the Knight put on a melancholy smile, and cutting a
reed at the river edge he fashioned it into a pipe and began to play. A
wonderful tune it was. Tom the Piper's Son knew the way of it, and to
the same swinging melody the Pied Piper footed the streets of Hamelin
town; for the burden of the tune was "Over the Hills and Far Away," and
the Boy's feet stirred at the catch of it.

"That," said the Knight, "is the tune I have marched to for many a year,
and a pretty chase it has led me." He put down the pipe. "Knocking about
aimlessly does very well for an old man, but youth should have a
definite goal."

The Boy did not agree with this. With that magic melody marching in his
head it was hey for the hills and the westering sun, and the pleasant
road to Anywhere.

"What lies yonder?" he queried, pointing to a deep notch in the skyline.

"The Kingdom of Rainbow's End," replied the Knight. "It is an agreeable
territory, and you would do very well to journey thither. The King of
the country is no longer young, and as he has nothing to say about
affairs of state, or anything else for that matter, he spends his time
tramping about from place to place, in much the same fashion as
myself."

"And who governs while he is away?"

"+She!+" said the Knight solemnly--"+She That Bosses Everybody!+"


III.

"You see," said the Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare, "the King made a
grave mistake some years ago. It is a foolish saying that when a man
marries his troubles begin; but it is the law of Rainbow's-End that when
a man marries he may chloroform his mother-in-law or not, just as he
pleases. But if he forfeit the right he may never again claim it, and
the deuce take him for a soft-hearted simpleton."

The Boy thought it a barbarous law and so declared.

"There is something to be said for it," returned the Knight. "A
mother-in-law is like the little girl with the little curl. It so
happens that the King's mother-in-law is a very unpleasant old party,
and the King made a sad mess of it when he threw the chloroform bottle
out of the window."

"Tell me about Rainbow's-End," the Boy entreated. "Is there a beautiful
Princess, with many suitors for her hand?"

"The Princess Aralia is a very pretty girl, as princesses go." The
Knight opened a locket attached to a long gold chain and exhibited an
exquisite miniature. "I don't mind saying," said he, "that the Princess
Aralia and I are on very good terms, and a word from me will procure you
a cordial reception. The question is, how shall we set about it? You
can't present yourself at court as you are; you must have a horse and a
fine costume, and all that sort of thing."

"Perhaps there's a good fairy in the neighborhood," said the Boy
hopefully.

The Knight shook his head. "Not within a dozen leagues. But stop a
bit--it is just possible that Aunt Jo can manage the matter. Aunt Jo is
the sister of my wife's mother, and one of the cleverest witches in the
country. She stands very high in her profession and is thoroughly
schooled in every branch of deviltry; and with the exception of my
wife's mother, I can think of no person whose society is less desirable.
But one day in each year she takes a day off, during which she is as
affable and benevolent an old dame as you can possibly imagine; really,
you would never know it was the same person. These annual breathing
spells do her a world of good, she tells me; for incessant wickedness is
just as monotonous and wearisome as unbroken goodness."

"And to-day is the Witch's holiday?"

"Yes, it so happens; and I always make it a point to spend the night at
her cottage if I am in this part of the country."

The Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare rose and put his cloak about his
shoulders, and with the Boy set forward through the valley.


IV.

Presently they came to the Witch's cottage, snuggled away in a hollow
and hidden from the road by a tangle of witch hazel shrubs. The Boy
rather expected a dark, forbidding hut of sinister outlines, but here
was as pretty a cabin as ever you saw, weathered a pleasing gray, with
green blinds and a tiny porch overrun with Virginia-creeper.

The Knight strode boldly up the path, the Boy following less
confidently. No one answering the summons at the porch, they tried the
kitchen door. It was open, and they stepped inside. The Witch was not at
home, but evidently she was not far away, for a fire was crackling in
the stove and a kettle singing over the flames. An enormous black cat
got up lazily from the hearth and rubbed himself against the visitors
with a purr like a small dynamo.

With the familiarity of a relative the Knight led the way about the
house. One door was locked. "This," said he, "is Aunt Jo's dark room, in
which she develops her deviltry. This"--opening the door of a little
shed--"is the garage."

The Boy peeped in and saw two autobroomsticks.

"The small green one is her runabout. The big red one is a touring
broomstick, high power and very fast; you can hear her coming a mile
off."

They returned to the sitting room, and the Boy became greatly taken with
Aunt Jo's collection of books. Some of these were: "One Hundred and One
Best Broths," "Witchcraft Self-Taught," "The Black Art--Berlitz Method,"
and "Burbank's Complete Wizard." The Boy took down the "Complete
Wizard," but he was not able to do more than glance at the absorbing
contents before the clicking of the gate announced that the Witch had
returned.

Aunt Jo was a sprightly dame of more than seventy years, very thin, but
straight and supple, and with hair still jet black. Her eyes were
gray-green or green-gray, as the light happened to strike them; her
cheeks were hollow, and a long sharp chin slanted up to meet a long
sharp nose. Ordinarily, as the Knight had hinted, she was no doubt an
unholy terror, but to-day she was in the best of humors, and her eyes
twinkled with good nature.

"I just stepped out," she explained, "to carry some jelly and cake to
one of my neighbors, a woodcutter's wife. The poor woman has been ill
all the summer! Mercy! if I haven't had a day of it!" She dropped into
a chair, brushing a fly from the tip of her nose with the tip of her
tongue. "How is everything in Rainbow's-End?" she asked. "I suppose +She+
is as bad as ever."

"Worse," replied the Knight, fetching a sigh. "And +She+ never takes a day
off, as you do."

"Well, Henry, it's your own fault, as I've told you a thousand times. If
you hadn't been so soft-hearted-- But mercy! that's no way to be talking
on my holiday."

"So!" said the Boy to himself. "This wandering knight is the King of
Rainbow's-End and the father of the Princess. I have a friend at court
indeed."


V.

"And how is the Princess Aralia?" asked the Witch. "As pretty as ever, I
suppose, and with no prospect of a husband, thanks to her grandmother
and the silly tasks she sets for the suitors."

"That brings us to the business of our young friend here," said the
Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare. "He wishes to present himself at
court, and is in great need of a horse and wardrobe."

"You've come to the wrong shop for horses and fine feathers," said the
Witch. "Those things are quite out of my line."

The Boy looked his disappointment.

"The best I can do," said Aunt Jo kindly, "is to give you a letter to a
Mr. Burbank, an excellent wizard of my acquaintance. He has recently
invented a skinless grape and a watermelon that is all heart, and is
quite the cleverest man in the business. Such a trifle as changing a pig
into a horse will give him no trouble whatever. Have you seen my garden,
Henry?"

"No, but I should like to," said the Knight rising.

"Meanwhile," said the Witch, "I will start the supper if our young
friend will fetch the wood."

The Boy responded with such cheerful readiness that Aunt Jo patted him
on the cheek and said: "You're the lad for the Princess Aralia, and have
her you shall if Aunt Jo can bring it about. And now go out in the
garden and pick me a hatful of Brussels sprouts."

It was impossible to imagine a more appetizing supper than that which
the three sat down to. Everything was prepared to a nicety, and the
Knight could not say enough in praise of the raised biscuits and home
made currant jell. As for the doughnuts, "Such doughnuts can't be made
without witchcraft, Jo," he declared.

"Nonsense!" said the old lady. "I don't put a thing into them that any
good cook doesn't use. Making doughnuts always was an art by itself. You
must both take some with you when you go."

After supper the Knight wiped the dishes while the Witch washed them,
Aunt Jo declaring it a shame that a man so domestically inclined should
be compelled to wander from one end of the rainbow to the other just
because of a foolish tender-heartedness in days gone by. While the pair
discussed this fruitful topic the Boy dipped into the fascinating
chapters of the "Complete Wizard."

"Time for bed," announced the Knight an hour later; and he added for the
Boy's ear: "We must make an early start in the morning."

"I for one shall sleep soundly," Aunt Jo declared. "I've run my legs off
to-day, as I never use a broomstick on my holiday."

She conducted her guests to a tiny bedchamber above stairs. "I will
leave a bag of doughnuts on the table, Henry," said she, "as I suppose
you will be off before I am up. Good-night!"

When she had gone below the Knight said: "We must be moving with the
first streak of day. Aunt Jo's holiday ends with sun-up, and you would
find her a vastly different old party, I can tell you."


VI.

"I don't think I should be afraid of her," said the Boy.

The Knight chuckled, and without further speech got into bed and was
soon wrapped in a deep slumber. Next to a clear conscience and the open
road, a good bed at night is something to set store by.

But the Boy could not sleep for the exciting pictures that danced in his
head, and he was impatient for the morning light, that he might be on
his way to Rainbow's-End. The moon peeped in the window; the breeze made
a pleasant sound in the poplar trees; from somewhere came the music of a
little brook. To all these gentle influences the Boy finally yielded.

He was awakened by a plucking at his sleeve.

"Time to be moving," said the Knight in a hoarse whisper. "We can put on
our shoes after we leave the house."

They crept down the stair, which creaked in terrifying fashion, but a
gentle snoring from the Witch's bedroom reassured them. After they had
tiptoed out of the house and gained the road they discovered that they
had forgotten the bag of doughnuts. The Knight declared that he would
not return for a million doughnuts, but the Boy, remembering how
delicious they tasted, stole back to the door and lifted the latch
softly. Aunt Jo was still snoring, but, just as he laid hold of the
doughnuts, Pluto the cat came leaping in from the kitchen, and the Boy
had barely time to put the door between its sharp claws and himself. He
ran down the path, vaulted the gate, and looked about for the Knight.
Away down the road was a rapidly diminishing figure.

The Boy was a good runner, and he was fast overtaking the Knight, when
the latter, who had been casting anxious glances over his shoulder as he
ran, suddenly plunged into the bushes at one side of the road. The Boy
thought it wise to follow his example.

And not a moment too soon. A small whirring sound grew louder and
louder, and Aunt Jo went whizzing by on her high power autobroomstick,
leaving in her wake a horrible reek of gasoline and brimstone. But not
the Aunt Jo of the evening before. Her green eyes flashed behind the
goggles, and her face was something dreadful to behold. On her shoulder
perched Pluto, every hair erect, and spitting fire.

The Boy gasped, and hoped he had seen the last of the terrible hag, when
the whirring noise announced that she was coming back. She stopped her
broomstick directly opposite the hiding-place and began cutting small
circles in the air, the while peering sharply about.

As the Boy plunged into the thicket, he fell. As he lay there, something
cold pressed against his hand.

It was Mowgli's nose. The dog's eyes questioned his master, who had
cried out in his sleep.

"Oh, Mowgli!" he exclaimed, taking the spaniel by his shaggy ears, "did
you dream _all_ that wonderful dream? Or did you stop at the woodchuck
hole? What a shame, Mowgli, if there shouldn't really be a Knight of the
Dusty Thoroughfare, and a Princess Aralia and a Witch who makes
wonderful doughnuts!"

MUSIC HINT.

Sir: P. A. Scholes, in his "Listener's Guide to Music," revives two good
laughs--thus: "A fugue is a piece in which the voices one by one come in
and the people one by one go out." Also he quotes from Sam'l Butler's
Note Books: "I pleased Jones by saying that the hautbois was a clarinet
with a cold in its head, and the bassoon the same with a cold in its
chest." The cor anglais suffers slightly from both symptoms. Some
ambitious composer, by judicious use of the more diseased instruments,
could achieve the most rheumy musical effects, particularly if, a la
Scriabin, he should have the atmosphere of the concert hall heavily
charged with eucalyptus.

THE HUNTING OF THE PACIFIST SNARK.

(_With Mr. Ford as the Bellman._)

 "Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
   "Just the place for a Snark, I declare!"
  And he anchored the _Flivver_ a mile up the river,

  He had bought a large map representing the moon,

  And the crew, you could see, were as pleased as could be
    With a map they could all understand.

 "Now, listen, my friends, while I tell you again
    The five unmistakable marks
  By which you may know, wherever you go,
    The warranted pacifist Snarks.

  The first is the taste, which is something like guff,
    Tho' with gammon 'twill also compare;
  The next is the sound, which is simple enough--
    It resembles escaping hot air.

  The third is the shape, which is somewhat absurd,
    And this you will understand
  When I tell you it looks like the African bird
    That buries its head in the sand.

  The fourth is a want of the humorous sense,
    Of which it has hardly a hint.

    Is a glutton for getting in print.

Concerning his reference to "Demosthenes' lantern," the distinguished

finally in the printed book. And heaven only knows how many proofreaders
let it through. "Be that as it may," says Rupert, "I am like our famous
humorist, Archibald Ward, who refused to be responsible for debts of his

The skies they were ashen and sober, and the leaves they were crisped
and sere, as I sat in the porch chair and regarded our neighbor's patch
of woodland; and I thought: The skies may be ashen and sober, and the
leaves may be crisped and sere, but in a maple wood we may dispense with
the sun, such irradiation is there from the gold of the crisped leaves.
Jack Frost is as clever a wizard as the dwarf Rumpelstiltzkin, who
taught the miller's daughter the trick of spinning straw into gold. This
young ash, robed all in yellow--what can the sun add to its splendor?
And those farther tree-tops, that show against the sky like a tapestry,
the slenderer branches and twigs, unstirred by wind, having the
similitude of threads in a pattern--can the sun gild their refined gold?
How delicate is the tinting of that cherry, the green of which is fading
into yellow, each leaf between the two colors: this should be described
in paint.

No, I said; in a hardwood thicket, in October, though it were the misty
mid region of Weir, one would not know the sun was lost in clouds. At
that moment the sun adventured forth, in blazing denial. It was as if
the woodland had burst into flame.

The Gluck aria, which Mme. Homer has made famous, was effectively cited
by the critic Hanslick to show that in vocal music the subject is
determined only by the words. He wrote:

"At a time when thousands (among whom there were men like Jean Jacques
Rousseau) were moved to tears by the air from 'Orpheus'--

 'J'ai perdu mon Eurydice,
  Rien n'egale mon malheur,'

Boye, a contemporary of Gluck, observed that precisely the same melody
would accord equally well, if not better, with words conveying exactly
the reverse, thus--

 'J'ai trouve mon Eurydice,
  Rien n'egale mon bonheur.'

"We, for our part, are not of the opinion that in this case the
composer is quite free from blame, inasmuch as music most assuredly
possesses accents which more truly express a feeling of profound sorrow.
If however, from among innumerable instances, we selected the one
quoted, we have done so because, in the first place, it affects the
composer who is credited with the greatest dramatic accuracy; and,
secondly, because several generations hailed this very melody as most
correctly rendering the supreme grief which the words express."

The London Busman Story.


_I.--As George Meredith might have related it._

"Stop!" she signalled.

The appeal was comprehensible, and the charioteer, assiduously obliging,
fell to posture of checking none too volant steeds.

You are to suppose her past meridian, nearer the twilight of years,
noteworthy rather for matter than manner; and her visage, comparable to
the beef of England's glory, well you wot. This one's descent was
mincing, hesitant, adumbrating dread of disclosures--these expectedly
ample, columnar, massive. The day was gusty, the breeze prankant;
petticoats, bandbox, umbrella were to be conciliated, managed if
possible; no light task, you are to believe.

"'Urry, marm!"

The busman's tone was patiently admonitory, dispassionate. A veteran in
his calling, who had observed the ascending and descending of a myriad
matrons, in playful gales.

"'Urry, marm!"

The fellow was without illusions; he had reviewed more twinkling columns
than a sergeant of drill. Indifference his note, leaning to ennui. He
said so, bluntly, piquantly, in half a dozen memorable words, fetching
yawn for period.

_II.--As Henry James might have written it._

We, let me ask, what are we, the choicer of spirits as well as the more
frugal if not the undeservedly impoverished, what, I ask, are we to do
now that the hansom has disappeared, as they say, from the London
streets and the taxicab so wonderfully yet extravagantly taken its
place? Is there, indeed, else left for us than the homely but hallowed
'bus, as we abbreviatedly yet all so affectionately term it--the 'bus of
one's earlier days, when London was new to the unjaded sensorium and
"Europe" was so wonderfully, so beautifully dawning on one's so avid and
sensitive consciousness?

And fate, which has left us the 'bus--but oh, in what scant and shabby
measure!--has left us, too, the weather that so densely yet so
congruously "goes with it"--the weather adequately enough denoted by the
thick atmosphere, the slimy pavements, the omnipresent unfurled umbrella
and the stout, elderly woman intent upon gaining, at cost of whatever
risk or struggle, her place and portion among the moist miscellany to
whom the dear old 'bus-- But perhaps I have lost the thread of my
sentence.

Ah, yes--that "stout, elderly woman"; so superabundant whether as a
type or as an individual; so prone--or "liable"--to impinge tyrannously
upon the consciousness of her fellow-traveller, and in no less a degree
upon that of the public servant, who, from his place aloft, guides, as
it is phrased, the destinies of the conveyance. It was, indeed, one of
the most notable of these--a humble friend of my own--who had the
fortune to make the acute, recorded, historic observation which, with
the hearty, pungent, cursory brevity and point of his class and

She was climbing up, or climbing down, perplexed equally, as I gather,
by the management of her _parapluie_ and of her--_enfin_, her
petticoats. The candid anxiety of her round, underdone face, as she so
wonderfully writhed to maintain the standard of pudicity dear--even
vital--to the matron of the British Isles appealed--vividly, though
mutely--to the forbearance that, seeing, would still seem _not_ to see,
her foot, her ankle, her _mollet_--as I early learned to say in Paris,
where, however, so exigent a modesty is scarcely ... well, scarcely.

"Madam," the gracious fellow said in effect, "_ne vous genez pas_." Then
he went on to assure her briefly that he was an elderly man; that he had
"held the ribbons," as they phrase it, for several years; that many
were the rainy days in London; that each of these placed numerous
women--elderly or younger--in the same involuntary predicament as that
from which she herself had suffered; and that so far as he personally
was concerned he had long since ceased to take any extreme delight in
the-- _Bref_, he was charming; he renewed my fading belief--fading, as I

_III.--As finally elucidated by Arnold Bennett._

Maria Wickwyre, of the Five Towns, emerged from muddy Bombazine Lane and
stood in the rain and wind at Pie Corner, eighty-four yards from the
door of St. Jude's chapel, in the Strand. She was in London! Yes, she
was on that spot, she and none other. It might have been somewhere else;
it might have been somebody else. But it wasn't. Wonderful! The miracle
of Life overcame her.

She had arms. Two of them. They were big and round, like herself. One
held a large parcel ("package" for the American edition); the other, an
umbrella. She also had two legs. She stood on them. If they had been
absent, or if they had weakened, she would have collapsed. But they
held her up. Ah, the mysteries of existence! More than ever was she
conscious of her firm, strong underpinning. Maria waved her umbrella and
her parcel and stopped a 'bus. The driver was elderly, wrinkled,
weatherbeaten. Maria got in and rode six furlongs and some yards to
Mooge Road, and then she stopped the 'bus to get out.

If she was conscious of her upper members and their charges, she was
still more conscious of her lower ones. If she had her parcel and her
umbrella to think about, she also had her stockings and petticoats to
consider. The wind blew, the rain drizzled, the driver looked around,
wondering why Maria didn't get out and have done with it.

"If he should see them!" she gasped. (You know what she meant by
"them.") Her round, broad face mutely implored the 'busman to look the
other way.

He wearily closed his eyes. He had been rumbling through the Strand for
thirty years. "Lor', mum," he said, "legs ain't no treat to me!"

Maria collapsed, after all, and took the 4:29 for home that same
afternoon.

truly civilized community would probably celebrate a centenary by
prohibiting all performances of the master's works for three or five
years, so that the public's deadening familiarity with them might wear
off. That would be the greatest service it could do him."

Newman, by the way, is a piano-player fan, contending that when the
principles of beautiful tone production are understood, mechanical means
will probably come nearer to perfection than the human hand. Mr. Arthur
Whiting, considering the horseless pianoforte some time ago, was also
enthusiastic. The h. p. is entirely self-possessed, and has even more
platform imperturbability than the applauded virtuoso. "After a few
introductory sounds, which have nothing to do with the music, and
without relaxing the lines of its inscrutable face, the insensate artist
proceeds to show its power. Its security puts all hand playing to shame;
it never hesitates, it surmounts the highest difficulties without
changing a clutch."

We were saying to our friend Dr. Empedocles that we kept our enthusiasms
green by never taking anything very seriously. "That's interesting,"

presently agreed that by having a great number and variety of
enthusiasms one is not likely to ride any of them to death. We all know

Persons who are so o. f. as to like rhyme with their poetry may discover
another reason for their preference in the following passage, which
Edith Wyatt quotes from Oscar Wilde:

"Rime, that exquisite echo which in the Muse's hollow hill creates and
answers its own voice; rime, which in the hands of the real artist
becomes not merely a material element of material beauty, but a
spiritual element of thought and passion also, waking a new mood, it may
be, or stirring a fresh train of ideas, or opening by mere sweetness and
suggestion of sound some golden door at which the Imagination itself had
knocked in vain; rime which can turn man's utterance to the speech of
gods"--

LETTER IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF WEDDING PRESENT.

Dear Lady Amblesham,

Who gives quickly, says the old proverb, gives twice. For this reason I
have purposely delayed writing to you, lest I should appear to thank you
more than once for the small, cheap, hideous present you sent me on the
occasion of my recent wedding. Were you a poor woman, that little bowl
of ill-imitated Dresden china would convict you of tastelessness merely;
were you a blind woman, of nothing but an odious parsimony. As you have
normal eyesight and more than normal wealth, your gift to me proclaims
you at once a Philistine and a miser (or rather did so proclaim you
until, less than ten seconds after I had unpacked it from its wrappings
of tissue paper, I took it to the open window and had the satisfaction
of seeing it shattered to atoms on the pavement). But stay! I perceive a
flaw in my argument. Perhaps you were guided in your choice by a
definite wish to insult me. I am sure, on reflection, that this is so.
_I shall not forget._

Yours, etc.
                              Cynthia Beaumarsh.

PS. My husband asks me to tell you to warn Lord Amblesham to keep out of
his way or to assume some disguise so complete that he will not be
recognized by him and horsewhipped.

Embarrassed by the riches of modern literature at our elbow, we took
refuge in Jane Austen, and re-read "Mansfield Park," marvelling again at
its freshness. They who hold that Mark Twain was not a humorist, or that
he was at best an incomplete humorist, have an argument in his lack of
appreciation of Jane Austen.

       *       *       *

One of the most delightful things about the author of "Mansfield Park"
that we have seen lately is an extract from "Personal Aspects of Jane
Austen," by Miss Austen-Leigh. "Each of the novels," she says, "gives a
description, closely interwoven with the story and concerned with its
principal characters, of error committed, conviction following, and
improvement effected, all of which may be summed up in the word
'Repentance.'"

Almost as good is Miss Austen-Leigh's contradiction of the statement
that sermons wearied Jane. She quotes the author's own words: "I am
very fond of Sherlock's Sermons, and prefer them to almost any." What a

As for William Lyons Phelps' remark, which a contrib has quoted, that
"too much modern fiction is concerned with unpleasant characters whom
one would not care to have as friends," how would you like to spend a
week-end with the characters in "The Mayor of Casterbridge"? With the
exception of the lady in "Two on a Tower," and one or two others, Mr.
Hardy's characters are not the sort that one would care to be cast away

"What I want to know is," writes Fritillaria, "whether you think Jane

warm affection for Fanny. Fanny Price, Elizabeth Bennet, and Anne (we
forget her last name) are three of the dearest girls in fiction.

The Magic Kit.

A FAIRY TALE FOR SYMPATHETIC
ELDERS.


I.

Once upon a time, not far removed from yesterday, there lived a poor
book reviewer named Abner Skipp. He was a kindly man and an excellent
husband and a most congenial soul to chat with, for he possessed a store
of information on the most remote and bootless subjects drawn from his
remarkable library--an accumulation of volumes sent to him for review,
and which he had been unable to dispose of to the dealers in second-hand
books. For you are to understand that too little literary criticism is
done on a cash basis. Occasionally a famous author, like Mr. Howells, is
paid real money to write something about Mr. James, or Mr. James is
substantially rewarded for writing about Mr. Howells, and heads of
departments and special workers are handsomely remunerated; but the
journeyman reviewer is paid in books; and these are the source of his
income.

Thus, every morning in the busy season, or perhaps once a week when
trade was dull, Abner Skipp journeyed from the suburbs to the city with
his pack of books on his back, and made the rounds of the second-hand
shops, disposing of his wares for whatever they would fetch. Novels,
especially what are known as the "best sellers," commanded good prices
if they were handled, like fruit, without delay; but they were such
perishable merchandise that oftentimes a best seller was dead before
Abner could get it to market; and as he frequently reviewed the same
novel for half a dozen employers, and therefore had half a dozen copies
of it in his pack, the poor wretch was sadly out of pocket, being
compelled to sell the dead ones to the junkman for a few pennies.

Abner Skipp was an industrious artisan and very skillful at his trade;
working at top speed, he could review more than a hundred books in a day
of eight hours. In a contest of literary critics held in Madison Square
Garden, New York, Abner won first prize in all three events--reviewing
by publisher's slip, reviewing by cover, and reviewing by title page.
But shortly after this achievement he had had the misfortune to sprain
his right arm in reviewing a new edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica,
which accident so curtailed his earning power that he fell behind in a
money way, and was compelled to mortgage his home. But Abner Skipp was a
cheerful, buoyant soul; and as his arm grew better and he was again able
to wield the implements of his trade, he set bravely to work to mend his
broken fortunes.


II.

If Abner Skipp had had nothing but popular novels to review he would
assuredly have perished of starvation, but frequently he received a
medical work, or a history, or a volume of sportive philosophy by
William James, or some such valuable work, which he could sell for a
round sum. There was always plenty to do--all the best magazines
employed him, and twice in the year--a month in spring and a month in
fall--books came to him in such numbers that the expressman dumped them
into the house through a shute like so many coals.

Mrs. Skipp assisted her husband all she could, but being a frail little
woman she was able to work on only the lightest fiction. Angelica, the
oldest daughter, cleared the book bin of a good deal of poetry and gift
books, and even Grandpa Skipp was intrusted with a few juveniles.

But none of the family was more helpful than little Harold, who, after
school time, worked side by side with his father, trimming the ready
made review slips which publishers send out with books, and seeing that
the paste pot never got empty or the paste too thick. Harold, as his
father often proudly observed, was a born book reviewer. From infancy it
was observed that the outside of a book always interested him more than
the inside, and once when his school teacher directed him to write a
sentence containing the word "book," he wrote: "The book is attractively
bound and is profusely illustrated."

One evening, in the very busiest week of the busy season, little
Harold's was the only bright face at the supper table. Abner Skipp had
had a bad day in the city; Mrs. Skipp and Angelica were exhausted from
reviewing and household cares, and Grandpa was peevish because Abner had
taken the "Pea Green Fairy Book" away from him and given him instead a
"Child's History of the Congo Free State."

"What is the matter, Abner?" his wife asked him when the others of the
family had retired. "Does your arm hurt you again?"

"No, wife," replied Abner Skipp. "My arm does not trouble me; I have
handled only the lightest literature for the last fortnight. Alas! it is
the same old worry. The interest on the mortgage will be due again next
week, and in spite of the fact that the cellar is so full of books that
I can scarcely get into it, we have not a dollar above the sum required
to meet our monthly bills."


III.

"Alas!" exclaimed the hapless Abner Skipp, next morning, "it seems as if
nothing was being published this fall except popular novels, and I
obtained an average of less than twenty cents on the last sackload I
took to town, not counting the dead ones which I sold to the junkman."

"If only there were some way of keeping them alive for a few days
longer!" said Mrs. Skipp. "If one could only stimulate the heart action
by injecting strychnine!"

"Or even embalm them," said Abner, sharing his wife's grewsome humor.
"But no; it is impossible to deceive a second-hand bookseller. He seems
to know to the minute when a novel is dead, and declines to turn his
shop into a literary morgue." The poor man sighed. "If my employers
would send me a few volumes of biography, or an encyclopedia, or a set
of Shakespeare, we could easily meet the interest on the mortgage."

"I wish, Abner, that I could be of more help to you," said Mrs. Skipp.
"If I could break myself of the habit of glancing at the last chapter of
a novel before reviewing it, I could do ever so many more. Angelica is
even more thoughtless than I. The poor child declares that some of the
stories look so interesting that she forgets her work completely and
actually begins to read them. As for Grandpa, he always was a great
reader, and consequently has no head at all for reviewing."

"If Harold were a few years older----" mused Abner. "But there, wife, we
must not spend in vain repining the scant hours allotted to us for
sleep. Perhaps the expressman will bring us some scientific books
to-morrow. Quite a number were on Appletree's fall list."

Abner Skipp kissed his wife affectionately, and presently the house was
dark and still. Mrs. Skipp, worn out by the day's work, went quickly to
sleep; but Abner, haunted by the mortgage, passed a restless night.
Several times he fancied he heard a noise in the cellar, as if the
expressman were dumping another ton of books into the bin. At last, just
before dawn, there came a loud thump, as if a volume of Herbert
Spencer's Autobiography had fallen to the floor. Getting out of bed
quietly so that his weary wife should not be disturbed, Abner went to
the cellar stairway and listened.

A clicking sound was distinctly audible, and a faint light gleamed
below.


IV.

Cautiously descending the stair, Abner Skipp came upon so strange a
sight that with difficulty he restrained himself from crying out his
astonishment. Little Harold was seated before a queer mechanism, which
resembled a typewriter, spinning wheel, and adding machine combined,
engaged in turning the tons of books around him into reviews, as the
miller's daughter spun the straw into gold, in the ancient tale of
"Rumpelstiltzkin."

"Child, what does this mean?" cried the bewildered Abner Skipp.
"Father," replied Harold, "I am lifting the mortgage. Not long ago I saw
among the advertisements in the Saturday Home Herald an announcement of
a Magic Kit for book reviewers, with a capacity of 300 books per hour.
Fortunately I had enough money in my child's bank to pay the first
installment on this wonderful outfit which came to-day. Is it not a
marvelous invention, father? Even Grandpa could work it!" Trembling with
eagerness Abner Skipp bent over the Magic Kit, while little Harold
explained the working of the various parts.

To review a book all that was necessary was to press a few keys, pull a
lever or two, and the thing was done. Reviewing by publisher's slip was
simplicity itself; the slips were dropped into a hopper, and presently
emerged neatly gummed to sheets of copy paper; and if an extract from
the book were desired, a page was quickly torn out and fed in with the
slip. Reviewing by title page was almost as rapid. The operator
type-wrote the title, author's name, publisher, price, and number of
pages, and then pulled certain levers controlling the necessary words
and phrases, such as--

"This latest work is not likely to add to the author's reputation"; or--

"The book will appeal chiefly to specialists"; or--

"An excellent tale to while away an idle hour"; or--

"The book is attractively bound and is profusely illustrated."

"Father," said little Harold, his face glowing, "to-morrow we will hire
a furniture van and take all these books to the city."

"My boy," cried Abner Skipp, folding his little son in his arms, "you
are the little fairy in our home. Surely no other could have done this
job more neatly or with greater dispatch; and no fairy wand could be
more wonder-working than this truly Magic Kit."

    For readers of your journal.)

  But what I started out to say,
    Across the gulf of ages,
  Is that, in our old Roman day,
    My patron paid me wages.

  No barren wreath of fame was mine
    When Mac approved my stuff,
  But casks of good Falernian wine,
    And slaves and gold enough.

  And last, to keep the wolf away
    And guard my age from harm,
  He gave me in his princely way
    My little Sabine farm.

  But now, forsooth, your merry crew--
    _O Tempora! O Mores!_--
  What do they ever get from you--
    Your Laura, Pan, Dolores?

  They fill the Line with verse and wheeze,
    To them your fame is due.
  What do they ever get for these?
    Maecenas? Ha! Ha! _You?_

  So as I quaff my spectral wine,
    At ease beside the Styx,
  Would I contribute to the Line?
    Nequaquam! Nunquam! Nix!

    Like the clasp, is broken._

  Till Orion's belt grow cold

The object is to save the house in which the poet lived during his last

Americans who speak at French should confine their conversation to other
Americans similarly talented. They should not practise on French people,
whose delicate ear is no more proof against impure accent than a stone
is proof against dripping water. The mistake which English speaking
people make is assuming that French is merely a language, whereas, even
in Paris, the speaking of it as much as accomplishment as singing, or
painting on china. Many gifted Frenchmen, like M. Viviani, Anatole
France, and some other Academicians, speak French extremely well, but
even these live in hope of improvement, of some day mastering the
finest shades of nasality and cadence, the violet rays of rhythm.

Mr. Masefield, the poet, does not believe that war times nourish the
arts. The human brain does its best work, he says, when men are happy.
How perfectly true! Look at ancient Greece. She was continually at war,
and what did the Grecians do for art? A few poets, a few philosophers
and statesmen, a few sculptors, and the story is told. On the other
hand, look at England in Shakespeare's time. The English people were
inordinately happy, for there were no wars to depress them, barring a
few little tiffs with the French and the Spanish, and one or two
domestic brawls. The human brain does its best work when men are happy,
indeed. There was Dante, a cheery old party. But why multiply instances?

Prof. Brown of Carlton College complains that college faculties are

Mr. Dubbe's Program Study Class.

(ACCOMPANYING THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA CONCERTS.)

Reported by Miss Poeta Pants.


I.--THE NEAPOLITAN SIXTH.

Mr. Criticus Flub-Dubbe's program study class began the season yesterday
afternoon with every member present and keenly attentive. After a
preparatory sketch of old Italian music, Mr. Dubbe told us about the
Neapolitan Sixth, which, he said had exercised so strong an influence on
music that, if Naples had never done anything else, this alone would
have insured to the city fame in history.

"The Neapolitan Sixth," said Mr. Dubbe, "is so called because the
composers of the Neapolitan school of opera were the first to introduce
it freely. D. and A. Scarlatti were at the head of the school and were
well-known musicians. Bach, who was not so well known, also used this
sixth."

"Which used it first?" asked Mrs. Givu A. Payne.

"Bach, of course," replied Mr. Dubbe. "Bach used everything first."

"Dear old Bach!" exclaimed Miss Georgiana Gush.

"The Neapolitan Sixth," continued Mr. Dubbe, "is usually found in the
first inversion; hence the name, the sixth indicating the first
inversion of the chord."

"How clever!" said Mrs. Gottem-Allbeat.

"It is an altered chord, the altered tone being the super-tonic. The
real character of the chord is submediant of the subdominant key; that
is, it is a major chord, and the use of such a major chord in the solemn
minor tonalities is indicative of the superficiality of the Italian
school--a desire for a change from the strict polyphonic music of the
times. Even the stern Bach was influenced."

"The Italians are so frivolous," said Mrs. Boru-Stiffe.

"A reign of frivolity ensued," went on Mr. Dubbe. "Not only was Italian
music influenced by this sixth, but Italian art, architecture,
sculpture, even material products. Take, for example, Neapolitan
ice-cream. Observe the influence of the sixth. The cream is made in
three color tones--the vanilla being the subdominant, as the chord is of
subdominant character; the strawberry being the submediant, and the
restful green the lowered supertonic or altered tone."

"What is the pineapple ice?" asked Miss Gay Votte.

"The pineapple ice is the twelfth overtone," replied Mr. Dubbe.

"There doesn't seem to be anything that Mr. Dubbe doesn't know,"
whispered Mrs. Fuller-Prunes to me with a smile.

I should say there wasn't!

After the lecture we had a lovely hand-made luncheon. Miss Ellenborough
presided at the doughnuts and Mrs. G. Clef poured. It was such a helpful
hour.


II.

"You remember," said Mr. Dubbe, "that Herr Weidig, in his lecture on the
wood winds, gave a double bassoon illustration from Brahms' 'Chorale of
St. Anthony,' which you are to hear to-day. But Herr Weidig neglected to
mention the most interesting point in the illustration--that the
abysmal-toned double bassoon calls attention to the devil-possessed
swine, St. Anthony being the patron saint of swine-herds. I want you to
listen carefully to this swine motive. It is really extraordinary." Mr.
Dubbe wrote the motive on the blackboard and then played it on his
double bassoon, which, he said, is one of the very few in this country.

"The bassoon," said Mr. Dubbe, "was Beethoven's favorite instrument. I
go further than Beethoven in preferring the double bassoon. Among my
unpublished manuscripts are several compositions for this instrument,
and my concerto for two double bassoons is now in the hands of a Berlin
publisher.

"But to recur to the Brahms chorale. You should know that it makes the
second best variations in existence. The best are in the Heroic
Symphony. The third best are Dvorak's in C major."

"C. Major--that's the man who wrote 'Dorothy Vernon,'" giggled Miss Vera
Cilly.

"I am not discussing ragtime variations," said Mr. Dubbe, severely.

"Not knocking anybody," whispered Miss Gay Votte.

"Another interesting point in connection with this week's program,"
resumed Mr. Dubbe, "is the river motive in Smetana's symphonic poem,
'The Moldau.' Three flutes represent (loosely speaking; for, as I have
often told you, music cannot represent anything) the rippling of the
Moldau, a tributary of the Danube. If the composer had had a larger
river in mind he would have used nine flutes. If this composition of
Smetana's seems rather unmusical, allowance must be made for him, as the
poor man was deaf and couldn't hear how bad his own music was."

"Wasn't Beethoven deaf?" asked Miss Sara Band.

"Only his physical ears were affected," replied Mr. Dubbe. "Smetana's
soul ears were also deaf."

At the close of the lecture Miss Ellenborough gave us a surprise in the
way of raised doughnuts made in the form of a G clef. Mrs.
Gottem-Allbeat poured.


III.

There was an ominous flash in Dr. Dubbe's eye when he arose to address
the class. "We have this week," he began, "a program barbarous enough to
suit the lovers of ultra-modern music. There is Saint-Saens' overture,
'Les Barbares,' to begin with. This is as barbaric as a Frenchman can
get, and is interesting chiefly as a study of how not to use the
trumpets. But for sheer barbarity commend me to Hausegger's
'Barbarossa.' Here we find the apotheosis of modern exaggeration.
Hausegger strove to make up for inimportant themes by a profuse use of
instruments. Only one theme, which occurs in the third movement, is of
any account, and that is an imitation of an old German chorale. In this
most monotonously muted of tone-poems the composer forgot to mute one
instrument--his pen."

"My! but Dr. Dubbe is knocking to-day," whispered Miss Sara Band.

"The thing is in C major and opens with a C major chord," continued Dr.
Dubbe. "That is the end of the C major; it never returns to that key.
This is modern music. Take the third movement. It opens with a
screeching barbershop chord. A little later ensues a prize fight
between two themes, which continues until one of them is knocked out. In
this edifying composition, also, snare drum sticks are used on the
kettle drums. More modern music. Bah!"

I have never seen Dr. Dubbe so irritated.

"Let us turn to something more cheerful," resumed Dr. Dubbe; and seating
himself at the piano he played the Schubert C minor impromptu. "On the
second page," he said, "where the key becomes A flat major, occurs a
harmony which looks and sounds like a foreign chord. Treated
harmonically it is a second dominant formation, and should read C flat,
D natural, A flat, diminished seventh of the key of the dominant.
Schubert does not, however, use it harmonically, otherwise the B natural
would read C flat. These notes are enharmonic because, though different,
they sound the same."

"How clear!" exclaimed Miss Gay Votte.

"But Schubert, instead of progressing harmonically, goes directly back
into the tonic of A flat major."

"How careless of him!" said Mrs. Givu A. Payne.

"Schubert uses it in its natural position. If the enharmonic C flat were
used the chord would then be in its third inversion. Each diminished
seventh harmony may resolve in sixteen different ways."

"Mercy!" murmured Mrs. Fuller-Prunes. "How much there is to know."

Dr. Dubbe passed his hand across his brow as if wearied. "I shall never
cease to regret," he said, "that Schubert did not write C flat. It would
have been so much clearer."

After the lecture Miss Ellenborough gave us another surprise--doughnuts
made in the shape of flats. Dr. Dubbe ate five, saying that D flat major
was his favorite key.

I rode down in the elevator with him and he repeated his remark that
Schubert had unnecessarily bemuddled the chord.

"I am sure you made it very plain," I said. "We all understand it now."

"Do you, indeed?" he replied. "That's more than I do."

Of course he was jesting. He understands everything.


IV.

Dr. Dubbe was in his element yesterday. The trinity of B's--Bach,
Beethoven, and Brahms--or, as Dr. Dubbe put it, the "trinity of
logicians," was much to his taste: a truly Gothic program.

"But what a contrast is the second half," said Dr. Dubbe. "In the first
we have the Kings of absolute music. In his youth Beethoven strayed from
the path (for even he must sow his musical wild oats), but in his
maturer years he produced no music that was not absolute. But in the
second half we have Berlioz and program music."

"I thought program music was music suitable for programs," said Mrs.
Givu A. Payne.

"Berlioz," continued Dr. Dubbe, "instituted the 'musical reform' in
Germany--the new German school of Liszt and Wagner. Berlioz's music is
all on the surface, while Brahms' music sounds the depths. He uses the
contra-bassoon in about all of his orchestral compositions (you will
hear it to-day), and most of his piano works take the last A on the
piano. If his bass seems at times muddy it is because he goes so deep
that he stirs up the bottom."

"How clear!" exclaimed Miss Gay Votte.

"Take measure sixty-five in Berlioz's 'Dance of the Sylphs,'" said Dr.
Dubbe. "The spirits hover over Faust, who has fallen asleep. The 'cellos
are sawing away drowsily on their pedal point D (probably in sympathy
with Faust), and what sounds like Herr Thomas tuning the orchestra is
the lone A of the fifth. The absent third represents the sleep of Faust.
This is a trick common to the new school. Wagner uses it in 'Siegfried,'
in the close of the Tarnhelm motive, to illustrate the vanishing
properties of the cap. In measure fifty-seven of the Ballet you will
find a chord of the augmented five-six, a harmony built on the first
inversion of the diminished seventh of the key of the dominant, with
lowered bass tone, and which in this instance resolves into the dominant
triad. Others claim that this harmony is a dominant ninth with root
omitted and lowered fifth."

"It has always seemed so to me," said Mrs. Fuller-Prunes. But I don't
believe she knows a thing about it.

"I think it's all awfully cute," said Miss Georgiana Gush.

"The harmony," resumed Dr. Dubbe, frowning, "really sounds like a
dominant seventh, and may be changed enharmonically into a dominant
seventh and resolve into the Neapolitan sixth. This is all clear to you,
I suppose?"

"Oh, yes," we all replied.

Dr. Dubbe then analyzed and played for us Brahms' First Symphony, after
which Miss Ellenborough served doughnuts made in the shape of a Gothic
B. We all had to eat them--one for Bach, one for Beethoven, and one for
Brahms.


V.

Dr. Dubbe did not appear enthusiastic over this week's program. I guess
because there was no Bach or Brahms on it. But we enjoyed his lecture
just the same.

"Raff was the Raphael of music," said Dr. Dubbe. "He was handicapped by
a superabundance of ideas, but, unlike Raphael, he did not constantly
repeat himself. This week we will have a look at his Fifth Symphony,
entitled 'Lenore.'"

"Oh!" exclaimed Miss Georgiana Gush, "that's the one the hero of 'The
First Violin' was always whistling."

"As you all know," said Dr. Dubbe, "this symphony is based on Buerger's
well-known ballad of 'Lenore,' but as only the last movement is
concerned with the actual ballad I will confine my remarks mainly to
that. I wish, however, to call your attention to a curious harmony in
the first movement. Upon the return of the first theme the trombones
break in upon a dominant B major harmony with what is apparently a
dominant C major harmony, D, F, and B. But the chords are actually
enharmonic of D, E sharp, and B. This is a dominant harmony in F sharp.
Listen for these trombone chords, and pay special attention to the E
sharp--a tone that is extremely characteristic of Raff."

"I think I have read somewhere," said Mrs. Givu A. Payne, "that Raff was
exceedingly fond of E sharp."

"He was," said Dr. Dubbe. "He often said he didn't see how he could get
along without it. But to resume:

"The fourth movement opens with Lenore's lamentation over her absent
lover and her quarrel with her mother--the oboe being the girl and the
bassoon her parent. Lenore foolishly curses her fate (tympani and
triangle), and from that moment is lost. There is a knock at the door
and her dead lover appears with a horse and suggests something in the
nature of an elopement. Not knowing he is dead, Lenore acquiesces, and
away they go (trumpets, flutes and clarinets).

"'T is a wild and fearful night. Rack scuds across the moon's wan face
(violas and second violins). Hanged men rattle in their chains upon the
wayside gibbets (triangle and piccolo). But on, on, on go the lovers,
one dead and the other nearly so.

"At last they reach the grave in the church-yard, and death claims the
lost Lenore ('cellos and bass viols _pizzicato_). For a conclusion there
is a coda founded on the line in the ballad, 'Gott sei der Seele
gnaedig.' It is very sad."

Dr. Dubbe seemed much affected by the sad tale, and many of us had to
wipe tears away. But Miss Ellenborough came to our rescue with some
lovely doughnuts made in the shape of a true lovers' knot. These, with
the tea, quite restored us.


VI.

There really wasn't any study class this week--that is, Dr. Dubbe did
not appear. While the class waited for him and wondered if he were ill
a messenger brought me the following note:

    "My Dear Poeta: Kindly inform the class that there will be no
    lecture this week. I cannot stand for such a trivial program as Herr
    Thomas has prepared.
                              C. F.-D."

"He might have told us sooner," said Miss Georgiana Gush.

"Why, yes; he knew last week what the next program would be," said Mrs.
Faran-Dole.

"The eccentricity of genius, my dear," remarked Mrs. Gottem-Allbeat.
"Genius is not tied down by rules of conduct of any sort."

"Well," said Mrs. Givu A. Payne, "I don't blame him for not wanting to
analyze this week's program. There isn't a bit of Bach or Brahms on it."

"Ladies," said Miss Ellenborough, coming forward with a gentleman who
had just arrived, "let me introduce Mr. Booth Tarkington, of Indiana.
Mr. Tarkington came up to attend the lecture, but as Dr. Dubbe will not
be here Mr. Tarkington has kindly consented to give a doughnut recital,
so to speak."

"Oh, how lovely!" we all exclaimed.

"Mr. Tarkington," added Miss Ellenborough, "is well known as the author
of the Beaucaire doughnut, the pride of Indiana doughnutdom."

Saying which Miss Ellenborough removed the screen that conceals her work
table and Mr. Tarkington, in an incredibly short time, produced a batch
of Beaucaires. They were really excellent, and we didn't leave a single
one. Mr. Everham Chumpleigh Keats poured.

After tea we all adjourned to the concert, which we enjoyed immensely,
in spite of the absence of Bach and Brahms. Not knocking Dr. Dubbe.

POETRY.

(_Lord Dunsany._)

What is it to hate poetry? It is to have no little dreams and fancies,
no holy memories of golden days, to be unmoved by serene midsummer
evenings or dawn over wild lands, singing or sunshine, little tales told
by the fire a long while since, glow-worms and briar rose; for of all
these things and more is poetry made. It is to be cut off forever from
the fellowship of great men that are gone; to see men and women without
their halos and the world without its glory; to miss the meaning lurking

OUR FAVORITE AUTUMN POEM.

(_By a New Jersey poetess._)

  Autumn is more beautiful, I think,
    Than Spring or Winter are.
  For then trees change at the river's brink--
    How beautiful they are.

  I love to see the different colors so bright--
    That grow around brooks & grottoes.
  Leaves that are pressed are a pleasant sight

"NATURE NEVER DID DECEIVE..."

No sooner had blundering man accomplished the ruin of Halifax than
Mother Nature sent a blizzard with a foot or two of snow. A kindly
dame--as kindly as the old lady of Endor. She has her gentle, her
amorous moods, in which we adore her, and write ballads to her beauty;
but we know, if we are wise, that her beauty is "all in your eye," to
speak in the way of science, not of slang, and that she is savage as a
jungle cat. Like some women and much medicine, she should be well shaken
before taken, and always one must keep an eye upon Nature, or one may
feel her claws in one's back. So we have reflected on a summer's day in
woods; but the forest seemed not less beautiful, nor was our meditation
melancholy. To be saddened by the inescapable is a great mistake.

THE DAY OF "DON'TS."

  Thanksgiving was a holiday I welcomed when a boy,
  But now it is a solemn feast without a jot of joy.
  It used to be a pleasure to attack the toothsome turkey,
  But now when I approach the bird I'm anything but perky.

  A multitude of dismal "Don'ts" impair my appetite;
  A fear of what may happen me accompanies each bite.
  There hovers round this holiday a heavy cloud of dread
  That never lifts till I am safe, with water-bag, in bed.

  I used to drink a glass of wine, but that is bad, I'm told,
  So now I ship in water--just as much as I can hold.
  To fail to fletcherize my food were fatal, without question;
  I never touch the stuffing, as it taxes the digestion.

  When the lugubrious feast is done I hasten from my chair
  To open all the windows wide, and let in lots of air;
  And then I sit around an hour and chew a wad of gum
  Until the fullness disappears from my distended tum.

  That pleasant, dozy feeling I compel myself to shake,
  For should I venture on a nap I'd never, never wake;
  And if I sneeze I take alarm and hasten out of doors,
  To start a circulation in my poison-clotted pores.

  The fact that I am still alive is due, I'm glad to say,
  To heeding all the dinner "Don'ts" that went with yesterday.
  It was, from soup to raisins, by and large, and all in all,
  The solemnest Thanksgiving meal that ever I recall.

[From Faguet's "Cult of Incompetence."]

Democracy has the greatest inducement to elect representatives who are
representative, who, in the first place, resemble it as closely as
possible, who, in the second place, have no individuality of their own,
who, finally, having no fortune of their own, have no sort of
independence. We deplore that democracy surrenders itself to
politicians, but from its own point of view, a point of view which it
cannot avoid taking up, it is absolutely right. What is a politician? He
is a man who, in respect of his personal opinions, is a nullity, in
respect of education a mediocrity; he shares the general sentiments and
passions of the crowds, his sole occupation is politics, and if that
career were closed to him he would die of starvation. He is precisely
the thing of which democracy has need. He will never be led away by his
education to develop ideas of his own; and, having no ideas of his own,
he will not allow them to enter into conflict with his prejudices. His
prejudices will be, at first, by a feeble sort of conviction, afterward,
by reason of his own interest, identical with those of the crowd; and
lastly, his poverty and the impossibility of his getting a living
outside of politics make it certain that he will never break out of the
narrow circle where his political employers have confined him; his
imperative mandate is the material necessity which obliges him to obey;
his imperative mandate is his inability to quarrel with his bread and
butter. Democracy obviously has need of politicians, has need of nothing
else but politicians, and has need indeed that there shall be in
politics nothing else but politicians.

The home of Mr. and Mrs. H. H. Duncan was the center of attraction
Sunday afternoon. All the relatives and a few special friends were there
to celebrate two happy occasions, the anniversary of Mr. and Mrs.
Duncan's marriage and the marriage of Miss Cora L. Peet, Mrs. Duncan's
sister, to Mr. J. E. Hammond, and the soft winds of March had blown the
planet of love over this beautiful home.

The composition of the decorations adhered with striking fidelity to
nature. The wide veranda was completely screened in by wild smilax and
fragrant honeysuckle vines, which entwisted themselves among the
branches of sweet myrtle and native palms, fitly transforming it into a
typical Arcadian scene beckoning to

 "Come unto the garden, Maud;
    I am here at the gate alone;
  And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,
    And the muck of the rose is blown."

ear. With a voice full of individuality of flavor

Between the Barn and the Woodhouse.

  Between the barn and the woodhouse,
    Where oft old Jersey would stand,
  I remember 'twas on this self-same spot
    Where she kicked Elizabeth Ann.

  I could hear the clang of the bucket,
    And also poor Annie's refrain,
  And when the family reached her,
    She was writhing and groaning with pain.

  Mother stooped dawn to caress her
    As she lay there stunned on the ground,
  And our big, simple minded brother

  Without halt or hesitation,

  Although she lay stunned and bleeding,
    He asked her where she was hurt.

It is a great pleasure to be free, for a time, from the practice of
expressing opinion; free to read the newspapers with no thought of
commenting on the contents; free to glance at a few hectic headlines,
and then bite into a book that you have meant to get to for a long time
past, to read it slowly, without skipping, to read over an especially
well done page and to put the book aside and meditate on the moral which
it pointed, or left you to point. Unless obliged to, why should anybody
write when he can read instead? One's own opinions (hastily formed and
lacking even the graces of expression) are of small account; certainly
they are of less account than Mr. Mill's observations on Liberty, which
I have put down in order to pen a few longish paragraphs. (I would
rather be reading, you understand; my pen is running for the same reason
some street cars run--to hold the franchise.) And speaking of Mill, do
you remember the library catalogue which contained the consecutive
items, "Mill on Liberty" and "Ditto on the Floss"?

One can get through a good many books on a long railway journey. My
slender stock was exhausted before I reached Colorado, and I am
compelled to re-read until such time as I can lay in a fresh supply. At
home it is difficult to find time to read--that is, considerable
stretches of time, so that one may really digest the pages which he is
leisurely taking in. Fifty years ago there were not many more books
worth reading than there are to-day, but there was more time to
assimilate them. A comparatively few books thoroughly assimilated gave
us Lincoln's Gettysburg address. Not long ago my friend the Librarian
was speaking of this short classic. "Did you ever," said he, "read
Edward Everett's address at Gettysburg?" "No," said I, "and I fear I
shall never get to it." "It is stowed away among his collected
orations," said he. "Not half bad. Unfortunately for its fame, Mr.
Lincoln happened along with a few well chosen remarks which the world
has preferred to remember."

       *       *       *

Another advantage of a long railway journey is the opportunity it
affords to give one's vocal cords a (usually) well-merited rest. It is
possible to travel across the continent without saying a word. A nod or
a shake of the head suffices in your dealings with the porter; and you
learn nothing from questioning him, as he has not been on that run
before. Also, business with the train and Pullman conductors may be
transacted in silence, and there is no profit in asking the latter to
exchange your upper berth for a lower, as he has already been entreated
by all the other occupants of uppers. When the train halts you do not
have to ask, "What place is this?"--you may find out by looking at the
large sign on the station. Nor is it necessary to inquire, "Are we on
time?"--your watch and time-table will enlighten you. You do not have to
exclaim, when a fresh locomotive is violently attached, "Well, I see we
got an engine"--there is always somebody to say it for you. And you
write your orders in the dining car. There is, of course, the chance of
being accosted in the club car, but since this went dry the danger has
been slight. And conversation can always be averted by absorption in a

Not everybody can travel three or four days without exchanging words
with a fellow traveler. Mr. George Moore, for example, would be quite
wretched. Conversation is the breath of his being, he says somewhere. I
understand that Mr. Moore has another book on press, entitled "Avowals."
Avowals! My dear!... After the "Confessions" and the "Memoirs" what in
the world is there left for the man to avow?

What a delightful fictionist is Moore! And never more delightful than
when he is writing fiction under the appearance of fact. No one has
taken more to heart the axiom that the imaginary is the only real. As my
friend the Librarian observed, the difference between George Moore and
Baron Munchausen is that Moore's lies are interesting.

Travelers must carry their own reading matter under government
ownership. The club car library now consists of time-tables, maps, and
pamphlets setting forth the never to be forgotten attractions of the
show places along the way. These are all written by the celebrated prose
poet Ibid, and, with a bottle of pseudo beer or lemon pop, help to make
the club car as gay a place as a mortician's parlor on a rainy

The treeless plateau over which the train rolls, hour after hour, is the
result of a great uplift. It was not sudden; it was slow but sure. This
result is arid and plateautudinous, in a manner of speaking--not the
best manner. It makes me think of democracy--and prohibition. To this
complexion we shall come at last. To be sure, the genius of man will
continue to cut channels in the monotonous plain; erosion will relieve
the dreary prospect with form and color, but it bids fair to be, for the
most part, a flat and dry world, from which many of us will part with a
minimum of regret. There will remain the inextinguishable desire to
learn what wonders science will disclose. Perhaps--who knows?--they will
discover how to ventilate a sleeping car.

At Albuquerque I remarked a line of Mexicans basking in the sun (having,
perhaps, finished jumping on their mothers). They looked happy--as happy
as the Russian peasants used to be. Men who know Russia tell me that the
peasants really were happy, even under the twin despotisms of Vodka and
Czar. It was not, of course, a reformer's idea of happiness: a
reformer's idea of happiness is perpetual attention to everybody's
business but his own. People who are interested academically in other
people's happiness usually succeed in making everybody unhappy. Now, the
Russian's happiness was a poor thing, but his own. In reality he was
wretched and oppressed, and his voice and bearing should have expressed
his misery and hopelessness, instead of a foolish content and a silly
detachment from political affairs. But he is at last emancipated, and,
as was said of Mary's fleecy companion, now contemplate the condemned

In Phoenix, Arizona, distance lends enchantment to the view. But the
hills are far away, and as I did not visit the Southwest to contemplate
the works of man, however ingenious, I followed the westering sun to
where the mountains come down to the sea. I do not fancy the elevated
parts of New Mexico and Arizona; and as there was no thought of pleasing
me when they were created, I feel free to express a modified rapture in
their contemplation. I should have remembered enough geology to know
that granite is not found in this section, except at the bottom of the
Grand Canyon. The hills I like are made of old-fashioned stuff, not
young upstart tufa and sandstone that was not thought of when the
Laurentians were built. One really cannot have much respect for a rock
that he can kick to pieces. The gay young buttes in this land of quickly
shifting horizons are not without their charm; they look well in
certain lights, and they are decidedly better than no hills at all.
Although immature, they have an air of pretending to be very ancient, to
be the ruins of mountains. They are picturesque and colorful. And I
would swap a league of them for one archaic boulder the size of a
box-car, with a thick coverlet of reindeer moss.

When I left the train at Pasadena I saw what I took to be a procession
of the K. K. K. It proved to be citizens in flu masks. I was interested,
but not alarmed; whereas a lady tourist who debarked on the following
day fell in a swoon and was conveyed to the hospital. The newspapers
charged her disorder to the masks, but as she was from Chicago I suspect
that her reason was unsettled by the sudden revealment of a clean city.
And Pasadena is clean--almost immaculate. I was obliged to join the
masqueraders, and I found the inconvenience only slight. The mask keeps
the nose warm after sundown, and is convenient to sneeze into. And I
have never remarked better looking folks than the people of Pasadena.
The so-called human race has never appeared to better advantage. The
women were especially charming, and were all, for once, equally
handicapped, like the veiled sex in the Orient.

Whoever christened it the Pacific ocean was the giver of innocent
pleasure to every third person who has set eyes on it since. "There's

reaches the top of a pass. "Isn't it calm! That's why it is called the
Pacific. And it is pacific, isn't it?" Some such observation must have
escaped the stout adventurer in Darien, before he fell silent upon his

I shall say nothing about the never to be sufficiently esteemed climate
of California, nor even allude to the windjammers of Loz Onglaze. The
last word concerning those enthusiasts was spoken by a San Francisco man
who, addressing the people of "Los," explained how the city might
overcome the slight handicap imposed by its distance from the sea. "Lay
an iron pipe to tidewater," he advised; "and then, if you can suck as
hard as you can blow, you will presently have the ocean at your doors."
It would be difficult to improve on that criticism. And so, instead of
praising the climate, I will gladly testify that it is easier to live in
this part of the country than anywhere east of the Sierras. And San
Diego impresses me as the easiest place in the state to live, the year
round.

The mechanical effort of existence is reduced to its minimum in La
Jolla, a suburb of San Diego, where I am opposing a holiday indolence to
pen these desultory lines. "There's lots of good fish in the sea" that
beats against this rockbound but not stern coast, and there is a fish
market in the village. But each day I see the sign in the window, "No
fish." The fisherman, I am told, is "very independent," a euphemism for
tired, perhaps. He casts his hooks and nets only when the spirit moves
him, and is not impelled to the sea by sordid motives. A true fisherman,
I thought, though he never change his window sign.

To-day's newspapers contain the protest of the governor of Lower
California against the proposed annexing of his territory by the United
States, Senor Cantu may be a hairless dog in the manger; he may, as he
claims, represent the seething patriotism of all but a negligible
percentage of the population; but he is no doubt correct in merely
asserting that the peninsula will not be annexed. Incidentally, he is on
sure ground when he attributes the chaos in Mexican affairs to
"conflicting political criteria." It is all of that. So far as I have
casually discovered, there is no active annexation sentiment on this
side of the border, for there is no hope of overcoming that provision in
the Mexican constitution which makes it a matter of high treason to
encourage a movement for the diminution of Mexican territory.

       *       *       *

Gov. Cantu's phrase, "conflicting political criteria," applies rather
happily to the doings in Paris these days. The Peace conference and
prohibition in the United States are perhaps the two most prominent
topics before the public, and they are the two things which I have not
heard mentioned since I began my travels.

Nowadays the buying and dispatching of Christmas gifts is scientifically
made. One merely selects this or that and orders it sent to So-and So.
One turns in to a book store a list of titles and a list of names and

Every trade has at least one classic. One in the newspaper trade
concerns the reporter who was sent to do a wedding, and returned to say
that there was no story, as the bridegroom failed to show up. Will a few
other trades acquaint us with their classics? It should make an
interesting collection.

Sir: The classic of the teaching trade: A school teacher saw a man on
the car whose face was vaguely familiar. "I beg your pardon," she said,
"but aren't you the father of two of my children?"

Sir: "If you can't read, ask the grocer." But I heard it differently. An
Englishman and an American read the sign. The American laughed. The
Englishman did not see the humor of it. The American asked him to read
it again; whereupon the Englishman laughed and said: "Oh, yes; the
grocer might be out."

(1) recognition of the union; (2) appointing a time and place for
meeting with a business committee to determine on a system of collective
bargaining for Line material; (3) allowing the Order to have a voice in
the management of the column. A prompt compliance with the demands of
the Order failing, a strike vote will be ordered.

We have never limited the output of a contributor; the union will. No

Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.

BEING A FEW HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED PAGES FROM HIS JOURNAL.


I.

In this, the seven and twentieth year of my captivity, I have been much
distressed by the monotony of my existence. My habitation is as complete
as I can wish; I have all the clothing to my need; and my subjects--my
man Friday and his father, and the Spaniard--keep me abundantly supplied
with food. When I was alone the necessity of husbandry gave me plenty to
do, but now I am oppressed by a great lack of matter for occupation,
both physical and mental. Questioning myself, I put the blame upon an
evil state of mind into which I have fallen, in no longer finding profit
in reading my bible and other books, or in meditating on this life and
that which is to come.

I am rich in that I want for no material thing; and I am idle, in that I
do naught to profit myself or my companions; so that, although
practically a solitary, I am, as you might say, an idle rich class, and
were I multiplied by thousands I should be a grievous burden on society.

Friday, perceiving the state of my mind, has set himself to entertain
me, and, being an ingenious fellow, will no doubt succeed. As a
beginning he took unto himself the management of our simple meals, and
he has contrived so to expand them, both in quantity of food and time
spent in consuming it, that a large part of my day is now given over to
eating. I drink a great deal of wine with my meals, and of rum also, a
great store of which I saved from the wreck; and these strong waters,
added to the great quantity of food consumed, produce in me a pleasant
torpor, which I find to be a satisfactory substitute for meditation.


II.

My man Friday came running to me this afternoon to relate that "many
great number" of savages were landed on our shore, and that, by the
preparations the wretches were making, a great feast was intended. The
news was extremely welcome, for I have become so bored by the monotony
of existence that any pretext for going abroad after nightfall is a
godsend. So after disposing of a heavy dinner, that included six kinds
of wines and liquors, my carriage, as I called it (though it was no more
than a litter), was fetched by Friday and his father; and followed by
the Spaniard, carrying my cloak and perspective glass, I set out for a
little wooded hill that overlooked the beach on which the savages were
encamped.

The dreadful wretches had finished their inhuman feast and were
squatting on the sand, watching one of their number, a comely female,
who was dancing wildly in a circle of strong firelight. The body of
this creature was swathed in veils, which she removed, one after the
other, until she was wholly naked. This degrading spectacle seemed to be
enormously enjoyed by the spectators, who were grouped in the form of a
horseshoe. I observed, also, that they were decorated with feathers and
glass beads, and that, except for these ornaments, were as naked as the
dancer.

My Spaniard, a God fearing man, was greatly shocked by the sight, and my
man Friday, too, was strongly affected; but to my shame I must confess
that I did not share their abhorrence. Yet even my stomach began to
protest when the dancer, darting to one of the canoes, appeared with a
gory head that had been chopped from one of the victims of the feast,
and continued her shocking gyrations, to a most infernal din of
barbarous musical instruments that half a hundred of the wretches were
beating. The Spaniard and Friday urged, in their indignation, that we
discharge our muskets at the unholy crew; but I restrained them from
such an intelligible piece of violence, reflecting that the barbarous
customs of these people might be regarded as their own disaster, and
that I was not called upon to judge their actions, much less to execute
the judgment of heaven upon them. Besides, they were in such numbers
that, had we attacked, we should have been overwhelmed. So, calling for
my litter, I returned to my habitation.

An artist friend, back from the Land of Taos, brings word of another

of Arthur Dove, one of the first of the Einstein school to exhibit in
this town. Despairing of the public intelligence, Mr. Dove took up the
raising of chickens, and very old readers of this column may recall the
verses in which we celebrated his withdrawal from art:


THE BROODING DOVE.

  Arthur Dove is raising chickens,
    He has put his paints away:
  Tell me, Chronos, where the dickens
    Are the Cubes of yesterday!

  Dove was real, Dove was earnest,
    But his efforts came to nix.
  Bowing to decree the sternest,
    He has gone to raising chicks.

  There's a strong demand for broilers,
    There's a call for chicken-pie;
  Dove declined to paint pot-boilers,
    So he put his brushes by.

  Luck attend his every setting!
    May his inspirations hatch!
  And, whatever price he's getting,
    May he market every batch.

  She was a three-toed tree toad,
    But a two-toed toad was he.

  The two-toed tree toad tried to win
    The she toad's friendly nod;
  For the two-toed tree toad loved the ground
    That the three-toed tree toad trod.

  Could you find an odder fodder if you hunted everywhere?

  Miss Tudor bought some madder. It's a color rather rare,
  And it made the adder shudder when Miss Tudor dyed her hair.

  Her hair was soft as eider when she tried her madder dye;
  Then, it had an odder odor--and was redder than the sky.

  But a sadder adder eyed 'er when the rider dyed 'er hair.

A reader wonders what we can find in a book so childishly egotistical as
Margot Asquith's Autobiography. Answer: much that is interesting. When
we read an autobiography we are interested in the people written about
rather than in the writer. There are exceptions, of course; for example,
Henry Adams and Jacques Casanova.

THE JANITOR ENTERTAINS.

[Iowa City Item.]

An unusual function for men in business circles was that which John
Voelkel, janitor of the First National bank, supervised, Saturday
evening. He gave a dinner, card party and a smoker to all the officers
of the bank. Invitations were issued to every member of the staff, from
president to clerk, and those who assembled at the custodian's home made
merry for several hours at an event probably without a duplicate in
banking history in Iowa City.

quartette, the uplift, inherent sin, Gibbon, fourth dimension,
Euripides, "eyether," pate de fois gras, lemon phosphate, Henry Cabot
Lodge, Woodrow Wilson.

Low-highbrow: Municipal government, Kipling, socialism, Shakespeare,
politics, Thackeray, taxation, golf, grand opera, bridge, chicken a la
Maryland, "eether," stocks and bonds, gin rickey, Theodore Roosevelt,
chewing gum in private.

A bachelor complains to us that prohibition has ruined his life. His
companions have deserted their haunts--all, all are gone, the old
familiar faces--and he can find no one to talk to; and he talks very
well, too. Now, we have as much compassion for him as it is possible to
have for any bachelor, and yet we do not esteem his case utterly
hopeless. As Mr. Lardner has suggested, when he repairs to his hotel at
night he can open the clothespress and talk to his other suit of
clothes.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
