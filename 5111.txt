THE REAL DIARY OF A REAL BOY

By Henry A. Shute




INTRODUCTION

In the winter of 1901-02, while rummaging an old closet in the
shed-chamber of my father's house, I unearthed a salt-box which had been
equipped with leather hinges at the expense of considerable ingenuity,
and at a very remote period. In addition to this, a hasp of the same
material, firmly fastened by carpet-tacks and a catch of bent wire, bade
defiance to burglars, midnight marauders, and safe-breakers.

With the aid of a tack-hammer the combination was readily solved, and an
eager examination of the contents of the box disclosed:--

  1. Fish-line of braided shoemaker's thread, with perch hook, to
     which adhered the mummied remains of a worm that lived and
     flourished many, many years ago.

  2. Popgun of pith elder and hoop-skirt wire.

  3. Horse-chestnut bolas, calculated to revolve in opposite
     directions with great velocity, by an up-and-down motion of the
     holder's wrist; also extensively used for the adornment of
     telegraph-wires,--there were no telephones in those days,--and
     the cause of great profanity amongst linemen.

  4. More fish-hooks of the ring variety, now obsolete.

  5. One blood alley, two chinees, a parti-colored glass agate,
     three pewees, and unnumbered drab-colored marbles.

  6. Small bow of whalebone, with two arrows.

  7. Six-inch bean-blower, for school use--a weapon of considerable
     range and great precision when used with judgment behind a
     Guyot's Common School Geography.

  8. Unexpended ammunition for same, consisting of putty pellets.

  9. Frog's hind leg, extra dry.

  10. Wing of bluejay, very ditto.

  11. Letter from "Beany," postmarked "Biddeford, Me." and expressing
      great indignation because "Pewt" "hasent wrote."

  12. Copy-book inscribed "Diry."

  The examination of this copy-book lasted the rest of the day, and it was
  read with the peculiar pleasure one experiences in reviewing some of the
  events of a happy boyhood.

  With the earnest hope that others may experience a little of the
  pleasure I gained from the reading, I submit the "Diry" to the public.

DIRY

Father thot i aught to keep a diry, but i sed i dident want to, because
i coodent wright well enuf, but he sed he wood give $1000 dolars if he
had kept a diry when he was a boy.

Mother said she gessed nobody wood dass to read it, but father said
everybody would tumble over each other to read it, anyhow he wood give
$1000 dolars if he had kept it. i told him i wood keep one regular if he
wood give me a quarter of a dolar a week, but he said i had got to keep
it anyhow and i woodent get no quarter for it neither, but he woodent
ask to read it for a year, and i know he will forget it before that, so
i am going to wright just what i want to in it. Father always forgets
everything but my lickins. he remembers them every time you bet.

So i have got to keep it, but it seems to me that my diry is worth a
quarter of a dolar a week if fathers is worth $1000 dolars, everybody
says father was a buster when he was a boy and went round with Gim
Melcher and Charles Talor. my grandmother says i am the best boy she
ever see, if i dident go with Beany Watson and Pewter Purinton, it was
Beany and Pewt made me tuf.

there dos'nt seem to be much to put into a diry only fites and who got
licked at school and if it ranes or snows, so i will begin today.

December 1, 186- brite and fair, late to brekfast, but mother dident say
nothing. father goes to boston and works in the custum house so i can
get up as late as i want to. father says he works like time, but i went
to boston once and father dident do anything but tell stories about what
he and Gim Melcher usted to do when he was a boy. once or twice when a
man came in they would all be wrighting fast, when the man came in again
i sed why do you all wright so fast when he comes in and stop when he
goes out, and the man sort of laffed and went out laffing, and the men
were mad and told father not to bring that dam little fool again.

December 2. Skinny Bruce got licked in school today. I told my
granmother about it and she said she was glad i dident do enything to
get punnished for and she felt sure i never wood. i dident tell her
i had to stay in the wood box all the morning with the cover down, i
dident tell father either you bet.

December 2. rany. i forgot to say it raned yesterday too. i got cold and
have a red rag round my gozzle.

December 2. pretty near had a fite in schol today. Skinny Bruce and
Frank Elliot got rite up with there fists up when the bell rung. it was
two bad, it wood have been a buly fite. i bet on Skinny.

December 3, 186- brite and fair. went to church today. Me and Pewt and
Beany go to the Unitarial church. we all joined sunday school to get
into the Crismas festerval. they have it in the town hall and have two
trees and supper and presents for the scholars. so we are going to stay
til after crismas anyway the unitarials have jest built a new church.
Pewt and Beany's fathers painted it and so they go there. i don't
know why we go there xcept because they don't have any church in the
afternoon. Nipper Brown and Micky Gould go there. we all went into
the same class. our teacher is Mister Winsor a student. we call them
stewdcats. after we had said our lesson we all skinned out with Mr.
Winsor. when we went down Maple street we saw 2 roosters fiting in
Dany Wingates yard, and we stoped to see it. i knew more about fiting
roosters than any of the fellers, because me and Ed Towle had fit
roosters lots. Mr. Winsor said i was a sport, well while the roosters
were fiting, sunday school let out and he skipped acros the street and
walked off with one of the girls and we hollered for him to come and see
the fite out, and he turned red and looked mad. the leghorn squorked and
stuck his head into a corner. when a rooster squorks he wont fite any
more.

December 5. snowed today and school let out at noon. this afternoon went
down to the library to plug stewdcats. there was me and Beany and Pewt,
and Whacker and Pozzy Chadwick and Pricilla Hobbs. Pricilla is a feller
you know, and Pheby Talor, Pheby is a feller too, and Lubbin Smith
and Nigger Bell, he is'nt a nigger only we call him Nigger, and Tommy
Tompson and Dutchey Seamans and Chick Chickering, and Tady Finton and
Chitter Robinson.

December 6. Gim Wingate has got a new bobtail coat.

December 7, 186- Got sent to bed last nite for smoking hayseed cigars
and can't go with Beany enny more. It is funny, my father wont let me go
with Beany becaus he is tuf, and Pewts father wont let Pewt go with me
becaus im tuf, and Beanys father says if he catches me or Pewt in his
yard he will lick time out of us. Rany today.

people. i want impident. you see they was making poetry and all sitting
around the vestry. they wanted to play copenhagin and post office and
clap in and clap out, but Mister Erl woodent let them because it was in
church. so they had to play poetry. one person wood give a word and then
the oppisite person wood give a word that rimed with it. it was auful
silly. a girl wood give the word direxion and then a stewdcat wood say
affexion and waul his eyes towards the girl. and then another wood say
miss, and another stewdcat wood say kiss and then he wood waul his eyes,
and when it came my turn i said what rimes with jellycake, and the girls
turned red and the stewdcats looked funny, and Mister Burley said if

together. when we came in from resess Cawcaw reached over and hit me a
bat, and i lent him one in the snoot, and he hit me back. we was jest
fooling, but old Francis called Cawcaw up front to lick him. i thought
if i went up and told him he wood say, noble boy go to your seat, i wont
lick neether of you. anyway i knew that Cawcaw wood tell on me, and so
i told old Francis i hit Cawcaw first, and old Francis said Harry i have
had my eye on you for a long time, and he jest took us up and slammed us
together, and then he wood put me down and shake Cawcaw and then he
wood put Cawcaw down and shake me till my head wabbled and he turned me
upside down and all the fellers looked upside down and went round and
round and somehow i felt silly like and kind of like laffin. i dident
want to laff but coodent help it. and then he talked to us and sent us
to our seats and told us to study, and i tried to but all the words in
the book went round and round and i felt awful funny and kind of wabbly,
and when i went home mother said something was the matter and i told
her and then i cried, i don't know what i cried for, becaus i dident ake
any. father said he wood lick me at home when i got licked at school and
perhaps that was why i cried. ennyway when father come home i asked him
if he was a going to lick me and he said not by a dam sight, and he gave
me ten cents and when i went to bed i got laffin and crying all to once,
and coodent stop, and mother set in my room and kept her hand on my

said he dident get much of a prise when he got me. i gess he wont say
that tomorrow when i bring my prise home.

Feb. 20. i dident get the prise. you see yesterday John Flanygin spelt
more words write than Gimmy Fitsgerald and Gimmy went to the foot. when
we marked slates Gimmy marked 9 of my words wrong out of 20, and i had
to go down most to where John Flannygin was. old Francis said he dident
beleave i had aught to have staid at the head so long as i did and i was
afraid he wood lick me and John but he dident. he said he was ashamed
and disapointed in me but i gess he was not the only one who was
disapointed. i had told Pewt and Beany i wood treat on what father wood

he went through so fast old Francis only hit him 2 bats. Tady Finton and
Nigger Bell both got licked. Tady dident cry or holler a bit, but Nigger

that.

Feb. 24, Beany and Pewt got punching today in school and old Francis
made them stand on the platform with their arms round each others neck
all the forenoon, i bet they felt pretty cheep. Brite and fair.

splitting my kindlings for a week. i did miss them twice but mother
dident tell him and if he dont ask her before tonight i am all right.

Feb. 28. Last night went to the velosipede race. it was jest ripping.
i got down before the door opened. Bob Carter came pretty soon but he
woodent let us in until the ticket man came. Mr. Watson was the ticket
man and he let me and Beany and Shinny Thing in free. they had a lot
of seats in the center of the hall, and the rest round the edges, and
a open track around the hall. On the platform set Bill Morrill and Dave
Quimby and John Getchell and Eben Folsom. Most of the fellers in the
race were stewdcats and most of the stewdcats and the girls had the
seats in the center of the hall. The stewdcats who were to race were
Stone and Stuart and Lee and Clifford and August Belmont and Swift and
Nichols and George Kent and Cutler and Johnny Heald and Gear and Burly
and Bob Morison. the townies were Charlie Gerish and Doctor Prey. each
feller rode round the hall twice to get going like time, and then Dave
Quimby hollered go and he had to ride around the hall until he had rid a
quarter of a mile.

When the stewdcats rode all the other stewdcats yelled and the girls
waved their handkerchiefs and the band played and the excitement was
dreadful.

After a while Doctor Prey came out and all the townies got up and
cheered and the band played the star spangled banner, because Doctor
fit in the war, and Doctor took of his hat and bowed and then rode round
like time. he rode faster than most every one of them except Stone and
Stuart and Lee and Clifford and Belmont and Swift. i guess if Doc hadent
fit so hard in the war he wood have beat them all. and then Charlie
Gerish came out and all the townies hollered again and Charlie made his
legs go so fast that they coodent hardly see them, and jest before the
last time around his velosipede slipped and Charlie went fluking over
three settees. he jumped on his velosipede again and went around with
his britches all torn but he dident get around quite quick enuf to beat
Stone, then the townies yelled and said it was a cheat and the stewdcats
hissed, and some of the townies said they could lick the stewdcats, and
the stewdcats said they wasent man enuf and it looked as if there was a
going to be a row when Charlie Gerrish got up and said he was beat fair
and there wasent anything to get mad about, and that he would like to
shake hands with the stewdcat which beat him, and he wood like to race
him another time but he coodent then because he hurt his leg, and then
they shook hands and every one felt buly, and the stewdcats said hooray
for Charlie and the townies hollered hooray for Stone, and Bill Morrill
made a speech and give the prise to Stone and the band played and we
all went home. i bet Doc. Prey and Charlie Gerrish can lick any two
stewdcats in the hall.

Mar. 2. i went to a show in the town hall tonight. it was a singing show
called the haymakers. it was splendid. Mr. Gale got it up. they have
been practising all winter. Alice Gewell was a dary maid and Charlie
Lane was a katydid, and lots of others sung. it was splendid.

Mar. 3. Cloudy but no rane. went down to Langley's store for some juju
paste, saw a fite. Old Kize tried to arest Bill Hartnit and Bill lammed
time out of him and after a while old Swain came up and arrested him.

Mar. 4. Brite and fair. Went to church to-day, the fernace smoked so the
people had to come home. They say they will have it fixed before next
Sunday. i hope not.

Mar. 5. School closes tomorrow. i got kept after school tonight for
whispering to Cawcaw.

Mar. 6. School closed today and we voted for prises. Mr. Gordon give 4
prizes for the 2 best fellers and 2 best girls for the term. So we voted
for them. Most of the fellers wanted to vote for Jenny Morrison because
she was the prettiest girl there and can go the greeshun bend better
than enny girl in the school. and most of the girls dident like Jenny
Morrison and wanted to vote for Dora Moses and Mary Luverin, and the
girls wanted to vote for Lees Moses because he was polite to them and
rather go with the girls than the boys and we holler at him, but he can
fite for i saw him lick Gim Erly one day, and Gim Erly can rassle better
than enny one but Jack Melvil. well most of the fellows wanted to vote
for Tady Finton or Pop Clark or Skinny Bruce because they never get
mad or cry when they are licked and make lots of fun, but we knew they
coodent get the prize for they are all the time raising time and getting
licked and so we voted for Honey Donovan and Moses Gordon, and when the
votes was counted Dora Moses and Mary Luvering got the prizes for the
girls and Mose Gordon and Nigger Bell for the boys. That was all write
about Dora Moses and Mary Luverin because they was the best girls and
always went together, but we dident like it very well about Mose and
Nigger, only we thought that so long as Mose's father give the prizes
Mose ought to have one. i gess most of the girls must have voted for
Nig, because they was mad with Lees Moses. i know what they was mad at
too.

Then the first class give old Francis a present of some books and
when he turned over the leaves there was twenty dollars there, and old
Francis was surprised and made a fine speech, and the people all clapped
becaus he made such a good speech. i heard him saying it over the night
before when i was kept after school. No school for 2 weeks.

Mar. 7. When my father was a boy he was the best fiter in this town.

Mar. 9. Went down to Fatty Melchers today to make a violin, we cut a
piece of wood the shape of a violin then take some horsehairs and strech
them over a brige and you can play a tune on them. in school i learnt to
play on a piece of india rubber. you pull a piece of elastic out of your
congres boot and hold it in your teeth and pull it tite and snap it with
your fingers and you can play tunes that you can hear but no one else
can. old Francis saw me snapping the elastic and came and took it away.
i have got plenty more in my boot. i am saving money to buy me a cornet.
when i get enuf i am a going to play in the band. +++

Mar. 10. plesent day. old Si Smiths big white dog and a bull dog had an
awful fite today. neether licked and they had to squert water on them
to seperate them. they dident make no noise, only jest hung write on to
each others gozzles. my aunt Sarah said it was dredful, and she staid to
the window to see how dredful it was.

Mar. 11, 186- Went to church in the morning. the fernace was all write.
Mister Lennard preeched about loving our ennymies, and told every one
if he had any angry feelings toward ennyone to go to him and shake hands
and see how much better you wood feel. i know how it is becaus when me
and Beany are mad we dont have eny fun and when we make up the one who
is to blam always wants to treet. why when Beany was mad with me becaus
i went home from Gil Steels surprise party with Lizzie Towle, Ed Towles
sister, he woodent speak to me for 2 days, and when we made up he
treated me to ice cream with 2 spoons and he let me dip twice to his
once. he took pretty big dips to make up. Beany is mad if enny of the
fellers go with Lizzie Towle. she likes Beany better than she does enny
of the fellers and Beany ought to be satisfied, but sometimes he acks
mad when i go down there to fite roosters with Ed. i gess he needent
worry much, no feller isnt going to leave of fiting roosters to go with
no girls. well i most forgot what i was going to say, but after church i
went up to Micky Gould who was going to fite me behind the school house,
and said Micky lets be friends and Micky said. huh old Skinny, i can
lick you in 2 minits and i said you aint man enuf and he called me a
nockneed puke, and i called him a wall eyed lummix and he give me a
paist in the eye and i gave him a good one in the mouth, and then we
rassled and Micky threw me and i turned him, and he got hold of my new
false bosom and i got hold of his hair, and the fellers all hollered hit
him Micky, paist him Skinny, and Mister Purington, Pewts father pulled
us apart and i had Mickys paper collar and necktie and some of his hair
and he had my false bosom and when i got home father made me go to bed
and stay there all the afternoon for fiting, but i gess he dident like
my losing my false bosom. ennyway he asked me how many times i hit Micky
and which licked. he let me get up at supper time. next time i try to
love my ennymy i am a going to lick him first.

Went to a Sunday school concert in the evening. Keene and Cele sung
now i lay me down to sleep. they was a lot of people sung together and
Mister Gale beat time. Charlie Gerish played the violin and Miss Packerd
sung. i was scart when Keene and Cele sung for i was afraid they would
break down, but they dident, and people said they sung like night horks.
i gess if they knowed how night horks sung they woodent say much. father
felt pretty big and to hear him talk you wood think he did the singing.
he give them ten cents apeace. i dident get none. you gest wait, old man
till i get my cornet.

Went to a corcus last night. me and Beany were in the hall in the
afternoon helping Bob Carter sprinkle the floor and put on the sordust.
the floor was all shiny with wax and aufully slipery. so Bob got us to
put on some water to take off the shiny wax. well write in front of the
platform there is a low platform where they get up to put in their votes
and then step down and Beany said, dont put any water there only jest
dry sordust. so i dident. well that night we went erly to see the fun.
Gim Luverin got up and said there was one man which was the oldest voter
in town and he ought to vote the first, the name of this destinkuished
sitizen was John Quincy Ann Pollard. then old mister Pollard got up and
put in his vote and when he stepped down his heels flew up and he went
down whak on the back of his head and 2 men lifted him up and lugged him
to a seat, and then Ed Derborn, him that rings the town bell, stepped up
pretty lively and went flat and swore terrible, and me and Beany nearly
died we laffed so. well it kept on, people dident know what made them
fall, and Gim Odlin sat write down in his new umbrella and then they
sent me down stairs for a pail of wet sordust and when i was coming up
i heard an auful whang, and when i got up in the hall they were lugging
old mister Stickney off to die and they put water on his head and lugged
him home in a hack. they say Bob Carter will lose his place. me and
Beany dont know what to do. if we dont tell, Bob will lose his place and
if we do we will get licked.

Mar. 12. Mister Stickney is all write today. gosh you bet me and Beany
are glad.

Mar. 13, 186- brite and fair. Mr. Gravel has bought old Heads carrige
shop. he is a dandy and wears shiny riding boots and a stove pipe hat
and a velvet coat and goes with Dan Ranlet and George Perkins and Johny
Gibson and the other dandies. i went down today and watched Fatty Walker
stripe some wheels.

Mar. 14. clowdy. Elkins and Graves had an oxion to-night. Beany got ten
cents for going round town ringing a bell and hollering oxion. i went
with Beany and it was lots of fun. Beany wouldent treet. he says he
is saving money for something. i know what it is it is a valintine for
Lizzie Tole. it was mean of Beany not to treet becaus i did as much
hollering as he did.

Mar. 15. The funniest thing hapened to-day you ever saw. after brekfast
me and father took a walk and then went and set down on the big school
steps. father was telling me some of the things he and Gim Melcher used
to do. father must have been a ripper when he was young. well ennyway
while we was talking old Ike Shute came along through the school yard.
Ike wears specks and always carries a little basket on his arm. he cant
see very well, and father said to me, now you jest keep still and you
will see some fun and when Ike came along father changed his voice so
that it sounded awfully growly and said where in the devil are you going
with that basket, and Ike was scart most to deth and said only a little
way down here sir and father said, move on sir and move dam lively and
i nearly died laffing to see Ike hiper. well after a while i see Ike
coming back with old Swane and old Kize the policemen. i tell you i was
scart but father only laffed and said you keep still and i will fix it
all right. so when they came up he said to old Kize what is the trouble
Filander and he said Mr. Shute here has been thretened by some drunken
rascal, and father looked aufuly surprised and said that is an infernal
shame, when did it happen Isak, and Ike said about fifteen minits ago
and father said we have been here about as long as that and i dident see
the scoundrel. how did he look Isak, and Ike said i coodent see him very
well George but he was a big man and he had a awfu deep voice and father
said did he stagger enny and Ike said i coodent see wether he did or
not but i cood tell he was drunk by his voice. so old Swain and old Kize
went down behind the school house and off thru the carrige shop yard
to see if they cood find him, and me and father walked home with Ike to
protect him and father said now Isak if ennyone insults you again jest
come to me and if i can catch him i will break every bone in his body,
and father and Ike shook hands and Ike shook hands with me and then we
went home and father began to laff and laffed all the way home and then
he told mother and aunt Sarah and they said it was a shame to play such
a trick upon him and father laffed all the more and said Ike hadent
had so much exercise for a year and it wood do him good and give him
something to think about. ennyway they said it was a shame to teech me
such things, and father said he would rather i wood be tuf than be like
Ike, and Aunt Sarah said i never wood be half as good as Ike for he
never did a wrong thing in his life, and father laffed and said he
dident dass to for his mother wood shet him in the closet. it was
aufully funny, but i gess they was right. i shall never be half as good
as Ike. i wonder if old Swane and old Kize have caught that man yet.

cents, 3 ten cents scrips and five cents. i have got it in a bird cage.

Mar. 20. my squirrel got out of the cage last nite and father found him
in the water pail drownded. father got up in the night and got a dipper
and drank some water out of that pail, he dident eat any brekfast

then. i wonder if it was. ennyway 35 cents of my cornet money has gone

Mar. 25. almost as warm as summer, went to church and Sunday school.
Beany has got a job blowing the organ for Kate Wells. he only let the

he was doing Beany will lose his job if he does it again.

Mar. 29, 186- The toads has come out. fine warm day. me and Potter

and he said, keep still there is some one down stairs and mother said
dont go down George and father said, lissen i can hear him giving a
whistle for his confedrit, i will jump in and give him a whack on the
cokonut. i had forgot all about the toads and you bet i was scart. well
father he crep down easy and blowed out his lite and opened the door
quick and jest lammed round with his club. then i heard him say what in
hell have i stepped on, bring a lite here. then i though of the toads
and you bet i was scarter than before, mother went down with a lite and
then i heard him say, i will be cussed the whole place is ful of toads.
then mother said did you ever. and father said he never did, and it was
some more of that dam boys works and he yelled upstairs for me to come
down and ketch them. so i went down and caught them and put them out all
but 2 that father had stepped on and they had to be swep up. then all
the folks came down in their nitegounds and i went up stairs lively and
got into bed and pulled the clothes round me tite, but it dident do
enny good for father came up and licked me. he dident lick me very hard
becaus i gess he was glad it wasent a berglar and if it hadent been for
me it might have been berglars insted of toads.

off my close and looked me over rite before mother and aunt Sarah and
said well he aint spekled eny. then he said what have you given him
Joanna and mother said, nothing, and the docter said, all right give him
some more, and mother said i havent given him enything docter, and then
he walked around the room and picked up some things and looked at them
and then he gave me some of the wirst tasting stuff i ever took. then he
said i gess he will be better tomorrow, and then he looked at some more
things and went home. i dident sleep very well that nite but was auful
hot and my head aked fearful. mother was in my room every time i waked
up, and Sarah too. next day i had the docter again he looked at some
pictures and things and told mother to give me some more. i always feel
better when the docter comes in. he dont scare a feller to deth.

Well the next day i felt a little better and tried to sit up and have
my britches on, but i had to lay down again my head aked so, and after
awhile my head felt better and as i laid there i could look out of the
window and it seamed as if little chains that you could see through like
glass, were floating up and down they were about an inch long. well i
wached them till i almost went to sleep and jest as i was most asleep i
heard Beany out in the street holler, say Pewt, did you know that Plupy
is going to die, and Pewt said course i did, why dont you tell me some
news, and Beany said i heard he swalowed a peach stone and Pewt said it
was liver complaint, and then i heard some one say, you boys shet up.

Gosh you bet i was scart. i hadent thought of dying. i began to howl and
holler for mother. she came running in and i told her i was going to die
and i told her about breaking the gaslite and a lot of other things
and she told me the docter said i was getting better and i wood sit up
tomorrow. well i better then and wished i hadent told mother about the
gaslite becaus i knew she wood make me tell father. well mother set
by my bed all the afternoon and read me some out of Billy Bolegs, jest
think of her doing that, so when supper time came i et a lettle tost and
had some current jelly. when father come home mother told him about the
gaslite and all he said was i wood have to pay for it out of my cornet
money. i thought he wood keep me in for a month. i gess mother must have
talked to him.

That nite father slep on a lounge in my room. i went to sleep most as
soon as he come in. after awhile i dremp i was tied on a sawlog jest
going nearer and nearer to the saw and the saw was a going skratch-zoo,
skratch-zoo, skratch-zoo. well i tride to pull away but i coodent move
and i tride to holler and i coodent make a yip, and jest before the saw
sawed into me i woke up. gosh you bet i was glad, but the funny part was
that i could hear the saw going skratch-zoo, skratch-zoo, skratch-zoo,
and what do you think it was. it was father snoring. gosh you ought to
have heard him. well at first i laffed, but by and by i wanted to go to
sleep and father snoring so loud i coodent till mother came in and told
him to go to bed and she laid on the sofa all nite. the next day i set
up and had my britches on and set up to the window all day. i saw Beany
and Pewt and i nocked on the window and waved my claw at them. i am
going out tomorrow.

becaus i had been sick. i let my rooster out to fite J. Albert Clark's.
they were fiting good when i looked up and there was father looking over

spring.

Jenny Morison was a tuch me not and set in the top of a rock and
sung tuch me not, tuch me not let me alone. Nell Tole was a piny or a
sunflower i have forgot whitch. Jenny Morison and Keene and Nell Tole
are the best singers for their size in town. father thinks Keene can
sing the best. he feels pretty big about Keene. i told him so one day

Clark, that is J. Albert Clark says I sassed him but i dident. Beany had
been working for J. Albert raking up leaves in his garden. J. Albert
was a going to give him 10 cents for it and me and Beany was a going to
divide up on goozeberries and juju paist, but Beany dident dass to
ask J. Albert for his pay because he had raked all the leaves under J.
Alberts front steps and he was afraid J. Albert wood find out about it
and not pay him. Beany wanted me to ask him but i dident dass to because
i let my rooster out to fite J. Alberts last Sunday and J. Albert dont
believe in fiting roosters. last night he was setting on his steps with
some company and he had on his best lavender britches and his best blew
coat.

So Beany said, tell you what Plupy, you set on your steps and i will set
on my steps and we will holler across the street about the money that J.
Albert owes me. So Beany he went across the street to his steps and he
hollered over, hi there Plupy have you got any chink, and i hollered
back, no Beany i havent got a cent, and Beany he hollered i shood have
10 cents if J. Albert Clark wood pay me what he owes me, and i hollered
why in time dont he pay you, and Beany hollered i gess he hasent got any
chink, and i hollered he has probably spent all his chink in buying them
lavender britches, and Beany he hollered, well if J. Albert Clark needs
the money more than I do he can have it. well while we was hollering
mister Head and the Head girls who was setting on their steps got up and
went into the house laffing, and the company at J. Alberts all laffed,
and J. Albert came down and beckoned to Beany and Beany he went running
over to get his 10 cents and J. Albert he said, Elbridge, that is Beanys
name, Elbridge you cood have your money enny time if you had asked me
for it decently, but now i shall not pay you for a week and i shall not
imploy you enny more. Tell you what, Beany came over to my steps feeling
pretty cheap and we was talking about it when mother called me in and
sent me up stairs, and said she wood tell father as soon as he came
home. So i went up stairs and looked out of the window jest in time to
see Beanys father lugging Beany in by the neck. Well that nite after
father got home he jawed me and said i coodent go down town for a
week and made me go to J. Alberts right before the company and ask his
forgiveness, and Beany had to to. J. Albert was a pretty good fellow and
said it was all right, and dident want our fathers not to let us go down
town, but father said i must learn to be respectable to my elders. Gosh
we dident know J. Albert was a elder. We knowed elder Stevens and elder
Stewart and deacon Gooch and we always was respectable to them, and if
we had knowed that J. Albert Clark was a elder we woodent have sassed
him for nothing.

April 26. Yesterday and day before it was brite and fair, and yesterday
was as warm as summer. today, it was cold and it snowed a little. jest
enuf to make the ground look as if it was covered with salt. the birds
looked all humped up. i bet the frogs hind legs is about froze. it is
raining now. if i was a frog i woodent come out of the mud until summer.
perhaps they cant stay under more than six months.

April 27. Warm again. 2 eggs today. i have got another hen. Willyam
Perry Molton gave it to me. it is a leghorn and his other hens licked
it and made its comb bludy and so he gave it to me. it was on the nest
today but did not lay. i went to church. Mr. Cram preeched. he talked
all about birds and flowers and i liked it.

April 28. brite and fair. all 3 hens were on the nest but dident lay.

April 29. no eggs today. mother said the hens cackled all the morning.
brite and fair.

April 30. i dont see what the mater is with my hens. i havent got 1 egg
this week. father said there was a rat in the koop. i got a steel trap
of Sam Diar and tonite i set it in the koop. i put a peace of cheeze on
it. tomorrow morning i ges mister rat wont steal any more eggs.

May 1. what do you think. this morning i got up to get my rat and i
found that my best hen, the bolton gray that John Adams gave me had
tried to pick the cheeze out of the trap and the trap had caught her by
the neck and killed her. i felt most bad enuf to cry. i thought i cood
get up before the hen did. i went to the may brekfast today. it was
may-fair day and they had a brekfast. me and Pewt, Beany, Whacker
and Pozzy Chadwick, Micky Gould, Pop Clark, Prisilla Hobbs, Chick
Chick-ering, Potter Gorham, Pile Wood, Curly Conner and all the fellers
were there. we had a good time and et till just before school time and
we had to hiper so as not to be late.

May 2. no eggs today. both hens went on the nest. i am going to lay for
that rat with my bowgun.

May 3. what do you think. this noon i set in the hen koop 1 hour. the
brama went on the nest and set a while and came off and cakled, then i
looked and she had lade an egg. i left the egg there and hid behind a
barrel and got my bowgun ready for the rat. well the leghorn hen went on
the nest and i suposed she was a going to lay, but she broke rite into
that egg and began to gobble it up. i was so mad that i let ding at her
with the bowgun and just then she stuck up her head and the arrow took
her rite in the back of the head. well i wish you cood have seen her.
she hollered one little pip and then went rite out of the nest backwards
and flapped round awful. i picked her up and she was dead. i dident mean
to kill her, i only wanted to make her jump and learn her not to eat
eggs. O dear, i dont know what father will say when he finds it out.

May 5, 186- Saw a bully fite today. Cris Staples and Charlie Clark.
Charlie is visiting his uncle J. Albert Clark, the feller that we
sassed. that is he said we did but we dident. Charlie is a city feller,
he lives in Chelsy and think he knows a pile about things and gets mad
if we call him names. now every feller who amounts to anything has
a nickname, and some of them have 2 or 3. my nicknames are Plupy and
Skinny and Polelegs, and Beany is called Bullethead and sometimes Fatty.
i told Charlie that if i called him Charlie the fellers would call him
sissy or Mary and he better agree to let me call him bulldog or tomcat
or diddly or gobbler or some nickname whitch wood mean something. but
he said he would lam the head off of enny feller which called him names.
well you jest see what trouble he got into for not having a nickname. he
would have knowed better than that if he hadent lived in Chelsy.

Well today me and Charlie was setting on his steps. Beany was mad
because i was going with Charlie and he had gone riding with his father
and he felt pretty big because his father let him drive. well while we
were setting there along came Cris Staples who carries papers for Lane
and Rollins store, and Cris hollered over, hullo Polelegs. Charlie
hadent heard enyone call me Polelegs. and i said, i woodent stand that
if i was you Charlie, now less see you lam the head off of him, and
Charlie he started across the road and walked up to Cris and said who
in time are you calling Polelegs and Cris wasent going to back down and
said, you, and Charlie said jest drop them papers and i will nock your
face rite off, and Cris dropped his papers and they went at it. it was
the best fite i have seen this year. they fit from Mr. Head's down to
Gim Ellisons corner, and Cris licked time out of Charlie, and Charlie
began to yell and give up and then Cris let go of his hair and told him
he was to smart, and that it was me he was calling Polelegs and not him,
and he better not be so smart another time, and Cris he picked up his
papers and went off with a great slit in his jacket and his necktie
way round on one side, and Charlie came home howling and Aunt Clark,
Charlie's grandmother came out and said, that is what you get Charlie
for quareling. see how much better Harry feels, and i said, yes mam.
Charlie is never going to speak to me again.

May 7. Beany was pretty mad when I told him about the fite because he
dident see it. i gess he will find it don't pay to get mad with me. i
saw Charlie today but he dident speak. he has got a black eye. Cris has
got a funny looking nose on one side.

May 8. Chitter Robinson went in swiming today. i bet it was cold.

May 9. Went down to the high school yard tonite to hear the band play.
they have got a new leader a Mister Ashman of Boston. he can play the
cornet with 1 hand. i went down today to pay the gasman for the gaslite
i broke. it cost 1 dollar and i have only got 87 cents for my cornet.
sometimes i dont believe i shall ever get that cornet. Scott Brigam can
blow a bugle. a bugle is like a cornet only a cornet has 3 keys and a
bugle is all covered with flappers and curly things where you put your
fingers. Rashe Belnap can play a cornet splendid but he dont play very
often. Frank Hirvey plays one that goes over his shoulder way behind his
back. gosh i wish i cood get a cornet.

May 10. father has found out about my killing that hen. he dident get
mad but said i ought to have cut her head off and she wood be good to
eat, but i supose it is to late now for it is almost a week ago and i
burried her the next day.

May 11. me and Potter Gorham went mayflowering today. i got a bunch
and sold them to a student named Chizzum for 35 cents. i put it with my
cornet money. i have now got $1.22. i can get a cornet for 25 dollars a
second hand one. i am afraid i shall never get that cornet.

May 12. Rany last nite and this morning. in the afternoon it cleared up.
gosh i wish you cood see the licking Beany got tonite. me and Beany went
out to go up to see Pewt and make some sweet fern sigars. Beany came
over for me and went up to Pewts. on the way Beany went up an rung his
doorbell and we hid behind the fence and Mister Watson, Beany's father,
came out holding a light and shading it with his hand. the wind blew the
lite out and in going in again he hit his head an awful bump against
the door. me and Beany nearly died laffing only we tride not to laff
too loud. well we went up to Pewts and Pewt had been sent to bed for
something and so we started back and met a man who said is this you
Elbridge, it was pretty dark and Beany said yes and Mister Watson
grabbed us both by the collar and said, so you are the boys who rung my
doorbell and then he give Beany a rap on the side of the head and began
to shake him round lively and while he was shaking Beany up i put for
home. i hid behind the fence and i cood hear him say i will learn you
to asosiate with that misable Shute boy and wast your time ringing
doorbells, and Beany was saying, o father i will never do it again. i
nearly died laffing to hear Beany a rattling round on the sidewalk. i
hope Mister Watson wont tell father. i gess he wont for he gets over his
mad pretty quick. every time i think of Beanys legs flying round in the
air i giggle rite out and when i think of Mister Watson bumping his head
i nearly die. sometimes i think it pays to be tuff.

May 13, 186- Keene and Cele have got some new crokay slippers. you bet
they feel pretty big about it.

May 14. nothing particular today.

May 15. Went in swimming today. the water was pretty cold but i swum
acros the river twise.

May 16. the suckers have come. Potter Gorham caught three yesterday. me
and Potter was going yesterday after school but father woodent let me

May 17. the band played tonight. father made me go to bed at nine but i
cood hear it becaus my window is jest acros the road. they are playing a
new peace. it is the woodup quickstep, they say Ned Kendall cood play it
on a bugle better than ennybody. old Robinson cood and Mister Ashman can
play it splendid. it goes

 ta-ta tata, ta-ta tata, ta-ta tata
 tatatatatatata.
 ta-te-ta-te-tiddle iddle-a
 ta-te-ta-te-tiddle iddle-a
 ta-te-ta-te-tiddle-iddle-a
 tiddle-iddle-iddle-iddle-ata

it is the best peace they play except departed days. that always makes
me feel like crying it is kinder sad like. i hope i can get my cornet
some day.

May 19. had a auful toothake today and had to go down to docter Pitman
and he pulled it out. i tell you it hurt. Docter Pitman said the roots
must have reached way to the back of my neck. Beany went with me and
then told all round that i hollered. you jest wait Beany.

May 21. erly this afternoon me and Fatty Melcher got some real segars
at Henry Simsons store and went down behind old man Churchills store and
smoked them. we were both auful sick and laid there all the afternoon.
when i went home i walked wobbly and mother asked me if i was sick and
she put me to bed and was going to send for the docter, but father came
in and when he found out what aled me he laffed and said it served me
rite. then after supper he set out on the steps rite under my window and
smoked a old pipe and i cood smell it and i thought i shood die. then
mother asked him to go away and he laffed and said all rite, but he
gessed i had enuf for one day and she said she gessed so and i gess so
too. he said if it hadent made me sick he wood have licked me.

i dont see why it is so, father swears sometimes when he hits his thum
with a hammer and once when he was in the dark he was walking towards
the door with his arms out to feel for the door, one arm went on one
side of the door and the other arm on the other side and he hit his nose
a fearful bump rite on the ege of the door, and i wish you cood have
heard him swear, well if i swear he licks me, and he smokes and if i
do he says he will lick me and he dont go to church and if i dont go he
says he will lick me. O dear i gess i wont smoke enny more.

mouth open and give him a spoonful. when i let him go he kept his mouth
open and sorter sneezed pip-craw pip-craw pip-craw, and then he went
to the water dish and began to drink. i think he is better because he
hadent drank any water for 2 days before. he was still drinking when i
went away. i gess he will be a lot better tomorrow.

May 28. What do you think, this morning when i went out to feed my hens

and give out the tickets. i had a long string of names and every time
i wood leave one i wood mark out the name. i dident give the Head girls
any because they told father about some things that me and Beany and
Pewt did and the Farmer girls and the Cilley girls lived way up on
the plains and i dident want to walk up there, so when i went over to
Hemlock side to give one, i went over to the factory boarding house and

would go to the dance. some people was not at home and so i gave their

his glasses off and Nichols nocked Johnny Lord way acros the entry and
they was going to have a big fite when Bob Carter and 2 or 3 men stoped

all mixed up and father made me give back the dollar. but he told Johnny
Heeld he hadent ought to have let me try such a hard job. Gosh, i am

and sniffed once and said, whew, what a almity smell. then he held his
nose and went out and came back with mister Staples the father of the
feller that called me Polelegs. well he came in and put his nose up to
the wall and sniffed round until he came to where my old close hung.
then he said, thunder George, this is the place, rite behind this
jacket, it is the wirst smell i ever smelt. then he threw my close in a
corner and took out his tools and began to dig a hole in the wall, while
father and mother and aunt Sarah stood looking at him and holding their
nose. after he dug the hole he reached in but dident find ennything,
then he stuck in his nose and said, it dont smell enny in there. then
they all let go of their nose and took a sniff and said murder it is
wirse than ever it must be rite in the room somewhere. then father said
to me, look in those close and see if there is ennything there. so i
looked and found in the poket of my old jaket that big roach that i
lost, when i went fishing with Potter Gorham. it was all squashy and
smelt auful. father was mad and made me throw the jaket out of the
window and wont let me go fishing for a week. ennyway i know now what
became of my roach.

go rite up to mothers room and see the company. so i skined up to her
room holding my hand behind me becaus i had tore my britches auful
getting over a fence and i dident want the company to see. well what
do you think the company was. it was the homliest baby you ever see,
it looked jest like a munky and made feerful faces and kinder squeaked

out, but mother said she wanted to see me and she kissed me and asked me
to kiss the baby. i dident want to but i did it becaus mother was sick.
mother asked me how many fish i caught and what kind and i told her and
said she shood have some for her supper, but she said she gessed she

my leg. gosh you bet it hurt. me and Fatty got the hook out but it bled
some. the worst of it was there was a wirm on the hook and when we got

a swich and the other fellers get on the other end of the rope and the
feller nearest you has a bell and rings it and you pull and if you can
pull him up to you, you can paist time out of him with your swich, only
if you pull off your blindfole all the fellers can paist time out of

pull and the feller rung his bell and he came pretty hard at first but
i kept yanking and bimeby he come so quick that i nearly fell over back
wards and i felt him and grabed him and began to paist time out of him
when he grabed away my swich and began to paist me, and that wasent fair
and i pulled off my blindfole and who do you suppose it was, well it was
Wiliam Perry Molton and he was mad. they had tied me to his door bell
and i had yanked out almost ten feet of wire. when i saw who it was
gosh i began to holler and he stoped licking me. i gess he never licked
anyone before because he dident know just how to lay it on. well when
he found out how it was he let me go but he said he shood have to do
something about the boys distirbing him so. it was a pretty mean trick

Marsten and Tom Levitt, and he is a ripper to holler. and they want
father to make a speach. father says he must work for the party and
perhaps he can get his salery rased. so he has been a riting every nite
and mumbling it over to hisself and last nite he said he had got it.
tonite he is a going to speak it to us.

Aug. 22. last nite father studed his speach over and let us stay up
to hear it. he stood up and looked auful stirn and put one hand in the
buzum of his shert. i coodent help laffin, but he told me to shet up
or i cood go to bed and so i shet up. i tell you it was fine. It begun
Mister Moddirator had i supposed, or for 1 moment dremp that i a humble
offis holder under this glorious government, wood have been called upon
to speak, i shood have remained at home with my wife and my children.

i said, if you dont want to make a speach why dont you stay at home
that nite, and he said 1 more word from you sir and you go to bed. so i
dident yip again.

then he went on like this, were it not that a crool axident in my erly
youth, in my far away boyhood days prevented me from voluntearing and
desecrating my life to my countrys welfare, in the strugle jest ended
i wood have poared out evry drop of my blud to have maintaned her owner
and the owner of her flag. mother began to laff and said George how
can you tell such feerful stories, you know you were scart most to deth
becaus you was afraid you wood be drafted.

father said they was a lot of old fellows traveling round the country
and talking that way who coodent have been drug into the war with a ox
chane. then he stood on the other leg a while and said, it is peculiarly
aproprate that Exeter, the berth place of Lewis Cas, the educater of
Webster, the home of Amos Tuck, of General Marston shood be fourmost
in the party strife, and as for me i wirk only for my partys good, my
countrys good, without feer or hope of reward. they was a lot more to
it, and some of it you cood hear about a mile he hollered so.

Aug. 23. We are all going the nite of the rally. mother says she wont go
for she wood be ashamed to hear father tell such dredful stories. Aunt
Sarah dont want to go because she is afraid father will brake down. but
she has got to go with me and Keene and Cele and Georgie.

Aug. 24. father practised his speach tonite and we all hollered and
claped at the fine parts. he has got a new pair of boots. they hurt like
time and he only wears them nites when he is practising his speach.

Aug. 25. father licked me tonite becaus i spoke some of his speach to
Beany. he was auful mad and said i was the bigest fool he ever see. the
fellers have got up a Grant Club. Pricilla cant belong because he is a
demicrat.

Aug. 26. father called me and Beany out behind the barn tonite and gave
us 10 cents apeace if we woodent say anything about his speach. after
supper father practised again but he dident holler so loud becaus he was
afraid some body wood hear him and mother dident want him to wake up the
baby, and it was sunday too.

Aug. 27. it has been brite and fair all the week and hot as time. i have
to go to the river for soft water because it hasent raned eny since i
had to tip over the rane water barril. i have got a little tirtle as big
as a cent. father went down to General Marstons office tonite to arrange
about the rally. he came home and practised about an hour. i gess he
wood have practised all nite if the baby hadent waked up an hollered.

Aug. 28. we are all getting ready for the rally. Keene and Cele and
Georgie have got some new plad dresses. father has got a pair of gray
britches and a black coat. mother said the rally was a good thing
becaus it was the first time she had seen father dressed up since he was
married.

Aug. 29. they was a big thunder shower last nite. we all got up in the
nite and went into mothers room. mother sat on the fether bed and all
them that was scart cood set there. i wasent scart. father said it would
be jest the cussid luck to have it rane the nite of the rally.

Aug. 30. we had the last practise tonite, father put on his best close
and new boots and the girls had on their plad dresses and i had on a new
paper coller. we all set down and father came in and stood up. i tell

for 1 moment dremp, and then he forgot the rest. i tell you he was mad.
i wanted to laff but dident dass to. well after a while he remembered
and went through it all rite, and then he went over it 2 times more.
gosh what if he shood forget it tomorrow nite. he is going to wright
some of it on his cufs and he practised tonite making jestures so as to
bring his cufs up so that he cood read it.

Aug. 31. the rally is tonite. father woke us all up last nite hollering
in his sleep. he dremp about the speach. this morning he went to Boston
without eating his brekfast. i gess he is begining to be scart. i am a
going to make his boots shine today. gosh what if he shood brake down. i
gess i am getting a little scart too. brite and fair.

Sept. 1. Last nite father came home and the first thing he did was to
send me down to miss Pratts for his shert. it was all pollished and
shone like glass. then he asked if i had blacked his boots and then he
et supper. he dident eat much though. he said Mr. Tuck came down from
Boston with him. Mr. Tuck was a going to make a speach first and then he
was going to introduce Gim Loverin as chairman and then Gim Loverin was
a going to call on father. father said he bet 5 dollars he wood call him
Gim instead of mister modderator. father was pretty cross at supper. i
gess he was getting scart. the baby began to cry and father asked mother
why she dident choak the squawling brat and mother sorter laffed and
put the baby into fathers lap and said i gess you had better choak him.
father laffed and began to toss the baby up and down. he likes the baby
and while he was playing with it he was all rite. but after supper he
was cross and said he hed an auful headake. then he went practising his
speach again so as not to call the modderator Gim. well we got ready and
went down erly to get some good seats so as to hear father and see him
come in with them that was to set on the platform. we wanted to go down
with father but he said he coodent bother with us. but before we went he
came down stairs with his new close on and he looked fine but his face
looked auful white. he said he had a headake but as soon as he got
started to speak it wood all go off. so we went down. Cele had her hair
curled and Keene had a new red silk ribbon on her hair becaus her hair
wont curl and Aunt Sarah had on a new dolman with beeds on it and some
long coral earrings and they all looked fine. Aunt Sarah took Georgie by
the hand becaus she was the littlest and me and Keene and Cele followed
on.

When we got there the band was playing in front of the town hall and
aunt Sarah said i cood stay out and hear it and then said i cood sit
with Gim Wingit and Willy Swet if i wood behave. i said i wood and we
lissened and after the band went in we went too. most all the seats were
taken and we got some bully seats way up in front. i looked for father
but coodent see him becaus the speakers hadent come in. well jest as
soon as we got in the policeman was up in front and he said they has
been to much whisling and stamping and the next one that whisles or
stamps will get put out. well they was old Swane and Brown and Kize and
Dirgin and every body kept quiet. after a few minits the band began to
play hale to the chief and the speakers came marching up the middle ile.
i looked for father but he wasnt there. evrybody began to clap and stamp
and Gim and Willy asked me where my old man was. i stood up to see if he
was there and jest then i saw the policeman a rushing at me. he grabed
me by the collar and shook me round till i dident know which end my head
was on and he draged me down the ile and threw me out. as we were going
down the ile i saw Aunt Sarah running down the other ile as fast as she
cood go with her bonnet on the back of her head and Keene and Cele and
Georgie following along all bawling. she got out in the entry jest as
he was going to put me out of the front door and she grabed me away from
him and said you misable cowardly retch to treat a boy that way. he said
i whisled and she said he dident and you knew it only you dident dass
take ennyone else.

Then she told us to come home and we went home as fast as we cood all
bawling. when we got home mother was sitting up alone and aunt Sarah
started to tell her and Keene and Cele and Georgie all bawled and you
never heard such a noise, and father was in bed with a headake and
hollered out what in time is the matter. and she told him and i
heard him jump out of bed and in a minit he came out buttoning up his
suspenders. Mother said where in the world are you going George, and
he said things is come to a pretty pass if a boy cant go and hear his
father make a speach without being banged round by a policeman. i am
going down to knock the heads off every policeman there. and he reeched
for his vest. mother said George, dont you go near the hall, and father
said he cood lick anny 2 men on the police force easy and he would show
them how to slam people round and he reeched for his coat, and Keene and
Cele and Georgia began to bawl again to think he wood get hurt and aunt
Sarah and mother said you had better not go George, and father said he
wood give them more fun in 5 minits than they had seen in a political
rally in 5 years and he reeched for his boots and mother said what will
they think of you after you have sent word that you are too sick to
make a speach, to see you come rushing into the hall and go punching the
policemen and father had got on 1 boot and when she said that he began
to look kinder sick and said, thunder that is so. and then his headake
got wirse and he gave me a twenty five cent scrip and Keene and Cele and
Georgie ten cents each and he went to bed and so did we.

i wonder if his head aked really so he coodent make a speach or if he
was scart. i bet he was scart.

school commences monday. father hasent asked once about my diry, so i
aint going to wright enny more.




THIRTY YEARS (OR MORE) AFTER

On looking back over the pages of the "Diary" it appears to me that some
sort of an amende honorable is due to those citizens now living, and the
relatives and friends of those now dead, whose names have appeared in
the "Diary" and who have, so to speak, been handled without gloves. That
I have been neither mobbed, nor horsewhipped, nor sued, nor prosecuted,
but that I have enjoyed many a good laugh with--and have received many
pleasant words from--the victims, and their friends, is good evidence
that they, and their more fortunate brothers who have not been therein
mentioned, have taken the "Diary" in the very spirit in which it was
published, that of affectionate and amusing retrospect. And it is indeed
with affection that I recall those men, at that time in their prime.
That I could not then understand the reason why they did not fully enter
into and appreciate the spirit that prompted me and my boon companions
to transgress so many rules, laws, and statutes is not surprising. Boys
seldom can understand it. But, although I now fully appreciate it, I
often wonder at the spirit that prompted so many of those men in after
years to show me so many kindnesses, so much encouragement, and such
great forbearance.

So many inquiries have been made of me about that cornet, the
soul-filling ambition of my early years, that I feel that the
uncertainty in regard to that delightful instrument ought to be cleared
up. I never did save up enough money to buy a cornet. I haven't to this
day. But many years afterwards, when my ambition had been turned into
other and equally profitless channels, upon the death of a dear friend
his beautiful cornet was sent me. I have it now, as the neighbors and
the members of my family can testify fully and with deep feeling, if
called upon.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE

A good many years ago, during my college days, it was my custom and that
of my room-mate, Brown of Exeter, to make our room the gathering-place
for Exeter boys, both "stewdcats" and homesick Exeter youths then
filling positions in Boston. It happened that frequently undergraduates
from other towns and cities came in at these Saturday evening gatherings
and it was a matter of wonder to them that we had so much to talk about
in relation to our native town; and it was their frequent remark that
"either Exeter is a remarkable place, or you are a remarkably loyal set
of fellows."

That Exeter is a remarkable place is an axiom, and no better evidence of
the fact can be found (were evidence necessary to sustain an axiom) than
in the loyalty that every citizen displays, and the sincere love that
prompts every one who has ever come under the spell of our dear old town
to revisit her at every opportunity.

Where else could a diary of this nature, dealing with actual persons
and actual events, be published and be received with such absolute
goodnature and even enthusiasm by the persons now living who are
mentioned therein?

It is therefore with affection as well as amusement that I append
the following brief biographical sketches of persons mentioned in the
"Diary," preserving as nearly as possible the order of their appearance
in the book. As many readers of the "Diary" have expressed a desire to
know more of the subsequent histories and achievements of those therein
mentioned, it is hoped this information will satisfy a curiosity and
interest which, to a loyal son of Exeter, appear quite natural:--


1. Father. GEORGE S. SHUTE.

A native of Exeter. For twenty-six years a clerk in the Boston Naval
Office. Still living in Exeter, an old man with a young tongue; in fact,
the quickest man at repartee in Exeter.

of "Ethan Spike"; and TRISTRAM TALBOT, of Newburyport, with others
whom the writer does not now recall. A few years later the writer spent
several of his college vacations as deputy clerk in the same Naval
Office, and made pleasant acquaintances with all of the above-named men.
He found them very competent clerks, courteous gentlemen, and the best
story-tellers that he ever knew, and recollects those vacations as very

in the Custom House.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
