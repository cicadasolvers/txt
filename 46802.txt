FOREWORD


People having only casual interest in insects usually express amazement
when they learn how much is known about this most numerous group of
animals. However, while entomologists have good reason to take pride in
the accomplishments of their contemporaries and predecessors, they are
more likely to be appalled by how much remains to be learned. We are
indeed ignorant of even the identity of fully half and probably much
more than half the total number of insect species. Of those that have
been described, we have reasonably complete information about the
behavior and basic environmental relationships for only a comparative
few. The great majority of the remainder are known only from specimens
found in museum collections. Such information as we have about these
species usually amounts to no more than date and locality of collection.

This is true of the cockroaches, which now include approximately 3,500
described species. Conservative estimates based on partially studied
museum collections and the percent of new species found in recent
acquisitions, particularly from tropical and subtropical countries,
indicate that at least 4,000 species remain unnamed. Although the group
is well known in general terms to nearly all entomologists, there is an
almost complete void of information about all except the few domestic
species and, to a progressively diminishing degree, some 400 others.
Many details about the lives of even those that share man's habitations
are not fully understood. This then is a rough measure of how little is
known about cockroaches.

With the exception of mosquitoes and a few other comparatively small
groups of insects on which work has been concentrated, it is doubtful if
any other comparable segment of the world's insect fauna is better
known. Already an estimated 800,000 kinds of insects have been
described, and since this figure is generally regarded as less than half
the actual total, think what this means in terms of knowledge yet to be
assembled. No wonder entomology is a growing science with a promising
future, but the magnitude of the task also presents a serious obstacle
to progress. Progress can continue only if the scattered literature
resulting from the diversified labors of hundreds of contributors is
brought together and summarized in thorough and well-organized
compilations that can serve as a solid basis for future research.

The present work is such a compilation, for it assembles what has been
gleaned from approximately 1,700 sources, including correspondence with
a large number of other workers. Original observations during some eight
years of concentrated effort in U. S. Army Quartermaster research
laboratories are a valuable supplement to what others have done, and
with this background of experience the authors are especially well
qualified to appraise previous work. Seldom has a compilation been done
so thoroughly or a single large group of insects been the subject of
such uninterrupted effort.

The contents gives the categories of subject matter treated and the
introduction discusses the value of this assembled information and
offers suggestions for future study. No longer are cockroaches regarded
only as disagreeable pests; many species appear to be important,
actually or potentially, as carriers of disease. Recognition of this
importance has grown considerably, even in the period since World War
II. Consequently, anything that increases our knowledge of the basic
bionomics of cockroaches will be consulted widely for factual
information and for clues to new approaches.

In spite of this extensive compilation, the limitations of present
information about cockroach bionomics must be kept in mind. The cited
observations of many writers were fragmentary, or their conclusions
disagreed. But it is fundamental to scientific inquiry that we should
know and attempt to evaluate the results of previous study, and that is
what Drs. Roth and Willis have done. Fortunately, their review is
readily available. Sometimes, a piece of work fails to be of maximum
value because the results are not generally accessible to later
students. For this reason I am especially glad that the Smithsonian
Institution, by disseminating the results of the authors' labors, has
this opportunity to exercise one of its traditional functions--that of
diffusing knowledge.

Throughout the period of research by Drs. Roth and Willis at Natick, I
was in frequent correspondence with them, and I admire their many
accomplishments. Our warmest commendations should go not only to them
personally but also to those in administration who encouraged their
fundamental research and who aided in the financial support of this
publication.

I. INTRODUCTION


Recently we brought together much of the literature linking cockroaches
with the transmission of certain organisms that cause disease in man and
other vertebrates. In that paper (1957a) we concluded that cockroaches,
being potential vectors of pathogenic agents, should not be regarded
simply as minor annoyances. Obviously the associations of cockroaches
with agents of vertebrate diseases are of more immediate importance than
their relations with pathogens of lower animals or with nonpathogens. On
the other hand, cockroaches are of general economic as well as medical
importance, and their control is sought by many who are unaware of their
medical significance. That the control of domiciliary cockroaches is far
from satisfactory may be inferred from current entomological and
pest-control journals in which new insecticides are continually
advocated to replace others found to be inadequate. Possibly new
approaches to the control of cockroaches are needed. Whether these lie
in the direction of increased use of parasites and predators for the
biological control of these insects remains to be seen. In any event,
the more we know about any insect, especially its ecology, the greater
the likelihood of achieving satisfactory control. In order to advance
knowledge in any field of science, new research should proceed from the
results of prior investigations when these exist. We hope that the
observations and experiments cited herein may suggest areas for future
research and exploitation.

To the best of our knowledge no previous publication has brought
together the vast literature on the parasites, predators, commensals,
and other symbiotic associates of the Blattaria. For this reason, we
have tried to assemble observations on all such known associations.
Undoubtedly we have overlooked some records, as, for example, those
buried in papers dealing with other phases of cockroach biology. We hope
that such inadvertent omissions will not seriously impair the usefulness
of this compilation. Whatever its defects, this review should be a
unified source of information for all who are interested in the biotic
associates of cockroaches.

In addition to previously published information, this monograph also
contains original records and observations on the associations of
cockroaches that are reported here for the first time. Although some of
the observations were made by us, others were made by colleagues who
have graciously made their knowledge available to us in private
communications.


HISTORICAL

Chopard (1938) in his book _La Biologie des Orthopteres_ reviewed much
of the literature on cockroaches, but of the many biotic associations
that exist he discussed only the commensal cockroaches, gregariousness,
and familial associations. Asano (1937), who reviewed the natural
enemies of cockroaches, mentioned about 10 groups of animals that attack
cockroaches. Thompson (1951) in his _Parasite Host Catalogue_, which was
based mainly on papers abstracted or noted in the Review of Applied
Entomology, listed only 19 insect parasites of cockroaches. Eighteen of
these were Hymenoptera which attack only cockroach eggs; the single
dipteron listed (_Sarcophaga lambens_ Wiedemann, supposedly parasitic on
_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_) is not a parasite in this case, but deposits
its eggs on the dead insects (see p. 229). Cameron (1955) listed as
parasites and predators of the cockroach 24 species of hymenopterous egg
parasites, 7 species of _Ampulex_ which hunt nymphs and adults, 17
Protozoa, 13 nematodes, 5 bacteria, 2 mites, and a few other
miscellaneous predators. In his classified list of the protozoan
parasites of the Orthoptera of the world, Semans (1943) listed about 26
species from cockroaches. Linstow (1878, 1889) recorded 14 species of
helminths from cockroaches. Van Zwaluwenburg (1928) listed 33 names of
roundworms which are commensals or secondary parasites of cockroaches,
but some of these names are synonyms. La Rivers (1949) extended this
list with 13 additional species. Chitwood (1932) recognized 24 species
of nematodes which are primary parasites (probably commensals) of
blattids. Steinhaus (1946) gave many instances of biological
relationships between cockroaches and bacteria, fungi, and yeasts, but
the cockroaches were not discussed as an entity and the information is
scattered throughout the book.

In surveying the literature on this subject we have collected a far more
extensive list of animals and plants associated with cockroaches than
one might have expected from an examination of any one of the previous
papers on this subject. In our review of the medically important
organisms associated with the Blattaria, we pointed out that in addition
to many experimental associations cockroaches have been found to harbor,
naturally, 4 strains of poliomyelitis virus, about 40 species of
pathogenic bacteria, the eggs of 7 species of pathogenic helminths, and
to serve as intermediate hosts of 12 other species of helminths
pathogenic for vertebrates; cockroaches have also been found to carry,
on occasion, 3 species of Protozoa that are pathogenic to man and 2
species of fungi which are sometimes found associated with pathological
conditions.

In addition to the above organisms of medical importance, we have
compiled records of other organisms, nonpathogenic to vertebrates, which
are naturally associated in some way with cockroaches. None of the
following numbers can be considered absolute because some names may be
synonyms. However, we believe that these figures are very close to the
actual numbers of species that have been isolated because we have
attempted to refer all obvious synonyms to the currently accepted name
for each organism. On this basis there are about 45 species of bacteria,
40 fungi, 6 yeasts, 90 Protozoa, and 45 helminths that have been found
associated naturally with cockroaches. Of the arthropods there are about
2 species of scorpions, 4 spiders, 15 mites, 4 centipedes, and 90
insects. Of vertebrates there are 4 species of fish, 16 amphibians, 12
reptiles, 20 birds, and 27 mammals. Besides these there are many records
of experimental associations that have been contrived in the laboratory.

Some idea of the increase in our knowledge of the biotic associations of
cockroaches, during the last 70 years, may be gathered from a comparison
of the above figures with those of Miall and Denny (1886) who presented
"...a long list of parasites which infest the Cockroach." This list
included 2 bacteria, 6 Protozoa (some of the names are synonyms), 7
nematodes (some of these names are also synonyms), 1 mite, 1 wasp, and
1 beetle. In addition, they mentioned as other foes of the cockroach:
monkeys, hedgehogs, polecats, cats, rats, birds, chameleons, and frogs.


METHODS

We have listed the organisms known to be associated with cockroaches
systematically by phylum, class, order, and family. Within each family
the organisms are listed alphabetically by genus and species. Under each
organism the associated cockroaches are listed as natural or
experimental hosts, vectors, or prey. Identified cockroaches are listed
by the currently accepted name. Unidentified cockroaches are indicated
by the word "Cockroaches." The name of each cockroach is followed by the
country in which the observation was made, the authority for the record,
and with a few exceptions[3] pertinent biological information, where
this is known. Question marks following the names of organisms or
countries indicate tentative or questionable identifications.

Records of predators capturing and feeding on cockroaches in zoos and on
shipboard we consider natural, even though it is very likely that these
particular predators would not normally have access to this prey in
nature.

Experimental prey are cockroaches that were fed to predators in the
laboratory. Although these predators may have little, if any, access to
these cockroaches in nature, we have included such records to indicate
the relative acceptability of cockroaches as food by a wide variety of
animals.

Records of presumed or known cockroach associates that give no
information about an associated cockroach are not included in this
review, even though certain of these (e.g., species of _Ampulex_,
_Evania_, _Podium_) probably prey upon or parasitize cockroaches
exclusively.

The validity of a host-parasite or predator-prey record is dependent
upon the accuracy and knowledge of the observer. In assembling these
records we have had to accept, in most instances, the identifications of
species made by the original authors. However, as a result of our
studies on the biology of various species of cockroaches, including some
work on their hymenopterous parasites, we have questioned certain
records in the literature. Other dubious records which have been
perpetuated from one publication to the next, but which apparently were
not based on fact, have also been questioned or have been clarified with
the aid of specialists in particular groups.

Because the records cover a period of many years, the names of many of
the organisms as well as the names of some of the cockroaches have been
changed. Although it would have been comparatively simple to list the
names as they appeared in the original references, this would have
resulted in misleading redundancy with the same organism being
catalogued under several synonyms. We have attempted to list each
organism by its currently accepted name. However, no attempt was made to
prepare complete taxonomic synonymies; the only synonyms given are those
that identify the organisms by the names used by the authors of the
papers cited. The synonyms under which the cockroaches may have been
cited originally are listed in section II. The synonyms of associated
organisms are listed with each organism. Although authorities for the
name changes of the cockroaches are given, these workers are not
necessarily those who were initially responsible for the synonymies.
Various sections have been checked by specialists in the particular
groups. Although we have accepted name changes suggested by these
reviewers, we assume full responsibility for the names.


FUTURE WORK

After having examined thousands of references on cockroaches, we are
impressed by how little is known about the biology of most species. As a
conservative estimate there are 3,500 described species of Blattaria (J.
W. H. Rehn, 1951). In our literature survey we found records of biotic
associations for about 400 species. Unfortunately, many of these records
contain only a sentence or two of biological information. Our detailed
knowledge of cockroaches is based on studies of the few domiciliary
pests that man attempts to eradicate. Comparable studies of the
bionomics of the less-well-known species should add much valuable
information to our knowledge of this ancient group.

Our understanding of most predator-prey and parasite-host relationships
has barely progressed beyond the taxonomic stage. The total effect of
predators and parasites in limiting natural populations of cockroaches
remains to be determined. It is still not known how, for example,
predatory or parasitic wasps select specific cockroaches from among all
other insects. Secretions produced by certain cockroaches (e.g.,
2-hexenal by _Eurycotis floridana_) will ward off certain predators. The
identities and biological activities of most cockroach secretions are
unknown, but the use of protective chemicals against predators may be
widespread among cockroaches. If so, how effective are these repellents
in protecting the individual or the species? It is not known whether
cockroaches are protected by apparent mimetic resemblances to other
arthropods. There is no experimental proof that insect parasites can
successfully attack the eggs of cockroaches that incubate their eggs
while they are being carried by the female.

It is conceivable that biological control of cockroaches might be
achieved in limited areas such as man-made structures or sewers, but
this possibility has not been thoroughly explored. It would be
informative to know what effects, if any, organisms such as bacteria,
Protozoa (e.g., gregarines), intestinal nematodes, or other helminths
have on cockroaches. Possibly pathogenic microorganisms can be used for
biological control of cockroaches; this approach seems to have been
little explored.

Associations of colonial cockroaches (e.g., _Cryptocercus_ spp.) may be
truly familial or they may merely result from gregariousness. Newly
hatched nymphs of species that carry their oothecae until the eggs hatch
cluster near the mother. This may be a response to the mother as such, a
search for shelter beneath the nearest object (thigmotaxis? or negative
phototaxis?), or there may well be yet another explanation. Tepper in
1893 stated that the native cockroaches of Australia are almost wholly
carnivorous; little supporting evidence for this claim has been brought
forward since that time. The apparent supersedure of one species of
domiciliary cockroach by another may result from antagonism between
different species, or it may result from more rapid breeding and more
effective utilization of available food and space; but which? Several
species of cockroaches are frequently found associated with certain
plants (e.g., bromeliads and bananas); the ecological relations in these
associations remain to be determined. Many of the obscure associations
between cockroaches and other insects, spiders, birds, and burrowing
animals have never been adequately defined. The factors influencing
cannibalism have never been thoroughly investigated experimentally.
These are only a few ideas for future work that have occurred to us
during the preparation of this review. We hope that these suggestions as
well as other questions that may occur to readers will stimulate further
research in areas where it is obviously needed.

III. ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS


The ecology of extinct cockroaches is necessarily a highly speculative
subject. From the coexistence of fossil cockroaches and fossil plants in
the same geological stratum, one might conclude that there had been
intimate associations between them during prehistoric life. Heer (1864)
and Goldenberg (1877) suggested that Carboniferous cockroaches fed on
the plants with which they have been found as fossils. Scudder (1879)
concurred with this hypothesis. However, Bolton (1911), remarking on the
noticeable associations of blattoid wings with vegetable remains,
suggested that the cockroaches may have been partly carnivorous, feeding
on the snails _Spirorbis pusillus_, which were attached to the leaves of
_Cordaites_. Yet the proximity of fossil insects and plants in the same
geological formation is hardly proof of a similar association during
life. In fact, Sellards (1903), Bolton (1921), and Laurentiaux (1951)
have all pointed out that the cockroach remains, particularly the more
resistant wings, may have been washed into streams by heavy rains and
transported with drifting plant material to places where permanent
deposits were accumulating.

Some species of fossil cockroaches have long, well-developed
ovipositors, very unlike present-day cockroaches whose ovipositors are
small and nonprotruding. Brongniart (1889) and Zalesskii (1939, 1953)
have suggested that certain Permian and Carboniferous cockroaches with
long ovipositors may have inserted their eggs singly into trees and
other plants, rather than protecting the eggs with an ootheca. However,
Laurentiaux (1951), although conceding the possibility of egg laying in
vegetable material, suggested that oviposition into the earth is more
probable because of the unbending nature of the ovipositor.

Although the ecological associations of modern cockroaches should be
well known from direct observation, actually most species are still
little more than names on museum specimens, and our knowledge of them is
fragmentary. All too frequently ecological observations have been only
incidental to taxonomic or faunistic studies; yet the biological
information that is contained in such papers is all that we know of many
species. For this reason we have cited these observations in some
detail, especially when they were brief; longer accounts of cockroach
bionomics, of necessity, have been abstracted.

Very few exclusively ecological studies of insects have included
cockroaches. The native woodroaches (_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, _P.
uhleriana_, and _P. virginica_) of the northern United States were
included in ecological studies of the Orthoptera by Hubbell (1922),
Strohecker (1937), and Cantrall (1943). Fifteen species of cockroaches
were included in an ecological study of the Orthoptera of northern
Florida by Friauf (1953). The original papers should be consulted for
detailed descriptions of the habitats and accounts of the associated
plants and other Orthoptera.

In this chapter the cockroaches are grouped into those that have been
found in man-made structures and those that occur in other habitats.
Certain species may appear in several categories because they live both
indoors and out. The structural pests are divided into cockroaches that
occur in land-based structures, those on ships, and those in aircraft.
The nonstructural cockroaches are divided into those that occur in quite
specific habitats (caves, water, and deserts) and those that occur
generally out of doors. Nests of various arthropods serve as
microhabitats of commensal cockroaches; these latter associations are
discussed on pages 310-318.

In this chapter our discussion is limited to the physical environment
and specific habitats of cockroaches, and only very general references
are made to associated organisms. The relationships of cockroaches to
the biota are examined in detail in subsequent chapters. To show the
full extent of the associations, the associates, from bacteroids to
vertebrates, are arranged phyletically. These associate-centered
classifications serve admirably to relate various species of cockroaches
within common bounds, but fail to give an integrated account of the
total biotic relationships in the ecology of each species. Although
physically separated in this monograph, the many associates of each
species of cockroach should all be considered in appraising the ecology
of that species. To assist the reader to achieve this end, we have
included a checklist (p. 290) which serves as a convenient index to
certain organisms associated with particular species of cockroaches.


CAVE HABITATS

Caves, mines, and animal burrows are somewhat similar habitats that
provide many species of cockroaches with shelter and frequently with
food. The microclimates of these cockroach habitats have not been
described in detail in the papers cited, but it seems rather obvious
that natural caves, man-made caves (mines), and burrows offer relatively
stable temperatures and humidities and protection from adverse climatic
conditions. Although such cavernicolous animals as birds and bats
periodically leave caves to search for food, cockroaches find the
accumulated guano and animal and plant detritus an entirely adequate
dietary (Chopard, 1938). Cockroaches in mines presumably subsist on the
food and feces dropped by man and mine animals (e.g., pit ponies). Food
stored in their nests by burrowing animals is undoubtedly utilized by
the associated cockroaches.

Cavernicolous cockroaches show varying degrees of dependence on and
adaptation to these specialized habitats. Some of the common domiciliary
species (_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, and _Periplaneta
americana_) may have accompanied man into caves and remained there after
he left (Chopard, 1929a, 1936, 1938). Other species, from the paucity of
records noting their occurrence in caves, are undoubtedly accidental
inhabitants that may never become established. Besides these, however,
many other species of cockroaches have established large breeding
colonies in caves. Although some of the latter species show very
pronounced morphological adaptations to a cave life, many others
resemble their noncavernicolous relatives. The possible origin of
cavernicolous Orthoptera has been discussed by Chopard (1938).

Cavernicolous cockroaches have been segregated into four groups
according to their ability to adapt to their environment and the degree
of their specialized evolution (Chopard, 1936, 1938): (1) =Trogloxenes=:
Cockroaches that occur in caves in a sporadic fashion (the domiciliary
cockroaches and accidentals such as _Ectobius_ and _Heterogamodes_). (2)
=Troglophiles=: Cockroaches found habitually in caves (_Symploce_,
_Periplaneta cavernicola_). (3) =Guanobies=: Cockroaches that live in
the guano of cavernicolous vertebrates (_Gyna_, _Acanthogyna_,
_Dyscologamia_, _Pycnoscelus_). (4) =Troglobies=: Cockroaches that
apparently cannot live outside of caves and which show very marked
adaptive characters (_Alluaudellina_, _Nocticola_, _Spelaeoblatta_,
_Typhloblatta_). For complete discussions of these groups including
descriptions of the adaptive characters shown by certain genera, the
original sources should be consulted.

Although we know very little of the ethology of most of the
cavernicolous cockroaches, it is intriguing that three of the six known
species of _Nocticola_ are cave dwellers, two are inhabitants of termite
nests (p. 315), and one (_N. bolivari_) was found under stones and
cement blocks (Chopard, 1950b). In the rather extensive list of
cavernicolous cockroaches only two (_Arenivaga grata_ and _Parcoblatta_
sp.) were taken from caves in North America north of Yucatan. All other
records are from Africa, Asia, Central America, Europe, West Indies,
East Indies, and the Philippine Islands. This we find puzzling. Packard
(1888) in his extensive study of the cave fauna of North America listed
no cockroaches. Dearolf (1941) found only the above-mentioned
_Parcoblatta_ in one of 37 caves in Pennsylvania. Kohls and Jellison
(1948) listed no cockroaches among the arthropods from six bat caves in
Texas. We would expect _Periplaneta americana_ to inhabit mines in North
America, but we have found no such records. Have cockroaches been
ignored in fauna collections from North American caves, or has our cave
fauna been less extensively studied than that of other parts of the
world?

The two species of cockroaches found in mines (_Blattella germanica_ and
_Periplaneta americana_) are also found in caves. For this reason we
have included them in the list headed Cavernicolous Cockroaches. On the
other hand, the cockroaches found in animal burrows are generally
different species from those found in caves, so we have grouped these
together in a second list.


CAVERNICOLOUS COCKROACHES

=Alluaudellina cavernicola=

DESERT HABITATS

There is relatively little ecological information about cockroaches that
live in deserts, even though certain species, notably _Polyphaga
aegyptiaca_, have long been known to inhabit arid zones. In fact, so
little is known about the ecology of arid-zone insects in general that
it is more a subject for research than for review (Pradhan, 1957). In
their account of the cockroaches of Northern Kenya and Jubaland, Kevan
and Chopard (1954) describe in some detail the vegetational areas of
this arid desert or semidesert country, which averages only about 10
inches of rain per year. The other sources that are cited below contain
very little more biological information than the abstracted material
that is given under each species.

Nearly all the Polyphaginae are said to be marked xerophiles whose
distribution coincides with that of the deserts (Bei-Bienko, 1950). With
the exception of _Arenivaga floridana_, the species of Polyphaginae in
the United States all occur in the Southwest, where they are (with a few
exceptions) the only cockroaches that inhabit the desert regions proper
(Hebard, 1917). The Polyphaginae reach their greatest diversity in the
deserts of Northern Africa and Anterior and South-Central Asia
(Bei-Bienko, 1950). Some of the desert-inhabiting species have also been
found under nondesert conditions. This only further exemplifies the
plasticity of cockroaches in adapting to different environments.

The ability of desert insects to live under what appear to be extremely
unfavorable conditions has been abundantly illustrated by Pradhan
(1957). Uvarov (1954) has pointed out that a desert "covers a great
variety of landscapes, which provide desert animals with a wide range of
habitats, some of them offering very favorable conditions for life."
Pradhan (1957) stated that many desert animals avoid the extremes of
desert climates by choosing suitable microclimates for diurnal resting
places, that a permanent or temporary underground existence is very
common among insects in arid zones, and that many nocturnal Orthoptera
burrow into the soil or hide under stones where temperatures are lower.
For example, the type of _Parcoblatta desertae_ was found under a
boulder on the bare desert (Rehn and Hebard, 1909).

Symbiosis with burrowing animals is another solution to the problem of
existence in the desert; in fact, symbiosis is a mode of life adopted by
nearly half of the desert cockroaches about which we have any
information. Vlasov and Miram (1937) found _Polyphaga indica_,
_Polyphaga saussurei_, and _Arenivaga roseni_ in the burrows of rodents
and desert turtles. In the desert regions of Arizona, females of
_Arenivaga erratica_ were found commonly in burrows of the kangaroo rat
(Vorhies and Taylor, 1922) and in dens of wood rats and ground squirrels
(Ball et al., 1942). _Arenivaga apacha_ and _Arenivaga bolliana_ have
also been found inhabiting the nests of wood rats (Hebard, 1917; 1943a).
Bei-Bienko (1950) has suggested that the adaptation of desert-inhabiting
cockroaches to rodent burrows might enable these insects to survive in
the severe climatic conditions of deserts in summer.

Under desert conditions in southern Arizona, the relative humidity
outside of the burrows of the kangaroo rat is 1 to 15 percent during the
day and 15 to 40 percent at night; but inside the burrows the relative
humidity is 30 to 50 percent, and the temperature, even during the day,
is below 30 deg. C. (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1949). Thus by living in rodent
burrows during the day and going outside at night, the desert
cockroaches could avail themselves of the most favorable microclimates
obtainable. Presumably whatever food these insects eat provides them
with sufficient water to enable them to survive under desert conditions.
Bodenheimer (1953) has suggested that the extent of utilization of dew,
which is sometimes heavy in the desert, should be investigated; he
stated that tenebrionid beetles have been seen in the early morning
eating dry [dead?] herbs that were still wet with dew. It is obvious
that there is a need for additional detailed information without which
we can only guess about the ecology of desert cockroaches.

In the following list we have cited only those species that were stated
to have been found under desert conditions. Undoubtedly, related species
that have been taken in similar localities are also desert-inhabiting
forms, as, for example, other species of _Arenivaga_ that were collected
in Texas by Hebard (1943a). In the absence of specific information
linking such other species with deserts, we have arbitrarily relegated
those forms to the section on outdoor habitats. In addition to the
species listed below, desert cockroaches are said to be found in the
following genera: _Anisogamia_, _Mononychoblatta_, and _Nymphytria_
(Chopard, 1938).

_Caucasus._--The wingless female was found buried in sand and dust
(Burr, 1913).

_Turkmen S.S.R._--Although this species is secondarily encountered in
dwellings and courtyards, it is a very characteristic insect of the
Trans-Caspian deserts; the females are encountered fairly frequently as
inhabitants of sand, where they run slowly over the surface, or dig
themselves into the sand to continue their forward motion not far below
the surface (Fausek, 1906). Uvarov (_in_ Chopard, 1929b) indicated that

attached to sandy terrain.


=Polyphaga indica=

_Turkmen S.S.R._--This species prefers sandy soils where the nymphs,
alate males, and wingless females "swim" readily through the sand; they
can also be found in the burrows of desert animals (Vlasov and Miram,
1937).

semidesert areas south of Sahara; the apterous females probably live
buried in sand (Kevan and Chopard, 1954).


=Tivia obscura=

_Northern Kenya._--In desert grass and thorn bush (Kevan and Chopard,
1954).


AQUATIC HABITATS

The so-called aquatic or amphibious cockroaches are all members of the
subfamily Epilamprinae (Chopard, 1938). These forms are not nearly as
aquatic as water beetles or aquatic Hemiptera, but in their relations to
water they behave differently from nonamphibious cockroaches, which tend
to avoid water except for drinking. There are apparently no special
morphological characteristics that distinguish amphibious cockroaches
(Shelford, 1907, 1909a; Chopard, 1938), although Takahashi (1926) listed
several characters that he considered made _Opisthoplatia maculata_
adapted for an aquatic life: (1) Back of body easily wetted; (2) long
hairs on underside of thorax trap air; (3) terminal abdominal spiracles
open into tubes that extend rearward; (4) long hairs on ventral surfaces
of cerci "protect" terminal abdominal spiracles. Annandale (1906) also
suggested that the position of the posterior abdominal spiracles, at the
base of tubes that project rearward from beneath the seventh tergite,
are an adaptation to an aquatic life. However, as Shelford (1907) and
Chopard (1938) have pointed out, this same feature may be observed in
many terrestrial cockroaches. The legs of amphibious cockroaches are
similar to those of nonaquatic species and are not modified for swimming
(Shelford, 1909a; Takahashi, 1926).

Biological observations have been made on relatively few species, but
representatives of at least six genera occur in quasi-aquatic habitats.
Strictly speaking, these cockroaches live on land at the edges of
streams or pools and spend relatively brief periods in the water. A few
species are found in water-filled bromeliads. The behavior of the known
amphibious species of cockroaches in relation to their habitats is
discussed below.


AMPHIBIOUS COCKROACHES


=Audreia bromeliadarum=

_Panama._--These insects when disturbed would dive into the water that
had collected in the base of the bromeliad; they would disappear beneath
the surface and remain submerged for some considerable time (Caudell,
1914).


=Dryadoblatta scotti=

_Trinidad._--This species was taken from the leaf bases of _Tillandsia_
sp. at 3,100 feet; water had collected between the leaves and the insect
was presumed to be more or less amphibious (Scott, 1912). Subaquatic in
the bromeliad _Glomeropitcairnia erectiflora_: "This large and handsome
species [_D. scotti_] is very common in the larger, water-filled,
epiphytic bromeliads of the rain forest. Within these plants it is
usually to be found, often in considerable numbers, just above the
surface of the water or partly immersed in it. The cockroaches will
descend rapidly into the water when alarmed and probably obtain their
nourishment from the accumulated organic matter in the water. Floating
material is probably taken and it seems less likely that they feed below
the surface. They appear to be ovoviviparous." (Princis and Kevan,
1955.)


=Epilampra abdomen-nigrum=

_Puerto Rico._--Abundant in wet "malojillo" meadows. The nymphs swim
easily and remain under water for long periods, as do the adults (Sein,
1923; Wolcott, 1950).

_Panama._--A swimming nymph, captured in a dipper with mosquito larvae
in a lagoon of the Rio Chilibre, was kept under observations in an
aquarium. If disturbed, the insect dived into the water from floating
vegetation and swam rapidly below the surface for a minute or two.
Finally becoming quiescent, the cockroach would then cling to submerged
roots; twice it remained still for 15 minutes before climbing to the
surface, where it remained for five or more minutes before emerging
completely (Crowell, 1946).


=Epilampra annandalei=

_Lower Burma._--One male and three nymphs were collected in the Dawna
Hills by Annandale who made the following observations: "The wingless
specimens were under stones in a jungle stream and behaved just as the
one I obtained in Chota, Nagpur, did [Annandale, 1906]. The winged
specimen was under a stone at the edge of the stream, but swam readily.
It did not seem so much at home in the water, however, and apparently
could not, owing to the wings, raise the tip of its abdomen above the
surface." (Shelford, 1909a.)


=Epilampra= sp.

_Siamese Malay States._--Wingless females rested on floating logs from
which they would dive into the water upon the least disturbance; they
remained under water for several minutes, then surfaced beneath the
shelter of the log. In the jungle all females were taken either in the
water or among matted roots on the sides of the stream. Winged males
were seen rising from the surface of the water (Annandale, 1900).

_Sarawak._--All specimens were immature; they swam and dived well, but
were soon drowned if prevented from rising to the surface to breathe.
"When at rest the body of the cockroach is almost entirely submerged,
the tip of the abdomen alone projecting above the surface of the water;
the abdomen moves gently up and down and every 30-40 seconds a bubble of
air issues from the prothoracic spiracle on each side." (Shelford, 1901,
1916.)

_India._--A nymphal female, found in a jungle stream at Chota Nagpur,
could swim with belly or back upward. When held under water it drowned
in a few minutes. The tip of the abdomen was held out of water
(Annandale, 1906).

Shelford (1907) has suggested that the immature stages of terrestrial
species of _Epilampra_ may well be amphibious. This is an area that
could profit by more field observations.


=Opisthoplatia maculata=

_Formosa._--Invariably found under or between rocks near mountain
streams. The wingless adult and the nymph have similar habits. Normally
the cockroach lives on land, and when it goes into the water it returns
to land within a few minutes. This cockroach rarely swims, but when it
does, it maintains its body in a horizontal position just below the
surface of the water. Ordinarily, it walks on the river bottom or on
water-covered rocks. This insect feeds on decayed leaves and, according
to Shikano, it will eat human feces. (Takahashi, 1926.)

This species has a large number of long hydrophobic hairs on the ventral
sides of the thorax and anterior abdominal segments. When the insect
submerges, air is trapped in these hairs. The thoracic and one pair of
abdominal spiracles open into the bubble of trapped air. However, the
insect apparently does not use this plastron of air to replenish its
tracheal air supply, but, like _Rhicnoda natatrix_ (see below), it
inspires air while at the surface through its posterior abdominal
spiracles and expires air into the bubble under the thorax. While the
insect is submerged, the air bubble increases in volume until part of it
breaks away and floats to the surface. (Takahashi, 1926.)


=Opisthoplatia orientalis=

_Formosa._--Lives on or in swampy ground (Takahashi, 1924).


=Rhicnoda natatrix=

_Sarawak._--Immature cockroaches were found in sodden leaves at the edge
of a pool, where they rested for hours at a time. Generally the fore
part of the body was in the water but the tip of the abdomen was always
in air. When disturbed the insects dived into the water and hid under
sticks and stones on the bottom. Air is inspired through the posterior
abdominal spiracles, when they projected above the water surface, and
expired through the thoracic spiracles. In experiments in which the
insects' abdomens were held immersed in water, with the thorax exposed,
the insects died in 6 to 12 hours or less. (Shelford, 1907.)


=Stictolampra buqueti concinula=

_Westsumba._--Found under moist fallen leaves on gravelly shore of
Melolo River. The nymphs distinguished themselves through their
amphibious mode of life and were often good swimmers (Princis, 1957a).


=Unidentified epilamprines=

_Brazil._--These cockroaches were found under stones at the side of a
rocky stream at Ouro Preto. When disturbed they ran down under the
surface of the water and hid under stones at the bottom. When thrown on
the water surface, they were helpless, and to get beneath the water
surface they had to walk down some object. When they had penetrated the
surface film they could swim freely. Specimens kept in jars lived
several days with only a portion of their abdomens exposed to the air.
(Bristowe, 1925.)


OUTDOOR HABITATS

This category is a catchall for all cockroaches that are not limited to
the more circumscribed habitats that have been previously considered.
Some cockroaches in this section select specific microhabitats (e.g.,
_Cryptocercus_ spp., which live exclusively in rotten logs; and
_Neoblattella dryas_, _N. eurydice_, and _N. grossbecki_ in bromeliads).
Others are found in a wide variety of habitats (e.g., _Ischnoptera
deropeltiformis_ and _Parcoblatta_ spp.). But some species are so little
known that their actual habitats are barely suggested in the collection
data.

Williams (1941) made an ecological study of the floor fauna of the
Panama rain forest. He found Orthoptera (nearly all were unidentified
nymphal cockroaches) in the litter of dead leaves, twigs, and other
plant products in over 90 percent of the quadrats he examined. These
insects represented about 0.25 percent of the total animal population.

Delamare Deboutteville (1948) made a quantitative study of the animal
population in suspended soil that had accumulated between the roots of
forest epiphytes of the lower Ivory Coast. He analyzed 2 dm.^3 samples
of soil from an epiphyte located 45 meters above ground on a main branch
of _Parinarium_, with these results: _Horizon A._--Superficial zone of
large rootlets, 6 cm. deep: 2 cockroaches, 4 arachnids, and 4 beetles.
_Horizon B._--Zone of fine rootlets, 6 cm. deep: 6 cockroaches and
numerous other arthropods. _Horizon C._--Humid zone, 8 cm. deep: 7
cockroaches and numerous other arthropods. Plants, such as _Palissota_,
were also living in this very original biotype.

The species of cockroaches listed below have been found in the following
kinds of outdoor microhabitats: In jungle, forest, and woodlands they
have been found in rotten wood; under bark of living, dead, and fallen
trees; in decay cavities in trees; burrowing in living bark; on foliage
of trees, shrubs, bushes, and low herbage; on vines and in bromeliads
and epiphytic ferns; under signs on trees and stumps; in piles of logs
and firewood; under dead leaves and debris; in and under decaying fruit
on the ground. Cockroaches have been found between the leaves and under
leaf sheaths of sugarcane, corn, and other grasses; under dry fibers and
fronds of coconut trees; in hollow stems and bases of tree-fern fronds;
under bracts of banana blossoms and in bunches of bananas (p. 146).
Cockroaches also inhabit abandoned cocoons and larval tents, wasp nests,
ant nests, termite nests, bird nests, rat nests, and burrows of other
rodents (pp. 23-25, 310-319). Cockroaches have been found in rock
crevices and under rocks; under boards and other objects on ground;
under seaweed, drift, and other debris on beaches; burrowing in soil and
under clods of earth; in marshes and swamps; in dumps and rubbish
heaps.

The above list does not exhaust the available outdoor microhabitats that
cockroaches find suitable for their continued existence, but it is
fairly representative. Although we have no measurements to substantiate
this conclusion, we suggest that the microhabitats cited above have a
more constant temperature and a relatively higher humidity than is
provided by the surrounding macrohabitats. We would expect insects such
as cockroaches, whose water balance is dependent on a continuous supply
of fluid water or moist food, to seek moist environments or to avoid
situations in which their transpiration might increase. Deviations,
presumably brief, from this expected behavior must occur to account for
the cockroaches that are found under relatively unfavorable
environmental conditions. Despite the apparent preference for cryptic
habitats, some cockroaches are found in hot sunlight (_Ellipsidion_
spp.; Tepper, 1893); Rehn (1945) has stated that many kinds are diurnal
rather than nocturnal. Movement of cockroaches between habitats may be
assumed to occur; but movement from an unfavorable environment to a more
favorable one, following a shift in water balance, has not been observed
in nature; however, laboratory experiments suggest that the mechanism
for mediating such behavior is present in some species of cockroaches
(Gunn and Cosway, 1938; Roth and Willis, 1952a). Obviously, additional
research is needed on the bionomics of all species. Further conclusions
based on current limited knowledge can only be speculative and possibly
misleading.

epiphytic fern, _Asplenium nidus_, although the species lives mainly in
bamboo bushes (Karny, 1924).


=Cryptocercus punctulatus=

_North Carolina._--"They were never found except in parts of the logs
[chestnut] where the decayed wood was soft, punky and wet" (Rehn and
Hebard, 1910).

_Appalachian Mountains, U.S._--In southern Virginia and eastern
Tennessee, it is usually quite abundant in well-forested areas at
elevations from 3,000 to 5,000 feet; "sometimes even a majority of the
dead logs on a mountain side have roaches in them" (Cleveland et al.,
1934). This cockroach not only lives in rotten, dead logs but also in
sound logs that have been down only a few years. In Virginia it is found
more often in chestnut and hemlock. "It occurs fairly often in oak, and
has been found in pine, spruce, and arbor vitae.... There is little
evidence that they ever leave the log and enter the ground" (Cleveland
et al., 1934).

=Diploptera punctata=

_Hawaii._--"Crowds of these insects in various stages of development
sometimes gather in cypress trees, in suitable chinks, in old flowerhead
sheaths of palms, etc., and even more or less openly on leafy twigs, in
bunch grass, and the species is at times locally abundant behind the
older leaf bases of sugar cane" (Williams et al., 1931). Williams also
lists the following as food plants: _Cryptomeria_, algaroba, lime trees,
ripening mangoes, papayas, and oranges. However, Bianchi (personal
communication, 1954) doubted that any of the above are the main dietary,
because the largest populations he had seen "were found in the fairly
dry litter of Star Jasmine (_Jasminum pubescens_ Willd.), well removed
from any of the plants mentioned by Williams."

feather-grass steppes, where it is found in associations of typically
steppe vegetation, with feather grasses at the head (_Stipa lessingiana_
and others), and on rocky slopes; it occurs frequently in cultivated
fields of young crops and also in young geological strata in sections
with virgin soil. The populations of this steppe cockroach average 6 to
8 individuals per square meter from the middle to the end of July. By
the end of summer most individuals were observed at the bases of straw

(Bei-Bienko, 1950).


STRUCTURAL HABITATS

In this category we include all man-made structures, whether inhabited
by man or not, that may become infested with cockroaches. A
nonexhaustive list of such structures would include dwellings,
restaurants, mess halls, barracks, groceries, markets, bakeries,
dairies, drug stores, department stores, hotels, hospitals, warehouses,
mills, factories, packing houses, animal houses, breweries,
incinerators, privies, sewers, sewage treatment plants, ships, aircraft,
etc. Although dwellings are only one of the many kinds of structures
that are colonized by cockroaches, the several species that have adopted
this mode of life are generally referred to as domiciliary cockroaches.
This term is adequate only if we remember that these cockroaches are not
restricted to domiciles but are pests in other structures as well.

Associations between man and certain species of cockroaches possibly
started as casually as the short-lived association that Beebe (1953)
observed when he discovered three cockroaches in the newly built couch
of an orang-utan. Obviously, when man came down from the trees, his
fellow travelers found his cave dwellings and other abodes particularly
favorable habitats. From such primitive beginnings, domiciliary
cockroaches have spread into every kind of structure that man has since
devised. We predict that when man develops a suitable vehicle,
cockroaches will someday accompany him into space. Yet despite the
apparent predilection of certain species of cockroaches for man, man is
only incidental to these associations. Only the shelter and food that
man unwittingly provides for these unwelcome guests attract cockroaches
to him; man's physical presence is unnecessary.

Most, if not all, of the common domiciliary cockroaches apparently
originated in the Tropics or sub-Tropics from whence they have spread,
through normal commercial channels, into most of the inhabited world. At
least eight domiciliary cockroaches originated in Africa (Rehn, 1945):
_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, _Leucophaea maderae_,
_Nauphoeta cinerea_, _Oxyhaloa buprestoides_, _Periplaneta americana_,
_P. australasiae_, and _Supella supellectilium_; and, perhaps,
_Periplaneta brunnea_ as well; _Neostylopyga rhombifolia_ was probably
of Indo-Malayan origin; _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ was of oriental
origin; and _Leurolestes pallidus_ was endemic in the West Indies (Rehn,
1945). Princis (1954a) rejected Africa as the original home of _Blatta
orientalis_ and advanced reasons for placing its origin in Central Asia.

Several domiciliary species have become well established in temperate
zones and some even in the Arctic. Bei-Bienko (1950) listed the
following 10 species as sinanthropes in the Palearctic zone: _Blatta
lateralis_, _B. orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, _Leucophaea
maderae_, _Periplaneta americana_, _P. australasiae_, _Polyphaga
saussurei_, _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, and _Supella supellectilium_. In
the warmer parts of the temperate regions, as in their native Tropics,
certain domiciliary species breed outdoors as well as indoors. In the
less temperate extensions of their ranges most domiciliary species are
nearly always found indoors. In regions with low winter temperatures
these cockroaches do not survive in unheated structures; but in heated
buildings _Blattella germanica_, for example, has been able to withstand
the rigorous climate of Alaska, where it has caused severe infestations
(Chamberlin, 1949).

The limiting factors that determine whether man-made structures will
provide suitable habitats for cockroaches are favorable temperature and
availability of water and food. The range of temperatures that man
provides for his own comfort and protection fosters the rapid increase
of cockroach populations indoors. Gunn (1934, 1935) has demonstrated
that the preferred temperature range (zone of indifference) of _Blatta
orientalis_ is 20-29 deg. C. The upper limit of the preferred temperature of
_Blattella germanica_ and _Periplaneta americana_ is 33 deg. C. (Gunn,
1935). The lower limits of temperature tolerance were not sharply
defined in Gunn's work. However, less than optimum temperatures, if they
last for only short periods, are not necessarily lethal. The 24-hour
mortality for _P. americana_ that had been held for one hour at 0 deg. C.
was only 2+-2 percent (Knipling and Sullivan, 1957). Gunn (1934) observed
that _Blatta orientalis_ would not settle at temperatures above 33 deg. C.
and would react violently against higher temperatures (e.g., 39 deg. C.) by
running away; thus the thermotactic behavior of cockroaches might be
presumed to bring them into favorable environments within structures.
Thermal death points have been determined for the above three species by
Gunn and Notley (1936).

It is common knowledge among those who rear cockroaches experimentally
that, unless the water content of the food is high, fluid water is
essential in the insects' dietary. Ten species of domiciliary
cockroaches have been shown to be unable to survive as long on dry food
alone as they could on food and water at 36-40 percent relative
humidity (Willis and Lewis, 1957). _Blatta orientalis_, when in a state
of normal water balance, usually spent more time in the drier part of a
humidity gradient; but desiccated insects tended to become hygropositive
(Gunn and Cosway, 1938). We presume that other domiciliary species
behave similarly. If water is available nearby, it may be presumed that
partially desiccated cockroaches could locate a source through the
mediation of a humidity sense. Hygroreceptors have been demonstrated on
the antennae of _Blattella germanica_ (Roth and Willis, 1952a) and
suggested for _Blatta orientalis_ (Gunn and Cosway, 1938).

Drinking water is available to cockroaches in the traps of sinks, wash
basins, tubs, and toilet bowls; in flush tanks; as condensation on cold
pipes, flush tanks, and windows; around leaking pipes and faucets; as
spillage; in miscellaneous water-filled containers, such as pet drinking
dishes, aquaria, vases; empty beverage bottles; and drainage from ice
boxes. Soft, juicy fruits and vegetables can provide both moisture and
food. There seems to be a tendency for certain species (_Blatta
orientalis_ and _Blattella germanica_) to become established in the more
humid parts of structures, such as basements, around sinks, and in
bathrooms. Whether this is a reaction to a preferred humidity or merely
a fortuitous aggregation near sources of drinking water and food has
never been clearly demonstrated. The rather widespread dissemination of
these species into zones of low as well as high humidity suggests that
detailed studies of the microclimatic conditions of structural
microhabitats will be needed before meaningful conclusions can be drawn
about the stratification of cockroaches within structures according to
species.

In nearly all structures infested by cockroaches, food of some kind is
available, either in the structure itself or nearby. This may be the
food stored by man for his own use or the use of kept animals; it may be
crumbs, food spillage, garbage, or excreta; glues and pastes on cartons,
boxes, stamps, envelopes, labels, and wall paper; sizing on cloth and
book covers; various dried animal and plant products; dead insects;
living plants; etc. In fact, it is almost impossible, despite good
housekeeping, to keep any structure used by man free of all food
suitable for cockroaches.

That the requisite temperature, water, and food are provided, more or
less adequately, by a variety of structures is attested by the
innumerable infestations of cockroaches that develop when control
measures are relaxed. Within structures the accessibility of certain
harborages to cockroaches probably depends on the habits of the species
and to some extent on their size. Similar types of harborages in
different structures may be used by the same species, although there
seems to be some overlapping by different species into the same kinds of
daytime shelters. The comparative ecology of domiciliary cockroaches has
not been thoroughly investigated, so any interpretation of observational
data is necessarily speculative and inconclusive at this time. Our
discussion on pages 324 to 343 is also pertinent to this section.


LAND-BASED STRUCTURES

Dwellings provide a variety of microhabitats that are acceptable to
cockroaches. It has been stated that old houses, or houses that have
many cracks and crevices, or have basement kitchens that are not kept
clean and in good repair are particularly liable to invasion by
cockroaches (Laing, 1946; British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951). Although
this statement is undoubtedly true, it has been our personal experience,
as well as the experience of others, that new, clean, and well-planned
houses and apartments are also easily and sometimes quickly invaded by
cockroaches. Mallis (1954) has cited the following places that are
frequently infested by cockroaches in homes. In the kitchen, cockroaches
are found in and around sinks, in cupboards above and below sinks, under
tables and chairs, in stoves, around breadboards, in utility cabinets,
in kitchen closets, under linoleum, behind, under, and inside
refrigerators and iceboxes. In living rooms cockroaches are found in
furniture, studio couches, sewing machines, closets, and bookshelves;
behind picture frames, pennants, calendars, and other wall ornaments. In
bathrooms cockroaches are found in and behind utility cabinets and
toilets; they may be found in wicker clothes hampers, in brooms and
mops, and in door hinges. Ordinarily, cockroaches are not found in
bedrooms unless they are abundant elsewhere in the dwelling. Additional
harborages are cited under specific cockroaches in the list below.

In markets DeLong (1948) found the German cockroach in bags of potatoes
and onions, in crates of citrus fruits, in pads and shredded papers in
banana boxes, and in cases of bottled beverages. The insects were
attracted by coffee and crawled into the folds of coffee bags. They were
found in cartons of canned goods; in bread and baked goods; in cartons
of packaged cookies, cakes, and crackers. Packaged cereals were
attractive, and cockroaches were sometimes found in packages of
cigarettes. The insects occurred in scales (by the hundreds) and in cash
registers. Rather heavy infestations were found under stainless-steel
cappings that covered wooden arms on the fish cleaning stand. The
insects were numerous in display cases where they were warm and
sheltered. They were also found behind mirrors above produce racks, in
electrical switch boxes and conduits, and in telephone boxes, as well as
generally in cracks and behind loose moldings or loose wall boards.
Enclosed boxlike tables were frequently heavily infested.

In restaurants cockroaches may be found in the following places:
Crevices in wood, plaster, concrete, and metal; in the bar; in the
kitchen and in the associated equipment; in cupboards, lavatories, and
garbage storage areas; and on the undersides of chairs and tables
(Mallis, 1954).

In drug stores Frings (1948) found cockroaches behind the mirror and
between the sink and the cooler. Thousands were found in hollow
ornamental shelf edging. The hollow bases of malted-milk dispensers and
drink mixers were cockroach havens.

In a hospital Frings (1948) found cockroaches in decorative trim around
doorways, by the thousands in wicker laundry baskets, and in incubators
for premature babies. In military hospitals we have seen cockroaches
(_Blattella germanica_) in kitchens and dining halls in the usual hiding
places mentioned above and on the undersides of stainless-steel serving
tables.

In department stores cockroaches have been found in food departments,
beauty salons, rest rooms, dressing rooms, linen departments, and
stationery departments (Anonymous, 1952). The infestation in the linen
department was traced to clean towels which, when returned from the
laundry, contained at least 500 cockroaches per bundle. The insects were
carried into the rest rooms and beauty salon when the towels were
distributed.

The microhabitats of cockroaches in privies and sewers have not been
studied. These habitats are particularly important in view of the
demonstrated migrations of cockroaches from sewers into dwellings and
the possible dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms from feces to
food. The reader is referred to our 1957(a) paper for a summary of the
known information on cockroach dispersal from sewers.


COCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH LAND-BASED STRUCTURES

Most of the cockroaches listed below are either known domiciliary
species or they have been found one or more times in houses or other
man-made structures. The known structural pests breed within the
building. Certain other species, which have been observed only
infrequently in structures and are not known to breed there, may
possibly be incipient pests; these latter species may attain future
economic importance if they establish breeding colonies within a
structure. A few species have undoubtedly wandered indoors by accident.
It is difficult to decide whether a particular species was an accidental
invader or whether it was attracted indoors in response to some
stimulus. Only additional information will provide the desired answers.


=Aglaopteryx ypsilon=

_Trinidad._--Male found indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955).


=Allacta similis=

_Hawaii._--Found only indoors at Nauhi. Otherwise this is apparently an
outdoor species (Swezey and Williams, 1932).


=Blaberus craniifer=

_Cuba._--Household pest (Deschapelles, 1939). Particularly abundant in
houses in Santiago and Havana (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).

_Florida._--Under boards in woodshed (Rehn and Hebard, 1912, 1914).


=Blaberus discoidalis=

_Ecuador._--In eating places (Campos R., 1926).

_Hispaniola._--In houses (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).

_New Jersey._--In greenhouse (Weiss, 1917).

_Puerto Rico._--In homes (Sein, 1923). In fruit stores (Wolcott, 1950).


=Blatta lateralis=

_Central Asia._--Household pest, often found in homes with clay floors
(Bei-Bienko, 1950).

_Turkmen S.S.R._--Males and females occurred in dwellings (Vlasov,
1929).


=Blatta orientalis=

This species is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917; Rehn,
1945). It is reported to occur particularly in basements and crawl
spaces under basementless houses (Mallis, 1954). In damp basements where
food is available large colonies are not unusual, but it also may infest
offices and apartments several floors off the ground (Gould and Deay,
1940). The number encountered on upper floors is seldom large, but the
frequency of occurrence may reach 30 percent of the observations (Spear
et al., _in_ Shuyler, 1956). In supermarkets this species hides during
the day inside concrete blocks or cracks in the foundation, under
furniture, or behind cartons; it is conspicuous on the floors of the
markets at night (De Long, 1948). In Great Britain the kitchen is
preferred by this pest (and by _Blattella germanica_); they shelter
beneath steam radiators and gas stoves, behind hot-water pipes,
underneath furniture and floor coverings, sinks and baths; basements and
underground kitchens are especially likely to be infested (Laing, 1946;
British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951). Goodliffe (1958) noted that _B.
orientalis_ may travel long distances to find food.


=Blattella germanica=

This species is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917; Rehn,
1945). It is one of the commonest insects in homes and restaurants
(Gould and Deay, 1940). It is found in kitchens, larders, bathrooms,
furnace rooms, and storage rooms of bakeries, breweries, hospitals,
barracks, as well as dwellings, where, during daylight, it hides behind
cupboards, furniture, hanging pictures, panels and skirting boards, in
cracks around drains, water pipes, electric wires, and hot-water and
steam heating units (Wille, 1920). The German cockroach may be found in
cracks around baseboards, pipes, conduits, sinks, and drawers; behind
cabinets; inside switch boxes and refrigerators; on under surfaces of
tables, chairs, and shelves; between stacks of stored goods, and in
almost every place that is not readily observed (Kruse, 1948). We have
also seen this species packed in electric-clock cases and loud-speaker
baffles, in cash registers, and clinging to the undersurface of
stainless-steel steam tables. The infestation of markets by this species
has been described above. Very narrow cracks provide refuges for the
German cockroach. Wille (1920) found first-instar nymphs in cracks 0.5
mm. wide and adult males and females without oothecae in cracks 1.6 mm.
wide.

Shuyler (1956) has observed extensions into relatively new structural
habitats by _Blattella germanica_ in the north-central area of the
United States. A few German cockroaches are now being encountered in
living rooms, bedrooms, clothes closets, bedroom furniture, lobbies,
entrance halls, checkrooms, nonfood storerooms, nonfood warehouses, and
coin-vending machine repair shops. In these situations this species is
behaving much like the brown-banded cockroach, _Supella supellectilium_.


=Blattella schubotzi=

_Cameroon._--Five specimens in a house (Princis, 1955).


=Blattella vaga=

_U.S.A._--Although this is mostly an outdoor species, during dry seasons
it may temporarily enter houses in great numbers, occasionally breeding
indoors in Arizona (Flock, 1941a). Two adults were collected indoors in
Texas (Riherd, 1953).


=Chromatonotus notatus=

_Trinidad._--A male was found indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955).


=Cutilia soror=

_Hawaii._--Almost as common in houses as _Neostylopyga rhombifolia_
(Hebard, 1922).


=Ectobius duskei=

_U.S.S.R._--Frequently occurs in living apartments in farming localities
as an accidental inhabitant (Bei-Bienko, 1950).


=Ectobius pallidus=

_Massachusetts._--A summertime pest in houses along coast (Gurney, 1953;
E. R. Willis, personal observation). Generally an outdoor species.


=Epilampra abdomen-nigrum=

_Trinidad._--Male, indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955). An outdoor species
generally.


=Ergaula capensis=

_Cameroon._--A male taken in a house (Princis, 1955).


=Eublaberus posticus=

_Trinidad._--Indoors, feeding on bat feces (Princis and Kevan, 1955).


=Eurycotis floridana=

_Florida._--Occasionally found in homes (Creighton, 1954; Roth and
Willis, 1954a).


=Euthyrrhapha pacifica=

_Hawaii._--Found outdoors and indoors where it breeds in neglected
cupboards and in rubbish (Fullaway and Krauss, 1945).


=Holocompsa azteca=

_Mexico._--Household pest (Ball et al., 1942).

=Holocompsa cyanea=

_Costa Rica._--One specimen in house (Rehn, 1906).


=Holocompsa nitidula=

Apparently domiciliary in American Tropics (Hebard, 1917). In houses
under chests, etc., Cuba (Gundlach, 1890-1891); Puerto Rico (Gundlach,
1887). In folds of burlap bag, Florida (Rehn and Hebard, 1914).


=Ischnoptera rufa occidentalis=

_Panama._--Thrives about human habitations under litter, though not
domiciliary (Hebard, 1920).


=Ischnoptera rufa rufa=

_Jamaica._--In hotel. "While hardly a domiciliary form it would seem to
frequent environments where man has considerably disturbed natural
conditions, as under debris, docks, under logs and stones in cultivated
areas" (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).


=Leucophaea maderae=

_West Indies._--In habitations, warehouses, and other structures; "At
times it is a very abundant and serious pest" (Rehn, 1945). In Puerto
Rico it was also found in fruit stores, markets, and inns (Sein, 1923;
Wolcott, 1950).

Reported as a domiciliary pest in Madeira (Heer, 1864); Windward Islands
(Marshall, 1878); Tropics and sub-Tropics (Rehn, 1937); Philippine
Islands (Uichanco, 1953); New York City (Anonymous, 1953; Gurney, 1953);
Trinidad (Princis and Kevan, 1955). This species is also established in
coastal Brazil, Central America, all the Greater Antilles, several other
tropical islands, and tropical Africa, where it probably originated
(Rehn, 1945).


=Leurolestes circumvagans=

_Hispaniola, Grenada._--Largely domiciliary (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).


=Leurolestes pallidus=

_Cuba._--All over island, in houses, under lockers, etc. (Rehn, 1945;
Gundlach, 1890-1891).

_Florida._--Rehn and Hebard (1914).

This species has been recorded from various islands in the West Indies,
from Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil (Rehn, 1945).


=Methana marginalis=

_Australia._--Reported entering houses (Pope, 1953a).


=Nauphoeta cinerea=

_Australia._--In hospital (Mackerras and Mackerras, 1948). In dwellings,
grain stores, and fowl-feeding pens (Pope, 1953).

_Sudan._--Domiciliary in huts of the Shilluk natives; fairly widely
distributed in eastern Africa (Rehn, 1945).

_Hawaii._--In feed rooms of poultry plants (Illingworth, 1942).

_Florida._--Established in feed mills around Tampa (Gresham, 1952;
Gurney, 1953).

The wide distribution of this species from East Africa, where it
originated, to the Orient and the New World was undoubtedly mediated by
shipping (Rehn, 1945).


=Neoblattella= sp.

_Puerto Rico._--Observed [as _Blatta caraibea_, Rehn and Hebard (1927)]
in houses (Gundlach, 1887).


=Neostylopyga rhombifolia=

Domiciliary in Indo-Malaya and New World Tropics (Rehn, 1945);
Philippine Islands (Uichanco, 1953); and Hawaii (Hebard, 1922).


=Oxyhaloa buprestoides=

Presumably to some extent domiciliary, as it evidently spread from
Africa to the New World via slave ships (Rehn and Hebard, 1927; Rehn,
1945).


=Panchlora nivea=

_Colombia._--A male and a female taken in a dwelling (Princis, 1946).
This is primarily an outdoor species which is frequently taken indoors
as an adventive on bananas (see p. 150 for references).


=Parcoblatta fulvescens=

_Florida._--Males found in laboratory and dormitory buildings,
ostensibly attracted by lights (Friauf, 1953).


=Parcoblatta lata=

_Connecticut._--Domiciliary pest (Moore, 1957). Generally an outdoor
species.


=Parcoblatta notha=

_Arizona._--It may occasionally be a nuisance in houses (Ball et al.,
1942).


=Parcoblatta pensylvanica=

_U.S.A._--Country houses often badly infested, Indiana (Blatchley,
1920). Frequently taken in houses in wooded areas, Michigan (Hubbell,
1922). Infestation by males, females, and nymphs on fourth floor of
building, South Dakota (Severin, 1952). Houses in wooded areas infested
by nymphs and occasionally by adults (Gould and Deay, 1940).

_Canada._--Pest in summer cottages in Ontario (Walker, 1912).


=Periplaneta americana=

This is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917; Rehn, 1945). It
is common in restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and where food is
prepared or stored; it was trapped regularly in the basement and upper
floors of store buildings, and it was also found in all heated parts of
an old meat-packing plant (Gould and Deay, 1938). _P. americana_ was
numerous in latrines in Iran (Bei-Bienko, 1950) and in privies in Texas
(Dow, 1955) and Georgia (Haines and Palmer, 1955). Large numbers of this
species also occur in sewers adjacent to human habitations (Roth and
Willis, 1957a).


=Periplaneta australasiae=

Generally domiciliary, but also occurs outdoors in the West Indies (Rehn
and Hebard, 1927). It is a very abundant domiciliary pest in tropical
Africa and tropical America (Rehn, 1945); Ecuador (Campos R., 1926);
Puerto Rico (Sein, 1923); Philippine Islands (Uichanco, 1953); Australia
(Pope, 1953).

Also occurs as a pest in greenhouses in Pennsylvania (Thilow and Riley,
1891); France (Giard, 1900); Italy (Boettger, 1930); Great Britain
(Laing, 1946; British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951).


=Periplaneta brunnea=

Circumtropical domiciliary pest which is apparently more nearly peculiar
to the Tropics and adjacent regions than _P. americana_ (Hebard, 1917).
This species has been trapped in significant numbers in privies and
dwellings in Georgia (Haines and Palmer, 1955). It is the species of
_Periplaneta_ present in homes in San Antonio, Texas (Mallis, 1954).


=Periplaneta fuliginosa=

_U.S.A._--Frequently encountered out of doors, but has been reported
common after dark about a hotel in Alabama and was captured in a house
in Louisiana; it was also extremely abundant on the wharves at night in
Jacksonville, Florida (Hebard, 1917). As a domiciliary pest it was, next
to _Blattella germanica_, the most common cockroach inside homes in
southwest Georgia, where it was also the most common cockroach in
privies (Haines and Palmer, 1955). This species has become a very common
domiciliary pest in Texas (Eads, personal communication, 1955). It
infested a greenhouse for five years in Indiana (Gould and Deay, 1940).


=Periplaneta ignota=

_Australia._--It occurs in dwellings occasionally (Pope, 1953).


=Phaetalia pallida=

_Colombia._--Three specimens from three dwellings (Princis, 1946).

_Trinidad._--Male indoors; male and female at light (Princis and Kevan,
1955).


=Plectoptera dorsalis=

_Puerto Rico._--According to Gundlach (1887) it enters houses at night
attracted by light (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).


=Polyphaga aegyptiaca=

_Iraq._--Common in houses (Weber, 1954).

_Caucasus._--Winged male in kitchen (Burr, 1913).

_U.S.S.R._--Listed as a sinanthrope (Bei-Bienko, 1950).


=Polyphaga saussurei=

_South-central Asia._--One of the commonest domiciliary species
(Bei-Bienko, 1950).


=Pseudophoraspis nebulosa=

_East Indies._--This species is sometimes difficult indoors (Karny,
1925).


=Pycnoscelus surinamensis=

A household pest in the East Indies (Karny, 1925); Philippine Islands
(Uichanco, 1953); Tanganyika (Smith, 1955); Trinidad, eight records
indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955). It is also a greenhouse pest (Hebard,
1917; Zappe, 1918; Doucette and Smith, 1926; Saupe, 1928; Roeser,
1940). Common in or around chicken batteries and yards in Hawaii
(Schwabe, 1949).


=Supella supellectilium=

Domiciliary wherever distributed (Rehn, 1945), this species is
especially difficult to control because of its apparently nonselective
dispersal throughout dwellings. For example, Mallis (1954) observed in
Texas that it was widely distributed throughout the apartment and was
probably the most common cockroach seen in the bedroom; its favorite
harborages were beneath and behind corner braces on kitchen chairs,
underneath tables, behind pictures and other objects on walls, and in
shower stalls; its oothecae were commonly fastened on walls and ceilings
throughout the house. Gould and Deay (1940) reported that this species
prefers high locations, such as shelves in closets, behind pictures, and
picture molding; oothecae were found about kitchen sink, desks, tables,
and other furniture, and even in bedding. Hafez and Afifi (1956) stated
that the adult wanders in nearly all rooms of the house and only visits
the kitchen when searching for food; it hides in cupboards, pantries,
closets, bookshelves, drawers, and behind picture frames; the nymphs
normally hide in the corners of drawers, behind frames, and in similar
situations.


=Symploce bicolor=

_Puerto Rico._--In houses, Sardinera Beach, Mona Island (Ramos, 1946).


=Symploce hospes=

_North American Tropics._--Domiciliary, but not exclusively so, and
apparently widely distributed (Hebard, 1917). In Florida, as
_Ischnoptera rufescens_, found in a greasy cupboard (Rehn and Hebard,
1914).

_Hawaii._--Illingworth (1915).


SHIPS

Sailing ships have long been notorious for their unwelcome hordes of
cockroaches, and it was by ship that at least 11 domiciliary species
migrated from their centers of origin to other parts of the world (Rehn,
1945). Over 40 nondomiciliary species have been carried by ship from the
American Tropics to other parts of the world in cargoes of bananas (p.
146). In addition to these, other adventive cockroaches appear from time
to time in ports to which they have been carried by ships. Yet by far
the most numerous cockroaches on shipboard are the breeding populations
of a few common domiciliary pests. Except in the most rigorously
disinsectized ships, this commerce in cockroaches has continued to the
present day.

Cockroaches undoubtedly infested the first ships that sailed the
Mediterranean; of these we have no records. The earliest recognizable
record of cockroaches on shipboard is Moffett's (1634) statement that
when Drake captured the ship _Philip_, he found it overrun with
cockroaches [_Blattarum alatarum_]. Bligh (1792) described disinfesting
H.M.S. _Bounty_ with boiling water to kill cockroaches. Chamisso (1829)
reported that he had seen ships casks, in which rice or grain had been
stored, that were found to be filled with _Blattella germanica_ when
opened. During a voyage from England to Van Diemen's Land, Lewis (1836)
was greatly annoyed by hundreds of cockroaches flying about his cabin at
night; the most numerous resembled _Periplaneta americana_ and another
was similar to _Ectobius lapponicus_. This latter was undoubtedly _B.
germanica_, which is the only ship-infesting species that resembles the
feral _E. lapponicus_. Lewis continued, _P. americana_ "were in immense
profusion, and had communication with every part of the ship, between
the timbers or skin. The ravages they committed on everything edible
were very extensive; not a biscuit but was more or less polluted by
them, and amongst the cargo 300 cases of cheeses, which had holes in
them to prevent their sweating, were considerably damaged, some of them
being half devoured and not one without some marks of their residence."

Kingsley (1870), Kellogg (1908), Gates (1912), Heiser (1936), and
Bronson (1943) have all reported that cockroaches were so numerous on
ships that they gnawed the skin and nails of the men on board. These are
all independent observations of what may well have been a common
occurrence on ships. We have discussed in detail the subject of
cockroaches biting man in our 1957(a) paper.

Mosely (1892) reported, "At the time that England was left the ship
[H.M.S. _Challenger_] seemed nearly free of animals, other than men,
dogs, and livestock required for food. The first cockroaches apparently
came on board at St. Vincent, Cape Verdes.... Cockroaches soon became
plentiful on board, and showed themselves whenever the ship was in a
warm climate.

"At one period of the voyage, a number of these insects established
themselves in my cabin, and devoured parts of my boots, nibbling off all
the margins of leather projecting beyond the seams on the upper
leathers."

Sir Edmund Freemantle (1904) recalled some of his experiences in the
British Navy. "Cockroaches in the tropics were also terrible scourges.
One saw little of them in fine, dry weather, but in damp, wet weather
they seemed to come from every hidden corner ... our remedy in the
'Spartan' was to make the boys catch them--on pain of being caned....
One brig, the 'Lily,' was so overrun by cockroaches that the officers'
clothes smelt of them."

The quotation from Sonan (1924) on page 348 describes similar conditions
in the Japanese Navy.

On modern cargo ships cockroaches are reported to be extremely numerous
in the galley, the crew's quarters, and sometimes in the holds; they
dwell in hot, humid environments such as the casing around steam pipes
(Monro, 1951). Williams (1931) reported that _Blattella germanica_ was
the most important cockroach pest on ships seen at New York. Although
often numerous in the holds, the cockroaches as a rule congregated in
living quarters. They were also frequently found between tarpaulins
covering the hatches. It was not unusual to kill 20,000 to 50,000 in the
forecastle, and more than 20,000 have been taken from a single
stateroom. Simanton (1946) inspected the S.S. _William Kieth_ when it
berthed at San Francisco from a 10-month voyage to the South Pacific.
The holds were infested with thousands of _Periplaneta americana_, but
in the crew's quarters, mess halls, and storerooms _B. germanica_
predominated. After insecticidal treatment about 2,000 _P. americana_
were seen in each hold and as many as 24 _B. germanica_ in each cabin.
Richardson (1947) reported that in Army transports inspected between
1943 and 1946 at New York, _P. americana_ was found in the galleys and
messes, and occasionally heavy infestations were found deep in the
holds; _B. germanica_ was found in the galleys and messes; _Blatta
orientalis_ was found only in the hold.

Additional references indicating the presence of _Blattella germanica_
on ships may be found in the account of its parasite _Ripidius
pectinicornis_ (p. 232). Although Rice (1925) and Williams (1931) cite
_B. germanica_ as the most numerous cockroach on ships, Brooke (1920)
stated that the great majority of ship cockroaches were _Periplaneta
americana_. In addition to citing cockroach infestations on ships, the
following authors reported various methods for disinfecting ships:
Canalis (1916), Pryor (1918), Brooke (1920), Rice (1925), Williams
(1931), Simanton (1946), Richardson (1947), and Anonymous (1951, 1954).


COCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH SHIPS

In the following list we include some previously unpublished data on
cockroaches that were recovered from ships at the Miami, Fla.,
Quarantine Station for the periods November 1945 through May 1946; May,
June, August, and September 1950; and 17 July 1957 (Porter, personal
communication, 1958). These data were lumped, without breakdown to
species, under the entry Orthoptera in Porter (1958).

Certain of the species listed below occur only accidentally on shipboard
and will probably never establish breeding colonies on ships or become
pests on shipboard or elsewhere; some were merely passengers between one
land-based colony and another. Others, the truly domiciliary pests, are
as likely to be pests on shipboard as they are in land-based structures.

AIRCRAFT

Michel (1935) stated that the development of air transportation brought
the same insect dispersal problems that exist in land and water
transportation; in addition, the problem of cockroach infestation had
become a very serious one, quite aside from the hygienic point of view,
because it had been discovered that these insects seek out the wings of
airplanes, where they subsisted on the glue and dope used in airplane
construction. However, Dethier (1945) found no cockroaches in dismantled
or wrecked wing and tail structures of metal aircraft in central Africa.
In fact, all-metal aircraft would seem to provide little in the way of
food or water for stowaway cockroaches.

Laird (1951, 1952, 1956a) found living specimens of _Blattella
germanica_, _Periplaneta americana_, and _Periplaneta australasiae_ in
baggage compartments and/or kitchens in aircraft. Other species which
have been recovered from undisclosed spaces in aircraft are listed
below. Some of the cockroaches that were reported as dead may not have
died from exposure during flight but may have been killed by insecticide
applied by inspecting personnel at the airports.


COCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT

In the following list we include some previously unpublished data on
cockroaches that were recovered from aircraft in Miami, Fla.,
International Airport from 1 July 1956 through 30 June 1957 (Porter,
personal communication, 1958). These data were lumped under the entry
Orthoptera without breakdown to species in Porter (1958).

Species reported by Hughes (1949), and cited below as from southern
United States, were recovered from aircraft that arrived at Brownsville,
Fort Worth, Miami, New Orleans, and San Juan. There was no way of
linking a specific record with any particular city.

encountered on ships apply with equal validity to similar species found
on aircraft.

IV. CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSOCIATIONS


Asano (1937) classified the natural enemies of cockroaches into two
types as follows:


     1. Enemies that feed mainly on cockroaches (certain ripiphorid
        beetles and certain chalcid, evaniid, and ampulicid wasps).

     2. Organisms which, in their search for food, devour cockroaches
        that may be encountered (certain species of scorpions, spiders,
        ticks, centipedes, Strepsiptera, ants, birds, rats, and
        "parasitic bacteria").

Cameron (1955) arranged the associates of cockroaches in two groups as
follows:

     Group A. Parasites and predators.

       1. Parasites: Hymenoptera (Evaniidae, Eulophidae, Eupelmidae,
            Encyrtidae, Pteromalidae, Cleonymidae) and Coleoptera
            (Ripiphoridae).

       2. Predators: Hymenoptera (Ampulicidae), Hemiptera (Reduviidae),
            Coleoptera (Dermestidae), Arachnida (Araneae, Acarina).

     Group B. Parasites and symbionts.

       1. Protozoa (including examples of both parasites and
            commensals).

       2. Nematoda (including both primary "parasites" and secondary
            parasites).

       3. Bacteria (including the mutualistic bacteroids).

       4. Algae [_Arthromitis_ (= _Hygrocrocis_) _intestinalis_; see p.
            124].

Asano's arrangement, although essentially true, is limited; Cameron's
system is divided into arthropods (group A) and lower forms (group B),
but does not include higher animals. Both attempts at classification
need amplification; this we have endeavored to do below.

In classifying the biotic associates of cockroaches, we were immediately
confronted with a problem in semantics. The concepts parasitism,
predatism, and symbiosis have all been used with various shades of
meaning by different authors. The problem is not solved merely by
accepting as authoritative specific definitions, however apt they seem
to be, because, unfortunately, these concepts are not mutually
exclusive. For example, among the entomophagous insects, as Sweetman
(1936) has pointed out, there can be no definite line of separation
between parasitism and predatism: the two intergrade, only the extremes
being quite distinct. In fact, Andrewartha and Birch (1954) generalized
these relationships by calling both categories predatism. These authors
divided natural populations of associated organisms into nonpredators
and predators. Although this simplifies their presentation of the
general principles of ecology, for our purpose more narrowly defined
terms have proved useful.

In the main we have followed Sweetman (1936) and Allee et al. (1949) in
arriving at the following definitions:

=Symbiosis= is the living together in more or less intimate association
of organisms of different species; it includes virtually all
relationships between cockroaches and other organisms, such as
parasitism, predatism, commensalism, and mutualism. Allee et al. (1949)
apparently do not include predatism in symbiosis.

=Mutualism= is symbiosis in which both members benefit by the
association. The smaller partner has commonly been called a symbiont or
symbiote by authors.

=Commensalism= includes associations in which neither party appears to
benefit or be harmed. One partner may live on the surplus food or wastes
of the other; shelter and transport may be involved.

=Parasitism= is the state of symbiosis in which one of the members feeds
upon the other during the whole of either the immature or mature feeding
stage; the host is harmed in some way and may be killed.

=Predatism= is an association in which one member attacks and feeds
upon, or stores as food for its progeny, one or more other organisms;
the predator spends less than the immature or mature feeding period on
the prey. This category includes a few invertebrates and all the
vertebrates that capture, kill, and feed on cockroaches. This
association may be divided into interspecies predatism, in which the
predator preys upon a different species, and intraspecies predatism
(cannibalism) in which the predator preys upon its own species.

Although we have attempted to adhere to these definitions throughout
this discussion, we realize that in doing so we may have tended to
oversimplify complex relations. Some questionable interpretations stem
from insufficient knowledge of the basic relationships between
cockroaches and their associates. Only further study will clarify these
relationships. Some of the problems are discussed below.

Probably many of the so-called parasites (e.g., Protozoa like
_Nyctotherus_, and intestinal nematodes of the family Thelastomatidae),
which do not invade the host's tissues and seem to have no effect on the
activity and vitality of the host, are commensals. Although we consider
these forms to be commensals, we realize that they might actually affect
the host in some way even though this has not been shown. It is possible
that Rothschild and Clay's (1957) statement about bird parasites may
well apply to the apparently harmless organisms found in the cockroach.
These authors wrote, "It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the
effect of all types of parasites on the host is detrimental. If we find
that a bird seems little, if at all, inconvenienced by the presence of
Protozoa or worms or lice, or a cuckoo in the nest, we can nevertheless
assume that it would be better off without them.... Small effects such
as lack of vitality, loss of voice, excessive blinking, or perverted
habits like dirt eating are extremely difficult to gauge. Nevertheless,
it is only a question of degree. Potentially all parasites are harmful."
It should also be pointed out that some workers would consider certain
of our commensals of cockroaches to be parasites. Thus Faust (1955)
stated that "A truly successful parasite is one which has developed a
state of equilibrium with its host, so that no detectable damage is
produced which endangers the health or life of the host. In a suitable
host the parasite may obtain food and shelter without any evidence of
trauma or toxicity. The damage produced may be so slight that repair and
functional readjustment keep pace with the injury." Faust's successful
parasite would be indistinguishable from a commensal, but there is
undeniably a difference between an organism causing slight, and
undetectable, damage to a host and one causing none. Certain of the
organisms we list as commensals may eventually be shown to be parasites.

Certain organisms which live in cockroaches appear to have no effect on
the vitality of the host even though the tissues of the host are
invaded. Gregarines may penetrate the intestinal wall of the cockroach
without seeming to injure the host. Fungi of the genus _Herpomyces_
invade the cuticle of cockroaches producing pathological changes; yet
the insects' behavior is apparently unaffected (see p. 129). We consider
these organisms to be parasites because the host's tissues are invaded
and, as far as we know, no benefit to the host results.

In the literature certain insects have been considered to be either
parasites or predators or both. Among these are the ensign wasps
(Evaniidae), whose larvae feed on the eggs of cockroaches within the
ootheca, and the ampulicid wasps, which capture, paralyze, and store in
their nests (as food for their larvae) nymphs and adults of cockroaches.
Clausen (1940) claimed that the evaniid _Zeuxevania splendidula_ is a
true egg parasite when it destroys the first egg in a cockroach ootheca;
but after the wasp larva molts and proceeds to devour the other eggs, he
considered it to be a predator. Clausen's definition of an entomophagous
parasite is an insect that in its larval stage develops either
internally or externally upon a _single_ host which is eventually
killed; with few exceptions the adults are free-living and their food is
usually different from that of the larvae. A predatory insect, by
Clausen's definition, is principally free-living in the larval as well
as adult stage, kills the host immediately by direct attack, and
requires a number of victims to reach maturity; the predator is of
greater size than the prey, and the food sources of the adults and
immature stages are frequently the same.

It is apparent, as Clausen and other writers have pointed out, that
there are instances of a particular species showing characteristics
which fit both the definitions for predator and parasite. Thus, among
the evaniids one wasp larva destroys all the eggs in an ootheca, but in
spite of this the larva has more of the characteristics of a parasite
than of a predator; the adult wasp does not utilize the same food as the
larva (adults have been taken on flowers and on honeydew from scale
insects). It is questionable whether the evaniid larva kills the
cockroach egg outright. The wasp larva, being restricted to the inside
of the ootheca, is not free-living. Probably the only criterion by which
the evaniid could be judged to be a predator, by Clausen's definition,
is that more than a single egg is devoured by the maturing wasp larva.

Among the other wasp parasites (Encyrtidae, Eulophidae, Eupelmidae) of
cockroach eggs many individuals develop in a single ootheca. When a
hundred or more wasps emerge from an ootheca which contained less than
20 eggs, it is obvious that a single cockroach egg supported more than
one wasp, yet it is possible that one particular wasp larva may have fed
upon more than one cockroach egg before becoming an adult. We consider
all entomophagous wasps that develop in cockroach oothecae to be
parasites rather than predators.

On the other hand, even though _Anastatus floridanus_, _A. tenuipes_,
and _Tetrastichus hagenowii_ are egg parasites as larvae, the adult
females are, in a sense, predators when they sometimes eat part of the
cockroach egg that oozes through the oviposition puncture (Roth and
Willis, 1954a, 1954b). Williams (1929) has seen the female of _Ampulex
canaliculata_ imbibe blood that oozed from the cut ends of the
cockroach's antennae after she had clipped them off before leading the
prey to her nest. Yet despite this evident predatism on the part of the
adult, the larva feeds as a parasite on the stored cockroaches in
accordance with Sweetman's (1936) (though not Clausen's 1940) definition
of parasitism, which is "that form of symbiosis in which one symbiont
lives in or on the host organism and feeds at its expense during the
whole of either the immature or mature feeding stage." The ampulicid
larva, as the evaniid, is not free-living and does not kill the host
immediately by direct attack, even though it may require more than one
victim to reach maturity. Thus, within one individual both parasitic and
predatory behavior are operant during different stages of its life
history.

With the above discussion in mind we have summarized below the various
biotic associations of cockroaches. Only a few examples are given for
each section, but all organisms with similar habits presumably would be
classified in the same categories.

  Class A. Associations in which cockroaches serve as hosts, vectors,
           or prey for other organisms.

    Type I. Obligate associates. Animals and plants that normally
            develop only on or in the cockroach; in general, these
            organisms depend entirely upon the cockroach for survival.

      Group 1. Mutuals (symbiotes or symbionts of authors).

        (a) Bacteria-like organisms (bacteroids which are found in the
            fat body of all cockroaches that have been examined; p. 96).

        (b) Bacteria (wood-digesting forms in _Panesthia_, and possibly
            certain bacteria in the intestines, of other cockroaches;
            p. 100).

        (c) Protozoa (several genera and species found in
            _Cryptocercus_; p. 101).

      Group 2. Commensals.

        (a) Protozoa (_Nyctotherus_, _Herpetomonas_, _Lophomonas_, etc.;

        (c) Helminths.

            (1) Primary parasites (mermithids and gordian worms;
                p. 201).

            (2) Secondary parasites (_Gongylonema neoplasticum_,
                _Oxyuris mansoni_, _Moniliformis_ spp.; p. 206).

            (2) Insects (larvae of ripiphorids, evaniids, and
                ampulicids; p. 231).

    Type II. Facultative associates. Animals and plants that prey on
     cockroaches or are incidentally or accidentally picked up by the
     cockroach, but which can survive or propagate readily on some
     other host or prey. Steinhaus (1946) emphasized the importance of
     the environment in determining the type of microbial flora
     associated with the cockroach which may carry one type of flora
     in an area which is exposed to filth and a different type in
     other areas. Because many of these organisms survive passage
     through or on the cockroach, the blattid may act as a vector of
     these animals and plants.

V. MUTUALISM


BACTEROIDS

Blochmann (1887, 1888) discovered intracellular particles (the
bacteroids or symbiotes of authors) that resembled bacteria in the fat
body of males and females of _Blatta orientalis_ and _Blattella
germanica_ (pl. 26), in the ova of these insects, and in their embryos.
Bacteroids have since been found in at least 25 species and 19 genera of
cockroaches. Presumably such microorganisms are universally distributed
throughout the Blattaria. General reviews of the bacteroids of
cockroaches and other insects have been published by Glaser (1930b),
Schwartz (1935), Steinhaus (1946, 1949), Buchner (1952, 1953), Brooks
(1954), and Richards and Brooks (1958). The reader is referred to these
papers, and those of authors cited in the list at the end of this
section, for discussions of the morphology of the bacteroids, their
distribution within the host, and attempts to culture them in vitro.

It has long been assumed, without proof, that cockroaches and their
bacteroids form a mutually beneficial association. As it has not been
possible to cultivate bacteroids apart from their cockroach hosts, it
may be assumed that the host is essential to the continued existence of
the microorganism, which also derives from the association other obvious
benefits as well. Experiments to show that the host also benefits from
the association have centered around rendering cockroaches bacteroid
free. Starvation, parasites, electromagnetic radiation, heat or cold, or
chemicals have all been used in attempts to eliminate the bacteroids. Of
these, only chemical treatment has provided a satisfactory technique.

Few chemicals other than antibiotics have proved to be useful in the
elimination or reduction of bacteroids. Yetwin (1932) injected various
dilutions of 22 compounds into _Blattella germanica_. He observed
decreases in the bacteroids of the fat body only following injection of
methylene blue, but did not pursue this lead further. Gier (_in_
Steinhaus, 1946) observed reduction in the numbers of bacteroids after
cockroaches were injected with crystal violet, hexylresorcinol, or
metaphen. Bode (1936) reported that injection of irritants such as
lithium salts or quinine hydrochloride had no apparent effect on the
symbiotes.

Brooks (1957) reared _Blattella germanica_ on diets containing different
concentrations of inorganic ions. On a manganese-deficient diet the
cockroaches grew poorly and some of their progeny lacked normal
bacteroids; about 10 percent of the aposymbiotic generation grew and
reproduced on a diet fortified with yeast. Varying the concentrations of
other salts in the diets gave results in which the progeny were either
aposymbiotic or the fat body was abnormal but the mycetocytes were
abundant; all these cockroaches soon died even on fortified diets.

The administration of certain antibiotic drugs has produced cockroaches
very nearly free of bacteroids. Brues and Dunn (1945) found that
although sulfa drugs had no effect on the bacteroids, penicillin in
large doses reduced the number of bacteroids in _Blaberus craniifer_,
but the cockroaches died within a few days. Death was attributed to lack
of bacteroids rather than effect of the drug; this is perhaps an
unwarranted conclusion in view of the survival of aposymbiotic
cockroaches that have been produced by other drugs (Brooks, 1954; Brooks
and Richards, 1955). Glaser (1946) found that the bacteroids of
_Periplaneta americana_ could be adversely affected or destroyed by
sulfathiazole, or sodium or calcium penicillin. Fraenkel (1952)
questioned the conclusions of Brues and Dunn (1945) and of Glaser (1946)
because of the high mortality in their experiments, and he suggested
that the described phenomena "were due rather to direct toxic effects on
the host than to loss of the symbionts." Noland (_in_ Brooks, 1954;
Brooks and Richards, 1955) confirmed Glaser's results with penicillin
and extended sulfa treatments to include _Blattella germanica_. Every
female whose bacteroids were reduced to the vanishing point resorbed her
ovaries and was incapable of reproduction. Brooks (1954; Brooks and
Richards, 1955) found that administration of several antibiotics did not
eliminate the bacteroids from the fat body of _B. germanica_ unless the
dose was so high that it caused excessive mortality. Frank (1955, 1956)
was able to eliminate bacteroids from _Blatta orientalis_ by injecting
or feeding chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, or penicillin; survival
of treated insects was not good and reproduction was poor; the
aposymbiotic individuals were smaller than normal. As Richards and
Brooks (1958) have pointed out, it is uncertain how much of this
difference was the result of loss of bacteroids and how much the effect
of the drug. It is obvious that in all these experiments the action of
the drugs on the bacteroids was accompanied by equivocal side effects
which confused interpretation of the results. The effect on the
cockroach of a loss of bacteroids cannot be separated from a possible
toxic effect of the drug.

Fortunately Brooks (1954; Brooks and Richards, 1955) obtained completely
aposymbiotic offspring from _Blattella germanica_ that had been reared
on aureomycin. These bacteroid-free nymphs were practically incapable of
growth on a natural diet that was adequate for nymphs with symbiotes.
However, the addition of large amounts of dried yeast to the diet
enabled aposymbiotic nymphs to mature in two to three times the period
required by normal nymphs. Final proof of the function of the bacteroids
was obtained by reestablishing them in aposymbiotic cockroaches. The
insects that received implants of normal fat body of _B. germanica_
showed a slow, steady gain in weight over the controls (Brooks, 1954;
Brooks and Richards, 1956). Obviously, the intracellular symbiotes
subserve the normal nutrition of the cockroach. Whether the bacteroids
produce only vitaminlike substances, as suggested by Keller (1950), or
function in some other way is still to be determined. Brooks (1954)
concluded that the amount of vitamin-containing food required for
increased growth by aposymbiotic cockroaches is much greater than the
known vitamin requirements; hence the factor(s) needed is unknown and
present in low concentration, or it serves as a precursor of a second
factor(s) whose synthesis is aided by the bacteroids. Brooks (_in_
Richards and Brooks, 1958) has since found that the bacteroids of
_Blattella germanica_ "can supply the insect with B vitamins, amino
acids and some larger protein fragment."

Gier (1947) stated that the symbiotes of cockroaches are generically all
the same. However, as the symbiotes are presumed to have been associated
with cockroaches for over 300,000,000 years (Buchner, 1952) they may be
assumed to have developed specific differences that link them
inseparably to their respective hosts. Ries (1932) transplanted
symbiote-containing fat body from _Blatta orientalis_ into the mealworm
and larva of _Ephestia kuehniella_, and from _Blattella germanica_ and
_Stegobium paniceum_ (=_Sitodrepa panicea_) into _B. orientalis_. The
implants did not become established in the new host, although most of
the transplantations were successful in that the hosts survived and the
implants remained intact for some time before they were encapsulated by
host tissue. Brooks (1954; Brooks and Richards, 1956) transplanted fat
body of _Periplaneta americana_ and _B. orientalis_ into aposymbiotic
_B. germanica_. The growth of the cockroaches injected with foreign
tissue was not different from that of aposymbiotic controls. Sections of
host insects did not contain mycetocytes and no bacteroids were found.
Haller (1955a) injected bacteroids or implanted mycetocytes of _B.
germanica_ into gryllids, acridids, and locustids. These implants and
innoculations were rapidly destroyed by the hosts. But as Richards and
Brooks (1958) have pointed out, none of these experiments provide
information about the specificity of the bacteroids themselves.

BACTERIA

Evidence showing that intestinal bacteria contribute to the nutrition of
cockroaches is meager. Cleveland et al. (1934) isolated a bacterial
organism from the foregut of the wood-feeding cockroach _Panesthia
angustipennis_. The bacterium digested cellulose rapidly in vitro and
these workers believe that this cockroach and other related wood-feeding
species are dependent on symbiotic bacteria for the digestion of their
food.

Mencl (1907) described cell nuclei in "symbiotic," not closely defined
types of bacilli that he found in abundance in the digestive tract of
the Kuechenschabe, _Periplaneta_ (presumably _Blatta orientalis_).
Unfortunately, he was more concerned about the morphology of the
bacteria than the stated mutualistic relationship, so nothing is known
of their physiology.

The growth rates of _Periplaneta americana_ and _Blattella germanica_
were retarded when the insects were reared aseptically, which suggests
that microorganisms normally found in the digestive tract supply certain
necessary dietary constituents (Gier, 1947a; House, 1949). Noland et al.
(1949) suggested that microorganisms in the digestive tract of _B.
germanica_ synthesized riboflavin since the nymphs reared on a low
riboflavin diet accumulated more of the vitamin than could have been
ingested in the diet. However, Metcalf and Patton (1942) found little or
no bacterial synthesis of riboflavin in _P. americana_. Noland and
Baumann (1951) suggested that methionine, one of the amino acids
essential for rapid growth of _B. germanica_, was synthesized by
intestinal microorganisms in the insects.


PROTOZOA

It is probable that with few exceptions protozoa found in the digestive
tract are not necessary for survival of the cockroach. However, very few
experiments have been performed to determine the importance, if any, of
these microorganisms to the host. Cleveland (1925) removed the protozoa
from the cockroach (possibly _Periplaneta americana_) by oxygenation at
3.5 atmospheres. The ciliates _Nyctotherus_ and _Balantidium_,
flagellates _Lophomonas_ and _Polymastix_, the amoeba _Endamoeba
blattae_, and three unidentified protozoa were killed by this treatment,
yet the insects lived normally after defaunation.

Armer (1944) studied the effects of high-carbohydrate, high-fat, and
high-protein diets, as well as starvation, on the intestinal protozoa
(_Nyctotherus ovalis_, _Endamoeba blattae_, _Endolimax blattae_,
_Lophomonas striata_, and _Lophomonas blattarum_) in _Periplaneta
americana_. Starvation of the host lowered the incidence or eliminated
most of the protozoa, but a high-carbohydrate diet maintained them at a
relatively high level. _Lophomonas blattarum_ was eliminated by a
high-protein diet, and practically eliminated by a high-fat diet.
_Lophomonas striata_ was eliminated from some hosts that were kept on
high-fat and high-protein diets. _Endamoeba blattae_ showed a decrease
in infection rate when the cockroaches were maintained on high-fat and
high-protein diets. The effects of diets on _Endolimax blattae_ were not
uniform.

It has been shown by Cleveland (1930, 1948) and Cleveland et al. (1931,
1934) that the wood-feeding cockroach _Cryptocercus punctulatus_ depends
upon certain intestinal protozoa for survival; these protozoa utilize as
food the wood ingested by this cockroach. The wood is broken down into
compounds the cockroach can utilize by the protozoa which elaborate a
cellulase and possibly a cellobiase (Trager, 1932). Only molting nymphs
of _Cryptocercus_ can pass the protozoa on to the newly hatched young,
so that molting and hatching must happen concurrently each year or the
young die.

The sexual cycles in species of protozoa in the genera _Trichonympha_,
_Saccinobaculus_, _Oxymonas_, _Monocercomonoides_, _Hexamita_,
_Eucomonympha_, _Leptospironympha_, _Urinympha_, _Rhynchonympha_,
_Macrospironympha_, and _Barbulanympha_ (fig. 3, B) are induced by
hormones produced by _Cryptocercus_ only during its molting period
(Cleveland, 1931, 1947, 1947a, 1949-1956a). Perhaps the prothoracic
gland hormone of the host may be responsible for initiation of the
flagellate sexual cycles (Cleveland and Nutting, 1955). The protozoan
sexual cycles may be used as indicators of the onset of molting in
_Cryptocercus_; thus different species of protozoa begin their sexual
cycles from 35 days before to 2 days after molting of the cockroach
(Cleveland and Nutting, 1954). Hollande (1952) and Grasse (1952) have
reviewed the roles and the evolution of the flagellates in
_Cryptocercus_ and in termites.

The protozoa of cockroaches and termites are clues to the relationship
between these two groups of insects. Kirby (1927) pointed out
similarities between _Endamoeba blattae_ of _Periplaneta_ and the
amoebae of the termite _Mirotermes_, suggesting that these protozoans
were probably derived from an amoeba in an ancestor common to both
blattid and termite. Kirby (1932, _in_ Kidder, 1937) found a species of
_Nyctotherus_ in _Amitermes_ that resembles _Nyctotherus ovalis_ from
domestic cockroaches. The belief that the termites and cockroaches had a
common origin is also strengthened by the similarities between the
hypermastigotes of both _Cryptocercus_ and termites (Cleveland et al.,
1934).

The cockroaches _Cryptocercus_ and _Panesthia_ both feed on wood, but
the protozoa found in _Panesthia_ resemble more closely the species in
domestic cockroaches than those in _Cryptocercus_. The Clevelandellidae
(from _Panesthia_) are closely related to _Nyctotherus_ and have
probably evolved from common ancestors. However, the separation of the
Clevelandellidae from _Nyctotherus_ must have taken place at a later
date than the divergence of their hosts, otherwise representatives of
that family would probably also be found in _Periplaneta_ and _Blatta_
(Kidder, 1937).

The protozoa of _Cryptocercus_ can be transferred from one individual to
another (Nutting and Cleveland, 1954). They can also be transferred to
the termite _Zootermopsis_ where they survive only until the host molts;
the reverse is also true, _Zootermopsis_ Protozoa can survive in
_Cryptocercus_ until the cockroach molts (Nutting and Cleveland, 1954a).




VI. VIRUSES ASSOCIATED WITH COCKROACHES


Annotations on some of the following observations may be found in Roth
and Willis (1957a). Use of asterisk is explained in footnote 3, page 4.


POLIOMYELITIS VIRUSES


* =Lansing strain=

_Experimental vectors._--_Blattella germanica_, U.S.A. (Hurlbutt, 1949,
1950).

_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Hsiang et al., 1952).


* =Brunhilde type, Minnesota and Mahoney strains=

_Experimental vectors._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Fischer and
Syverton, 1951; Syverton et al., 1952).


* =Columbia SK virus=

(Findlay and Howard, 1951): Results with _Blattella germanica_ were
negative.


* =Four unspecified strains=

_Natural vectors._--_Blattella germanica_ and/or _Blattella vaga_,
_Periplaneta americana_ and/or _Periplaneta brunnea_, and _Supella
supellectilium_, U.S.A. (Syverton et al., 1952; Dow, 1955; Dow _in_ Roth
and Willis, 1957a).


OTHER VIRUSES

* =Coxsackie viruses=

_Experimental vectors._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Fischer and
Syverton, 1951a, 1957): Recently Fischer and Syverton (1957) found that
after feeding a single meal of Coxsackie virus to _Periplaneta
americana_, the gastrointestinal tracts of the insects, which were
removed at 5-day intervals up to 20 days, contained sufficient virus to
paralyze and kill test mice. Cockroach salivary glands, removed 5 days
after the insects had fed, contained the virus which caused paralysis
and death in test mice; mice were also infected by virus obtained from
salivary glands removed from the insects 10 and 20 days after the
cockroaches had fed once on the virus. The virus was also isolated from
the cockroaches' feces and rarely from the fat bodies and reproductive
organs. Fischer and Syverton concluded that it is possible that
cockroaches could acquire the virus, by feeding on mammalian excreta,
maintain it for a period of time, and transmit it by contamination of
food. The virus could also be transmitted through the feces of wild mice
if the mice happened to feed on virus-infected cockroaches.

VII. BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH COCKROACHES


Classification of the bacteria follows Breed et al. (1948). Synonymy in
most cases was taken from the same source. Names of bacteria preceded by
the symbol [cross] are either not listed by Breed et al. or are stated
by them to be insufficiently characterized for definite classification.

recovered from the feces.


* =Micrococcus pyogenes= var. =albus= (Rosenbach) Schroeter

_Natural vectors._--_Blaberus craniifer_, U.S.A. (Wedberg et al.,
1949).

_Blatta orientalis_, U.S.A. (Tauber, 1940; Tauber and Griffiths, 1942).

_Blattella germanica_, U.S.A. (Herms and Nelson, 1913; Herms, 1939;
Janssen and Wedberg, 1952).

_Experimental vectors._--_Blatta orientalis_, Italy (Cao, 1898); U.S.A.
(Tauber and Griffiths, 1942).

_Micrococcus pyogenes_ var. _albus_ (=_Staphylococcus albus_) and an
unidentified short rod form were found by Tauber (1940) in the hemolymph
of _B. orientalis_. These microorganisms were never found together in
the same insect and caused loss of appetite, sluggishness, irregular
respiratory movements, and paralysis in the cockroach; in the final
stages of the disease the legs were folded under the body, the head was
tucked beneath the forelegs, the whole insect became arched and
maintained this position until death. In some cockroaches infected with
the rod pathogen, conjunctival folds, particularly those between the
dorsal abdominal sclerites, and the joints of the metathoracic legs
ruptured liberating thick white hemolymph filled with bacteria. Tauber
suggested that the infection might be spread by contact, especially to
newly molted individuals or by actual ingestion of the bacteria by the
cockroaches feeding on dead or dying individuals. All the roaches died
after successful inoculation with the _Micrococcus_. The bacterial
infection was associated with high total hemocyte counts and high
percentages of mitotically dividing hemolymph cells (Tauber, 1940);
these responses of the insect were interpreted as a mechanism whereby
the number of hemocytes increases resulting in an increase in the number
of phagocytes for combating the bacteria (Tauber and Griffiths, 1942).

Quartermaster bacteriologist, from dead specimens found in our
laboratory colonies which showed the red coloration characteristic of
insects that have died with infections of _S. marcescens_ (pl. 16, A,

suspensions of ground insects. In 1954 we received a culture of
_Periplaneta brunnea_ from the Department of Public Health, University
of Minnesota. These insects began to die off rapidly and the normally
lightly pigmented parts of the body became red. Dr. Hillel Levinson,
Quartermaster bacteriologist, cultured _Serratia marcescens_ from
several moribund individuals. The Department of Public Health of
Minnesota had at times in the past cultured _S. marcescens_ but had
discarded the cultures and was unaware that it might be surviving in the

VIII. FUNGI AND YEASTS


By far the greatest number of fungi known to be associated with
cockroaches belong to the Laboulbeniaceae, genus _Herpomyces_, the
species of which are restricted to parasitizing cockroaches (Thaxter,
1908). Most species are hyaline, small and inconspicuous (Thaxter, 1931)
and are usually, but not exclusively, found on the insects' antennae.
Species of _Herpomyces_ are highly, but not completely, host specific
(Richards and Smith, 1954). While attached to the host, these fungi
appear like minute dark-colored, yellow, or white (e.g., _H. arietinus_)
bristles or bushy hairs (pl. 27, A).

  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Diagram illustrating the relationship between a
  mature plant of _Herpomyces stylopygae_ and the integument of _Blatta
  orientalis_. (Reproduced from Richards and Smith [1956], through the
  courtesy of Dr. A. G. Richards.)]

Richards and Smith (1955, 1955a) have studied the life history of
_Herpomyces stylopygae_ on the oriental cockroach. The plants grow only
on living cockroaches, and the infection is disseminated by contact. The
mature plants are found mostly on the antennae (pl. 27, B), either on
setae or on hard or soft cuticle. Spores are ejected from perithecia
singly or in groups of 2 to 4 spores, although groups as large as 12
spores have been found. The presence of single, paired, or multiple
spore groups on the surface of the host was correlated with the presence
of single, paired, or multiple plants on infected cockroaches.
Development from spore to mature perithecia takes about two weeks. The
plant obtains nutriment from the host by means of a tubular haustorium
that extends through the cockroach's cuticle and expands into a large
bulb in the underlying epidermal cells (fig. 1). Infections on nymphs
are lost when the nymph moults, but infections on adults persist
throughout life. However, nymphs which have lost the fungus upon
moulting are readily reinfected. Collart's (1947) statement that nymphs
are never infected with _Herpomyces_ is not true.

Richards and Smith (1956) concluded that there is no evidence of
pathogenicity in _Herpomyces_ infections because heavily infected
cockroaches appear fully active in laboratory colonies; they can run at
the same speed as uninfected cockroaches; they reproduce normally and do
not appear to die prematurely. These workers stated that the infections
cause a dermatitis which is neither pathogenic nor debilitant. So far as
we know there are no comparative data on longevity and reproductive
performance of fungus-infected versus normal cockroaches. However, Gunn
and Cosway (1938) have shown that the presence of these fungi
(identified as _Stigmatomyces_ sp.; see p. 138) on the antennae seemed
to interfere with the humidity reactions of _Blatta orientalis_.
Although Richards and Smith (1956) admit that humidity receptors and
other sense organs on the antennae may be destroyed by the fungus, they
state that "insects possess such a large number of sensilla that the
result may well be more distressing to the sensory physiologist than to
the insect." Yet it seems to us that the loss of sense organs from
fungal infection and concomitant shortening of the antennae (pl. 27, A)
might be considerably more of a handicap to free-living cockroaches than
those in laboratory colonies.

Bode (1936) studied the flora of _Periplaneta americana_ and cultured
Aspergillaceae and Mucorinae from the insect's body surface and
intestinal contents; he also found nonsporulating yeasts in _P.
americana_. To prevent fungal growth on oothecae of _P. americana_,
Griffiths and Tauber (1942a) autoclaved their rearing containers and
dipped the oothecae in 70-percent alcohol for 10 seconds.

Mercier (1906) isolated and cultured a pathogenic yeastlike parasite
which had invaded the fat body and blood of _Blatta orientalis_. The
abdomens of the infected insects became swollen, distended, and soft.
McShan (unpublished MS., 1953) consistently isolated Saccharomycetes
from the feces of _Periplaneta americana_.

the opinion that the so-called yeasts that supposedly may displace the

It is likely that Thaxter's host records (certainly those assigned to
_Temnopteryx_ and possibly those assigned to _Ischnoptera_) were species
of _Parcoblatta_. Hebard (1917) has shown that all the species referred
to _Ischnoptera_ in the United States, except _I. deropeltiformis_, now
belong in the genus _Parcoblatta_. All species originally referred to

(1931) believed that _H. macropus_ may be synonymous with _H.

Since this cockroach is not found in Mexico (J. A. G. Rehn, personal

this fungus. W. B. Brown (personal communication, 1957) searched the
cockroach collection at the Museum of Comparative Zoology but was unable
to find Thaxter's insect for reidentification.


=Herpomyces stylopygae= Spegazzini

_Natural hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, Argentina (Spegazzini, 1917);
U.S.A. (Richards and Smith, 1955a).

_Experimental hosts._--_Neostylopyga rhombifolia_ (Richards and Smith,
1954): A few plants matured.

_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ (Richards and Smith, 1954): Some development
but no mature plants.

The fungus (fig. 1) is found on antennae (pl. 27, B, C), palpi, cerci,
and femurs. Thaxter (1931) believed _H. stylopygae_ to be synonymous
with _H. periplanetae_. However, Richards and Smith (1954) concluded
that _H. stylopygae_ would not grow on _P. americana_ under their
laboratory conditions although _H. periplanetae_ would grow on _B.
orientalis_. This indicated a strain or species difference between the
two fungi. Gunn and Cosway (1938) reported a species of _Stigmatomyces_
on the antennae of _B. orientalis_; this fungus was probably _H.
stylopygae_ (Richards and Smith, 1956).


=Herpomyces supellae= (Thaxter)

_Natural host._--_Supella supellectilium_, Trinidad (Thaxter, 1931): On
antennal spines.


=Herpomyces tricuspidatus= Thaxter

_Natural hosts._--_Blaberus craniifer_, U.S.A., Key West (Richards and
Smith, 1955).

_Blaberus_ sp. and _Epilampra?_ sp., Panama (Thaxter, 1902, 1908).

_Epilampra_ sp., Saint Kitts, B.W.I., and Haiti (Thaxter, 1902, 1908).

_Leucophaea maderae_, Fernando Po (Spegazzini, 1915).

_Nauphoeta cinerea_, Brazil (Thaxter, 1931).

Cockroaches, China? (Thaxter, 1902); Philippine Islands, Mindanao
(Thaxter, 1931).

_Experimental hosts._--_Blaberus craniifer_, U.S.A. (Richards and Smith,
1955).

Infections on the antennae. Richards and Smith (1954) were unable to
secure experimental infections in _L. maderae_ with _H. tricuspidatus_.
Experiments with _N. cinerea_ showed some development but no mature
plants although identification of the growing fungus was uncertain
because of simultaneous exposure to _H. ectobiae_, _H. stylopygae_, and
_H. tricuspidatus_.


=Herpomyces zanzibarinus= Thaxter

_Natural hosts._--_Eurycotis manni_, Brazil (Thaxter, 1931): On
antennae.

_Gyna_ sp.?, Isle of Nias (Spegazzini, 1915): On antennae.

Cockroach, Zanzibar (Thaxter, 1902): On antennae.


=INCERTAE SEDIS=

According to Dr. R. K. Benjamin (personal communication, 1957) and Dr.
E. G. Simmons (personal communication, 1957), the phylogenetic position
of the following genus is uncertain.


=Amphoromorpha blattina= Thaxter

_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, Grenada, B.W.I. (Thaxter, 1920): On the
axis of the antennae of a dark wingless and a pale winged blattid.


=Amphoromorpha= sp.

_Natural host._--Cockroach, Grenada, B.W.I. (Thaxter, 1920): On antennal
setae.




IX. HIGHER PLANTS


The significance of many observed associations between cockroaches and
the higher plants is still obscure. Undoubtedly many associations are
ecological, but lack of adequate supporting evidence makes this
conclusion somewhat tentative. The ecological aspects are covered in
Section III (p. 14). Other associations may be accidental (e.g., certain
unique observations that have never again been confirmed). In the
absence of contrary evidence, most associations are presumed to be
benign; exceptions to this conclusion are found among the cockroaches
that feed on living plants (p. 162) and those allegedly captured as prey
by the carnivorous pitcher plants (_Sarracenia_ and _Nepenthes_). In all
the records cited below the cockroaches were stated to have been on, in,
or feeding on the plant.

The plants are listed below by family according to the taxonomic
arrangement of Lawrence (1951). Botanical nomenclature follows Bailey
(1925), Fernald (1950), or Dr. R. A. Howard (personal communications,
1958, 1959). We take full responsibility for referring to appropriate
taxa certain plants that were reported by common name only in the cited
literature.

=Bananas=

Cockroaches have been captured in bunches of bananas, in bracts of
banana flowers, under banana leaves, and burrowing in rotten banana
stalks. Although many of the species associated with bananas are
indigenous to the banana-growing areas of the American Tropics, most of
the specimens cited below were captured elsewhere as adventitious
insects that had been imported with the fruit. It is obvious that many
of these insects must have been closely associated with bananas on the
plantations, where, undoubtedly, the growing plants provided attractive
ecological niches. Bunting (1956) deduced, from the presence of healthy
cockroaches on bananas allegedly sprayed with copper arsenate, that the
insects did not feed on stems or fruit but hid among the bananas and
foraged elsewhere; however, certain reports are of cockroaches actually
feeding on bananas. Some of the records cited by Hebard (1917) were
compiled from earlier reports not all of which we have seen. Numbers in
parentheses following certain citations indicate the number of times the
association had been observed. Known or suspected adventive material is
so indicated.

_Aglaopteryx diaphana_, Jamaica (Rehn and Hebard, 1927): Found in bracts
of banana blossoms. England (Bunting, 1955): Adventive, on bananas from
Dominica.

_Aglaopteryx vegeta_, Finland (Princis, 1947): Adventive, in banana box.

_Amazonina emarginata_, Trinidad (Princis and Kevan, 1955): In banana
bunch.

_Archimandrita marmorata_, Denmark (Henriksen, 1939): Adventive (2), in
bananas from Jamaica(?). As Princis (1947) and Gurney (personal
communication, 1959) point out, this is a Central American species, so
Jamaica may be an error.

_Archimandrita tessellate_, Sweden (Princis, 1947): Adventive, from
Honduras.

_Blaberus atropos_(?), Denmark (Henriksen, 1939): Adventive, from
Jamaica. Princis (1947) pointed out that this species was more likely to
have been _Blaberus craniifer_ or _Blaberus discoidalis_, which are West
Indian species, than _B. atropos_ which is a South American species.

_Blaberus boliviensis_, Ecuador (Princis, 1952): In a shipment of
bananas from near Puna.

_Blaberus discoidalis_, Puerto Rico (Rehn and Hebard, 1927): From banana
ripening room. Great Britain (Pearce, 1929): Adventive. England

Adventive, from Dominica.

_Epilampra maya_, Massachusetts (Hebard, 1917): Adventive.

_Epilampra mexicana_(?), Denmark (Henriksen, 1939): Adventive (2), from
Danish West Indies. Princis (1947) suggested that this should be
_Epilampra_ sp., because _E. mexicana_ is not a West Indian species.

_Eudromiella calcarata_ and _Eurycotis bananae_, U.S.S.R., Leningrad
(Bei-Bienko, 1947): Adventive, from Colombia.

_Euphyllodromia angustata_, Sweden (Princis, 1947): Adventive.

under decayed banana stem.

_Latiblattella_ sp., Finland (Frey, 1948): Adventive.

_Leucophaea maderae_, New York (Hebard, 1917): Adventive. Dominica (Rehn
and Hebard, 1927): Under banana sheaths. England (Palmer, 1928):
Adventive, captured at railroad station after bananas had been unloaded.
England (Bunting, 1955): Adventive, from Dominica. Trinidad (Princis and
Kevan, 1955): Nymph, eating bananas in cupboard. Puerto Rico (Sein,

_Neoblattella carcinus_, _Neoblattella celeripes_, and _Neoblattella
laodamia_, England (Bunting, 1956): Adventive, from Dominica. Bunting
(1955) first reported these as _Neoblattella_ spp. and stated that they
were common.

_Neoblattella detersa_, Jamaica (Rehn and Hebard, 1927): From under the
bracts of banana blossoms. Sweden (Princis, 1947): Adventive.

_Neoblattella detersa_ and _Neoblattella tridens_, Finland (Frey, 1948):
Adventive.

_Neoblattella fratercula_, Nebraska (Hebard, 1916b): Adventive.

_Neoblattella semota_, Jamaica (Rehn and Hebard, 1927): From under
drying bracts of banana blossoms.

_Neoblattella vatia_, Cuba (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).

_Neoblattella_ sp., Finland (Princis, 1947): Adventive, from Jamaica.

_Nyctibora azteca_, England (Bunting, 1955): Adventive, from Dominica.
Bunting reported this species as _Nocticola azteca_. Dr. A. B. Gurney
called our attention to the fact that _Nocticola_ is an Old World genus,
presumably combined in error with the New World species _azteca_. The
true identity of the specimen was confirmed by Dr. D. Ragge (personal

DAMAGE TO PLANTS BY COCKROACHES

Cockroaches characteristically feed on dead plant and animal material.
Damage to living plants occurs principally in the Tropics or under
subtropical conditions in greenhouses in temperate regions. Among the
depredations attributed to cockroaches in text books, damage to plants
is seldom emphasized. This is surprising in view of the many records
cited below.

Capt. William Bligh (1792), while collecting breadfruit trees in Tahiti
to take to the West Indies, wrote in his log during January 1789: "This
morning, I ordered all the chests to be taken on shore, and the inside
of the ship to be washed with boiling water, to kill the cockroaches. We
were constantly obliged to be at great pains to keep the ship clear of
vermin, on account of the plants."

Westwood (1869) stated that _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ was very
destructive in orchid houses feeding on buds and young shoots. Later
Westwood (1876) exhibited the bulb of an orchid from Ecuador which
contained six species of cockroaches: _Blatta orientalis_,
[_Periplaneta_?] _americana_, [_Nauphoeta_?] _cinerea_, [_Leucophaea_?]
_maderae_, and two others unknown to him. Fullaway (1938) stated that
cockroaches damage root tips, buds, and flowers of orchids. _Periplaneta
americana_ has been said to eat the root tips and blossoms of orchids
(Taschenberg, 1884) and to devour the open flower petals of _Cattleya_
orchids as well as the aerial roots and flower spikes of _Vanda_ orchids
(Rau, 1940a). Wainwright (1898) stated that _Periplaneta australasiae_
had been observed in an orchid house in Perthshire where over a period
of three years it had caused a good deal of damage. Skinner (1905)
reported that _P. australasiae_ in greenhouses in Pennsylvania showed no
preference for any one plant but ate both plants and flowers of orchids,
roses, and carnations. Lucas (1918) received specimens of _P.
australasiae_ which had played havoc with orchids especially _Cattleya_
and _Vanda_. Morse (1920) reported that both _P. australasiae_ and
_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ were obnoxious in a conservatory in
Massachusetts where they gnawed the tips of the aerial roots of orchids.
Swezey (1945) in Hawaii stated that the following cockroaches have been
reported as occasional minor pests on orchids: _Blatta orientalis_,
_Blaberus discoidalis_, _P. americana_, and _P. surinamensis_; he
further stated that _Graptoblatta notulata_ had been intercepted at
Honolulu on orchids from India.

Watson (1907) stated that _Blatta orientalis_, _Periplaneta americana_,
and _Periplaneta australasiae_ were injurious in the tropical plant
houses at Kew: "at night they come out and run or fly about among the
plants, devouring flowers and leaves like rabbits. Such plants as
_Eucharis_, _Crinum_ and _Alpinia_, when in flower, have little chance
in the palm house, where the cockroaches are most abundant; they also
find out the ripening bananas and soon devour them." Raffill (1910)
stated that in plant houses in England _B. orientalis_, _P. americana_,
and _P. australasiae_ commonly, and _Nauphoeta cinerea_, _Nauphoeta
flexivitta_, and _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ more rarely, are extremely
destructive to plants. Flowers having a strong perfume, such as orchids,
_Eucharis_, _Crinum_, and _Hedychium_, were often attacked while other
flowers nearby were left uninjured.

Plank and Winters (1949) reported that in Puerto Rico the species of
Orthoptera most injurious under greenhouse conditions was _Periplaneta
americana_. Large nymphs destroyed 25 to 30 percent of freshly planted
seed of _Cinchona pubescens_. In Hawaii the host plants of _P.
americana_ are blossoms of _Canna_ and _Tribulus_, and the host plants
of _Periplaneta australasiae_ are _Pritchardia_ and _Sida_ (Zimmerman,
1948). On St. Kitts, B.W.I., young cotton plants were severely attacked
by _P. australasiae_; this caused loss of the stand on a considerable
area and necessitated replanting (Ballou, 1916). _P. australasiae_ was
reported damaging the _Polystichum aristatum_ Presl [=_Lastrea aristata
variegata_] in a greenhouse (Thilow and Riley, 1891). Laing (1946;
British Museum [Natural History], 1951) stated that _P. australasiae_
abounds in greenhouses and forcing pits where it may do considerable
damage to the plants. _Periplaneta fuliginosa_ is also troublesome in
greenhouses because of its tendency to feed on seedlings and succulent
plants (Dodge and Rickett, 1943).

_Ectobius lapponicus_ has been observed feeding in galleries in the
thick skin of young aspen in 25 percent of the trees examined (Stark
_in_ Bei-Bienko, 1950). The aquatic cockroach _Epilampra abdomen nigrum_
fed on the leaves of _Jussiaea natans_ in an aquarium (Crowell, 1946).
_Ischnoptera deropeltiformis_ has been taken while it was feeding on a
fleshy fungus (_Agaricus_ sp.) in dense woods in Indiana (Blatchley,
1920).

_Diploptera punctata_, the cypress roach or beetle roach, has been found
in Hawaii feeding on ripening mangoes and papayas, oranges on the tree,
and the outer covering of the pods of _Acacia farnesiana_ (Bridwell and
Swezey, 1915). Pemberton (1934) stated that _D. punctata_ "disfigures
our cypress trees by eating the bark from the young branches, often
giving them a dead appearance over much of their leaf area." Fullaway
and Krauss (1945) added, "This injury [to cypress] is so severe that
sometimes areas of leaves die and turn brown. The Japanese cedar,
ironwood, citrus and algaroba (kiawe) trees are attacked in a similar
manner." Similar injury to cypress was described by Hebard (1922). In
addition to girdling _Cupressus_, _D. punctata_ injures _Cryptomeria_ in
the same fashion and also attacks algaroba, lime, and other plants
(Pemberton and Williams, 1938). Zimmerman (1948) cited the following
host plants for _D. punctata_ in Hawaii: "_Cupressus macrocarpa_,
_Casuarina_, _Cryptomeria_, _Citrus_, geraniums, _Acacia farnesiana_
pods, mango fruits, orange fruits, papaya fruits."

In the reports of damage to plants by cockroaches, _Pycnoscelus
surinamensis_ has been implicated most often. This species is
undoubtedly one of the economically most important cockroaches, being
the vector of the chicken eyeworm as well as feeding on plants. In
addition to the few reports of damage caused by this species that have
already been mentioned, _P. surinamensis_ has been reported to be very
destructive in New Orleans to palms and ferns, attacking large
alsophilas avidly, eating out the hearts (Anonymous, 1893). Zappe (1918)
in Connecticut reported damage in a greenhouse to roses valued, at that
time, at several hundred dollars; _P. surinamensis_ had girdled the rose
bushes, done much damage to Easter lilies, and in another greenhouse had
eaten the bark from the stems of poinsettias. In Germany this species
bit off the tips of the aerial roots and ate the petals of orchids
(Zacher, 1920). Lucas (1923) reported damage to cucumber plants in a
greenhouse in Surrey. Damage by _P. surinamensis_ to the stems of rose
bushes has been reported in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania; the canes
were attacked both under and above ground (Caudell, 1925). Doucette and
Smith (1926) reported a heavy infestation of _P. surinamensis_ in a
range of greenhouses in Philadelphia: "The roaches were present
literally by the millions.... Although the roaches had been observed in
cabinets and trash barrels for several months, it was not until the
manager had occasion to go through the house one evening that he
discovered that roaches were the cause of the troubles previously
attributed to soil condition, watering, fungus, and other agencies....
About 30,000 to 35,000 rose plants from a total of 200,000 in the three
more heavily infested houses were so badly injured by the gnawing off of
the bark, young buds, and shoots of the main stems, that they were not
in condition to be kept in the beds for another season."

In Haiti _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ damaged the tubers of growing
potatoes (Hoffman, 1927). Illingworth (1927, 1929) reported that in
Hawaii _P. surinamensis_ was a minor pest of pineapples, feeding on the
roots. This species was very plentiful in a propagating pit in England
where it did much damage to various seeds and seedlings (Lucas, 1930).
Roeser (1940) summarized some of the above-mentioned damage caused by
_P. surinamensis_ and added damage to chrysanthemums in Hawaii and
tobacco in Sumatra where this cockroach destroyed 300,000 plants in a
few days. Roeser was of the opinion that living plants were eaten only
as a substitute when the earth became poor in food material. Zimmerman
(1948) listed as host plants of _P. surinamensis_ in Hawaii: "blossoms
of _Tribulus_; reported feeding at roots of pineapples, and unconfirmed
reports of damage to underground parts of some other plants." Goodliffe
(1958) reported damage by this species to banana plants in a
conservatory in northern England. Cohic (1956) implied that in New
Caledonia "Racines de legumes" were attacked by _P. surinamensis_ and
that _Zea mays_ Linnaeus was attacked by _Supella supellectilium_.
Wolcott (1924a) reported that _P. surinamensis_ damaged transplanted
tobacco plants in Puerto Rico by eating the interior of the stalks.
Tobacco planters in Cuba consider _P. surinamensis_ injurious to the
roots of tobacco plants (Bruner and Scaramuzza, 1936); this belief was
confirmed in the laboratory, where adults and nymphs destroyed the roots
and stems of tobacco plants two inches high and ate into the edges of
the leaves. Dammerman (1929) reported that in Malaya this species often
appeared in large numbers in gardens where it gnawed at the underground
parts of vegetables and ornamental plants. Lever (1947) listed it as a
pest on the leaves of pineapple.

_Blattella vaga_ may occasionally damage seedlings in the laboratory
(Flock, 1941a), but no damage has been reported in the field (Ball et
al., 1942). Heer (1864) reported receiving a shipment of cycads from
Cuba with all stages of _Periplaneta americana_ living in holes in the
branches, apparently subsisting on the starchy tissues. Goldenberg
(1877) stated that sago trees provide cockroaches with their favorite
nourishment. Scudder (1879) found _Eurycotis floridana_ living in the
tops of the cabbage palmetto, on which he presumed it fed. _Parcoblatta
americana_ has been observed feeding on an apple 6 feet above ground
(Fulton, 1930).

orientalis_ infested.

Grasse (1926, 1926a) identified corrugations on the surface of _L.
striata_ as a bacterial parasite which he named _Fusiformis
lophomonadis_.

Pacific coast areas (Cleveland et al., 1934): Found in only a few
specimens, never abundant.


=Trichonympha parva= Cleveland et al.

_Natural host._--_Cryptocercus punctulatus_, U.S.A., Appalachian and
Pacific coast areas (Cleveland et al., 1934): This organism is smaller
than any known species of _Trichonympha_; it is more resistant to warm
weather than the other hypermastigotes.


Family EUCOMONYMPHIDAE


=Eucomonympha imla= Cleveland et al.

_Natural host._--_Cryptocercus punctulatus_, U.S.A., Appalachian and

Class SARCODINA

Order MYCETOZOA

INCERTAE SEDIS


=Peltomyces periplanetae= (Leger)

_Synonymy._--_Peltomyces blattellae._ Sprague (1940a) synonymizes
_Peltomyces periplanetae_, with _Coelosporidium periplanetae_.

_Natural hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, France (Debaisieux, 1927).

_Blattella germanica_, France (Leger, 1909; Debaisieux, 1927).

The organism inhabits the malpighian tubules of cockroaches. Leger and
Debaisieux concluded that their organism was a mycetozoan, but they may
have erred in synonymizing _Plistophora periplanetae_ with the organism
they studied. Debaisieux found intracellular stages of _Peltomyces
periplanetae_ that have not been found in _Plistophora periplanetae_ or
_Coelosporidium periplanetae_.


Order AMOEBINA

Family AMOEBIDAE


=Hartmannella blattae= Ivanic

_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, Yugoslavia (Ivanic, 1937): Found
in the hind gut.


Family ENDAMOEBIDAE

In the following classification we have accepted the conclusions of
Kirby (1945), Kudo (1954), and others that species of _Endamoeba_ are
generically different from species of _Entamoeba_ and that the latter
genus is not a homonym of _Endamoeba._


=Dobellina= sp.

_Natural vectors._--_Blattella germanica_ and/or _Periplaneta
americana_, Egypt (DeCoursey and Otto, 1956, 1957): Thirty out of 261
cockroaches examined contained this protozoan.

The habitat of _E. blattae_ (fig. 2, C) is the hind intestine and rectum
of the cockroach. The incidence of infection varies: Kudo (1925a) found
in 1,255 oriental cockroaches infections in 5 percent in March and 50
percent in the summer; Schubotz (1905) found 5 to 20 percent of the
examined cockroaches to be infested; Yakimov and Miller (1922) found 4
percent of 124 oriental cockroaches infested; Zasukhin (1930) found up
to 50 percent of over 3,000 _B. orientalis_ infested; Meglitsch (1938,
1940) found almost 100 percent infection in _B. orientalis_ kept in a
crowded culture for several weeks. Chen (1933) developed two synthetic
media in which _E. blattae_ could be grown for 45 to 50 days.

Mercier (1907a) observed a fungus, _Nucleophaga_ sp., hyperparasitic in
the nucleus of _Endamoeba blattae_.

lot of 60 cockroaches captured in latrines, two were found that carried
apparently live cysts similar to cysts of _E. coli_.

_Blattella germanica_ or _Periplaneta americana_, Egypt (DeCoursey and
Otto, 1956, 1957): One out of 44 cockroaches collected in a village
harbored _E. coli_.

_Experimental vector._--_Periplaneta americana_, Gold Coast Colony
(Macfie, 1922): In nine experiments cysts of _E. coli_ were fed to the
cockroaches. In seven of the experiments cysts of _E. coli_ were found
in the feces. Cysts were observed in the feces for only one to three
days, and eventually disappeared completely. The cysts appeared to be
unharmed. No amoebae were found.

months.


=Entamoeba= sp.

_Natural vector._--_Periplaneta americana_, Gold Coast Colony (Macfie,
1922): Under the heading "_Entamoeba histolytica_ and _E. coli_" Macfie
(p. 445) stated, "The cockroaches used in these experiments had
previously been carefully examined for amoebic infections a precaution
which was doubly necessary, because some of these insects at Accra had
been found naturally infected."

_Experimental vectors._--_Periplaneta americana_, Gold Coast Colony
(Macfie, 1922): _Entamoeba_, resembling _E. coli_, from feces of the
monkey [_Erythrocebus patas patas_ (Schreber)] were fed to cockroaches,
and on the second to fourth days thereafter apparently healthy cysts
were recovered in the cockroach feces.

_Natural hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, U.S.S.R. (Zasukhin, 1930): This
organism was found in the hind gut of 0.3 percent of over 3,000
cockroaches examined.

_Blattella germanica_ and/or _Periplaneta americana_, Egypt (DeCoursey
and Otto, 1956, 1957): Seventy-four out of 261 cockroaches examined
harbored this protozoan.

(Jameson, 1920); Germany (Foerster, 1939).

In body cavity of host. Cysts containing spores are ingested during
cannibalistic feeding on infected cockroaches. Sporozoites penetrate the
gut wall which later ruptures, freeing the gregarines into the coelom.
There is no apparent pathogenic effect. Jameson (1920) found 81 percent
of _P. americana_ infested with _D. schneideri_.


=Diplocystis= sp.

Laveran and Franchini, 1920a); Brazil (Magalhaes, 1900; Pinto, 1919);
U.S.S.R. (Zasukhin, 1929, 1930).

_Blattella germanica_, U.S.A. (Crawley, 1903); South Africa (Fantham,
1929; Porter, 1930: these appear to be the same record).

_Blattella germanica_ and/or _Periplaneta americana_, Egypt (DeCoursey
and Otto, 1956, 1957).

_Periplaneta americana_, Brazil (Magalhaes, 1900); U.S.A. (Crawley,
1903; 1907; McAdow, 1931); South Africa (Fantham, 1929; Porter, 1930:
these appear to be the same record); Gold Coast Colony (Macfie, 1922).

_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A., Michigan (Ellis, 1913a).

Cockroaches, Germany (Schiffmann, 1919: probably used the oriental
cockroach); Venezuela (Tejera, 1926).

Organism usually found in the intestinal tract of cockroaches where it
is attached to the gut cells. Cysts are passed in the feces.
Occasionally, _G. blattarum_ (fig. 2, J) is found in the body cavity
(Leidy, 1853a; Hall, 1907). Though this is considered to be one of the
commonest of the Sporozoa encountered in cockroaches, DeCoursey and Otto
(1956) found only 10 of 217 _P. americana_ and _B. germanica_, collected
in restaurants in Egypt, infested with this species. Watson (1917) found
a dozen or more in one specimen of _Blatta orientalis_. Zasukhin (1929,
1930) found 2.6 percent of 3,000 oriental cockroaches infected with this
parasite.


=Gregarina fastidiosa= Harrison

_Natural host._--_Aptera fusca_, South Africa (Harrison, 1955): All
mature females were heavily infected; in all specimens there were over
100 parasites in the gut. All nymphs were infected, the earlier instars
more lightly than the later instars. Gregarines were found in all parts
of the gut except the crop and gizzard.


=Gregarina gibbsi= Harrison

_Natural host._--_Temnopteryx phalerata_, South Africa (Harrison, 1955):
Although the cockroaches were found in groups, only 32 percent were
infected and only 10 percent heavily. The gregarines were found in the
anterior mesenteron but none in the hepatic caeca. All cysts were found
in the hind gut or rectum.


=Gregarina illinensis= M. E. Watson

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A., Illinois (Watson,

_Natural host._--_Leucophaea maderae_, Uganda (Watson, 1945): Midgut.
Trophozoites could be seen in sections attached to cells of the
intestinal wall (fig. 2, H).


=Gregarina sandoni= Harrison

_Natural host._--_Melanosilpha capensis_, South Africa (Harrison, 1955):
This gregarine was found in the anterior and middle parts of the
mesenteron and in the hepatic caeca.


=Gregarina thomasi= Semans

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A., Ohio (Semans,
1939): Enteric caeca and midgut.

_Natural host._--_Periplaneta americana_, Brazil (Magalhaes, 1900): In
the coelom and alimentary canal. The host of this parasite (fig. 2, K)
was incorrectly cited as _Blatta orientalis_ by Watson (1916).

gregarine was found in the cockroach's digestive tract; it was also
claimed to be present in new-born nymphs.


Order COCCIDIA

Family ADELEIDAE


=Adelina cryptocerci= Yarwood

_Natural host._--_Cryptocercus punctulatus_, U.S.A. (Yarwood, 1937):
This intracellular parasite was found in the fat body in light
infestations. In heavy infections the coccidia were found in the head,
antennae, mouthparts, muscles, legs, salivary glands, nerve cord, as
well as fat body. Infection in freshly collected specimens was about 3
percent; when large numbers of cockroaches were kept together in
culture, the rate of infection increased because the insects ate their
dead companions.

Cleveland et al. (1934) mentioned a coccidium which was sometimes
generally distributed through the body (head, legs, antennae, etc.) of
_C. punctulatus_; this parasite was probably the species described by
Yarwood.


Order HAPLOSPORIDIA


=Haplosporidium periplanetae= Georgevitch

_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, Yugoslavia (Georgevitch, 1953):
This organism was described from the malpighian tubules of the cockroach
where it apparently occurred in a mixed infection with the

This organism (fig. 2, B) passes its life cycle living free in the
lumina of the malpighian tubules of cockroaches. The elongate
trophozoite is firmly attached to the wall of the tubule as are clusters
of immature spores. Mature spores are freed into the lumina of the
tubules from whence they pass to the exterior. Sprague (1940) examined
about 200 wild-caught _B. orientalis_ and found them to be practically
100 percent infected.

_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, U.S.A., Illinois, West Virginia,
Kentucky (Sprague and Ramsey, 1941, 1942): Found in the epithelial
cells of caeca and midgut. Considerable damage is done to these cells.
Seventy-five percent of 52 _B. orientalis_ harbored the parasite.


=Plistophora periplanetae= (Lutz and Splendore)

_Synonymy._--_Nosema periplanetae_, _Pleistophora periplanetae_ [after
Semans, 1943]. Georgevitch (1953) has pointed out that one may find in
the malpighian tubules of cockroaches a mixed infection of
Microsporidia, Haplosporidia, and Mycetozoa, and that some of the
discrepancies in the earlier literature may be attributed to attempts to
combine in one organism disparate stages belonging to different orders.

This organism lives in the lumen of the malpighian tubules of
cockroaches. The cited authors appear to have been convinced that this
organism was a microsporidian. Georgevitch (1927, 1953) described the
polar capsule and filament characteristic of this order.


=Plistophora= sp.

_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, France (Mercier, 1908a): The
organism parasitized the fat body of the cockroach. Mitoses, often
abnormal, were induced in the fat cells. Infected cockroaches were
easily recognizable by their distended abdomens. The fat body became
chalky white and showed through the intersegmental membranes.

Porter (1930) reported finding an unidentified microsporidian in the fat
bodies of _Blattella germanica_ and _Periplaneta americana_ collected in
South Africa. It may or may not have been a species of _Plistophora_.

Three of 30 cockroaches collected in the basement of a department store
had paramecia in their stomachs but none in the rectum.

_Experimental associate._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Hegner,

of the anterior region of the colon in association with several other
species of protozoa. Only 7.6 percent of 500 cockroaches examined
contained _B. praenucleatum_. The largest number encountered in a single

Yakimov and Miller (1922) found _N. ovalis_ in 68 percent of 124 _B.
orientalis_. Zasukhin (1930) found this organism in 63 percent of over
3,000 _B. orientalis_. Zasukhin (1928, 1934) found a fungus and possibly
a bacterium hyperparasitic in the cytoplasm of _N. ovalis_. _N. ovalis_
has been cultured outside the cockroach in several media (Lucas, 1928;

NEGATIVE FINDINGS

In a recent experimental study Schmidtke (1955) failed to demonstrate a
host-parasite relationship between _Periplaneta americana_ and the
haemosporidian _Toxoplasma gondii_ Nicolle and Manceaux. This protozoan
is a blood parasite in a rodent in North Africa (Kudo, 1954).




XI. HELMINTHS


Intestinal nematodes of the family Thelastomatidae have no apparent
pathological effect on their cockroach hosts. Galeb (1878) has shown
experimentally that oxyurids eat the same food as the host insect and
that if one starves them, by withholding food from the host, the
oxyurids die and disappear. In other words, these worms are not
parasites, in the sense that we use the term in this paper, but
commensals. Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) stated that "all observations
seemed to indicate that the health, fertility and activity of the
heavily infested cockroaches were comparable with those of the
non-parasitised specimens."

Very few papers have dealt with the ecology of the oxyurid parasites of
cockroaches. According to Galeb (1878), usually one species of nematode
is found in a single cockroach, but sometimes two species live together
in the same host (e.g., in _Blatta orientalis_ and _Polyphaga
aegyptiaca_) where they compete for food. Galeb claimed that
_Hammerschmidtiella diesingi_ would replace _Leidynema appendiculata_;
he observed that _H. diesingi_ surpassed _L. appendiculata_ in numbers
and the latter became uncommon in the intestines of the cockroaches. On
the other hand, Sobolev (1937) found that 48 percent of his oriental
cockroaches were infected with both of the above species of nematodes.
The average number of both species was 7.5, and the maximum number was
97; the mean number of _H. diesingi_ was 5.1 and the maximum 64; the
mean number of _L. appendiculata_ was 2.4 and the maximum 33. More than
40 nematodes were found in each cockroach of 1.3 percent of those
examined. These results apparently contradict Galeb's conclusions
inasmuch as the number of each species in mixed infections was
essentially the same as the number found in cockroaches infected by only
one species (see pp. 195 and 197). Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) found
that 29 percent of 222 _Periplaneta americana_ contained both of the
above species of nematodes; whereas 40 percent contained _L.
appendiculata_ only, and 21 percent contained _H. diesingi_ only. The
infestation ranged from 1 to 36 worms per cockroach with averages of 3.8
per male, 5.1 per female, and 2.7 per nymph.

The eggs of some helminths pass unharmed through the guts of cockroaches
that serve as vectors of these ova and have no effect on the insect.
However, helminths that are secondary parasites in cockroaches damage
the insect to varying degrees depending upon the extent of the
infection. Thus the larvae of _Moniliformis moniliformis_ pass through
the gut wall and some may become embedded in the fat tissue (Moore,
1946). First stage larvae of _Oxyspirura mansoni_ also burrow through
the midgut wall into the fat body; Sanders (1929) believed that
_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ could be killed if at one time a sufficient
number of migrating larvae of _O. mansoni_ penetrated the cockroach's
intestinal wall. _Gongylonema neoplasticum_ migrates through the
digestive tract and encysts in the muscles of the thorax and legs of the
host (Fibiger and Ditlevsen, 1914). Infective larvae of _Protospirura
muricola_, after hatching from ingested eggs, pass through the
cockroach's gut wall and encyst mainly in the thorax, around the crop,
and at the bases of the large muscles of the prothoracic legs (Foster
and Johnson, 1939). It is probably generally true that nematodes which
are secondary parasites in cockroaches do some damage to the host's
intestinal tract at least, and they probably also damage other organs in
which they may encyst.

Cockroach tissues may react defensively to infections by parasitic
nematodes. For example, encysted third-stage larvae of _Physaloptera
turgida_ have been found enclosed in a thin, brown, chitinous substance
that was undoubtedly deposited by the tissue of the cockroach (Alicata,
1937). Cysts of similar appearance have been found in cockroaches
infected with _Physaloptera rara_, _P. maxillaris_, _P. hispida_ (Petri,
1950; Hobmaier, 1941; Schell, 1952), and _Gongylonema pulchrum_
(Schell, 1952a); in the latter species the deposit eventually completely
surrounded the nematode larva which was killed and "chitinized."
Apparently these pigmented cysts surround unhealthy or dead larvae and
are secreted as a defensive mechanism by the host (Schell, 1952a).
Oswald (1958) has reported finding similar pigmented cysts in _Blatta
orientalis_ and _Periplaneta americana_ that were experimentally
infected with _Rictularia coloradensis_.

Our classification of the helminths follows Hyman (1951, 1951a).

Family MERMITHIDAE


=Undetermined mermithids=

_Natural Hosts._--_Ectobius pallidus_, U.S.A., Plymouth, Massachusetts
(Roth and Willis, 1957): This mermithid lies coiled in the body cavity
of the host and one end may extend into the thorax. Apparently, the host
is eventually killed and the worms may leave the cockroach ventrally
between the thorax and abdomen (pl. 29, A) or thorax and head.

_Periplaneta americana_, Germany (Bode, 1936): Attacked by "_Mermis_" or
"_Gordius_." It has been suggested that the name _Mermis_ is often
applied without critical identification to immature Nematoda found in
insects (Buxton, 1955).

=Neoaplectana= sp.

_Experimental hosts._--_Blattella germanica_, _Nauphoeta cinerea_, and

found in codling moth larvae, is close to _Neoaplectana chresima_
Steiner but apparently is a new species. _Nauphoeta cinerea_ was very
susceptible to infection; _B. germanica_ and _P. americana_ were less

The life cycle has been studied by Bozeman (1942): He found never more
than four worms in the large intestine of each cockroach. Embryos
developed to "resting" stage in vitro. The resting stage was infective
while the active stage was not. The worms seemed to have no effect on
the vital activities of the host. Alicata (1934b) found that the embryo
undergoes a molt before hatching.

Chitwood (1930) found 75 percent of the German cockroaches examined from
houses in Washington infected. As a rule, one adult female, one or two
males, and possibly two larval females are found in a single individual,
apparently only in the rectum.

Sobolev (1937) found 72 percent of _Blattella germanica_ collected in
Gorkov (U.S.S.R.) infected with _Blatticola blattae_. The mean number of
worms per host was 1.8, the maximum 5. Sondak (1935) found about 30
percent of 788 _B. germanica_ collected in Leningrad to be infected with
_B. blattae_. Groschaft (1956) regularly found only single worms in _B.
germanica_, collected in a laboratory in Prague, except for two females
that contained 2 and 3 worms each.

accepted it as a valid species in describing the variety _javanica_.

_Panesthia brevicollis_, but no such cockroach exists. Van Zwaluwenburg

_Panesthia laevicollis_. According to Gurney (personal communication,
1957) Caudell's notes show that in 1933 he wrote to Dr. Chitwood and
explained that he had compared Cobb's figure of the cockroach with
_laevicollis_ Saussure (figures and description) and had found them the

Cockroach, Venezuela (Tejera, 1926).

According to Hammerschmidt (1847) this worm may be found throughout the
intestinal canal but especially in the small intestine. It is frequently
found in adults and seldom in the nymphs. There were seldom more than 5
to 10 worms in one cockroach and female worms were found more frequently
than males; the male worms were found only in winter and spring while
the females were present at all times of the year. Buetschli (1871)
stated that all stages from those just hatching to mature males and
females are found.

Yakimov and Miller (1922) found _H. diesingi_ in 50.8 percent of 124 _B.
orientalis_ collected in Petrograd. Sobolev (1937) found 96 percent of
_B. orientalis_ infected with _H. diesingi_ with a mean number of 5.6
and maximum number of 22 in one cockroach. Groschaft (1956) found 18 in
one specimen of _B. orientalis_. Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) found
about 50 percent of 222 _P. americana_ infected with _H. diesingi_.
Sondak (1935) found about 36 percent of 412 _B. orientalis_ infected
with either or both _H. diesingi_ and _Leidynema appendiculata_.

Two molts occur during development of the eggs; the first takes place
outside the host resulting in a resting or infective stage. After the
egg in the infective stage is eaten by the host, the second molt occurs
before the egg hatches. Completion of the second molt and hatching
perhaps are connected with ammonia present in the digestive tract; the
ammonia seems to arise from the bacteria present in the gut. There
appears to be a relationship between the intestinal bacteria of the
cockroach and development and hatching of nematode eggs (Todd, 1944).

At the time of oviposition the nematode eggs are in the very earliest
stages of cleavage. In 36 hours a motile, tadpole-like stage is reached
and in a few days the embryo becomes quiescent and nonmotile. This
nonmotile stage is infective whereas the motile embryonic stage is not.
Feeding experiments proved that transmission of the nematode is direct.
The worm reaches sexual maturity in 20 or 30 days after being ingested
by the cockroach (Dobrovolny, 1933).

The bacterium _Streptomyces leidynematis_ Hoffman grows on the cuticle
of _H. diesingi_ (Hoffman, 1953). The bacterium apparently is only
anchored to the nematode and probably obtains its food from the
intestinal contents of the cockroach. See notes under _Leidynema
appendiculata_.

Sanchez's emendation is apparently an error.]

_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, Spain, Grenada (Serrano Sanchez,
1947): Of 2,943 specimens examined, 1,143 were parasitized by oxyurids
and of these 45 percent contained _H. neyrai_.


=Leidynema appendiculata= (Leidy, 1850) Chitwood, 1932

_Synonymy._--_Oxyuris blattae orientalis_ Hammerschmidt, 1847, of
Buetschli, 1871, and _Oxyuris blattae-orientalis_ of Magalhaes, 1900;
_Oxyuris blattae_ Hammerschmidt, 1847, of Galeb, 1878; _Aorurus_
(_Thelastoma_) _appendiculatus_ Leidy, 1850. [Chitwood, 1932.] Serrano
Sanchez (1947) has divided this species into three geographical
varieties as follows: _L. appendiculata_ (Leidy, 1852) (Dobrovolny and
Ackert, 1934) var. _indiana_; _L. appendiculata_ (Leidy, 1852)
(Chitwood, 1932) var. _americana_; _L. appendiculata_ (Serrano Sanchez,
1947) var. _hispana_. However, Basir (1956) does not recognize these
varieties. The Russians recognize _hispana_ (M. B. Chitwood, personal
communication, 1957).

Chitwood (1932) also listed China for distribution of the worm, but we
could not tell which host was involved.

The worms are found in the colon and rectum of the host. Galeb (1878)
found as many as 20 individuals in a single _B. orientalis_. Sobolev
(1937) found 52 percent of _B. orientalis_ infected with _L.
appendiculata_; the mean number of worms per roach was 1.5 and the
maximum 2. Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) found 69 percent of 222 _P.
americana_ infected with this species.

Two molts occur within the egg during development of the larva. The
first molt occurs outside the host resulting in the formation of an
infective resting stage. The second molt occurs inside the cockroach
(Todd, 1941, 1944).

Transmission of the nematode is direct, eggs in the resting embryonated
stage being infective (Dobrovolny and Ackert, 1934).

Hoffman (1953) described a filamentous bacterium, _Streptomyces
leidynematis_ Hoffman, which grows on the cuticle of _L. appendiculata_
in _P. americana_. Leidy (1853) noted the presence of simple,
inarticulate, amorphous filaments, growing from nematodes infecting _B.
orientalis_. Buetschli (1871) and Magalhaes (1900) described similar
filaments adhering to the surface of oxyurids from cockroaches.

Ransom (_in_ Pierce, 1921) states that _G. aquaticus_ may be an
accidental parasite of man. Faust (1955) summarizes the few reported

We have recently found (Roth and Willis, 1960) that two strains of
_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ exist; a parthenogenetic strain (from
Florida), and a bisexual strain (from Hawaii) which does not reproduce
parthenogenetically. The parthenogenetic strain is undoubtedly the form
that has been shown to be the host of _O. mansoni_ in the United States
and Antigua, because only this form is found in the New World. Probably
the parthenogenetic strain was the form involved in most Pacific areas.
However, from internal evidence in his papers, we concluded that
Schwabe, in Hawaii, may well have been working with the bisexual strain
and possibly also with the parthenogenetic strain; if this is true, then
both parthenogenetic and bisexual strains of _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_
may serve as intermediate hosts of the eyeworm.

_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, _Parcoblatta virginica_, _Periplaneta

larvae underwent normal development in all species of cockroaches except
_B. orientalis_ and _P. americana_ in which cysts developed that
contained a reddish-brown pigment; larvae in such cysts were dead or
dying. Eggs of _R. coloradensis_ hatched in the midgut of _B. germanica_
and first-stage larvae entered the hindgut epithelium within 24 hours.
The larvae underwent two molts within a cyst formed by tissues of the
host's gut, the second molt occurring during the twelfth or thirteenth
day. In _Parcoblatta_, cysts were found free in the body cavity as well
as attached to the hindgut. In _B. germanica_ and _S. supellectilium_
the cysts remained attached to the hindgut. Usually over 20 cysts
developed in each infected _Parcoblatta_; fewer than 10 per insect
developed in the other species. Larvae became infective to the
definitive host, the white-footed mouse [_Peromyscus leucopus
noveboracensis_ (Fischer)], as early as the tenth day.

XII. ARTHROPODA


The classification follows Brues et al. (1954) with the following
exceptions. The Acarina are arranged according to Dr. J. H. Camin
(personal communication, 1955). Family Eupelmidae of the Hymenoptera
follows the classification of Peck (1951).


Class ARACHNIDA

In this class, representatives of at least four orders have utilized
cockroaches as food: the whip scorpions, scorpions, spiders, and mites.
Apparently none of these feed exclusively on cockroaches, but the
Philippine forest scorpion _Heterometrus_ (=_Palamnaeus_) _longemanus_
seems to prefer blattids to other insects (Schultze, 1927).

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, U.S.A. (Marx, 1892, 1894): Immature
whip scorpion captured and fed on one or two cockroaches a week. It
lived on this diet for about two years.


=Mastigoproctus= sp.

_Common name._--Whip scorpion.

_Experimental prey._--_Blattella germanica_, U.S.A., Florida [Dr. B. J.
Kaston, personal communication, 1953].


Order SCORPIONIDA

Pocock (1893) noticed that a scorpion whose pectines had come in contact
with a cockroach immediately turned back and ate the insect. He
concluded that the scorpion detected the cockroach by means of the
pectines. However, Cloudsley-Thompson (1955) has demonstrated that the
main function of the pectines is probably the detection of ground
vibrations. He accounted for Pocock's observation by the presence of
sensory spines (presumably tactile) which project from beneath the
pectines. In a house in Arizona, Lyon (1951) observed over 60 scorpions
living in a kitchen cabinet that enclosed a sink. They were apparently
thriving on a heavy infestation of cockroaches. Stahnke (1953) stated
that he used _Periplaneta americana_ as the principal food for scorpions
at the Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory of Arizona State College.
Cloudsley-Thompson (1955a) cited cockroaches as one of the arthropods
that scorpions feed upon.


Family BUTHIDAE


=Buthus australis= (Linnaeus)

_Synonymy._--_Androctonus australis_ [Crabill, personal communication,
1957].

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, England (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1955a):
This African species ate at least one cockroach per week during the
summer months. It can, however, survive four months' starvation and is
particularly adapted to a dry climate (Cloudsley-Thompson, personal
communication, 1956).


=Centruroides gracilis= (Latreille)

_Experimental prey._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Roth, unpublished
data, 1953): Scorpion collected in Florida by Roth and identified by Dr.
M. H. Muma.


=Centruroides hentzi= (Banks)

_Experimental prey._--_Periplaneta australasiae_ and _Pycnoscelus
surinamensis_, U.S.A. (Muma, personal communication, 1953): This
scorpion occurs in large numbers in the Florida citrus groves, together
with _P. australasiae_ which is probably an important natural prey.


=Centruroides vitattus= (Say)

_Natural prey._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ (?), U.S.A., Florida (Muma,
personal communication, 1953). This may have been another species of
this genus, possibly _P. divisa_, as _P. pensylvanica_ is not known from
Florida (Rehn, personal communication, 1958).

_Experimental prey._--_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_,
_Periplaneta americana_, and _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, U.S.A., Florida
(Muma, personal communication, 1953).


=Parabuthus capensis= (Hemprich and Ehrenberg)

_Experimental prey._--"Common house-cockroach" (Pocock, 1893): The
scorpions were collected in Cape Town, South Africa.


Family CHACTIDAE


=Euscorpius germanus= (Koch)

_Synonymy._--_Euscorpius carpathicus_ [Cloudsley-Thompson, 1955a].

_Experimental prey._--_Blattella germanica_, England? (Pocock, 1893).

_Periplaneta americana_, nymphs, England? (Cloudsley-Thompson, personal
communication, 1956): This scorpion is found naturally in southern
Europe and North Africa.


=Euscorpius italicus italicus= (Herbst)

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches including nymphs of _Periplaneta_,
England? (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1951): The cockroaches had to be disabled
before the scorpion would feed on them. Prey is apparently detected by
tactile and auditory senses, sight being poorly developed and not used.
The scorpion is found in southern Europe and North Africa.


Family VEJOVIDAE


=Hadrurus arizonensis= Ewing

_Experimental prey._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Stahnke, 1949):
This record is a photograph showing the scorpion eating the cockroach.


Family ISCHNURIDAE


=Hormurus caudicula= (Koch)

_Experimental prey._--Cockroach, Australia (McKeown, 1952): This record
is a photograph showing the scorpion feeding on a cockroach.


Family SCORPIONIDAE


=Heterometrus longimanus= (Herbst)

_Synonymy._--_Palamnaeus longimanus_ [Cloudsley-Thompson, personal
communication, 1956].

_Natural prey._--"Large wood cockroach," Philippine Islands (Schultze,
1927): On several occasions Schultze found fragments of wings and legs
of the large wood cockroach in a scorpion cavity, under a rotten log.

_Experimental prey._--_Leucophaea maderae_, _Periplaneta americana_, and
other species of Blattidae, Philippine Islands (Schultze, 1927):
Blattids seemed to be the favored food. This scorpion is usually found
in humid, damp places in forest and jungle. Schultze describes in detail
feeding behavior of the scorpion and method of capturing its prey.


=Urodacus novaehollandiae= Peters

_Experimental prey._--_Periplaneta americana_, Australia (Glauert,
1946): An injured cockroach was accepted at once by the scorpion, which
held the insect in its claws and tore it with the alternately moving
chelicerae. The scorpion ate all the soft parts and most of the
sclerotized exoskeleton.


Order ARANEIDA

Many observations of spiders feeding on cockroaches are quite general,
and many observers have failed to identify either the spider or its
prey. Belt (1874) stated that "the cockroaches that infest houses in the
tropics ... have numerous enemies--birds, rats, scorpions, and spiders."
When Belt tried to drive a cockroach toward a large cockroach-eating
spider, the insect rushed away from him until it came within a foot of
the spider when it would double back, never advancing nearer.

Beebe (1925) watched a giant "wood roach," which was in the grasp of a
2-inch ctenid spider, fly through the window of his British Guiana
laboratory. While the spider ate the cockroach, the insect gave birth to
51 nymphs. Sonan (1924) reported that large gray spiders devour nymphs
and adults of _Periplaneta americana_ and _P. australasiae_ in Formosa;
this spider also occurs on Hiyakejima Island and Okinawa. Passmore
(1936), who has produced some excellent photographs of tarantulas,
stated that they destroy cockroaches. Rau (1940) stated that American
and oriental cockroaches were the principal item of diet of a friend's
pet tarantula for several years. Kaston (personal communication, 1953)
successfully fed a tarantula with _Periplaneta americana_.

Bristowe (1941) found that the British species of _Ectobius_ are readily
accepted by _Xysticus_, _Clubiona_, _Drassodes_, _Zelotes_, _Tarantula_,
and the web-builders _Ciniflo_ and _Aranea_. The British domestic
cockroaches were accepted by _Tegenaria_ and _Ciniflo_, spiders large
enough to overpower them, and were useful as food for tropical
avicularids, ctenids, and sparassids in captivity.


Family THERAPHOSIDAE


=Avicularia avicularia= (Linnaeus) and =Avicularia= sp.?

_Common name._--Bird-eating spider.

_Natural prey._--_Periplaneta americana_, Trinidad (Main, 1924, 1930):
The remains of the host were compressed into globular form by the spider
after it had extracted the nutritive parts.


=Phormictopus cancerides= (Latreille)

_Experimental prey._--Cockroach, West Indies (Wolcott, 1953).


Family SPARASSIDAE


=Heteropoda venatoria= (Linnaeus)

_Synonymy._--_Heteropoda regia_ Fabricius.

_Common names._--Banana spider (Comstock, 1912); huntsman spider
(Gertsch, 1949); big brown house spider (Bryan, 1915).

_Natural and experimental prey._--Cockroaches, Bermuda (Verrill, 1902);
Puerto Rico (Sein, 1923; Wolcott, 1924a; Petrunkevitch, 1930a); Hawaii
(Bryan, 1915, Williams et al., 1931); British Guiana (Moore _in_
Williams et al., 1931); Panama (Gertsch, 1949); New Zealand (adventive)
(Parrott, 1952); England (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1953); Comstock (1912);
Hawaii (Pemberton, 1917).

This (pl. 30, A) is a tropical species frequently imported into northern
localities with bunches of bananas (Comstock, 1912; Cloudsley-Thompson,
1953). Adults measure 3 to 4 inches across with bodies over an inch
long. They seldom leave their resting places during the day, but are
active at night and search for food. The female does not spin a web
(Bryan, 1915; Gertsch, 1949). The spider turns the cockroach over onto
its back at the instant of seizure and holds it firmly against the
substrate. The cockroach dies in 10 minutes and is gradually rolled up
by the spider as it sucks out the nutriment (Moore _in_ Williams et al.,
1931). The spider does not attempt to bite when captured, but if it
does, its bite is said to be painful but not dangerous
(Cloudsley-Thompson, 1953). Zimmerman (1948) found scores of
_Periplaneta australasiae_ breeding in rock piles in Hawaii; also
present were large numbers of these spiders and centipedes which
presumably preyed upon the cockroaches.


Family THERIDIIDAE


=Latrodectus indistinctus= Pickard-Cambridge

_Common name._--Button spider.

_Natural prey._--_Karnyia discoidalis_, South Africa, Western Cape
Province (Hesse, 1942): The nest is constructed on the ground among
grass stems or other vegetation. Preferred sites are slight hollows,
hoof imprints, etc. Nests are roughly tubular. The remains of insects
are entangled in the walls of the nest where they form dense
accumulations. Predatory activities of the spider are limited to an area
close to the tubular entrance to the nest and do not extend beyond the
trapping strands near the entrance. Capture is dependent upon accidental
contact of the insect with sticky threads surrounding the entrance. This
spider apparently attacks any insect or arachnid that becomes entangled
in the nest. In an examination of 40 nests, remains of 6 _K.
discoidalis_ were found.


=Latrodectus mactans= (Fabricius)

_Common names._--Black widow, hourglass, or shoe-button spider.

_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, Puerto Rico (Petrunkevitch, 1930). U.S.A.,
Florida, on shipboard (Anonymous, 1939): This is a presumptive host
record, as the spiders were not reported as having been seen eating
cockroaches; however, heavy infestations of both were found together.


Family LYCOSIDAE


=Lycosa helluo= Walckenaer

_Experimental prey._--Young nymphs of _Diploptera punctata_, U.S.A.
(Eisner, 1958): Larger nymphs and adults repelled the spider by ejecting
a repellent secretion, which has been identified as a mixture of
_p_-benzoquinone and its derivatives by Roth and Stay (1958).


=Lycosa= sp.

_Experimental prey._--_Supella supellectilium_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis,
unpublished data, 1953): The lycosid (pl. 30, B-E) was probably _L.
avida_ Walckenaer (tentatively identified by Dr. B. J. Kaston from a
photograph).


Order ACARINA

Family PHYTOSEIIDAE


=Blattisocius tineivorus= (Oudemans)

_Synonymy._--_Blattisocius triodons_ Keegan [Baker and Wharton, 1952].

_Natural host._--_Blattella germanica_, U.S.A. (Keegan, 1944): Three
mites found on 238 cockroaches examined; others taken in debris from
floor of cockroach cage (Keegan, 1944). Members of this family are
predaceous (Baker and Wharton, 1952).


Family LAELAPTIDAE


=Blattilaelaps nauphoetae= Womersley

_Natural host._--_Nauphoeta cinerea_, Australia, Brisbane (Womersley,
1956).


=Coleolaelaps= (?) sp.

_Natural host._--_Gromphadorhina portentosa_, the hosts were imported
into U.S.A. from Madagascar via Europe (Roth and Willis, unpublished
data, 1958): The mites (pl. 12, C) were tentatively determined by Dr. E.
W. Baker.


=Hypoaspis= sp.

_Natural host._--_Panesthia australis_, imported into U.S.A. from
Australia (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1955): Cockroach
determined by J. A. G. Rehn. Generic determination of mite made by Dr.
R. W. Strandtmann (Camin, personal communication, 1955).


Family UROPODIDAE


=Uropoda= sp.

_Natural host._--_Blattella humbertiana_, Formosa (Takahashi, 1940).
Nymphs of the cockroach may be destroyed (Takahashi, 1940). Uropodids
frequently attach themselves to insects, especially in nymphal stages
but probably are harmless (Baker and Wharton, 1952).


Family DIPLOGYNIIDAE


=Undetermined diplogyniid=

_Natural host._--_Panesthia australis_, imported into U.S.A. from
Australia (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1955): Cockroach
determined by J. A. G. Rehn. According to Dr. J. H. Camin (personal
communication, 1955) this is a new genus and new species in the
subfamily Diplogyniinae, and is most closely related to the genus
_Lobogynioides_. Mites of this family live as ectoparasites and
commensals on beetles and possibly other insects (Baker and Wharton,
1952).


Family ANOETIDAE


=Histiostoma feroniarum= (Dufour)

_Natural host._--_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, Germany (Roeser, 1940):
Though not parasitic, the mites at times became so numerous that the
insects were hindered in their movement, were unable to feed, and died.
The mites were introduced with soil and leaves and had originally been
attached to millipedes, waterfleas, and sowbugs.

The deutonymphs, hypopial forms, or travelers are found on insects; the
other stages are found in decaying organic matter (Baker and Wharton,
1952).


Family ACARIDAE


=Caloglyphus spinitarsus= (Hermann)

_Natural host._--_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, Germany (Roeser, 1940): See
notes following _Histiostoma feroniarum_ above.


=Caloglyphus= sp.

_Natural hosts._--_Blattella germanica_ and _Periplaneta americana_,
U.S.A. (Piquett and Fales, 1952): Mite feeds on organic matter but can
reduce the vigor of a cockroach colony.


=Tyrophagus lintneri= (Osborne)

_Common name._--Mushroom mite.

_Associate._--_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis,
unpublished data, 1953): Mite determined by Dr. E. W. Baker (personal
communication, 1953). Although this mite was found on the cockroach, it
is a known pest in stored foods (Baker and Wharton, 1952) and probably
was brought into the culture with food. Rau (1924) reported that the
food of _Blatta orientalis_ often became infested with this species, but
it did not affect the health or mortality of the cockroaches in his
culture.


=Tyrophagus noxius= A. Z.

_Natural host._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis,
unpublished data, 1953): Mite determined by Dr. E. W. Baker (personal
communication, 1953). Mites were found in the oothecal cavity of a
female cockroach that had been isolated for her entire adult life. The
mites were in a closely packed mass behind a plug of what appeared to be
feces, disintegrated eggs, and dried blood; none of the mites were
visible until this plug was removed. Baker (personal communication,
1953) stated that the mite is probably not parasitic and that species of
the genus feed on organic matter.


=Rhizoglyphus tarsalus= Banks

_Natural host._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Rau, 1940a): Not
normally parasitic on cockroaches, but the mites became so numerous at
times they would attack living as well as dead and dying cockroaches.


Family GLYCIPHAGIDAE


=Chaetodactylus= sp.

_Synonymy._--_Trichotarsus_ sp. [Baker and Wharton, 1952].

_Natural host._--_Leucophaea maderae_, Puerto Rico (Sein, 1923): Mites
found on cockroach's thorax and particularly among the folds of the
wings (Sein, 1923). Mites of this genus are found infesting organic
matter (Baker and Wharton, 1952).


Family PODAPOLIPODIDAE


=Locustacarus= sp.

_Natural hosts._--_Diploptera punctata_ and _Nauphoeta cinerea_, U.S.A.
(Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1954): Mite genus determined by Dr.
E. W. Baker (personal communication, 1954). The mites cluster thickly on
intersegmental membranes, particularly around the coxae and neck.
Despite a heavy infestation, the colony of _Nauphoeta_ thrived for
several years. This mite was found first on _N. cinerea_ and possibly
transferred to _D. punctata_ when the latter was brought into the
laboratory from Hawaii.


Family IOLINIDAE


=Iolina nana= Pritchard

_Natural hosts._--_Blaberus craniifer_ (originally from a culture at
Harvard University) and _Diploptera punctata_ (originally from Hawaii),
U.S.A., Pennsylvania (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1953;
Pritchard, 1956): The mites usually attached near the wing bases of the
insects. Morphologically, the species is intermediate between certain
predaceous and phytophagous mites (Pritchard, 1956).


Family PTERYGOSOMIDAE


=Pimeliaphilus podapolipophagus= Traegardh

_Common name._--Cockroach mite.

_Natural hosts._--_Parcoblatta_ sp., U.S.A. (Edmunds, 1953a).

_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Piquett and Fales, 1952).

Cockroaches. U.S.A. (Baker and Wharton, 1952).

_Experimental hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, and
_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Cunliffe, 1952).

Eggs of this mite (fig. 4) are usually laid indiscriminately in the
rearing cages, rarely on the host. Eggs are coated with a sticky
secretion which enables those laid on the host to adhere. Hatching
occurs in 6-11 days at 90-95 deg. F., and in 9-11 days at 80 deg. F. The newly
hatched larva starts to feed immediately on the cockroach. Larval stage
lasts 4-6 days, rests 2-3 days, and molts. During the single nymphal
instar, the mite feeds on the host and moves about for 6-7 days. The
mite then rests 3-4 days before molting. Entire life cycle covers a
period of 28-32 days. Adult mite lives 2-3 weeks, during which time it
can produce 2-3 batches of from 1 to 20 eggs; the usual batch is about
12 eggs. The mites are unable to live on cockroach feces, cast skins, or
dead cockroaches. Mites died within 4-5 days unless live cockroaches
were supplied. Parasitism was proved by detecting radioactivity in mites
that had fed on cockroaches which had been previously fed radioactive
NaCl (Cunliffe, 1952).

The mites can destroy laboratory cultures of cockroaches (Piquett and
Fales, 1952; Edmunds, 1953a). A cockroach attacked by 25 mites succumbed
after about an hour, falling on its back; it died after 5 hours
(Cunliffe, 1952).

When found in homes and offices, these mites are an indication of the
presence of cockroaches; the mite has been twice accused of biting
people (Baker et al., 1956).


RECORDS OF UNIDENTIFIED MITES

_Natural hosts._--_Aglaopteryx facies_, Puerto Rico (Sein, 1923): Four
red "tick" nymphs found under wings of female.

_Blaberus craniifer_, U.S.A., Florida (Hebard, 1917): "A number of lice
[mites] are present on many of these specimens [28[F][F]]."

_Blaberus discoidalis_, adventive from West Indies, taken in Scotland
(Stewart, 1925): A considerable number of mites were all over the body
and hind wings.

_Blatta orientalis_, Germany (Cornelius, 1853): Ex sexual organs of
male.

_Blattella germanica_, U.S.A., in laboratory (Parker, 1939): Under
conditions of high humidity, the cockroaches became heavily infested
with mites. In cages where the infestation was heavy, an abnormally
large number of females dropped their oothecae, and the percentage of
eggs hatching was low.

_Parcoblatta uhleriana_, U.S.A., North Carolina (Hatcher, 1939): Hypopi
of mites were found deeply embedded in the fat body of two individuals.

Mites in the hypopial stage attach to insects by which they are
dispersed. Hypopi have been found in the gill chambers of a mollusk and
in the gonads of a millipede (Baker and Wharton, 1952).

_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A., in laboratory (Fisk, 1951): The insects
were sluggish and molted with difficulty. Gold Coast Colony (Macfie,
1922): Larvae of a tarsonemid mite were found in the feces.

_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, Hawaii (Illingworth, 1915): During the
summer the soil was literally swarming with young of various stages.
Early in September most of the adults were dead and all were covered
with mites. U.S.A., Connecticut, in laboratory (Zappe, 1918a). Hawaii,
in laboratory (Schwabe, 1950): Some of the cockroaches apparently died
from mite infestations.

CONTROL OF MITES IN COCKROACH COLONIES

Fisk (1951) eliminated the mites [possibly _Pimeliaphilus
podapolipophagus_ (Baker et al., 1956)] in his cockroach colony by using
a 5-percent spray and a 5-percent dust of p-chlorophenyl,
p-chlorobenzene sulfonate. The exterior of the cockroach containers were
sprayed with the solution and the interior, including the insects, were
dusted. Within a month the mites had disappeared and the vigor of the
cockroach colony improved. Piquett and Fales (1952) used flowers of
sulfur and general sanitary procedures for eliminating the mites in
laboratory colonies of _Blatta orientalis_; they cleaned the dishes
every few days and applied grease around the edges of the containers to
prevent new mite invasions. Qadri (1938) employed similar control
measures.


Class CHILOPODA

Large centipedes which entered houses in India probably sought out
cockroaches (Maxwell-Lefroy, 1909). In Puerto Rico, centipedes entered
homes to which they were attracted by cockroaches (Sein, 1923). In
Hawaii, centipedes preyed on insects generally but especially on
cockroaches (Bryan, 1915). Sonan (1924) reported that in Formosa and
Okinawa Islands a species of centipede 5 to 6 inches long comes into the
houses and devours both adults and nymphs of _Periplaneta americana_ or
_P. australasiae_. Zimmerman (1948) found _P. australasiae_ breeding by
scores in rock piles in Hawaii accompanied by large numbers of
_Scolopendra_ and large spiders that probably preyed upon the
cockroaches.


Order SCUTIGEROMORPHA

Family SCUTIGERIDAE


=Scutigera coleoptrata= (Linnaeus)

_Synonymy._--_Scutigera forceps_ Rafinesque [Crabill, 1952].

_Common name._--House centipede.

_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, U.S.A. (Felt, 1909; Back, 1947; Auerbach,
1951; Crabill, 1952; and others): This predator-prey relationship seems
to be based on good circumstantial evidence (Crabill, personal
communication, 1953).

_Experimental prey._--_Blattella germanica_, newly hatched nymphs and
adult female, U.S.A. (Snodgrass, 1930; Roth and Willis, unpublished
data, 1953).

_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis, unpublished data,
1953).

_Supella supellectilium_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis, unpublished data,
1953): See plate 31.

Our specimen caught a small American cockroach nymph that we placed in
its jar. Before it had finished its meal, it caught and held two other
nymphs with its legs while it continued to feed on the first. The body
of this centipede reaches a maximum length of 27 mm. and it is usually
found in basements, dark corners, or in spaces in the walls (Auerbach,
1951). Introduced from Europe, this species is now widespread in the
United States (Crabill, 1952).


=Allothereua maculata= (Newport)

_Synonymy._--_Scutigera maculata_ [Crabill, personal communication,
1957].

_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, Malay peninsula, Batu caves (Ridley in
Annandale et al., 1913): This is a presumptive host record.


Order SCOLOPENDROMORPHA

Family SCOLOPENDRIDAE


=Scolopendra cingulata= Latreille

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, England (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1955):
After capture in France, this specimen was kept for four weeks without
food. She was then fed medium-sized nymphal cockroaches of which she ate
an average of about one per week throughout the summer. Adult
cockroaches were attacked only after they had been disabled.


=Scolopendra morsitans= Linnaeus

_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, Guadeloupe (Lherminier, 1837).

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, India, Nagpur (Jangi, 1955): As soon
as the centipede became aware of its prey, it rapidly embraced the
cockroach within its legs and with its fangs gripped the insect's
thorax. The predator continued to hold the prey with its fangs while its
mouth parts prodded the victim's body. After feeding on an adult
cockroach, the centipede is not inclined to kill another for 2-3 days.


=Scolopendra subspinipes= Leach

_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, Hawaii (Williams et al., 1931): This is a
common species with a body length of 6 or more inches. It is reported to
be a great enemy of cockroaches.


=Scolopendra= sp.

_Natural prey._--_Ectobius panzeri_, England (Lucas, 1911, 1920): When
captured, the centipede was holding a live cockroach which it had
apparently just caught. The insect was held beneath its captor's body,
ventral surface upward, by several of the anterior legs while the
centipede fed.


Class INSECTA

We have found representatives of only 10 orders that have preyed on or
parasitized cockroaches: Beetles, flies, bugs, ants, wasps, stylops, and
cockroaches occurred in nature; the others resulted from feeding
cockroaches to captive insects or were laboratory observations.


Order ODONATA

Family AESHNIDAE


=Anax strenuus= Hagen

_Common name._--Giant Hawaiian dragonfly.

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, Hawaii (Williams, 1936): The
dragonfly nymph was fed with medium large cockroaches and other insects.


Order BLATTARIA

In this chapter the relations of other arthropods to cockroaches are
either as parasites or as predators. Certain cockroaches have turned the
tables on their adversaries and become predators themselves. This aspect
of cockroach behavior is discussed in chapter XVI. Other associations of
cockroaches, as commensals with other insects and as associates of other
cockroaches, are discussed in chapters XV and XVII.


Order ORTHOPTERA

Family MANTIDAE


=Hierodula tenuidentata= (Saussure) (?) (Serville)

(Pl. 32)

_Experimental prey._--_Blatta orientalis_, _Diploptera punctata_,
_Eurycotis floridana_, _Leucophaea maderae_, _Nauphoeta cinerea_,
_Neostylopgya rhombifolia_, and _Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A.
(Rilling, personal communication, 1957): Mrs. Rilling wrote us that with
the exception of _N. rhombifolia_, all the above cockroaches were
readily eaten. All the mantids initially rejected _N. rhombifolia_ after
grasping and making a brief attempt to chew the cockroaches. However, if
specimens of _N. rhombifolia_ were left in the jars with the mantids,
the cockroaches were usually eaten within the next 24 hours. _N.
rhombifolia_ ejects an odorous substance when seized and the mantids
probably ate these insects after most of this secretion had been
depleted. It is highly probable that the secretion of _N. rhombifolia_
may deter the mantid's attack, but it should be pointed out that, with
the possible exception of _N. cinerea_, all the other species fed to
these mantids give off odorous substances when seized or disturbed.
Apparently, certain naturally repellent compounds will deter this
mantid, whereas others that are presumed to be repellent will not;
however, the nutritional state of the mantid is undoubtedly a factor
which may limit the effectiveness of certain repellent secretions
against this predator.

_Byrsotria fumigata_, teneral males, and _Periplaneta australasiae_,
nymphs, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1958).

_Diploptera punctata_, U.S.A. (Eisner, 1958).


=Mantis religiosa= Linnaeus

_Common name._--European mantis.

_Experimental prey._--_Nauphoeta cinerea_, and _Periplaneta americana_,
U.S.A. (Rilling, personal communication, 1957).


=Metallyticus semiaeneus= Westwood

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, Borneo (Shelford, 1916).


=Sphodromantis viridus= (Forskal)

_Synonymy._--_Sphodromantis bioculata_ Burmeister [Gurney, personal
communication, 1958].

_Experimental prey._--_Blatta orientalis_, Egypt (Adair, 1923): This
species of cockroach was apparently used regularly as food for the
mantid in the laboratory.


=Stagmomantis carolina= (Johansson)

_Common name._--Carolina mantis.

_Experimental prey._--_Blattella germanica_ and _Periplaneta americana_,
U.S.A. (Breland, 1941): The mantids were fed 1-2 German cockroaches
daily. One female mantid consumed 10 adult German cockroaches plus one
ootheca and part of another in 2.5 hours. An adult German cockroach was
consumed in an average of 8.5 minutes (range 5.5-15 minutes).

_Blatta orientalis_, nymphs, and _Diploptera punctata_, U.S.A. (Roth and
Willis, unpublished data, 1953).

=Tenodera aridifolia sinensis= Saussure

_Common name._--Chinese mantis.

_Experimental prey._--_Nauphoeta cinerea_ and _Periplaneta americana_,
U.S.A. (Rilling, personal communication, 1957).


Family GRYLLACRIDIDAE


=Diestrammena apicalis= Br. v. Wattenwyl

and

=Diestrammena japanica= Blatchley

_Natural prey._--Cockroach eggs, Japan (Asano, 1937): These are
questionable records. Asano found _D. apicalis_ and _D. japanica_
beneath his house near several empty cockroach oothecae which appeared
to have been eaten into. He assumed from the condition of the oothecae
and the proximity of the stone crickets that the insects had devoured
the cockroach eggs.

_Experimental prey._--Eggs of _Blattella germanica_ and _Periplaneta
japanica_, Japan (Asano, 1937): Seven eggs of _B. germanica_ (obtained
from an ootheca being carried by a female) and eggs of _P. japanica_
(presumably in oothecae) were fed to both species of stone crickets in
the evening. The eggs were devoured by the next morning.


Order DERMAPTERA

Family FORFICULIDAE


=Undetermined earwigs=

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, France (Chopard, 1938): According to
Chopard, Brisout de Barneville in 1848 indicated that earwigs in
captivity can be fed small cockroaches.


Order HEMIPTERA

Family LYGAEIDAE


=Clerada apicicornis= Signoret

_Natural prey._--Cockroach, Hawaii (Illingworth, 1917): This predaceous
bug is commonly found about buildings. Illingworth says that Kirkaldy
suspected that it fed on small blattids and that Dr. Perkins saw it
feeding on a dead cockroach.


Family REDUVIIDAE


=Spiniger domesticus= Pinto

_Natural prey._--_Periplaneta americana_, Brazil, Matto Grosso (Pinto,
1927, 1927a): This bug preys principally on cockroaches and was observed
infesting the walls of dwellings where it preyed on _P. americana_.


=Triatoma arthurneivai= Lent and Martins

_Natural prey._--_Monastria_ sp., Brazil, Minas Gerais (Martins, 1941):
This bug probably feeds on cockroaches of this genus, as well as on
rodents.


=Undetermined reduviids=

_Natural prey._--_Arenivaga roseni_ and _Polyphaga saussurei_, Turkmen
S.S.R. (Vlasov and Miram, 1937): These desert cockroaches are found in
burrows of rodents and desert turtles around Ashkhabad. Reduviids are
their main enemies. Vlasov (1933) found nymphs of _Reduvius christophi_
Jak. and _R. fedtschenkianus_ Osch. in similar burrows in this same
area, although he did not specifically cite them as enemies of the
desert cockroaches.


Family NEPIDAE


=Ranatra= sp.

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, U.S.A. (Hoffman, 1924).


Order NEUROPTERA

Family ASCALAPHIDAE


=Undetermined larva=

_Experimental prey._--_Blattella germanica_, Kenya Colony (Someren,
1924).


Order DIPTERA

From the few observations that have come to our attention, it seems that
flies are comparatively rare parasites in cockroaches.


Family PHORIDAE


=Megaselia= sp.

_Host._--Eggs of _Parcoblatta_ sp., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952a).


Family CONOPIDAE


=Stylogaster stylata= (Fabricius)

_Hosts._--Cockroaches, Brazil (Souza Lopes, 1937): L. Travassos was
quoted as having observed this species pursue cockroaches that were
escaping columns of the army ant _Eciton_ sp. Souza Lopes (1937) stated
that the female deposits eggs on the cuticle of the host near the end of
the body; the egg is barely inserted and two recurrent hooks prevent it
from falling off. Souza Lopes (1937) also observed other species of
_Stylogaster_ pursue Orthoptera, but he was unable to devote proper
attention to the behavior of the flies.


=Stylogaster= spp.

_Hosts._--_Chorisoneura_ sp., Brazil (Souza Lopes, 1937): An adult
specimen was found in a museum collection with an egg of _Stylogaster_
attached to the posterior end of its abdomen.

Cockroaches, Panama (C.W. Rettenmeyer, personal communication, 1959):
"Seven species were collected hovering over army ant swarms and a few
flies were seen apparently attacking cockroaches that had been flushed
by the ants."


Family LARVAEVORIDAE


=Calodexia= (?) =venteris= Curran

_Hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_, Brazil (Souza Lopes, 1937): Obtained
complete evolution of the parasite in this host. This may have been an
experimental host.


=Calodexia= spp.

_Hosts._--Cockroaches, Panama (Rettenmeyer, personal communication,
1959): Swarms of army ants are accompanied by about 20 species of
_Calodexia_. These flies larviposit on the cockroaches, crickets, and
possibly other arthropods that are flushed from cover by the ants.
Larvae were found in one(?) cockroach. Larvae from an adult of
_Calodexia_ were introduced experimentally into a cockroach and
successfully reared.


=Undetermined tachinids=

_Hosts._--_Eurycotis floridana_, from Florida (Roth, unpublished data,
1953): Three larvae (det. by W.W. Wirth) were found in a living adult
male.

_Panesthia australis_, from Australia (Roth, unpublished data, 1957):
Reared from a wild-caught cockroach that was maintained in a laboratory
colony.

Cockroaches, Australia (E. F. Riek, personal communication, 1955):
Reared from some of the larger species.


Family MUSCIDAE


=Coenosia basalis= Stein

_Host._--Eggs of _Parcoblatta_ sp., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952a).


Family SARCOPHAGIDAE


=Sarcophaga omani= Hall

_Host._--_Arenivaga bolliana_, Texas (Wirth, personal communication,
1953): Specimens in U.S. National Museum.


=Sarcophaga lambens= Wied.

_Synonymy._--_Sarcophaga sternodontis_ (Towns.).

Hoffman (1927) claimed that approximately 40 percent of some specimens
of _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ collected in southern Haiti were
parasitized by _S. lambens_. However, according to entomologists at the
University of Puerto Rico Agricultural Experiment Station, Hoffman was
incorrect in his observations: _S. lambens_ was never reared from a
living insect and had been recovered only from dead cockroaches and
other dead insects and was considered saprophytic rather than parasitic
(Schwabe, 1950b).


=Sarcophaga= spp.

Sanjean (1957) reared various species of sarcophagid larvae on
_Periplaneta americana_ which were freshly killed or chopped up; first
instar larvae were also introduced into the body cavity of cockroaches
which had their heads and legs removed. Adult sarcophagids were
collected and freshly killed American cockroaches used as bait.


Order COLEOPTERA

Family CARABIDAE


=Harpalus pennsylvanicus= De Geer

_Experimental prey._--_Cryptocercus punctulatus_, U.S.A. (Cleveland et
al., 1934): This beetle is often found in the galleries of _C.
punctulatus_ in nature. In the laboratory it killed and devoured
cockroaches as large as itself.


Family DYTISCIDAE


=Rhantus pacificus= Boisduval

_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, disabled, Hawaii (Williams, 1936):
This beetle, which is common in mountain streams, located wounded
cockroaches in an aquarium by sense of smell or taste rather than sight.


Family LAMPYRIDAE


=Undetermined larva=

_Experimental prey._--_Parcoblatta virginica_, adult female (pl. 33, C),

_Synonymy._--_Nephrites australis_ Riek [Selander, 1957].

_Natural host._--_Cutilia_ sp., Australia Capital Territory (Riek,
1955): Two females emerged from one host.


=Riekella nitidioides= Selander

_Synonymy._--_Nephrites nitidus_ of Riek not Shuckard [Selander, 1957].

_Natural host._--_Platyzosteria_ sp., Tasmania (Riek, 1955).

_Synonymy._--_Nephrites_ sp. [Selander, 1957].

_Natural host._--_Platyzosteria castanea_, Australia Capital Territory
(Riek, 1955).

_Biology of Australian Ripidiini._--The Australian species of Ripidiini
are parasites of apparently endemic, ground-dwelling species of
cockroaches. There is some correlation between host subfamily and
parasite genus: _Riekella_ spp. [= _Nephrites_] have only been bred from
Blattinae. _Rhipidioides_ spp. occur only in the closely related
Ectobiinae and Pseudomopinae. _Neonephrites_ and _Neorhipidius_ also
occur in the Pseudomopinae. _Paranephrites_ occurs in the Panchlorinae.
There is some evidence that the parasitized cockroaches migrate onto
trees when the larval parasite is mature, as pupae have only been found
on the trunks of eucalyptus trees. In all species the larva leaves the
host dorsally through an intersegmental membrane. The host continues to
live for a few days after the parasite emerges. The larva attaches
itself to bark on the tree trunk by a few strands of silk before
pupating. The larviform, wingless female remains near the pupal skin and
is sought out by the winged male. The eggs are laid in a mass around the
pupal skin (Riek, 1955).


=Ripidius[5] boissyi= Abeille

Balduf (1935) lists _Ripidius boissyi_ as parasitic on nymphs of
_Ectobius pallidus_ giving Abeille de Perrin (1909) as a source for
this information. However, Abeille de Perrin simply presumed that _R.
boissyi_ parasitized _E. pallidus_ because he collected this cockroach
in the same habitat as the beetle. Abeille de Perrin suggested that the
species of the genus _Ripidius_ lived in the bodies of cockroaches, but
there are no rearing records, as far as we know, of _R. boissyi_ from
cockroach hosts.


=Ripidius denisi= Chobaut

Chobaut (1919), in France, collected both _R. denisi_ and _Ectobius
pallidus_ when beating an oak tree. Because of the known association of
other species of _Ripidius_ with cockroaches, he presumed that this
beetle was parasitic on _E. pallidus_, a cockroach common in this
beetle's habitat.


=Ripidius pectinicornis= Thunberg

_Synonymy._--_Symbius blattarum_ Sundevall [Leng, 1920].

_Natural hosts._--_Blattella germanica_, on shipboard (Sundevall, 1831);
Germany (Aclogue and Fowler, _in_ Burr, 1899a); on steamship "Samui"
(Stamm, 1936); on cruiser "Duguay-Trouin" (Barbier, 1947); Hawaii
(Williams, 1946a): This last record was based on a specimen dissected
from an adult German cockroach collected on an airplane from the South
Pacific. The parasite was reported as _Ripidius_ sp. by Williams, but
Weber (1948) made the specific identification.

_Ectobius pallidus_? Abeille de Perrin (1909) stated that _R.
pectinicornis_ was first described by Sunders [sic] as _blattarum_
because it had been captured in the body of _Ectobia livida_. We presume
that Abeille de Perrin was referring to Sundevall's work in which the
host was given as _Blattella germanica_.

_Periplaneta americana_, on shipboard (Sundevall, 1831): One nymph only.

With the exception of the single nymph of _P. americana_, _R.
pectinicornis_ apparently attacks only adult females and nymphs of _B.
germanica_. Barbier (1947) found only _B. germanica_ parasitized,
although both _Blatta orientalis_ and _Supella supellectilium_ were
prevalent on board the ship. Primary larvae of the parasite failed to
parasitize _Supella_.

_Adult behavior._--The winged male is relatively active compared to the
apterous female; it runs around, flies well, and jumps on the female
when in her vicinity. The female remains stationary and lays eggs around
her by bending her long ovipositor (Sundevall, 1831). The eggs (50-100)
are laid among a network of silk fibers secreted by the female. The
female dies after completing oviposition (Barbier, 1947).

_Development._--The eggs hatch after 14 days, and the primary
(triungulin) larvae ascend the host's legs to its body; the larvae then
cut the intersegmental membrane between the metasternum and first
abdominal segment of the cockroach, in order to enter the host's abdomen
(Barbier, 1947). Chobaut (1892) first suggested this method of attack by
the ripiphorid larva. As the parasites develop, the abdomen of the host
becomes swollen. Developing larvae apparently eat the host's fat body,
leaving the vital organs until the last. Parasitized female hosts were
sterile and the eggs, when formed, never hatched. Development of the
ootheca was also inhibited. There were usually two larval parasites per
host, but three or four were found several times (Barbier, 1947).
Sundevall (1831) found only one larva per cockroach except one host
which, when crushed, yielded five. Stamm (1936) found three hosts
infested with five larvae each. In a little over 100 cockroaches, Stamm
found 10 that were parasitized.

The day before the parasite leaves the host, the cockroach shows an
abrupt uneasiness and runs about, finally falling over on its back. The
parasite larva emerges from the host through an opening it makes in the
membrane between penultimate and last tergite. The host dies a few hours
after the larva has left. The larva seeks a sheltered area and pupates
within 48 hours. Adults emerge in 9 days (females) and 13 days (males)
(Barbier, 1947).

_Distribution._--Adult males have been collected in light traps in
Hawaii (Van Zwaluenburg, 1946), and the first female was reported by
Weber (1948); the parasite is now established in the islands around
Pearl Harbor (Dr. F. X. Williams, personal communication, 1953). The U.
S. National Museum has specimens of _R. pectinicornis_ from England,
Guatemala, Hawaii, Panama, and from Florida and Georgia in the U. S.
(Dr. E. A. Chapin, personal communication, 1953). Kono (_in_ Asano,
1937) reported two species in Japan. It is noteworthy that all these
records are from localities adjacent to oceans and on ships; none are
from interiors of continents. The only biological data were obtained
from parasites found on board ships. Sundevall (1831) believed that the
parasites boarded his ship with their hosts during loading in Calcutta,
since before that not any were seen on board. Barbier (1947) suggested
that the parasite must be spread very easily in ports between
neighboring ships by parasitized cockroaches in baskets or sacks of
provisions.


=Ripidius scutellaris= Heller

_Natural hosts._--Blattidae, Philippine Islands (Schultze, 1925).


Family DERMESTIDAE


=Dermestes ater= De Geer

_Common name._--Black larder beetle.

_Natural prey._--_Blatta orientalis_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis,
unpublished data, 1953): _Dermestes ater_ is generally a scavenger, but
we have seen adult beetles, which had developed in our cockroach colony,
clinging to and feeding on living oriental cockroaches, eventually
killing them; the beetles probably attack only the weakened or injured
cockroaches in a culture. This was a natural infestation of a laboratory
culture by a predator.

_Experimental prey._--_Blattella germanica_, oothecae, U.S.A. (Roth and
Willis, 1950): The beetle larvae can penetrate unhatched oothecae of the
German but not those of the American or oriental cockroaches.


=Dermestes= sp.

_Natural prey._--_Blatta orientalis_, oothecae, U.S.A., Missouri: Rau
(1924) stated that _Dermestes_ larvae often infest the egg cases of this
cockroach; it is probable that Rau was referring to cockroaches in
laboratory cultures.


Order STREPSIPTERA

Pierce (1909) predicted that the Blattoidea and the Grylloidea would be
the only groups of the Orthoptera which would be parasitized by
Strepsiptera. Essig (1926) made the statement that certain cockroaches
are among the hosts of Strepsiptera. E. F. Riek (personal communication,
1952) found a strepsipteron in a late nymph of _Cutilia_ sp. from
Waroona, Western Australia; he wrote us, "The female parasite is
extruded between a pair of sternites towards the base of the abdomen and
appears to belong to the family Halictophagidae." This is the only
record that we have been able to find of a strepsipteron parasitizing
cockroaches.


Order HYMENOPTERA


PREDATORS AND PARASITES OF COCKROACH EGGS

Wasps from at least six families of Hymenoptera have been recorded as
developing on cockroach eggs. All the Evaniidae are presumed to be
parasitic in the egg capsules of cockroaches (Clausen, 1940; Townes,
1951), although hosts for many of the described species have yet to be
discovered. The presence of evaniids in dwellings indicates the presence
of cockroaches (Gross, 1950). At times these wasps may become a
nuisance; a family in Worthington, Ohio, complained of the evaniid wasps
that they found on the windows and in other areas of their home, but
they were apparently not annoyed by the oriental cockroaches in the
basement (Edmunds, 1953).

The known parasites of cockroach eggs are listed below with summaries of
their biology.


Family EVANIIDAE


=Acanthinevania princeps= (Westwood)

_Synonymy._--_Evania princeps_ [Dr. H. Townes, personal communication,
1956].

_Natural host._--Cockroach eggs, Australia (Froggatt, 1906).


=Brachygaster minutus= (Olivier)

_Synonymy._--_Evania minuta_ Olivier [Kieffer, 1920].

_Natural hosts._--_Blattella germanica_, Europe? (Schletterer, 1889;
Kiefer, 1912; Crosskey, 1951.)

_Ectobius lapponicus_, Europe? (Schletterer, 1889; Kieffer, 1912;
Crosskey, 1951.)

_Ectobius panzeri_ var. _nigripes_? Great Britain (Blair, 1952): This is
a presumptive record. The wasp was collected at Niton and Headon Hill,
Isle of Wight, an area in which this variety of _E. panzeri_ was the
only species of cockroach known to occur.

_Ectobius_ sp., England (Cameron, 1955, 1957): Natural History Museum
records.

Adult wasps have been collected on _Asparagus officinalis_ Linnaeus
(Schmiedeknecht _in_ Schletterer, 1889; Crosskey, 1951). Thompson's
(1951) citation of records of _B. minutus_ and _Evania appendigaster_
from _Blatta orientalis_ and _Blattella germanica_, and Cameron's (1957)
citation of these records and one from _Ectobius lapponicus_, all
attributed to Kadocsa (1921), are almost certainly in error. Kadocsa
(1921, p. 33) listed these wasps as egg parasites of cockroaches but not
necessarily in Hungary and did not name specific cockroach hosts.

The present writers have found no information, other than host reports,
on the biology of _Brachygaster minutus_. The records of this wasp
parasitizing _B. germanica_ may trace back to Schletterer, but his
listing may not have been an original observation. Since the female of
_B. germanica_ carries its ootheca attached to the abdomen until or just
before the eggs hatch, it would seem that the female of _B. minutus_ (if
the host records are valid) must oviposit into the ootheca of this
species while it is still being carried by the female; this would not
necessarily be true for the other hosts which drop the egg case long
before the eggs hatch.

_Distribution._--Europe: Sweden, Russia, England, France, Germany,
Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy (Kieffer, 1920).


=Evania appendigaster= (Linnaeus)

_Synonymy._--_Evania desjardinsii_ Bordage, _Evania laevigata_ Latreille
[Dalla Torre, 1901-1902].

_Natural hosts._--_Blatta_, "exotic species" (Westwood, 1854, 1954a).

_Blatta orientalis_, Europe? (Schletterer, 1886; Howard, 1888, Kieffer,
1912); Egypt? (Alfieri, 1914; Adair, 1923). [Girault (1907, 1914)
erroneously attributed another record to Marlatt (1902);[see footnote 6].
See also notes under _Brachygaster minutus_ with respect to Kadocsa.]

_Blattella germanica_? (Girault 1907, 1914). [This record is obviously
an error. Girault attributed the record to Marlatt (1902); see footnote
6.]

_Cutilia soror_, Hawaii (Swezey, 1929; Zimmerman, 1948).

_Leucophaea maderae_ (Schletterer, 1889; Bordage, 1896; Kieffer, 1912):
These records are probably erroneous inasmuch as this cockroach
incubates its eggs internally (Roth and Willis, 1954). Later, after
finding that _L. maderae_ is ovoviviparous, Bordage (1913) admitted
having misidentified a parasitized ootheca from some other species; he
concluded that the developing eggs of this species are protected against
egg parasites because they are carried within the female. Clausen
(1940), in classifying the placement of parasitic wasp eggs in relation
to the host, erected the category: Egg placed in the embryo while the
latter is still within the parent. He stated that although this behavior
was not definitely known to occur, it probably could occur. However, the
records cited above do not indicate that the alleged parasitization
followed this pattern.

_Neostylopyga rhombifolia_, Hawaii (Swezey, 1929).

_Periplaneta americana_, Europe (Schletterer, 1889; Bordage, 1896;
Kieffer, 1912); Reunion Island (Bordage, 1913); Puerto Rico (Sein,
1923); Jamaica (Gowdey, 1925); Hawaii (Swezey, 1929); Palestine
(Bodenheimer, 1930); U.S.A., Florida (Ashmead, 1900); Maryland (Piquett
and Fales, 1952); Saudi Arabia, Jedda (Cameron, 1957); Canton Island and
Samoa (Dumbleton, 1957).

_Periplaneta americana_ or _P. australasiae_, Formosa (Sonan, 1924).

_Periplaneta australasiae_, U.S.A., Florida (Ashmead, 1900); Hawaii
(Swezey, 1929; Zimmerman, 1948). [Girault (1914) erroneously attributed
another record to Marlatt (1902); see footnote 6, above.]

_Experimental host._--_Blatta orientalis_, U.S.A. (Haber, 1920).

Relatively little detailed information was known about this wasp (fig.
5), one of the earliest parasites of cockroach eggs to be discovered,
until Cameron (1957) studied its biology. Arnold (Kirby and Spence,
1826) discovered that the genus _Evania_ parasitized _Blatta_, but did
not know whether the wasp developed on the cockroach eggs or in the
nymphs. MacLeay (Westwood, 1843) determined that _Evania_ developed
within the oothecae of cockroaches. Westwood (1854a) found the larvae,
pupae, and adults of _E. appendigaster_ in egg cases of an unidentified
species of cockroach found on orchids received from Calcutta.

_Adult behavior._--Adult wasps visited flowers of parsley, _Petroselium
crispum_, and fennel, _Foeniculum vulgare_ (Margretti _in_ Schletterer,
1886; Crosskey, 1951). In Hawaii the adult wasps have been seen resting
on leaves coated with honey dew (Williams et al., 1931); _Evania_ sp.
were attracted to the honey dew secreted by a diaspine scale insect
(Williams, 1931). Adults lived two to three weeks in captivity with
ample food and water (Cameron, 1957).

_Oviposition._--Shelford (1912, 1916) erroneously supposed that
_Evania_, by means of her cleaverlike abdomen, opened the ootheca at the
crista and then deposited her egg or eggs on the eggs of the cockroach.
Haber (1920) observed and described oviposition. The female wasp
crawled over the surface of the ootheca, actively vibrating her
antennae, and settled with the axis of her body parallel to the axis of
the egg case as it lay upon its right side. Lying on her right side, the
wasp extended her ovipositor and punctured the ootheca in the fifth cell
on the left side; she remained in this position for about 15 minutes.
Cameron (1957) described similar oviposition behavior that lasted about
half an hour. Kieffer (1912) and Crosskey (1951) stated that the female
deposits her eggs before the walls of the ootheca harden.

  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Evania appendigaster._ Left, dorsal view, x 8.
  Right, side view, x 5. (Reproduced with permission. British Museum
  [Natural History], 1951, figs. 1A and 1B.)]

_Development._--Kieffer (1912) stated that the larvae in this family eat
the cockroach eggs and pupate in the ootheca without forming a cocoon.
Smith (1945) stated that the larva feeds on one cockroach egg after
another until all are destroyed; by that time it is full grown and it
pupates within the ootheca. Cameron (1957) found that there are five
larval instars and that in material from Saudi Arabia there are three or
possibly four generations a year.

_Distribution._--Tropical and subtropical parts of the world as far
north as New York City, and all of Europe except the northern part
(Kieffer, 1920; Townes, 1949). The wide distribution of _Evania_ has
been attributed to the abundance of host cockroaches on ships between
the Tropics (Haldeman, 1847). Kieffer (1903) appears to have shown some
correlation between the numbers of species of cockroaches found in
various geographical regions and the numbers of species of evaniids
found in similar regions. However, the number of blattids he listed is
small.


=Evania dimidiata= Fabricius

_Synonymy._--_Evania abyssinica_ Westwood [Schletterer, 1889].

_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, Egypt? (Alfieri, 1914).


=Evania subspinosa= Kieffer

_Natural host._--_Periplaneta_ sp., Fiji (Lever, 1946): Although Lever
(1946) listed this species as a cockroach-egg parasite, he did not state
that he actually reared it from _Periplaneta_ oothecae.


=Hyptia dorsalis= of Ashmead

_Synonymy._--Dr. H. Townes, (personal communication, 1956) believes that
this wasp was probably either _H. reticulata_, _H. harpyoides_, or _H.
thoracica_; it is not possible to tell which without reexamining
Ashmead's specimens; these apparently have been lost.

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A., Mississippi
(Ashmead, 1900).

=Hyptia harpyoides= Bradley

_Natural hosts._--_Parcoblatta virginica_, U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952a,
1953a, 1954).

_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A. (Muesebeck, 1958).

_Parcoblatta uhleriana_, U.S.A., Natick, Mass.: Ootheca collected by L.
Roth, May 17, 1956; wasp emerged June 12, 1956 (pl. 33, B); determined
by Dr. H. Townes. The keel region of the ootheca of _P. uhleriana_ (pl.
18, B) is different from that of any other species of _Parcoblatta_
(Hebard, 1917; Lawson, 1954) so there can be no doubt as to the species
of cockroach parasitized by this wasp.

_Development._--The last instar larva overwinters inside the cockroach
ootheca (Edmunds, 1954). Five oothecae yielded one parasite each
(Edmunds, 1953a).

_Distribution._--Canada, Ontario. U.S.A.: New Hampshire and Minnesota to
South Carolina, Mississippi, Texas, and Kansas. Upper and Lower Austral
Zones (Townes, 1951).

=Hyptia reticulata= Say

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A., Missouri (Rau,
1940).

Adult wasps have been taken on parsnip, _Pastinaca sativa_ (Robertson,
1928).

_Distribution._--U.S.A.: Pennsylvania to Florida and Louisiana. Mexico.
Upper Austral to Tropical Zones (Townes, 1951).


=Hyptia thoracica= (Blanchard)

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds,
1952a, 1953a, 1954).

_Adult behavior._--Copulation was rapid, lasting only a few seconds.
Blooms of _Asmorrhiza longistylis_ were placed in a cage with adult
wasps. The insects were attracted to and fed on the flowers (Edmunds,
1954).

_Development._--Entire contents of ootheca are eaten by the single
larva. Last instar larva overwinters inside the ootheca. Emergence in
Ohio was around the middle of June. The emergence hole made by this
genus was about 2 mm. in diameter. The hole was made at the top side of
the ootheca near one end. Adult took about 65 minutes to emerge from the
time its mandibles first broke through the oothecal wall. (Edmunds,
1954.)

_Distribution._--Canada, Ontario, U.S.A.: Connecticut to Wisconsin,
south to Florida and Texas. Upper Austral to Tropical Zones. (Townes,
1951.)


=Hyptia= sp.

_Natural host._--_Cariblatta delicatula_, Cuba (Hebard, 1916a); Parasite
identified by Ashmead.


=Hyptia= sp. (undescribed)

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta_ sp., U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952a).


=Prosevania punctata= (Brulle)

_Synonymy._--_Evania punctata_ Brulle [Townes, 1949].

_Natural and experimental hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, Istrian
Peninsula (Fahringer, 1922); Algeria (Cros, 1942); U.S.A., Ohio
(Edmunds, 1954).

_Blattella germanica_? Europe? (Girault 1907, 1914); Europe (Fahringer,
1922). [The records on this host are extremely doubtful. Girault
erroneously cited Marlatt (1902) as the source of this record; see
footnote 6, page 236. Fahringer, however, claimed that he obtained
seven female parasites from oothecae of _Blattella germanica_. He placed
female parasites with adults of _B. germanica_ in a glass cage. As soon
as oothecae could be seen between folds of a woolen rag, he removed all
the larger cockroaches and held the oothecae until the parasites
emerged. Fahringer may have been dealing with a different species of
cockroach, because placing oothecae in crevices (or between folds of
rag) is a habit foreign to _B. germanica_, the female of which usually
carries her ootheca until hatching or until about a day before. Edmunds
(1953b) could not induce this wasp to parasitize eggs of _B.
germanica_.]

_Periplaneta americana_, Istrian Peninsula (Fahringer, 1922); Palestine
(Bodenheimer, 1930); U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952, 1953b, 1954).

_Adult behavior._--The wasps (pl. 33, A) are very active; they walk
about a great deal and fly short distances. They are often found in
abundance in buildings infested with the larger domiciliary cockroaches
where they may reproduce for many generations without leaving the
premises. Specimens have also been collected outdoors. (Edmunds, 1953,
1954.) As the adult walks about, the laterally compressed abdomen moves
up and down like a waving flag; because of this behavior, these insects
are commonly known as ensign-flies. Cros (1942) maintained adults 17
days without food. Edmunds (1954) fed adults on unidentified flowers in
the laboratory. He also maintained them for 20 days after capture on a
5-percent honey solution.

_Oviposition._--A female _P. punctata_ selected oothecae of _P.
americana_ for oviposition and ignored those of _B. orientalis_ and
_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ in the same cage. Oviposition was
accomplished as described for _Evania appendigaster_. One ootheca was
turned over onto its right side by the wasp before she oviposited.
(Edmunds, 1952.) Although there seemed to be a "preferred" position for
oviposition, it was not obligatory. The usual position was for the
female to face the keel of the ootheca, but she also oviposited from the
opposite side or, rarely, directly down into the side of the ootheca.
The average time spent by females in 10 ovipositions was 29 minutes
(range 16-62 minutes). The wasp apparently could not determine whether
the eggs had been previously parasitized. The wasp laid her egg between
the cockroach eggs rather than in them and she oviposited into oothecae
that had just been dropped and those two weeks old or older. On three
occasions nymphal cockroaches emerged within a few hours after the wasp
had oviposited. (Edmunds, 1954.) Apparently, for successful
parasitization the wasp must oviposit before the cockroaches have
reached the final stages of preemergence development. Edmunds (1954)
placed females of _Periplaneta americana_ that were carrying oothecae,
into cages with _Prosevania_; some of the female wasps showed
considerable interest in the attached oothecae, but he observed
oviposition only into egg cases that had been dropped by the
cockroaches.

Cros (1942) described an interesting reaction that he called
"instinctive hostility" of the oriental cockroach toward _Prosevania_. A
wasp was placed in a jar in which a cockroach had just deposited its
ootheca. The wasp tried to oviposit into the egg case but was upset and
pursued by the cockroach. The cockroach placed herself over the ootheca,
standing high on her legs, and remained there motionless. The wasp then
approached from the rear, slipped under the cockroach, and, unnoticed by
the cockroach, climbed on the ootheca and oviposited successfully.

_Development._--In _Blatta orientalis_: The developmental period was
completed in 40-57 days in summer and fall (Cros, 1942). Time from
oviposition to emergence of adult varied from 45-177 days; three
parthenotes from an oviposition by an unfertilized female wasp developed
in 45-53 days (Edmunds, 1954). In _Blattella germanica_: Almost 4 weeks
spent in development (Fahringer, 1922). In _Periplaneta americana_:
Three wasps developed in 127 days (Edmunds, 1952). Only one parasite
develops in each ootheca. There were three generations a year in Ohio.
(Edmunds, 1954.) In Algeria there were two to three generations per
year. The adult emerged from the ootheca through a hole 4 mm. in
diameter. (Cros, 1942.) Parthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs
produced only males (Edmunds, 1954).

_Distribution._--Eastern U.S.A., from New York and Ohio south to Georgia
(Townes, 1949). Europe, Syria, Palestine (Kieffer, 1920).


=Szepligetella sericea= (Cameron)

_Synonymy._--_Evania sericea_ Cameron [Townes, 1949, personal
communication, 1956]. _Evania impressa_ Schletterer [Townes, p. c.,
1956].

_Natural hosts._--_Cutilia soror_ and _Neostylopyga rhombifolia_, Hawaii
(Swezey, 1929).

_Periplaneta americana_ and _Periplaneta australasiae_, Hawaii (Swezey,
1929; Zimmerman, 1948).

_Periplaneta_ sp., Fiji (Lever, 1943, 1946).

Adults are sometimes found resting on leaves covered with honey dew
(Williams et al., 1931).


=Zeuxevania splendidula= Costa

_Natural hosts._--_Loboptera decipiens_, France (Lavagne, 1914; Genieys,
1924).

Picard (1913) believed that _Z. splendidula_ parasitized _L. decipiens_
and not its eggs; however, Lavagne (1914) explained the true
relationship by dissecting two specimens of _Z. splendidula_ from
oothecae of _L. decipiens_.

The following information is taken from Genieys (1924):
_Oviposition._--Wasp egg is introduced into the still-soft ootheca
before the wall hardens. Some oothecae had four oviposition scars but
never contained more than two parasite eggs. _Development._--Larva
commences development in July or August. Only one larva completes
development, but it eats all the eggs in the ootheca. The wasp passes
the winter as a last instar larva and pupates in the spring; the adult
emerges during the spring or in June. _Hyperparasitism._--About 10
percent of the oothecae of _Loboptera decipiens_ that were parasitized
by _Z. splendidula_ were also hyperparasitized by an eulophid (see
_Syntomosphyrum ischnopterae_, p. 249).


Family CLEONYMIDAE


=Agamerion metallica= Girault

_Natural hosts._--_Ellipsidion australe_, Australia, Queensland (Dodd,
1917): "the parasite when ready to emerge fully occupies the whole space
of the destroyed eggs."

Cockroach, Australia, New South Wales (Dr. B. D. Girault, 1915a).


Family ENCYRTIDAE


=Blatticida pulchra= Ashmead

_Natural host._--Cockroach eggs on orange leaves, Australia, New South
Wales (Gahan and Peck, 1946). According to Dr. A. B. Gurney the ootheca
associated with the type specimens of the wasps in the United States
National Museum is possibly _Balta_ sp. (Burks, personal communication,
1956).


=Blatticidella ashmeadi= (Girault)

_Synonymy._--_Blatticida ashmeadi._ _Blatticida_ Girault, 1915, is
preoccupied by _Blatticida_ Ashmead, 1904. In 1923 Gahan and Fagan
renamed _Blatticida_ Girault, _Blatticidella_. [Burks, p. c., 1956.]

_Natural host._--Cockroach, Australia, Queensland (Girault, 1915).


=Cheiloneurus viridiscutum= (Girault)

_Synonymy._--_Cristatithorax_ Girault = _Cheiloneurus_ Westwood [Mercet,

_Natural host._--_Ellipsidion australe_, Australia, Queensland (Dodd,
1917).


=Comperia merceti= (Compere)

_Synonymy._--_Comperia merceti_ var. _falsicornis_ Gomes [Peck, 1951].

_Natural hosts._--_Blattella germanica_, Brazil, Distrito Federal
(Gomes, 1941): In the English summary of his paper, Gomes states that
_C. merceti_ var. _falsicornis_ was reared from _B. germanica_. However,
in the body of the paper, he states that the _supposed_ origin of the
parasite was the ootheca of _B. germanica_. Burks (personal
communication, 1956) does not believe that this wasp parasitizes the
eggs of _B. germanica_. We (unpublished data, 1957) exposed six oothecae
of _B. germanica_ to _C. merceti_. In order to retard water loss the
oothecae were removed from the females by cutting the insects in two so
that each ootheca remained attached to the posterior part of the
abdomen. No wasps developed in these oothecae.

_Supella supellectilium_, U.S.A., Kansas (Lawson, 1954a); Hawaii
(Zimmerman, 1944; Compere, 1946; Keck, 1951).

_Adult behavior._--Males and nonovipositing females showed a flea-like
jumping tendency. Adults were attracted to light and were found near
windows. Both sexes pursued an erratic course in walking and continually
touched the surface with their antennae. (Lawson, 1954a.)

_Oviposition._--The wasp (pl. 34, B) selected a site on an ootheca with
the sheath of her ovipositor; it was uncertain whether there was a
definite preference for oviposition sites. Wasp tended to choose a
nearly horizontal position for oviposition. She preferred to oviposit
into eggs about 2 weeks old, although she would place eggs in oothecae
less than a week old and in embryos in the green band stage. There were
1-50 oviposition punctures per ootheca. (Lawson, 1954a.)

_Development._--If enough wasp larvae were present, they ate all eggs in
an ootheca. Occasionally wasps developed in one end of an ootheca while
cockroaches developed in the other; when this occurred, the cockroach
nymphs always emerged last. The developmental period was 30-41 days at
room temperature. There were 5-25 parasites per ootheca. The single exit
hole in the ootheca varied from 0.6 to 0.9 mm. in diameter. (Lawson,
1954a.)

_Distribution._--U.S.A.: New Jersey south to Florida, west to Illinois,
Kansas, and Arizona. West Indies; Central and South America; Hawaii.
(Burks, personal communication, 1956.)


=Dicarnosis alfierii= Mercet

_Natural hosts._--"_Phyllodromia_" sp., Egypt (Mercet, 1930): According
to Mercet, Dr. Alfieri claimed that this wasp parasitized one of the
species of "_Phyllodromia_" found in Egypt, namely, _Phyllodromia_
[= _Blattella_] _germanica_, _Phyllodromia_ [= _Supella_] _supellectilium_
and/or _Phyllodromia treitliana_. We do not know to which modern genus
the host of this wasp belonged.

Cockroach, Egypt? (Mercet in Compere, 1938.)


=Eutrichosomella blattophaga= Girault

_Natural host._--Cockroach, Australia, Queensland (Girault, 1915).


Family EUPELMIDAE[7]


=Anastatus blattidifurax= Girault

_Natural host._--Cockroach, Australia, Queensland (Girault, 1915).


=Anastatus floridanus= Roth and Willis

_Natural host._--_Eurycotis floridana_, U.S.A., Florida (Roth and
Willis, 1954a).

_Experimental hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, _Eurycotis floridana_, and
_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis, 1954a).

_Adult behavior._--Female wasps are sexually receptive almost
immediately on leaving the ootheca. Mating takes 3-4 seconds. Males mate
repeatedly and may fertilize several females; females may also mate more
than once. At about 80 deg. F. the female wasps lived 2-4 days, males one
day.

_Oviposition._--The female wasp first probes the ootheca with her
sheathed ovipositor until she finds an acceptable spot; she then drills
through the wall of the ootheca with her ovipositor. One female
oviposited for 5 hours, but briefer periods were more usual. We have
seen six or more females ovipositing simultaneously into an ootheca of
_Eurycotis floridana_. One female was seen to feed on material that
oozed from the oviposition puncture. The wasp (pl. 34, A) may oviposit
into the ootheca of _E. floridana_ while it is still being carried by
the female, as well as in oothecae that have been dropped and which have
hard walls. Eggs 36 days old were successfully parasitized.

_Development._--In _Eurycotis floridana_: In the laboratory, development
was completed in 34-36 days at about 85 deg. F. This time was regulated to
some extent by the number of parasites in the ootheca.

There is evidence that larvae eat unhatched wasp eggs or other larvae.
In 34 oothecae exposed to many female wasps, the maximum number of
parasites to emerge was 306; yet an average of 601 wasp larvae were
dissected from four oothecae that had each been exposed to 50 female
wasps one week earlier. The larvae usually eat all the host eggs.
Cockroach eggs that were not eaten by the wasp larvae sometimes
developed but usually failed to hatch. Adult wasps made one to six
emergence holes in the ootheca; the average number in 42 oothecae was
two holes.

_Number of parasites per ootheca._--In _Blatta orientalis_: One of 111
oothecae exposed to female wasps yielded 48 parasites. In _Eurycotis
floridana_: One ootheca parasitized in the field yielded 68 parasites; 8
oothecae exposed to single wasps for their entire lifespan yielded an
average of 50 +- 6 parasites (range 23-81); 34 oothecae exposed to many
wasps for their entire lifespan yielded an average of 198 +- 8 parasites
(range 93-306). In _Periplaneta americana_: Nine oothecae of 152 exposed
to the wasps were found to be parasitized when dissected; 11 adults
emerged from one ootheca; no parasites emerged from the other 8
oothecae.

_Sex ratio._--4 [F][F]:1 [M] from ovipositions by isolated females. In
the one ootheca collected in the field, the ratio was 21.6 [F][F]:1 [M].
Parthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs produced only males.


=Anastatus tenuipes= Bolivar y Pieltain

_Synonymy._--_Anastatus blattidarum_ Ferriere. Dr. C. Ferriere (personal
communication, 1957) is of the opinion that his _A. blattidarum_ is a
synonym of _A. tenuipes_. He stated "I have never been able to see the
unique type of _A. tenuipes_ B. y P., which is in Madrid, but the
description agrees with _A. blattidarum_. I had not yet knowledge of
Bolivar's description, when describing my species. The parasite of
cockroaches eggs [_Supella supellectilium_] should be called _A.
tenuipes_ Bol." Mani (1938) synonymized _Solindenia blattiphagus_ Mani
with _Anastatus blattidarum_.

_Natural hosts._--_Supella supellectilium_, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan
(Ferriere, 1930, 1935); U.S.A., Arizona (Flock, 1941); Egypt (Alfieri,
_in_ Hafez and Afifi, 1956). Ohio (Hull and Davidson, 1958).

_Periplaneta americana_, India (Burks _in_ Roth and Willis, 1954a).

Cockroach, Hawaii (Weber, 1951); India (Mani, 1936).

The following is based on parasites that developed on eggs of _Supella
supellectilium_ (Flock, 1941): _Adult behavior._--Wasp may be seen
running rapidly on walls in buildings infested with the cockroach host.
The wasp rarely flies but hops proficiently; when disturbed it can hop
from several inches to several feet. The female licks up the drop of
fluid that oozes from the oviposition puncture. Females die in a few
days, but if fed honey and water may live two weeks. _Oviposition._--The
female selects an ootheca by feeling with her antennae. Flock stated,
without citing experimental evidence, that the age of the egg case was
apparently the chief factor determining choice. The wasp took 15-45
minutes to oviposit. Three females oviposited simultaneously into a
single ootheca; a single female repeatedly oviposited into one ootheca
at intervals. _Development._--Completed in an average of 32.6 days at a
constant temperature of 82 deg. F.

_Number of parasites per ootheca._--Average about 10.7 (range 4-16)
(Flock, 1941); 15 (Ferriere, 1935).

_Sex ratio._--4 [F][F]:1 [M] (Ferriere, 1935); average of 6 [F][F]:1 [M]
(Flock, 1941). Parthenogenesis occurs; the unfertilized eggs produced
only males (Flock, 1941).

_Distribution._--U.S.A.: Maryland, south to Florida, west to Illinois,
Kansas, and Arizona. Guatemala; Hawaii; India; Egypt; Sudan. (Burks,
personal communication, 1956).

Family PTEROMALIDAE


=Pteromalus= sp.?

_Natural host._--_Leucophaea maderae_?, Jamaica (Westwood, 1839; Sells,
1842). [This host is undoubtedly an error. Sells stated that the ootheca
which contained 96 unidentified chalcids had 16 dentations at the edge;
the description fits the ootheca of an oviparous cockroach and not that
of _L. maderae_ (see Roth and Willis, 1954). Westwood (1839, footnote p.
423) stated that at the meeting of the Entomological Society in 1838 Mr.
Sells exhibited 94 specimens of a small _Pteromalus_ (apparently
identified by Westwood) obtained from one cockroach ootheca. This same
record of Sells was published posthumously in 1842, although in this
paper he identified the host ootheca as "_Blaberus_" _maderae_. Cameron
(1955) lists a European record of _Pteromalus_ sp. from _Periplaneta
americana_ citing Girault (1914) as the source of the record. Girault's
record was apparently taken from Westwood's footnote mentioned above.]


=Systellogaster ovivora= Gahan

_Natural hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, U.S.A., Illinois (Gahan, 1917).

_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, Canada, Ontario (Judd, 1955).

_Parcoblatta_ sp., U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952a, 1953a).

"Blattid," U.S.A., Maryland (Gahan, 1917).

One ootheca of _P. pensylvanica_ yielded 14 parasites with a sex ratio
of 2.5 [F][F]: 1[M] (Judd, 1955). The average number of parasites in 11
oothecae of _Parcoblatta_ sp. collected in 1950-51 was 27 wasps
(Edmunds, 1952a, 1953a). The adults made two to three emergence holes in
the ootheca (Edmunds, 1953a; Judd, 1955).


Family EULOPHIDAE


=Melittobia chalybii= Ashmead

_Natural host._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A., Missouri (Rau, 1940a):
_M. chalybii_ is normally a parasite of Coleoptera and Hymenoptera
(Peck, 1951). This is the only record from cockroach eggs. Burks
(personal communication, 1956) stated that this species will attack any
insect to which it is exposed and can be a serious pest in insect
cultures of practically any insect order. In nature it seems to prefer
the nests of aculeate Hymenoptera; Rau suggested that the parasites were
probably brought into his laboratory with mud nests of _Sceliphron
caementarium_ (Drury).


=Mestocharomyia oophaga= Dodd

_Natural host._--_Ellipsidion australe_, Australia, Queensland (Dodd,
1917).


=Syntomosphyrum blattae= Burks

_Natural hosts._--_Parcoblatta_ sp., U.S.A., Ohio (Burks, 1952; Edmunds,
1952a, 1953a): Ten oothecae yielded an average of 92 wasps (Edmunds,
1952a). Five oothecae, collected a year later, yielded an average of 74
wasps; adults sometimes made two to three exit holes in the ootheca
(Edmunds, 1953a).

Cockroach, U.S.A., West Virginia (Burks, 1952).


=Syntomosphyrum ischnopterae= (Girault)

_Synonymy._--_Epomphaloides ischnopterae_ Girault [Peck, 1951].

Parker and Thompson (1928) called their hyperparasite _Tetrastichus_ sp.
However, Dr. B. D. Burks (personal communication, 1955) has examined the
teneral specimens which Parker and Thompson deposited in the U.S.
National Museum; he stated that the species is apparently
_Syntomosphyrum ischnopterae_. In view of the experimental work by
Parker and Thompson (see below), this wasp may prove to be a
hyperparasite on evaniids in cockroach oothecae rather than a primary
parasite on cockroach eggs. (See _Zeuxevania splendidula_, p. 243.)

_Natural hosts._--_Ischnoptera_ sp. [probably _Parcoblatta_ sp. (Rehn,
personal communication, 1958)]. U.S.A., Maryland (Girault, 1917).

_Zeuxevania splendidula_ Costa (an evaniid in the oothecae of _Loboptera
decipiens_), France (Parker, 1924; Parker and Thompson, 1928).

The following information is from Parker and Thompson (1928): _Adult
behavior._--Courtship and mating were accomplished as soon as adults
emerged, and in a manner similar to that in other chalcids. The females
oviposited only into oothecae that were parasitized by _Zeuxevania_,
never into normal, nonparasitized oothecae. _Oviposition._--Oviposition
occurred two days after mating. The female wasp stroked the ootheca with
her antennae, selected a site, and bored into the ootheca with her
ovipositor. She inserted the ovipositor deeply and oviposited for 10-30
minutes. The eggs were deposited randomly on the evaniid larva, some
upright and others lying down. _Development._--Eggs of the hyperparasite
hatched within 3 days and the larvae commenced feeding on the host
larva. There were 30 and 50 hyper-parasites in two oothecae. _Sex
ratio._--5 [F][F]:1 [M] (from 3 oothecae).

_Distribution._--U.S.A., District of Columbia, Maryland (Burks, 1952).


=Tetrastichus australasiae= Gahan

_Natural host._--_Periplaneta australasiae_, Sumatra (Gahan, 1923).


=Tetrastichus hagenowii= (Ratzeburg)

_Synonymy._--_Entedon hagenowii_ Ratzeburg, _Blattotetrastichus
hagenowii_ (Ratzeburg) [Burks, 1943]. _Tetrastichodes asthenogmus_
Waterston. G. J. Kerrich (personal communication, 1957) compared the
type of _Tetrastichodes asthenogmus_ Waterston with authentically
determined material of _Tetrastichus hagenowii_ and concluded that _T.
asthenogmus_ is only a weakly developed specimen of _T. hagenowii_. He
stated, "The longitudinal dorsal grooves of the scutellum, which are
strongly developed in normal _hagenowii_, are only rather faintly
developed in Waterston's type and also the second specimen, which was
dissected and mounted on a series of ten microscope slides. No doubt it
was this faint development that caused Waterston to describe the species
in _Tetrastichodes_, a segregate that has since been recognized by Dr.
Burks (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1943) as being not truly generically
distinct from _Tetrastichus_."

_Natural hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, Seychelles (Ratzeburg, 1852);

_Blatta_ sp., U.S.A., Louisiana (Gahan, 1914).

_Blattella germanica_ (Burks, 1943; Peck, 1951). [In personal
communications, Burks and Peck cite Howard (1892) and Marlatt (1902, and
the 1908 revision of 1902) as sources for this host record. However, _B.
germanica_ is not mentioned specifically as a host of _T. hagenowii_ in
the sources cited nor in the 1915 revision of Marlatt's 1902 paper cited
by Burks (1943); see footnote 6, p. 236.]

_Neostylopyga rhombifolia_, Hawaii (Pemberton, 1941): This record is
based on one parasitized ootheca. We have exposed, at three different
times, groups of 10 to 20 oothecae of _N. rhombifolia_ to many newly
emerged _T. hagenowii_, but none of the eggs was parasitized (Roth and
Willis, unpublished data, 1957).

1936; Usman, 1949); Trinidad and Saudi Arabia (Cameron, 1955). Westwood
(1839) stated that 70 parasites belonging to the genus _Eulophus_
emerged from an ootheca of _P. americana_ collected on shipboard. Burks
(personal communication, 1955) stated that the wasp was probably _T.
hagenowii_.

_Experimental hosts._--_Blatta orientalis_, _Eurycotis floridana_, and
_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis, 1954b): We have
maintained _T. hagenowii_ for over two years through more than 30
generations on eggs of both _B. orientalis_ and _P. americana_.

_Periplaneta fuliginosa_, U.S.A., Pennsylvania (Roth and Willis, 1954b);
Massachusetts (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1957).

Schmidt (1937) deduced that _T. hagenowii_ was a primary parasite of
eggs of _P. americana_ because the parasitized ootheca was obtained from
a cage covered with screen too fine to permit entry of a larger
parasite, such as an evaniid. As noted above, we have reared _T.
hagenowii_ for more than 30 generations on cockroach eggs, none of which
was ever exposed to parasitization by an evaniid. If _T. hagenowii_ were
ever hyperparasitic on _Evania_, this relationship would be accidental,
the eulophid happening to oviposit into an ootheca already containing an
evaniid, or vice versa.

_Adult behavior._--The male mates soon after becoming adult; he mounts
the female from behind, grasps her antennae with his own antennae, and
vibrates his wings during copulation. Mating is accomplished in from
"several" to 20 seconds (Takahashi, 1924; Edmunds, 1955). The adults are
positively phototactic and are capable of hopping for some distance
(Edmunds, 1955). The females feed on material that oozes through the
oviposition puncture (Roth and Willis, 1954b). Females lived 10 days
(Sein, 1923). Without food, females lived 7.8 days and males 3.4 days,
but when fed dilute honey females lived 12.5 days (Usman, 1949). Females
lived 5-11 days (Roth and Willis, 1954b). Fed water and sugar, the wasps
lived 2-6 weeks at 65 deg.F. (Cameron, 1955). Without food, 9 females lived
an average of 3.5 days and 9 males an average of 1.7 days, but when fed
on raisins, 9 females lived an average of 25 days and 9 males 15 days
(Edmunds, 1955). In Formosa there were six generations from April to
December (Maki, 1937).

In Hawaii, Severin and Severin (1915) caught 571 _T. hagenowii_ in 10
kerosene traps that were set up to sample populations of Mediterranean
fruitfly. Apparently the parasite is attracted by the odor of kerosene.

_Oviposition._--The female wasp explores the surface of the ootheca with
vibrating antennae (Edmunds, 1955). She bends her abdomen ventrad and
repeatedly touches the surface of the ootheca with her valvae; when she
finds an acceptable oviposition site, the wasp unsheathes her ovipositor
and bores through the wall of the ootheca (Roth and Willis, 1954b). The
wasp deposited her eggs in 2-5 minutes (Edmunds, 1955). Wasps oviposited
(pl. 34, C) into young or old eggs of _P. americana_ (Roth and Willis,
1954b). A single wasp parasitized more than one ootheca and more than
one wasp oviposited into the same ootheca (Roth and Willis, 1954b;
Edmunds, 1955). We found freshly laid wasp eggs in 34 empty but
previously parasitized oothecae from which the wasps had emerged (Roth
and Willis, 1954b).

_Development._--In _Periplaneta americana_: Development is completed in
an average of 36 days (range 29-58 days) (Maki, 1937); 29-40 days
(Lever, 1943); average of 23.6 days (range 22-26 days) at 62 deg.-85 deg. F.
(Usman, 1949); about 3 months at 60 deg.-65 deg. F. (Cameron, 1955); 31-60 days
at 70 deg.-80 deg. F. (Edmunds, 1955). We found that the wasps completed
development in 23-56 days at about 85 deg. F., but the period depended on
the number of wasps in the ootheca; the larger the number of wasps (up
to an average of about 70 wasps per ootheca), the shorter the time
required to complete development. Wasps in oothecae containing 70 or
more parasites developed in an average of about 32 days (Roth and
Willis, 1954b). Wasp larvae eat the contents of the cockroach egg in
which they start development, then rupture the chorion and attack
adjoining eggs (Cameron, 1955; Edmunds, 1955). All eggs are consumed
when the parasite density is high, but if too few larvae develop per
ootheca, some cockroach eggs survive and the embryos complete
development (Roth and Willis, 1954b). However, a certain number of
cockroach nymphs must complete development to enable the survivors to
force open the crista and emerge from the ootheca; fewer than this
number of surviving nymphs will be trapped and killed as effectively as
if they had been eaten by the parasite. The adult parasites emerge from
one to three holes cut through the wall of the ootheca (Usman, 1949;
Roth and Willis, 1954b).

_Number of offspring per female._--In _Blatta orientalis_: In the
laboratory, 5 oothecae were left with each of 25 female wasps for their
entire lifespans; of the 125 oothecae, 32 were parasitized. The average
number of offspring per female was 66 (range 5-164) (Roth and Willis,
1954b). In _Periplaneta americana_: Each of 206 oothecae was exposed to
a single female wasp for 24 hours; the average number of offspring per
female was 103 (range 50-139). Five oothecae were left with each of 38
females for their entire lifespans; of the 190 oothecae, 81 were
parasitized. The average number of offspring per female was 94 (range
45-168 [from original data]) (Roth and Willis, 1954b).

_Number of parasites per ootheca._--In _Eurycotis floridana_: In the
laboratory, 3 oothecae that had been exposed to 20 female wasps yielded
an average of 648 parasites (range 606 [from original data] to 685)
(Roth and Willis, 1954b). In _Neostylopyga rhombifolia_: One ootheca
yielded 73 parasites (Pemberton, 1941). In _Parcoblatta_ sp.: Two
oothecae yielded an average of 100 parasites (Edmunds, 1953a). In
_Periplaneta americana_: 100 parasites per ootheca (Sein, 1923); 140
(Schmidt, 1937); 25 (Rau, 1940a); 7-38, average 33 (Usman, 1949); 71
(Wolcott, 1951); 4 oothecae exposed to 20 female wasps yielded an
average of 204 wasps (range 164 [from original data] to 261) (Roth and
Willis, 1954b); average of 30-40 (Cameron, 1955); 39 oothecae yielded an
average of 93 parasites (range 12-187) (Edmunds, 1955). In _Periplaneta
australasiae_: Oothecae yielded an average of 40-50 adult parasites
(Cameron, 1955); about 50 (Shaw, 1925).

_Sex ratio._--3 [F][F]:1 [M] (Usman, 1949); 4 [F][F]:1 [M] (Cameron,
1955); 2-8 [F][F]:1 [M] (Roth and Willis, 1954b); 1.2 [F][F]:1 [M]
(Edmunds, 1955). Parthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs produced
only males (Roth and Willis, 1954b; Edmunds, 1955).

_Distribution._--Probably worldwide. Eastern and southern U.S.A.;
Central and South America; Europe; Arabia; Africa; India; Formosa;
Hawaii.


=Tetrastichus periplanetae= Crawford

_Natural hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_, Mozambique (Crawford, 1910);
Union of South Africa (parasites reared from oothecae collected in
Durban, Natal, by the City Health Department): The parasites were
identified by Burks (personal communication, 1956). Jamaica (Gowdey,
1925); Reunion Island (Bordage, 1913).

"Domestic cockroach," Puerto Rico (Wolcott, 1951).


=Tetrastichus= sp. I

_Taxonomy._--Burks (personal communication, 1956) stated that this
species (specimens of which are in the U.S. National Museum) is very
close to _T. hagenowii_.

_Natural hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_, Union of South Africa
(parasites reared from oothecae collected in Durban, Natal, by the City
Health Department [Burks, p. c., 1956]).

_Periplaneta australasiae_, Manila, Philippine Islands (Burks, p. c.,
1956).


=Tetrastichus= sp. II

_Synonymy._--Because of the war, Cros (1942) could not determine this
insect specifically. He designated it provisionally and with reserve
under the name _Eulophus_ sp. However, Burks (p. c., 1956) stated that
the species is most certainly a _Tetrastichus_ from the description
given; but, it is apparently not _T. hagenowii_ because of its brilliant
steel-blue color.

_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, Algeria (Cros, 1942): _Adult
behavior._--Mating began as soon as wasps emerged from an ootheca. Males
mated repeatedly. Adults lived up to 5 days in summer and up to 12 days
in fall. There were up to four generations per year in the laboratory.
_Oviposition._--Wasps oviposited into oothecae 6, 22, 40, and 43 days
old, and the parasites developed successfully. More than one female
oviposited into the same ootheca. Oviposition was of long duration.
_Development._--From egg to eclosion took an average of 34 days in
summer (range: 30-38 days, 5 oothecae), and an average of 67 days in
fall (range: 58-73 days, 3 oothecae). An average of 55 parasites
developed per ootheca (range 21-105, 5 oothecae); over 130 wasps emerged
from a sixth ootheca. _Sex ratio._--10-20 [F][F]:1 [M].


HOST SELECTION BY EGG PARASITES

The nature of the oviposition stimulus(i) for the wasp parasites of
cockroach eggs is unknown. Edmunds (1954) noted that _Prosevania
punctata_ showed more interest in oothecae that had been cemented to the
substrate than in clean oothecae that had simply been dropped. Cros
(1942) experimented with two females of _P. punctata_ to see if the
wasps could find oothecae that had been buried in sand by the oriental
cockroach. After prospecting the sand with their antennae, the wasps dug
deep excavations with their front legs but always mistook the location
of the oothecae. Cros suggested that the wasps were misled by the odor
left in the jar by the cockroaches. It is quite possible that odor helps
the wasp find the host ootheca.

The extent of host selection varies among these parasites; some species
will oviposit into the eggs of more than one species of cockroach, but
others show some degree of host specificity. Positive selection of
specific hosts by certain parasites appears in correlative data from
different investigators on pages 235 to 254. There is a small body of
data that shows nonacceptance of certain hosts by some of these wasps.
For example, _Comperia merceti_ would not parasitize eggs of _Blatta
orientalis_ or _Periplaneta americana_ in the laboratory (Lawson,
1954a). We (unpublished data, 1957) exposed a soft ootheca, recently
removed from _Eurycotis floridana_, to _C. merceti_; no wasps developed;
we had similar negative results with _C. merceti_ and oothecae of _B.
germanica_. We (1954b) could not induce _Tetrastichus hagenowii_ to
parasitize eggs of _Blattella germanica_, _B. vaga_, or _Parcoblatta
virginica_ in the laboratory. In our experiments, _T. hagenowii_
oviposited into eggs of _Supella supellectilium_, but the wasp eggs
either failed to hatch, or if they hatched, the larvae died before
completing development. Neither would _T. hagenowii_ parasitize eggs of
_N. rhombifolia_ (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1957). _Anastatus
tenuipes_ would not parasitize the eggs of _Latiblattella lucifrons_
Hebard, _Periplaneta americana_, _B. germanica_, or _B. vaga_ (Flock,
1941). _Anastatus floridanus_ would not oviposit into eggs of _S.
supellectilium_ and only rarely into eggs of _P. americana_ or _B.
orientalis_ (Roth and Willis, 1954a); in the laboratory, this wasp could
not be maintained beyond one generation on the eggs of _P. americana_.
Edmunds (1953b) could not induce _Prosevania punctata_ to parasitize
eggs of _B. germanica_. Cros (1942) induced _P. punctata_ to oviposit
into a mantid ootheca, but neither mantids nor parasite developed.


COCKROACH-HUNTING WASPS

A number of wasps of the families Ampulicidae, Sphecidae, and a very few
species of Pompilidae have been found to provision their nests with
nymphal or adult cockroaches. This habit of preying on cockroaches is
primitive (Leclercq, 1954); Leclercq (personal communication, 1955)
stated that this habit is always associated with the conservation of a
number of structures considered as archaic from a purely morphological
point of view.

The records of wasps of the genus _Astata_ capturing cockroaches (e.g.,
Sickmann, 1893; St. Fargeau _in_ Sharp, 1899) "all trace back to a
questionable record by Lepeletier (1841) which probably was a
misidentification of the predator" (K. V. Krombein, personal
communication, 1956). Marshall (1866) suggested that the braconid
_Paxylomma buccata_ Breb., which he found frequenting cockroach runs in
Pembrokeshire, was parasitic on _Ectobius nigripes_ Stephens; however,
this wasp is undoubtedly parasitic on ants, probably on ant larvae
(Donisthorpe and Wilkinson, 1930).

The wasps that are known to capture cockroaches, and summaries of their
biology, are listed below.


WASPS THAT PROVISION THEIR NESTS WITH COCKROACHES


Family POMPILIDAE


=Pompilus bracatus= Bingham

_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, India (Bingham, 1900).


=Pompilus= sp.

_Natural host._--Cockroach, Nyasaland (Lamborn _in_ Poulton, 1926): The
wasp was collected leading a nymph of the cockroach by its antenna. The
cockroach was in a stupefied state, and its antennae were bitten off to
about half their length.


=Salius verticalis= Smith

_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, India (Bingham, 1900).


Family AMPULICIDAE

The species of _Ampulex_ do not appear to make special nests in which to
lay their eggs but drag their prey to any convenient hole, or crack in
the ground (Arnold, 1928). Although many species of _Ampulex_ have been
described, the prey of only a small number of species have been
discovered, but the known prey are all cockroaches.


=Ampulex amoena= Stal

_Synonymy._--_Ampulex novarae_ Saussure [Krombein, personal
communication, 1957].

_Natural hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_ and _Periplaneta
australasiae_, both as small nymphs, Formosa (Sonan, 1924, 1927): The
wasp stings a nymph about one inch long and carries it to a suitable
place, such as bamboo pipes, folds of newspaper, or books (in houses),
for oviposition.

_Periplaneta picea_, Japan (Kamo, 1957; Kohriba, 1957).

_Experimental hosts._--_Periplaneta picea_, Japan (Kamo, 1957; Kohriba,
1957).

Kamo (1957) observed that in the field both males and females sucked
juices from wounds they made in the stems of _Clerodendron_
_trichotomum_ Thunberg or _Ilex rotunda_ Thunberg. Kohriba (1957), on
the other hand, found both sexes sucking sap of _Abies_ sp. and other
trees from points injured by the rostrum of cicadas. Kamo (1957)
observed that the female wasp grasped the cockroach by a tergum and
stung it several times in the thorax. The wasp always amputated the
antennae of the prey and sucked up the fluid oozing from the cut
antennae. The wasp egg was placed on the mesocoxa of the cockroach. In
the laboratory as many as three cockroaches, each with a wasp egg, were
stored in artificial nests per day. Kohriba (1957) observed similar
behavior in the laboratory and made these additional notes. The
paralyzed cockroach could move its legs and was led to the nest by the
wasp which seized its antennae. The egg hatched in 2 days, and after
sucking up body fluid for 2 days the larva began to devour the prey.
Three days later the larva spun its cocoon, and about one month after
spinning a female wasp emerged.


=Ampulex assimilis= Kohl

_Natural hosts._--_Blatta lateralis_, wingless females, Iraq (Hingston,
1925): Nesting sites are holes in palm trees, galleries of beetles, or
tunnels in ground. The wasp first seizes a cockroach by the edge of its
thorax and stings it in the thoracic region, then seizes the cockroach
by an antenna and pulls and leads it to the nest. The wasp deposits her
egg on the outer surface of the femur of the cockroach's midleg. The
nest is closed with debris; later the cockroach recovers from the sting.
The wasp larva first feeds externally, then bores into the cockroach and
devours the internal organs. Pupation occurs inside the exoskeleton of
the cockroach.


=Ampulex canaliculata= (Say)

_Synonymy._--_Rhinopsis caniculatus._

_Natural hosts._--_Ischnoptera_ sp., U.S.A. (Krombein, 1951).

_Lobopterella dimidiatipes_, Hawaii (Williams, 1928a, 1929).

_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_? MacNay (1954) referred to a rare sphecoid
wasp in eastern Canada which provisioned its nest with nymphs and adults
of _P. pensylvanica_. Dr. W. R. M. Mason (personal communication, 1957)
wrote us that although this wasp was _Ampulex canaliculata_, it was not
reared from the cockroach but was swept from a pine tree. There are no
positive records linking _A. canaliculata_ with _P. pensylvanica_.

_Experimental host._--_Parcoblatta virginica_, females, U.S.A., Missouri
(Williams, 1928a, 1929): figure 6.

Nesting sites are in twigs (Krombein, 1951). The adult behavior is
similar to that of _A. compressa_; the female wasp imbibes blood that
oozes from the amputated antennae of the cockroach; the egg hatches in
2-3 days, and the development of one male was completed in 33 days
(Williams, 1929).

_Distribution._--U.S.A.: Connecticut south to Georgia; Ohio, Wisconsin,
Missouri, Kansas; in open woods (Krombein, 1951).


=Ampulex compressa= (Fabricius)

(Pl. 35)

_Synonymy._--Guepe ichneumon of Reaumur [Williams, 1929]; _Chlorion_
(_Ampulex_) _compressum_.

_Natural hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_, New Caledonia (Lucas, 1879);
India (Dutt, 1912); Reunion (Bordage, 1912).

_Periplaneta australasiae_, Hawaii (Swezey, 1944).

_Periplaneta_ sp., India (Maxwell-Lefroy, 1909).

Cockroach. Mauritius (Reaumur, 1742); Burma (Bingham, 1897).

_Experimental hosts._--_Neostylopyga rhombifolia_, _Periplaneta
americana_, and _Periplaneta australasiae_, Hawaii (Williams, 1942,
1942a). Zimmerman's (1948) listings probably were taken from Williams.

_Nesting sites._--Holes in walls; holes in banyan and fig trees; in
houses in drawers and cartons. _Behavior._--Similar to that of _A.
assimilis_. Bordage (1912) gives a complete description of capture of
prey. The female wasp cuts off part of the cockroach's antennae, legs,
and wings; she sticks her egg onto the host's mesothoracic coxa. The
wasp frequents houses in search of prey. Five [F][F], supplied with a
cockroach per day, stored an average of 57+-14 cockroaches; 8 [F][F]
stored an average of 45+-3 cockroaches; these latter wasps were not
supplied with a cockroach per day throughout (mean values computed from
Williams, 1942). This wasp will not attack _Nauphoeta cinerea_
(Williams, 1942a) or _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ (Schwabe, 1950b). On one
occasion, _A. compressa_ stung _Diploptera punctata_, but did not
oviposit (Williams, 1942a). _Development._--Minimum 34 days, maximum 140
days (Williams, 1942). About 6 weeks (Swezey, 1944). _Longevity of
adults._--13 [F][F] lived an average of 110+-11 days (minimum 31, maximum
159); several [M][M] lived 2 months (Williams, 1942).


=Ampulex fasciata= Jurine

_Natural host._--_Ectobius pallidus_, France (Picard, 1911, 1919):
Nesting sites are in brier or bramble stems, or in crevices in fig
trees; the female possibly uses old nests of leaf-cutter bees. The
feeding of the wasp larva is similar to that of other _Ampulex_. Adult
wasp emerges by cutting open a passage through its cocoon and through
the anus of the cockroach.


=Ampulex ruficornis= (Cameron)

_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, Oriental region (Rothney _in_ Sharp,
1899): Nesting sites are in crevices in bark. The female grasps the
cockroach by an antenna to drag it to her nest.


=Ampulex sibirica= Fabricius

_Synonymy._--Perkins referred to this species as _Ampulex sibirica_.
Williams (1942a), referring to Perkins's observations, mentions the
species as "_A. compressiventris_ Guerin (=_A. siberica_ Sauss.)."
Krombein (personal communication, 1956) has commented upon this synonymy
as follows: _Ampulex siberica_ Sauss. is apparently a misidentification
by Saussure of _sibirica_ Fab. Kohl (1893) in his revision of the genus
_Ampulex_ considered _A. compressiventris_ Guerin to be the correct name
for this common African species and that _sibirica_, described from
Siberia, must be another species. However, Turner (1912) stated that he
had seen Fabricius's type specimen and that it was identical with what
had been called _compressiventris_; he considered the Siberian locality
given by Fabricius as an error. Krombein suggested that Williams's use
of the combination _siberica_ Sauss. was a lapsus and that the valid
name, if Turner is correct, is _sibirica_ Fab.

_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, West Africa (Perkins _in_ Sharp, 1899):
Nesting sites are keyholes. Enters apartments in search of cockroaches.
Wasp cocoon protrudes from dead body of cockroach.


=Ampulex sonnerati= Kohl

_Synonymy._--"La mouche bleue" of Sonnerat (Kohl, 1893).

_Natural host._--"Kakkerlac," Philippine Islands (Sonnerat, 1776):
Nesting sites are readymade crevices. The wasp seizes the cockroach by
an antenna and stings the host many times in the "abdomen." She drags
the cockroach by an antenna to the nest, and, after depositing her egg,
plugs the opening with moistened earth.


=Dolichurus bicolor= Lepeletier

_Synonymy._--Schulz (1912) considered this to be _Dolichurus
corniculus_. Berland (1925) stated that this is possibly a color variety
of _D. corniculus_. Soyer (1947), from a study of the behavior of the
wasps, believed that both _D. bicolor_ and _D. haemorrhous_ are
varieties of _D. corniculus_. Krombein (personal communication, 1956)
stated that _D. corniculus_ and _D. bicolor_ differ in characters other
than color alone and that _D. bicolor_ is considered a valid species
today.

_Natural host._--Cockroach, France (Benoist, 1927): The wasp was
observed closing the entrance to its burrow. Its egg was attached to the
coxa of the midleg of the cockroach.

Maneval (1932) stated that _D. bicolor_ is found at the edge of dry
woods along with _D. corniculus_ and that the wasp will also accept the
prey of _D. corniculus_ if presented to it.


=Dolichurus corniculus= (Spinola)

_Synonymy._--_Dolichurus haemorrhous_ Costa [Schulz, 1912]. Berland
(1925) listed _D. haemorrhous_ separately but stated that it is perhaps
a color variety of _D. corniculus_.

_Natural hosts._--_Blattella germanica_, France (Benoist, 1927).

_Ectobius lapponicus_, Germany (Sickmann, 1893); Denmark (Nielsen,
1903); Sweden (Adlerz, 1903); Italy (Grandi, 1931, 1954); France
(Benoist, 1927; Maneval, 1928).

_Ectobius pallidus_, France (Maneval, 1932; Soyer, 1947).

_Ectobius panzeri_, France (Soyer, 1947).

_Ectobius_ sp., Italy (Grandi, 1954).

_Hololampra punctata_, Pitten (Handlirsch, 1889).

_Loboptera decipiens_, France (Ferton, 1894).

Cockroach, Netherlands (Bouwman, 1914).

_Nesting sites._--The wasp uses already-made cavities such as rotting
dead branches on ground, fissures in the earth, abandoned ant holes,
chinks in stone, or the empty cocoon of the ichneumon _Ophion luteus_
(Ferton, 1894; Maneval, 1932).

_Behavior._--The prey is immobile while being dragged to the nest but
recovers sufficiently from the sting so that if dug up it will run
around (Ferton, 1894; Bouwman, 1914; Benoist, 1927; Grandi, 1954). The
wasp cuts off about two-thirds of the cockroach's antennae prior to
putting its prey in its nest (Adlerz, 1903; Bouwman, 1914; Soyer, 1947).
One cockroach is placed in the nest and the wasp's egg is attached to
the midcoxa (Ferton, 1894). Oviposition takes 5 to 6 minutes (Maneval,
1939). Wasp fills and seals its nest with bits of earth and stones
(Ferton, 1894; Grandi, 1954). The wasp larva feeds externally and
devours the entire cockroach, including its exoskeleton (Ferton, 1894).

_Development._--Hatching occurs in 3 to 4 days (Ferton, 1894) or longer
during cooler weather (Maneval, 1939). Larval development takes 6 days
(Grandi, 1954), 8 days (Ferton, 1894), or 10 to 25 days depending on
season (Maneval, 1939).


=Dolichurus gilberti= Turner

_Natural hosts._--"Small Blattidae," India (Turner, 1917).


=Dolichurus greenei= Rohwer

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta_ sp., U.S.A., Virginia (Krombein, 1951,
1955): Nesting sites are under leaf litter. The prey was a paralyzed
third-instar nymph. _Distribution._--Ontario. U.S.A. from Canadian
border south to Florida in coastal States (Krombein, 1951).


=Dolichurus ignitus= Sm.

_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, Natal and Southern Rhodesia (Arnold,
1928): The wasp is "usually seen running up and down the trunks of
trees searching for small cockroaches in the crevices of the bark."


=Dolichurus stantoni= (Ashmead)

_Natural hosts._--_Allacta similis_, nymphs, Hawaii (Williams et al.,
1931; Zimmerman, 1948).

_Blattella lituricollis_, usually nymphs, Philippine Islands, Hawaii
(Williams, 1919).

_Cutilia soror_, nymphs, Hawaii (Williams et al., 1931; Zimmerman,
1948).

"_Phyllodromia_" sp., Philippine Islands, Hawaii (Williams, 1918;
Bridwell, 1920).

_Experimental hosts._--"Field cockroaches," Philippine Islands
(Williams, 1944).

_Nesting site._--Readymade crevices or holes in ground; porosity in
lava. _Behavior._--The wasp seizes the cockroach by a cercus or leg and
stings it in the thorax. She (fig. 7, A) then drags the cockroach to the
nest by the base of an antenna. Wasp bites off distal part of host's
antennae. She deposits her egg on one of the host's midcoxae. Nest is
plugged with lumps of soil. The larva eats the entire host.
_Development._--Eggs hatched in about a day and a half. Adults emerged
about 3 weeks later. About five generations per year. (Williams, 1918,
1919; Williams et al., 1931.)


=Dolichurus= sp.

_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, nymphs, South Africa (Bridwell, 1917).
Adult female cockroach carrying an ootheca, France (Deleurance, 1943).

_Nesting site._--Plant stem, or in ground possibly an old abandoned nest
of _Ammophile_. _Behavior._--Bridwell noted that one wasp larva ate two
cockroach nymphs before pupating; the adult emerged about 4 months after
cocoon formation. Deleurance observed the wasp close its nest with small
pebbles, balls of earth, and small dead branches. The wasp egg was
placed on the femur of the midleg. The prey in the nest is alert when
disturbed. Deleurance believed the wasp was a variety of _D.
corniculus_.


=Trirhogma caerulea= Westwood

_Natural hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_ and _Periplaneta
australasiae_, Formosa (Sonan, 1924): The wasp stings a nymph about one
inch long and carries it to a suitable place (bamboo pipe) for
oviposition.

As far as is known species of this genus of wasps hunt cockroaches.


Family SPHECIDAE


=Tachysphex blatticidus= Williams

_Natural hosts._--_Chorisoneura_ sp., adults, Trinidad, St. Augustine
(Callan, 1942): The wasps nest gregariously in sandy places. The wasp
itself is parasitized by the mutillid _Timulla_ (_Timulla_) _eriphyla_

_Graptoblatta notulata_."), New Caledonia (Williams, 1945).

_Nesting sites._--Patches of dry soil (Cheesman, 1928); coarse sand at
base of a bank (Williams, 1945). _Behavior._--The female wasp pounces on
the cockroach and stings it into immobility; she carries her prey in
flight to the nest. Two to 13 cockroaches may be found in one nest; and
one or more wasp eggs may be deposited in one nest. The egg is attached
at one end to the host's thorax behind a forecoxa. Nest is sealed with
dry pellets of soil. The cockroaches apparently do not recover from the
wasp's sting.

_Ectobius_ sp., Denmark (Nielsen, 1933).

Ferton (1914) stated that he had reported in 1912 that this species
hunted Hemiptera, but that this observation was a lapsus. _Nesting
site._--In the ground of sandy woodlot or border of dry woods; the nest
is a hole 5.5 to 8 cm. long ending in a horizontal cell. Grandi (1928)
stated that the entrance to the nest descended obliquely for 5 to 6 cm.
and ended 4 cm. below the surface of the ground. _Behavior._--Two
cockroaches, either sex, adults or nymphs, were stored in the cell
(Adlerz, 1903; Grandi, 1928). The wasp laid her egg on the first prey
brought, attaching it behind the front coxa. The cockroaches were not
excitable and their antennae had not been injured. Grandi (1928) stated
that the claws of the hind tarsi of the victims may be amputated. The
hatched larva may consume one of its victims in four days leaving only
the head, pronotum, tegmina, wings, and the urosternum.


=Podium abdominale= (Perty)

_Synonymy._--_Trigonopsis abdominalis_ Perty [Kohl, 1902].

wasps are apparently mainly arboreal mud daubers. The female wasp
constructs a mud nest on underside of a palm leaf. Wasp egg is attached
behind one of the forecoxae of the cockroach. Several cockroaches are
stored in each nest. The prey is not immobilized as a result of the
sting, and its antennae are left intact.


=Podium carolina= Rohwer

_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, nymphs (Rau, 1937): Nesting
sites are mud nests of _Sceliphron caementarium_ (Drury). One to three
cockroach nymphs are stored per nest; mud partitions are placed in tube;
the nest is plugged with mud which is coated with resin.

Burrows, lenticular in cross section, are found on shaded trails. The
wasp's habits are similar to those of _P. flavipenne_ and _P.
haematogastrum_.


=Podium flavipenne= Lepeletier

_Natural host._--_Epilampra abdomen-nigrum_, British Guiana (Williams,
1928): _Nesting site._--Burrows, about 2 inches deep and lenticular in
cross section, are dug in the ground in well-drained, partly sheltered
areas; also old _Podium_ nests are used. _Behavior._--The wasp stings
the cockroach to helplessness and flies with it back to her nest where
the host may recover from the sting; one or more cockroaches are stored
per nest; the egg is deposited behind the forecoxa while the cockroach
is still outside the burrow. The nest is sealed with mud. The larva
feeds on most of the cockroach and leaves only some heavily sclerotized
portions in the cell. In 153 nests examined, there was an average of 2.2
+- 0.08 [standard error computed from cited data] cockroaches per cell;
four nests contained five cockroaches apiece. Of the 331 cockroaches in
the nests, only 6 percent were adults. _Development._--Egg hatches in
about 2 days; larva feeds about 4 days and pupates about 2 weeks later;
adult emerges about 10-12 days later.


=Podium haematogastrum= Spinola

_Natural host._--_Epilampra_ sp., Brazil, Para (Williams, 1928): The
female wasp (fig. 7, B) burrows into the surface of termite mounds, in
banks, and in level ground. This wasp's behavior is similar to that of
_P. flavipenne_. There was an average of 1.6 cockroaches (fig. 7, C) per
cell in 74 nests examined. Of the 121 cockroaches collected, 28 percent
were adults. Under artificial conditions, the life cycle varied from
about a month to 45 days or more.

_Natural hosts._--"Wood roaches," British Guiana (Howes, 1917, 1919);
Brazil (Williams, 1928): Nesting sites were clay column nests on houses,
sides of stumps, or forest trees; banks; termite mound. Variable numbers
of cockroaches were placed in the nests with one wasp egg attached
behind forecoxa of the last host. The egg hatches in 2 days, the larva
pupates about 2 weeks later, and the adult emerges 24 days later.


=Podium= sp.

_Natural host._--_Epilampra conferta_, Brazil (Poulton, 1917): The
burrow contained several cockroaches of the same species.


ANTS PREDACEOUS ON COCKROACHES

     A large roach endeavored to escape by crossing the main front of
     the army. The creature made several powerful jumps, but each time
     it touched the ground ... its legs were grasped by the fearless
     ants.... In the end it fell ... and was instantly torn to bits and
     carried to the rear.... Another ant with the body of a wood roach
     was assisted by a worker who held the carrier's abdomen high in the
     air out of the way of her burden, all the way to the nest.

                                                           HOWES (1919)


Family FORMICIDAE

From the known entomophagous habits of the lower ants (Wheeler, 1928),
we wonder that there are not more records of ants feeding on
cockroaches, because this act must occur frequently. Kirby and Spence
(1822) stated that R. Kittoe had observed in Antigua that ants which
nested in the roofs would seize a cockroach by the legs so it could not
move, kill it, and carry it up to their nest. Hotchkiss (1874) observed
ants kill cockroaches on shipboard. Cockroaches attracted to sugar in
the pantry were killed and carried off by the ants. The destruction of
cockroaches by army ants has been recorded by Bates (1863), Wallace
(1891), Beebe (1917, 1919), Howes (1919), and others. Dead and mutilated
specimens of _Ischnoptera_ sp. [undoubtedly _Parcoblatta americana_
(Gurney, personal communication, 1958)] are common in the nests of
species of _Formica_ in California (Mann, 1911).

Class PISCES

In British Guiana, Beebe (1925a) found undetermined cockroach remains in
the stomachs of four species of fish belonging to three families, as
follows:


Family POTAMOTRYGONTIDAE


=Potamotrygon humboldti= (Dumeril)

(= _Potamotrygon hystrix_)

=Cyrtocharax magdalenae essequibensis= (Eigenmann)

(= _Cynopotamus essequibensis_)


=Chalceus macrolepidotus= Cuvier and Valenciennes

The only other records of cockroaches being eaten by fish pertain to the
use of cockroaches as bait.[8] Captain William Owen (_in_ Webster, 1834)
stated that the Chinese used cockroaches as bait in their fishing
excursions. At Reelfoot Lake, Tennessee, _Blatta orientalis_ were kept
in large numbers by bait dealers and were sold to fishermen who used
them for catching _Lepomis pallidus_, a sunfish locally known as bream,
blue bream, or bluegill (Rau, 1944). In Indiana, oriental cockroaches
were collected at a city dump by fishermen (Gould, 1941). Peterson
(1956) states that cockroaches are satisfactory bait for bluegills,
crappies, channel cat, blue heads, and large mouth black bass.

wheeleri_, _Periplaneta americana_, _Periplaneta australasiae_, and
_Symploce flagellata_, Puerto Rico (Wolcott, 1924): The last-named
cockroach may have been _S. ruficollis_ Rehn and Hebard, the females of
which are hard to distinguish from _flagellata_. Rehn and Hebard (1927)
stated that in all probability _flagellata_ does not occur on the island

  The cockroach is always wrong when arguing with a chicken.

                                    _Spanish proverb_ (HARTNACK, 1939)

Arboreal cockroaches hidden in and under bark are much more likely to be
encountered by birds than by other predators, and insectivorous birds
undoubtedly consume many more cockroaches than the few records would
indicate. Most of the records we have located identify the birds at
least by common name. Where possible we have given the scientific names
for those birds whose common names are recognizably specific. We have
followed the systematic classification of Wetmore (1940).

Figuier (1869) stated that poultry and owls are very fond of
cockroaches. Perkins (1913) made the general statement that some of the
native birds of Hawaii are partial to the endemic _Allacta similis_.
Asano (1937) stated that in Japan natural enemies of cockroaches may be
found in the Galliformes, Strigiformes, Passeriformes, and Piciformes.
Although Lederer (1952) successfully fed newly molted _Periplaneta
americana_ to insectivorous birds in the Zoological Garden, Frankfurt am
Main, _Blattella germanica_ were preferred by these birds. The following
records are of specific birds feeding on cockroaches.

XIV. CHECKLIST OF COCKROACHES AND SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATES


Only naturally occurring associations are included in this list.
Commensal cockroaches are listed on page 315. Bacteroids are not listed
because they undoubtedly occur in all species. The higher plants were
excluded because most of the associations may be too casual to
constitute symbiosis; however, many of the plant associations were
included in the chapter on ecology. The cockroaches and the associates
within each category are arranged alphabetically by genus and species.
Page references are to citations in the classified sections where
details of the associations and/or sources of the records are given.

XV. COCKROACHES AS COMMENSALS

     These particular associations may well have been accidental and due
     to a predilection for the same type of nesting site. But this fact
     in no way detracts from the interest of such records. Chance must
     play a very considerable part in first bringing symbiotic or
     commensal partners together. Once such a partnership between
     species has been firmly established, it is on the whole, fairly
     obvious, ... On the other hand, in the early stages before the
     relationship has become fixed as a specific habit, individual cases
     are generally dismissed as coincidences. It is, however, unwise to
     disregard such isolated observations or dismiss them lightly.

                                              ROTHSCHILD AND CLAY (1957)


The following social insects have been found harboring cockroaches in a
state of commensalism in which the cockroaches presumably benefit by
acquiring food from their hosts. Benefits accruing to the hosts are not
apparent. Unfortunately, biological details are not always sufficient to
substantiate the suspected association. However, it seems significant
that the cockroach commensals of the insects listed below have been
found only in association with their hosts and, so far as we know, have
never been found apart from them. Chopard (1938) has pointed out that
the myrmecophilous cockroaches are all small, being only a very few
millimeters long; they are apterous or subapterous; their eyes are
reduced; and they are all of American origin.

_Commensal._--_Phorticolea boliviae_, Bolivia, Cachuela Esperanza
(Caudell, 1923): Three males collected in the joint nests of _C.
femoratus_ and _Crematogaster limata_.


=Camponotus maculatus= (Fabricius)?

_Note._--Dr. W. L. Brown (personal communication, 1957) states that this
ant is an Old World species only. So presumably Mann's record pertains
to a different species.

_Commensal._--_Myrmecoblatta rehni_, Mexico (Mann, 1914): "They were
very abundant, several occurring in almost every nest, where they are no
doubt very efficient scavengers."


=Camponotus rufipes= (Fabricius)

_Commensals._--_Atticola mortoni_, _Nothoblatta wasmanni_, and
_Phorticolea testacea_, Brazil, San Leopoldo (Bolivar, 1905): Found in
the formicaries of _C. rufipes_.


=Formica rufibarbis= Fabricius

and

=Formica subcyanea= Wheeler

_Commensal._--_Myrmecoblatta rehni_, Mexico (Mann, 1914): "They were
very abundant, several occurring in almost every nest."


Subfamily MYRMICINAE


=Acromyrmex lobicornis= Emery

_Commensal._--_Attaphila bergi_, or possibly a variety of this species,
Huasan, Argentina? (Bruch, 1916).


=Acromyrmex lundi= (Guerin)

_Synonymy._--_Atta lundi_ [Brown, personal communication, 1957].

_Commensal._--_Attaphila bergi_, Argentina and Uruguay (Bolivar, 1901):
The cockroach was found in the nests of the ants sitting on the back,
neck, or head of sexual individuals. It remains attached to the ant
during swarming. The antennae seem always to be mutilated. Bruch (1916)
stated that in La Plata _A. bergi_ is encountered by hundreds in every
nest of _A. lundi_.


=Acromyrmex niger= (F. Smith)

_Synonymy._--_Atta nigra_ Schupp [Brown, p.c., 1957].

_Commensal._--_Attaphila schuppi_, Brazil, Porto Alegre (Bolivar, 1905):
Found outside the nest of the ant and mixed in the columns of ants on
the march.


=Acromyrmex octospinosus= (Reich)

_Synonymy._--_Atta octospinosa_ [Brown, p.c., 1957].

_Commensals._--_Attaphila fungicola_, Panama (Wheeler, 1928): Taken in
the fungus gardens of the ant.

_Attaphila aptera_, Esperanza, Dibulla, Colombia (Bolivar, 1905).


=Acromyrmex silvestrii= Emery

_Commensal._--_Attaphila bergi_, or possibly a variety of this species,
San Luis Province, Argentina (Bruch, 1916): According to Bruch, the
behavior of this species of _Attaphila_ is identical with the one
encountered in Huasan in the nests of _Acromyrmex lobicornis_ Emery; it
differed from _A. bergi_ in size and color.


=Atta cephalotes= (Linnaeus)

_Commensal._--_Attaphila fungicola_, British Guiana (Wheeler, 1928):
Taken in the fungus gardens of the ant.

_Attaphila_ sp., British Guiana (Beebe, 1921): 7 of 12 queens in one
nest had cockroaches hanging on them.


=Atta sexdens= (Linnaeus)

_Commensal._--_Attaphila sexdentis_, Brazil, San Leopoldo (Bolivar,
1905): Found in nests of the ant.


=Atta texana= (Buckley)

_Synonymy._--_Atta fervens_ Say [Wheeler, 1910].

_Commensal._--_Attaphila fungicola_, U.S.A., Texas (Wheeler, 1900,
1910): The cockroach does not feed on the fungus in the ants' nest, as
Wheeler (1900) first supposed, but mounts the back of the soldiers and
licks their surfaces. It is tolerated by the ants with no signs of
hostility. The antennae of the cockroach are clipped short. Although
Wheeler (1910) stated that this is probably accidental or unintentional,
it is peculiar that Bolivar (1905) noticed the same invariable
mutilation of the antennae of _Attaphila bergi_. Wheeler (1900) had
originally suggested that the antennae were probably clipped off by the
ants which are continuously trimming the fungus hyphae. Louisiana
(Moser, personal communication, 1959): Numerous specimens were
encountered in some nests of _A. texana_. This cockroach is the most
closely associated inquiline in the nest and maintains very intimate
terms with the ants. It is found living in the fungus cavities and
tunnels.


=Crematogaster limata parabiotica= Forel

_Commensal._--_Phorticolea boliviae_, Bolivia, Cachuela Esperanza
(Caudell, 1923): Collected in joint nests of _C. limata_ and _Componotus
femoratus_.


=Solenopsis geminata= (Fabricius)

_Commensal._--_Myrmecoblatta wheeleri_, Guatemala (Hebard, 1917a):
Collected from a colony of this ant under a stone on the shores of Lake
Atitlan, altitude 11,719 feet.


=Unknown host=

_Cockroach._--_Attaphila flava_, British Honduras (Gurney, 1937):
Because the known hosts of the other five species of _Attaphila_ are
ants, we presume that this species also lives in the nest of some
myrmecine ant.


Subfamily PONERINAE


=Odontomachus affinis= (Guerin)

_Commensal._--_Myrmeblattina longipes_, Brazil, Rio de Janeiro (Chopard,
1924, 1924a; Hancock, 1926): Originally described as _Phileciton
longipes_ by Chopard (1924) from the nest of an ant mistakenly
identified as _Eciton_ sp.


Family VESPIDAE


=Polybia pygmaea= Fabricius

_Commensal._--_Sphecophila polybiarum_, French Guiana (Shelford, 1906a):
Shelford stated that it was probable that the cockroaches living on the
floor of the paper nest fed on small fragments of insects and spiders
that were dropped by the wasp larvae feeding in the cells above.


Family MEGACHILIDAE


=Melipona nigra= Lepeletier

_Commensal._--_Oulopteryx meliponarum_, Brazil (Hebard, 1921): According
to Hebard, this cockroach is the first one to be known to inhabit the
nests of bees. Nothing is known of the relationship between the
cockroach and the bees. [See comment by Sonan (1924) on page 318.]

OBSCURE ASSOCIATIONS

Cockroaches that are sometimes found in the nests of, or in association
with, other animals are not necessarily commensals. This is particularly
true of cockroaches that normally are found unassociated with other
animals or that merely occupy the same habitat with the other animals
because of similar microclimatic requirements (see Chopard, 1924c).

McCook (1877) excavated in February a nest of _Formica rufa_ in
Pennsylvania. A hundred or more lively cockroaches occupied a part of
the nest that contained few ants. Near the cockroaches McCook also found
a colony of _Termes flavipes_. _Ischnoptera deropeltiformis_ has been
found in the company of ants, but it is probably not myrmecophilous
(Donisthorpe, 1900). Mann (1911) found an "_Ischnoptera_" sp. (probably
a species of _Parcoblatta_) abundant in the nests of, and tolerated by,
_Camponotus maccooki_ Forel in California. Dead and mutilated specimens
of this cockroach were common in the nests of "Formicas."
"_Ischnoptera_" sp. was also common in the nests of _Veromessor andrei_
(Mayr) [= _Stenamma andrei_]. Hebard (1917) reported that W. M. Wheeler
collected _Eremoblatta subdiaphana_ in Arizona as an ant guest. Rehn
(1906a; Rehn and Hebard, 1927) reported that _Pholadoblatta inusitata_
had also been taken by Wheeler from the galleries of a jumping ant,
_Odontomachus clarus_ Roger [= _O. haematodes insularis_ Guerin var.
_pallens_ Wheeler; Brown (personal communication, 1958)], on Andros
Island, Bahamas; Rehn and Hebard (1927) stated that "This genus and
species is the only blattid, which is presumably a myrmecophile, known
from the West Indies." Rehn (1932a) reported _Dendroblatta sobrina_ as
taken in an ant nest in a tree in the Amazon Basin. _Tivia australica_
was taken in an ant nest in Australia (Princis, 1954). The male of
_Compsodes schwarzi_ was taken in an ant nest in the Santa Rita
Mountains of Arizona (Ball et al., 1942). A male and female of
_Stilpnoblatta minuta_ were taken in a migrating column of the ant
_Myrmicaria natalensis_ Sm. subsp. _eumenoides_ Gerst. in Nyasaland
(Princis, 1949). Princis cautioned that it is premature to derive any
inference from this, possibly accidental, association. Four females of
_Parcoblatta desertae_ were taken about a nest of an ant, _Ischnomyrmex_
sp. (Hebard, 1943a). A nymph of _Parcoblatta virginica_ was found in a
nest of _Formica_ sp. (Hauke, 1949).

_Chorisoneura texensis_ has been found in nests of webworm in Florida
(Rehn and Hebard, 1916). Karny (1924) in Malaya found an ootheca of
_Aristiger histrio_ (sp.?) between leaves (_Costus_ sp.) that had been
stuck together by a thysanopteron, _Anaphothrips_ sp. He pointed out
that the ootheca would not adhere to leaves that were not stuck together
but would fall to the ground.

Sein (_in_ Rehn and Hebard, 1927) in Puerto Rico found _Aglaopteryx
facies_ in abandoned cocoons of _Megalopyge krugii_ (Dewitz) and in
leaves webbed together by caterpillars and in abandoned spiders nests.
Wolcott (1950; and _in_ Rehn and Hebard, 1927) also found _A. facies_ in
the empty cocoons of _M. krugii_ and in the larval tents of _Tetralopha
scabridella_ Ragonot on _Inga vera_ (coffee shade tree); and "Where
there are no butterfly-nests, it lives in abandoned spider-nests on the
leaves of other forest trees." Cotton (_in_ Wolcott, 1950) found the
type of _Aglaopteryx absimilis_ also living in the abandoned cocoon of
_M. krugii_ on bucare trees in Puerto Rico. Wolcott (1950) reported that
_Plectoptera dorsalis_, _Plectoptera infulata_, and _Plectoptera
rhabdota_ have been found living in trees between leaves or in
"butterfly-nests" of _Tetralopha scabridella_ in leaves of _Inga vera_,
or nests of _Pilocrocis secernalis_ (Moeschler) in the leaves of _Petitia
domingensis_ in the mountains of Puerto Rico. Sein (_in_ Rehn and
Hebard, 1927) had collected _P. rhabdota_ in the nest of larvae of _T.
scabridella_.

Wolcott (1950) reported that _Nyctibora lutzi_ had been found in a large
rotten stump associating with "'comejen' termites [_Nasutitermes
costalis_ (Holmgren)], yellow wood-ants and rhinoceros beetle grubs."
Rehn and Hebard (1927) found _Simblerastes jamaicanus_ in numbers in the
debris of an abandoned termites' nest in Jamaica: "To what extent the
species is dependent upon the protection of the termite or other
structures remains to be determined."

In Virginia _Cryptocercus punctulatus_ has been found living in the same
galleries with _Reticulitermes_ sp., and on the Pacific Coast it has
been found occupying the same log with _Termopsis_ sp. (Cleveland et
al., 1934).

Shelford (1909) found one male and one female of _Balta platysoma_ in a
nest of a spider of the genus _Phryganoporus_ and assumed a symbiotic
association. Chopard (1924) recorded _Mareta acutiventris_ from empty
nests of spiders on Barkuda Island, India; nothing is known of the
relationships, if any, between these cockroaches and spiders.

Chopard (1924c) found _Margattea_ sp. in the nest of the ant _Acropyga
acutiventris_ Roger; he also found _Margattea_ sp., _Periplaneta_ sp.,
_Polyphaga indica_, and _Temnopteryx obliquetruncata_ in deserted
termite mounds in India. However, he believed that none of these species
were more than accidental associates of the host insects; he considered
them hygrophilous cockroaches which had found a retreat in the nests.

McClure (1936) obtained a large nest of _Vespula maculata_ (Linnaeus)
[= _Vespa maculata_] in March in Illinois. In it were living 65 nymphs of
_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, 3 spiders (_Philodromus pernix_ Blackwall),
2 immature spiders (_Drassus_ sp.), and 6 mites. Balduf (1936) observed
four individuals of _Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ in a nest of _Vespula
maculata_; he suggested that they probably fed on dead bodies and
organic wastes of the wasps. However, Rau (1940) has observed this
cockroach devour a _Polistes_ larva in its cell. Although we do not
imply that a commensal relationship exists between _Parcoblatta_ and the
wasp, it is well to recall a statement by Rothschild and Clay (1957): "A
commensal relationship is potentially even more dangerous than a merely
social tie, for by nature it is more intimate. The closer the
association, the more easily is the balance upset. One partner can then
suddenly take a mean advantage of the other."

Cockroach nymphs may enter bees' nests where, according to Imamura (_in_
Sonan, 1924), they do not feed on honey or pollen but presumably feed on
excreta of bees or anything scattered by bees in their nest; the bees
are not disturbed by the cockroaches.

Cockroaches that have been found in the burrows of vertebrates are
listed on pages 23-25.

Paulian (1950) found immature cockroaches in the nests of birds
(Ploceinae) in Madagascar and Ivory Coast. All nests of _Fondia_ sp.
examined in Madagascar contained many cockroaches, and Paulian believed
that the blattid was a species peculiar to the nests of birds. Three
nests of _Ploceus_ sp. in Ivory Coast yielded one or two cockroaches
each in association with more numerous mites, Psocoptera, Heteroptera,
beetles, and lepidopterous larvae (Delamare, Deboutteville and Paulian,
1952). These last cited workers also found four cockroaches in a nest of
_Estrildine_ sp., and two in a nest of an undetermined bird, all in
association with other arthropods. Moulton (1912) observed large numbers
of _Symploce cavernicola_ and _Periplaneta australasiae_ swarming in
soft bird guano on the floor of caves in Borneo. Abdulali (1942) found
in India many _Periplaneta americana_ in caves containing the
edible-nest swift; there was no indication of association of the
cockroaches with the birds. Danforth (_in_ Wolcott, 1950) reported
finding large numbers of _Aglaopteryx facies_ "in the nests of the grey
kingbird, in the region of the Cartagena Lagoon [Puerto Rico], 'living
among the twigs.'" In Trinidad, Kevan found a male of _Blaberus
discoidalis_ in a bird's nest (Princis and Kevan, 1955).

Davis (_in_ Rehn and Hebard, 1914a) stated that "At Punta Gorda
[Florida] there was a vacant house at the end of the town frequented at
night by a Nanny and Billy goat, and on warm evenings many _Periplaneta
australasiae_ would run about on the piazza floor and on the sides of
the house. They were seen feeding on the excrement of the goats and were
no doubt to a great degree dependent upon them." This is another example
of a coprophagous insect that has taken advantage of a particular
situation favorable to its survival. Similar associations exist in which
many of the domiciliary cockroaches feed on the feces of man and
domestic and other animals (Roth and Willis, 1957a).




XVI. COCKROACHES AS PREDATORS


INTERSPECIES PREDATION

Tepper (1893) made the broad statement that the majority of Australian
and Polynesian cockroaches appear to be wholly carnivorous, eating other
insects, eggs, and larvae. He stated that, because of their voracity and
cannibalistic tendencies, the carnivorous species lead more or less
solitary lives so that one rarely meets several in close proximity; they
are never very numerous at any time because the stronger devour the
weaker in the absence of other prey. Tepper stated that Australian
species of _Ischnoptera_ hunt for their prey among the foliage of
shrubs, and that Australian species of _Cutilia_ [= _Drymaplaneta_,
Hebard (1943)] run about actively on the surface, or ascend shrubs and
trees in quest of living insects and therefore are highly beneficial.
Tepper (1894) also stated that _Geoscapheus robustus_ ate earthworms,
grubs, and caterpillars. Froggatt (1906) and Marlatt (1915) attributed
to Tepper the statement that cockroaches, like _Epilampra notabilis_,
which are found out-of-doors in Australia, are carnivorous and feed on
caterpillars and other soft-bodied insects; but Froggatt (1907) believed
that this alleged behavior needed confirmation.

A number of observations have been recorded which indicate that
sometimes cockroaches may be predatory. According to Ealand (1915),
nymphs of the cockroach _Pseudomops cincta_ fed on the Argentine ant
_Iridomyrmex humilis_. In the laboratory, _Eurycotis floridana_ has been
observed to catch and devour the wasp _Anastatus floridanus_ which
parasitizes the eggs of _Eurycotis_ (Roth and Willis, 1954a).
_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ was observed devouring a larva of _Polistes_
sp. in its cell in a deserted wasps' nest (Rau, 1940). Brigham (1866)
saw a cockroach kill and eat a centipede four or five inches long.
Annandale (1910) described the destruction in Calcutta of termites by
_Periplaneta americana_. During a heavy rain storm many termites flew
into the dining room and were set upon by the cockroaches which seized
them with their mandibles and began to gnaw their abdomens. If
disturbed, the cockroaches carried the termites away in their mandibles
without using their legs to seize, hold, or carry the prey. Sometimes
only the abdomen, but other times the whole body with the exception of
the wings, was devoured. Perhaps this observation led Allyn (Anonymous,
1937) to theorize that, first, cockroaches could eradicate termites from
houses, and then the blattids in turn could be eliminated. Falls (1938)
has pointed out the unfeasibility of this idea. _Blattella vaga_ has
shown some tendency to eat plant lice (Flock, 1941a). Certain small
cockroaches found beneath cane leaf-sheaths, in the Philippine Islands,
preyed in part upon leafhoppers (Uichanco, _in_ Williams et al., 1931).

Takahashi (1924) stated that the American cockroach will eat the eggs of
the hemipteron _Cantao ocellatus_ (Thunberg). Cunliffe (1952) observed
mite-infested cockroaches (_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_,
and/or _Periplaneta americana_) dislodge and eat the mite _Pimeliaphilus
podapolipophagus_. Sonan (1924) reported that cockroaches (_P.
americana_ and _P. australasiae_) devoured the egg clusters and first
instar larvae of _Prodenia litula_ and the first instar larvae of
_Attacus atlas_ which were being reared in the laboratory. Lederer
(1952) stated that _Periplaneta americana_ ate reptile eggs in the
aquarium at Frankfurt am Main. Pettit (1940) stated that cockroaches
"are said to have destroyed a large colony of dermestids used to
skeletonize carcasses at the University of Kansas."

DeFraula (1780) believed that his silent "gryllon" [obviously _Blatta
orientalis_ from his drawings; see Willemet (1784)] was the enemy of the
chirping species of cricket, because after the cockroach became
established in his home he no longer heard crickets chirping. Gilbert
White (1905 ed.), writing in England in the late 18th century, stated
that "Poda says that these [_Blatta orientalis_] and house crickets will
not associate together; but he is mistaken in that assertion"; however,
in August 1792 White noted that "Since the _blattae_ have been so much
kept under, the crickets have greatly increased in number." For several
years Jolivet (1950) had observed changes in a mixed population of
_Blatta orientalis_ and _Acheta domesticus_ in an old kitchen in France.
He suggested that the cyclical fluctuations in the relative abundance of
the cockroaches and crickets might be caused by reciprocal predatism
with one species more susceptible than the other at certain stages.
Mallis (1954) has stated that crickets prey on other insects as well as
on one another. Lheritier (1951) had also observed crickets becoming
rare in bakeries in France, having been superseded everywhere by _B.
orientalis_; however, he doubted that Jolivet's hypothesis was the
correct explanation and suggested that the higher optimum temperature
requirements of crickets might be the regulating factor. Lederer (1952)
stated that the number of crickets decreased in the aquarium buildings
at Frankfurt am Main as the population of American cockroaches
increased.

_Platyzosteria novae seelandiae_ was found under the bark of trees in
New Zealand devouring bugs (Walker _in_ Shelford, 1909b).

For years it has been believed that cockroaches feed on bedbugs (_Cimex
lectularius_ L.) and this statement has been repeated in many reference
works and articles. Ealand (1915) stated that cockroaches devour bedbugs
with avidity. Even today similar statements are to be found in the
literature. "In the old sailing ship days, they [cockroaches] were often
welcomed by crews because of the belief that they would eradicate a
population of bedbugs. This belief was based on scientific fact, as
cockroaches are known as predators of bedbugs" (Monro, 1951).
Cockroaches will often "help rid a house of bedbugs by devouring all the
little parasites they can capture" (Gaul, 1953). The basis for this
belief may have originated with a statement by Webster (1834) who wrote
that bedbugs disappeared aboard "H.M. Sloop Chanticleer" when
cockroaches made their appearance. Newman (1855) reported the
observations of a friend who claimed to have seen a cockroach seize a
bedbug in an infested boardinghouse in London. In 1920 Purdy
reintroduced cockroaches into a house from which they had been
exterminated, in order to control the bedbugs which had become
established. According to a popular account by Lillingston (1934)
African natives are said to ask sailors for a cockroach or two to be
used to hunt bedbugs.

In Siberia, Burr (1926, 1939) found _Blattella germanica_ and bedbugs
inhabiting the same room. Mellanby (1939) studied the populations of an
animal house in which bedbugs and cockroaches occurred in large numbers;
the bugs apparently were not attacked and their numbers increased
greatly over a period of a few weeks (Johnson and Mellanby, 1939). Wille
(1920) placed starved _B. germanica_ with bedbugs for 20 days, but the
cockroaches failed to attack the bugs. In India, captive adults and
nymphs of two species of house cockroaches would not touch living
bedbugs or their eggs (Cornwall, 1916). In laboratory experiments Gulati
(1930) found that _Periplaneta americana_ ate young bedbugs which had
soft, blood-filled abdomens; adult bedbugs with harder exoskeletons
sometimes were rejected. The maximum number of bedbugs eaten by a
cockroach was 3 out of 12 during a period of 48 hours. Johnson and
Mellanby (1939), also in laboratory experiments, were unable to show
that bedbugs can be controlled by _Blatta orientalis_ or that bedbugs
are eaten to any extent by them. The existing evidence indicates that
there is little basis for the often repeated statement that cockroaches
destroy bedbugs in nature. As Lorando (1929) pointed out, assassin bugs,
cockroaches, and red ants can hardly be considered as practical factors
in bedbug control, though he did recommend the use of spiders.

According to Martini (1952), cockroaches prey on mosquitoes and sand
flies but we have been unable to find any original sources for these
statements; the only reference we have found in which cockroaches and
_Phlebotomus_ are mentioned together is a paper by Whittingham and Rook
(1923); they fed ground-up cockroaches to larvae of _Phlebotomus
papatasii_. Wharton (1951) reported that cockroaches and other predators
attacked mosquitoes knocked down by insecticides and affected the number
recovered.

Cockroaches will on occasion attack and bite animals other than insects.
In an earlier paper (1957a) we discussed about 20 reports of cockroaches
biting man. The injury is usually confined to abrasion of the callused
portions of hands and feet but may result in small wounds in the softer
skin of the face and neck. We failed to include the following reference
in the above-mentioned paper. Sonan (1924) had his toes and breast
nibbled by cockroaches on Hiyakejima Island during sleep. He had
previously learned from a policeman that _Periplaneta americana_ and _P.
australasiae_ nibbled people on that island, but he had hardly believed
it before he experienced the biting himself.


INTRASPECIES PREDATION

Those who have reared cockroaches in the laboratory have undoubtedly
seen cannibalism occur in the cultures. Cannibalism has been observed
among the common domiciliary species of cockroaches as well as
laboratory colonies of _Leucophaea maderae_ (Scharrer, 1953), and
_Blaberus craniifer_[12] (Saupe, 1928). Edmunds (1957)

reported that cannibalism was common in a laboratory colony of
_Periplaneta brunnea_ and that egg capsules deposited by a female were
often eaten by the other cockroaches.

_Periplaneta americana_ occasionally ate other cockroaches and their
oothecae and also attacked members of their own species (Lederer, 1952).
Griffiths and Tauber (1942) recorded the killing of male American
cockroaches by females of the species: "One female was especially
vicious and attacked each new male as he was introduced into the
container. Most of such males had molted less than 2 days previously.
Older males were more capable of defending themselves against attacks of
these cannibalistic females." Even though adequate food may be present,
females of _Periplaneta americana_ may eat their own eggs (Klein, 1933).
Some females may regularly eat their oothecae as soon as they are
dropped (Griffiths and Tauber, 1942). To be completely eaten an ootheca
generally must be attacked before it has hardened. If a hole is eaten in
one side of the capsule, the cockroach may devour the eggs and leave a
portion of the ootheca. Frequently only the keel or a part of the keel
is eaten and when this occurs the eggs fail to hatch and usually do not
complete development because of the rapid loss of water (Roth and
Willis, 1955). When adults of _P. americana_ and _P. australasiae_ were
deprived of food, both males and females ate newly deposited eggs and,
finally, the females ate the males (Sonan, 1924).

_Parcoblatta virginica_ in laboratory cultures also may eat part of its
oothecae; in this species only the soft end of the recently deposited
ootheca was eaten (Roth, unpublished data, 1957).

Cros (1942) observed oothecae-bearing females of _Blatta orientalis_
attack and kill males of the same species which were attempting to mate;
these males were then eaten by the females. Cros also observed injured
and recently molted nymphs of _B. orientalis_ to be eaten by others of
the same species.

Pettit (1940) noted that cannibalism in his culture of _Blattella
germanica_ occurred only when the insects were molting. Adult insects
attacked the molting cockroaches more often than did the nymphs.
However, nymphs after the fourth instar occasionally set upon other
molting nymphs. First-to third-instar nymphs rarely victimized their
mates. The victims were all older than third instar; the later stadia
were progressively more subject to attack, and molting adults suffered
the greatest mortality. No direct correlation was noted between
population density and cannibalism.

German cockroaches may attack newly molted nymphs of their own kind and
cause them to deflate (Gould and Deay, 1938). Lheritier (1951) has
observed the hatching nymphs of _B. germanica_ being devoured by their
congeners even before they have left the ootheca.

_Nauphoeta cinerea_ in laboratory cultures will eat newly hatched young
of the same species (Roth and Willis, 1954; Willis et al., 1958). In
Hawaii, in nature, _N. cinerea_ may kill and eat the cypress cockroach,
_Diploptera punctata_ (Illingworth, 1942; Fullaway and Krauss, 1945).

Bunting (1956) stated that species of _Neoblattella_ are omnivorous with
carnivorous and cannibalistic tendencies. An adult female _Panchlora_
sp. was killed and eaten by _Neoblattella_ sp. in captivity. A male,
provisionally identified as _N. celeripes_, was killed and partly eaten
by two other males of the same species.

The factors influencing the extent of cannibalism among cockroaches are
not completely known. According to Wille (1920) hunger was not the cause
of cannibalism in _Blattella germanica_. Wille claimed that the tendency
toward cannibalism increased at high temperatures and decreased at low
temperatures. Pettit (1940) also noted this effect. Gould and Deay
(1938) stated that under crowded laboratory conditions, when there was a
scarcity of food, cannibalism among _Periplaneta americana_ was common.
The injured cockroaches and those unable to molt were often eaten. Adair
(1923) made similar observations. Undoubtedly, conditions of crowding,
availability of food, temperature and other factors all influence
cannibalism, but practically no experimental work has been done on this
subject.

It is interesting, in comparison with the above positive examples of
cannibalism, that both Saupe (1928) and Roeser (1940) observed no
cannibalism during extensive studies with _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_. In
fact, Roeser stated that there was never a case of cannibalism in spite
of long hunger periods imposed on both nymphal and adult insects.




XVII. ASSOCIATIONS AMONG COCKROACHES


Besides preying on their own species or on other blattids, cockroaches
exhibit additional symbiotic relationships among themselves. These
relationships are (1) the familial associations of parent and offspring,
(2) gregariousness, (3) intraspecies fighting, (4) interspecies
compatibility, and (5) interspecies antagonism. There are some
inconsistencies between observations made on the same species by
different workers, which only further observation and experimentation
will explain. Some of the reported observations are unique; this is
especially true for the feral species. Because of the paucity of
information, it is impossible at this time to make valid generalizations
about some of these interesting relationships.


FAMILIAL ASSOCIATIONS

The females of many species of cockroaches insure varying degrees of
protection to the developing young in their ways of disposing of the
ootheca after it has been formed. The extent of this association between
the mother and her developing progeny varies from the minimum amount of
time spent by oviparous females in concealing their oothecae, to the
duration of embryogenesis in the so-called viviparous species, a period
of over a month or more.

Haber (1920a) observed a female of _Periplaneta americana_ chew a groove
in a piece of pasteboard into which she attempted to deposit her
ootheca. The ootheca failed to adhere to the shallow hole and fell to
the floor. After several futile attempts to replace the ootheca in the
hole, the female finally left the egg case on the floor of the cage and
coated it with an oral secretion to which she attached bits of trash.
During this operation she chased other females away when they ventured
near the site. Qadri (1938) described the behavior of the female of
_Blatta orientalis_ in concealing her ootheca in a hole that she dug in
sand; she deposited the egg case in the hole, coated it with saliva and
sand, and then refilled the pit. Rau (1943) described in detail how
females of _P. americana_ and _B. orientalis_ covered their oothecae
with wood dust or sand in holes they had prepared in the substrate. Both
species placed a sticky oral secretion in the holes and then deposited
their oothecae therein. After coating the oothecae with more sticky
secretion, the females adjusted the oothecae so that the keels were
uppermost and then carefully concealed the oothecae with the excavated
debris. Both females spent over an hour in the act. Rau (1924)
previously reported that of 90 oothecae deposited by _B. orientalis_ in
jars containing earth and trash, 36 were placed in crevices or excavated
holes, and 38 were hidden by being covered with dirt stuck to them with
saliva; only 16 were left uncovered.

Edmunds (1957) described oviposition by _Periplaneta brunnea_. Some
females spent from 30 to 40 minutes secreting from the mouth a frothy
substance that was smeared on the substrate; the egg capsule was
deposited in the secretion and covered with additional froth, which
hardened into a very strong cement. Some females spent as long as two
hours coating the capsule after it was deposited. It was not stated
whether the ootheca was otherwise concealed. The female remained with
her body over the ootheca for several hours and drove away other
cockroaches which approached.

Sonan (1924) observed that _Periplaneta americana_ and _Periplaneta
australasiae_ spent from 40 minutes to an hour covering their oothecae,
and that if the females were frightened away from this activity, they
returned again to complete it. As well as excavating holes in the
substrate in which to deposit its oothecae, _P. americana_ also avails
itself of readymade crevices of appropriate size (Ehrlich, 1943).
Species of _Epilampra_ in Malaya were said by Annandale (1900) to
deposit their oothecae in crevices in floating logs just above the water
line. However, Shelford (1906) stated that four genera (including
_Epilampra_) of the subfamily Epilamprinae are "viviparous," in which
event the females would carry their oothecae within their bodies during
embryogenesis and would not place the oothecae in crevices in logs.

The female of _Cryptocercus punctulatus_ was observed to make a groove
in a piece of wood, then carry her ootheca 6 inches from where she had
dropped it and place it in the groove; she covered the ootheca so that
only a portion was visible (Cleveland _in_ Cleveland et al., 1934). Dr.
W. L. Nutting (personal communication, 1954) collected a number of
oothecae of _C. punctulatus_ in the field and found each one almost
completely sealed off with bits of wood in a deep groove in the roof of
a chamber in a log. The keel of the ootheca was visible but the rest was
well camouflaged. He stated that "The adult pair usually frequents the
chamber at this time, while their broods of previous years occupy
neighboring galleries."

Berland (1924) observed a female of _Loboptera decipiens_ filling a hole
(the abandoned nest of a hymenopteron) with earth that she carried in
her mouth; he later found her ootheca behind the earthen barricade which
she had erected.

In summary, the following species of oviparous cockroaches have been
observed concealing their oothecae (only those references not previously
cited are given): _Blatta orientalis_; _Cryptocercus punctulatus_;
_Ectobius sylvester_ (Harz, 1956, 1957); _Epilampra_ sp.; _Eurycotis
floridana_ (Roth and Willis, 1954a); _Loboptera decipiens_; _Balta
scripta_, _Methana curvigera_, _Methana marginalis_, and _Methana
caneae_ (Pope, 1953a); _Pelmatosilpha marginalis_, _Pelmatosilpha
purpurascens_, and _Nauclidas nigra_ (Bunting, 1956); _Periplaneta
americana_ (Haber, 1919; Adair, 1923; Sein, 1923; Nigam, 1933; Gould and
Deay, 1938; Rau, 1940a); _Periplaneta australasiae_ (Girault, 1915b;
Spencer, 1943; Pope, 1953); _Periplaneta brunnea_ (Roth and Willis,
unpublished data, 1958); _Periplaneta fuliginosa_ (Gould and Deay,
1940); _Periplaneta ignota_ (Pope, 1953); _Supella supellectilium_
(Flock, 1941). Undoubtedly other oviparous species that drop their
oothecae long before the eggs hatch also make some attempt to conceal
the oothecae by placing them in crevices or covering them with debris.

Sometimes the oothecae are deposited but not concealed. Hafez and Afifi
(1956) reported that in Egypt _Supella supellectilium_ attaches its
ootheca to a suitable substrate with a gummy oral secretion but leaves
the egg capsule otherwise exposed. We (1954) have noticed similar
behavior in laboratory colonies of this species and of _Blatta
orientalis_, as have Gould and Deay (1940). Cornelius (1853) stated that
the female of _B. orientalis_ takes care of the safety of her offspring
to the extent of usually dropping her oothecae in places which are dry
and raised above the ground, although rarely one also may find some
oothecae scattered on the ground. For lack of suitable material females
of _Periplaneta americana_ sometimes did not conceal their oothecae
(Nigam, 1933). Frequently in laboratory colonies _P. americana_ merely
drops the oothecae loosely in sand or food "in contrast to _P.
australasiae_, which almost always went to considerable trouble to
fasten their eggs securely and to conceal them with debris" (Pope,
1953). If conditions under which _Nauclidas nigra_ is kept are not
suitable, the female will drop her ootheca anywhere (Bunting, 1956). Rau
(1940) stated that the female of _Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ does not
conceal her ootheca. However, Gould and Deay (1940) stated that this
species deposits its oothecae loosely behind bark. _Ellipsidion affine_
and _Ellipsidion australe_ attach their oothecae to bark or the
underside of leaves but apparently make no attempt to conceal them
(Pope, 1953a).

The females of most of the above species have no further familial
association with their offspring. The eggs hatch with no attention from
the mother who is probably not even in the vicinity at that time. The
young apparently do not react to the presence of the parent, as such,
after hatching. This is not unexpected, as several additional oothecae
may have been deposited by these oviparous females before the eggs of
the first oothecae hatch. However, a different behavior is encountered
among species that do not form a second ootheca until after the eggs of
the first have hatched (see below) and in the so-called colonial
species.

Shaw (1925) reported that in Australia both _Panesthia australis_ and
_Panesthia laevicollis_ appear to live in families, and that one usually
finds a pair of adults associated with from 12 to 20 nymphs in
different stages of development; he continued, "it is only where the
molts are very abundant that one loses sight of this familial habit."
Tillyard (1926) also stated that the Australian species of _Panesthia_
live in burrows in soil in strict family communities of a pair of adults
and 10 to 20 nymphs. A related colonial species, _Cryptocercus
punctulatus_, lives in both sound and rotten logs in colonies consisting
of a pair of adults and 15 or 20 nymphs, probably representing two or
three broods (Cleveland et al., 1934; Cleveland, 1948). Chopard (1938)
has cited this association as an example of gregariousness, which it may
well be; however, the presence of only one pair of adults in each colony
suggests a more intimate relationship.

Among species of _Blattella_ and certain other genera with similar
reproductive habits the female carries her ootheca clasped in her
genital cavity with the posterior portion projecting behind her. Each
normal ootheca is carried for approximately the duration of
embryogenesis and is not dropped until, or shortly before, hatching. We
have seen (1954, fig. 65) newly hatched nymphs of _Blattella vaga_ crawl
over the body of the mother who stood quietly near the dropped ootheca;
this female raised her wings and some of the nymphs crawled under them
onto the dorsal surface of her abdomen. The nymphs seemed to feed on the
grease covering the mother's body. The association was short-lived,
however, and soon the nymphs scattered. Pettit (1940) stated that when
hatching of _Blattella germanica_ occurs in the open (on a table top),
the nymphs may remain near the capsule only a few minutes. Ledoux (1945)
found that newly hatched nymphs of _B. germanica_ remained together
without shelter in a single, sparse group. If the nymphs were separated
by blowing on them, the group quickly reassembled, usually in the same
spot. Ledoux showed that this gregarious grouping of first-instar nymphs
was not necessarily a familial association by placing nymphs from two
oothecae together. In groups of 8 to 12 nymphs there was a perfect
intermingling of the offspring from the two different females.

It is among the so-called viviparous cockroaches that the greatest
number of observations have been made of postparturient associations
between female cockroaches and their offspring. The females of these
species carry their oothecae in brood sacs within their bodies until
embryogenesis has been completed. This behavior ensures protection of
the young from desiccation and attack by parasites (Roth and Willis,
1955a). (See Roth and Willis, 1958a, for an analysis of oviparity and
viviparity in the Blattaria.) Shelford (1906, 1916) reported that he had
captured a female of _Pseudophoraspis nebulosa_ in Borneo with numerous
young nymphs clinging to the undersurface of her abdomen. He also
recalled that there was in the Hope Museum (Oxford) a female of
_Phlebonotus pallens_ to which the following label was attached:
"'Ceylon ... carries its young beneath its wing covers. 1878.'" Pruthi
(1933) found in South India another female of _P. pallens_ which was
carrying over a dozen young nymphs on her back beneath her wings. In his
paper Pruthi reproduced a photograph of this specimen with the
light-colored nymphs in place on the back of the female. Hanitsch (1933)
reported having seen a museum specimen from Luzon, Philippine Islands,
of the apterous female of _Perisphaerus glomeriformis_ with nymphs still
clinging to her undersurface; he also reported having seen a museum
specimen of a female of _Ellipsidion variegatum_ from Australia with
four young clinging to the upper side of the apex of her tegmina and six
to the ootheca which projected beyond her body. Presumably this specimen
was giving birth when captured. Gurney (1954; personal communication,
1958) stated that specimens of _Perisphaerus_ sp. from Mindanao and
Luzon have been found with young nymphs clinging to the middle and hind
coxae. The first-instar nymph has an elongate face and specialized
galeae. Karny (1925) also observed that at the slightest alarm the young
of some species of Phoraspidinae creep under the dome-shaped front wings
of the mother.

The newly hatched young of _Leucophaea maderae_ have also been seen
congregated under the mother on several occasions. Sein (1923) stated
that after being born, the nymphs of this species gather under the
mother and accompany her at night in her excursions in search of food.
Pessoa and Correa (1928) reported that "During the first days the free
larvae hide under the adult cockroach which becomes restless and active
in contrast to its usual slow gait." Wolcott (1950) stated that "They
are not only gregarious, but the mother broods over her young, and
together they sally forth at night in search for food, until they are of
such a size as to mingle with their elders."

The African mountain cockroach _Aptera fusca_ has been observed during
late summer and early winter in familial groups beneath loose bark,
under stones, and in dead leaves (Skaife, 1954): "Each party consists of
a number of black young ones, together with one, two or more adult
females and perhaps a winged male or two. Later on they scatter and live
more or less solitary lives." In Malaya Karny (1924) often found
phoraspidine females between leaves surrounded by about 20 young nymphs.
He stated that one also often found females of _Perisphaerus armadillo_
surrounded by pale, yellowish-white young; similarly he had observed
that _Archiblatta hoevenii_ was found mostly in colonies made up of
mothers and their young. The duration of these associations is not
known.

Saupe (1928) noticed that the newly hatched nymphs of _Blaberus
craniifer_ (see footnote II, p. 322) collected together under the body
of their mother and stated that this is as pronounced a case of brood
care as Zacher had observed with _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_. Nutting
(1953) stated that "A degree of maternal solicitude is exhibited by this
roach [_B. craniifer_], for many times I have observed the female to
remain motionless for an hour or more with her unpigmented brood
clustered around and beneath her body." We, too, have observed similar
behavior in laboratory colonies of _B. craniifer_ and _Leucophaea
maderae_.

Chopard (1950) noted that after hatching the young of _Gromphadorhina
laevigata_ remained grouped around the female for some time; the mother
stood motionless, high on her legs, with her thorax curved up to make
room for the brood which hid under her body. We (unpublished data, 1958)
have seen young nymphs of _Gromphadorhina portentosa_ also stay near
their mother for some time after birth; the mother at this time produced
a characteristic hissing sound when she was only slightly disturbed by
the movement of our hand near her and her brood. The sound is produced
as air is expelled through the second abdominal spiracle. We have seen
recently hatched nymphs of _Nauphoeta cinerea_ crawl beneath the mother,
even under her wings, where they remained about an hour (Willis et al.,
1958). Bunting (1956) observed a female of _Blaberus discoidalis_
collect a mound of debris into which she inserted the tip of her
abdomen; he found young in the mound later the same day. This female
showed no maternal care for the young after birth. Whole families of
cockroaches may be found in bromeliads in Brazil (Ohaus, 1900). Hebard
(1920) observed a colony of adults and young of _Dendroblatta sobrina_
on a tree trunk in the Panama Canal Zone.

Whether any of the above associations exemplify maternal care for the
newly hatched young is questionable. The behavior of the mother, beyond
placing her eggs in a suitable location, seems to be entirely passive.
The first-instar nymphs are the active partners in these associations,
and they may merely be seeking shelter under the nearest convenient
object rather than under the mother as such. More extensive studies of
some of these relationships will be needed before claims for maternal
care, as suggested by Scott (1929), can be substantiated.


GREGARIOUSNESS

Casual statements that cockroaches are gregarious are often encountered
in the literature. There has been some argument to the effect that
large numbers of these insects seeking the same environment in a limited
space would appear to be gregarious, whereas there is probably no true
social tendency (Rau, 1924). Reactions of cockroaches to certain stimuli
in the environment undoubtedly do result in aggregations of individuals.
However, as Chopard (1938) has pointed out, it is difficult to assign
the respective parts played in assembling by the attraction of the
milieu and by gregarious instincts. Chopard (1938) also stated that
Orthoptera with a gregarious tendency are found rarely isolated; one
finds them, on the contrary nearly always collected in the same
shelters, close together, as if conscious of a need for contact between
themselves. He continued further that one can be tempted to attribute
the assembling to taxes but that interattraction equally plays an
important role; for example, if one places a large number of cockroaches
in a container and offers them similar shelters composed of cardboard
tubes, one finds that nearly all the individuals will assemble in one of
the tubes, ignoring the others. Pettit (1940) claimed that in _Blattella
germanica_ gregariousness seemed to depend on the mutual attractiveness
of body secretions as well as a thigmopositive behavior and love of
warmth.

Ledoux (1945) has studied experimentally gregariousness and social
interattraction in _Blatta orientalis_ and _Blattella germanica_. He
also found that the cockroaches tended to collect in shelters containing
other cockroaches. He concluded that group formation is not the result
of chance, but is a social phenomenon, and that interattraction is
mainly olfactory, conditioned by (1) positive chemotaxis to odors
emitted by the cockroaches themselves, (2) positive hygrotaxis, and (3)
thigmotaxis. He found also that large groups are not stable and tend to
break into smaller groups.

Gregariousness in the Orthoptera varies in intensity according to the
species and within a species according to the age or physiological state
of the insects (Chopard, 1938). This is well exemplified by several of
the blattid species discussed below.

Gregarious groupings of cockroaches have been observed most frequently
among the domiciliary species. A few examples will suffice. Gal'kov
(1926) observed heavy infestations of undetermined cockroaches in
workers' living quarters in the Ural region: "In the corners near the
stove, the cockroaches covered the walls in a dense carpet." After
fumigating he collected about 135,000 dead cockroaches from one barracks
and about 475,000 from another. We have reviewed a few other examples of
heavy infestations in our 1957(a) paper.

_Periplaneta americana_ was observed by Gould and Deay (1938) in an old
meat-packing building in Indiana. Adult cockroaches were present in
large numbers between closely placed beams, but the nymphs were more
common in cracks between bricks. Clusters of several hundred cockroaches
were seen on the open walls of the cold, dark hide room. Gould and Deay
stated "American roaches of all sizes live together in perfect harmony.
Young nymphs have been noted in clusters underneath adults and crawling
over the adults as they wander about in rearing jars." In the monkey
house of the Hamburg zoo, _P. americana_ spent most of the day in the
cellars resting on the walls in groups of about 200 individuals
(Brecher, 1929). Lederer (1952) noted that in closed, dark, heated
spaces under the aquarium at Frankfurt am Main, _P. americana_ rested in
groups of 20 to 30 individuals; he stated that it was remarkable that
the "herd" divided itself into groups each of which usually contained
insects of the same age or stage of development. Eads (1954) found _P.
americana_ in 40 percent of 762 sewer manholes in Tyler, Tex.; 13
percent of 670 of these manholes were heavily infested with 100 or more
cockroaches in each. Other heavy sewer infestations have been reviewed
in our 1957(a) paper.

Ehrlich (1943) has stated that _Periplaneta americana_ exhibits social
behavior. For instance, cockroaches of various ages inhabit a fairly
large space jointly; the adults and older nymphs sense approaches with
their antennae and warn and protect the young by a beating of wings and
by body movements. There is complete utilization of the available living
space; the imagos drive older nymphs from their resting places, and the
older nymphs drive out the younger ones, until all cracks, depending on
their size, are occupied by various age groups of different sizes. In
his experiments Ehrlich observed that in cages with no hiding places the
cockroaches would group together; when given a choice of small and large
shelters, _P. americana_ hid only under the larger ones that could
shelter more insects. Finally, the cockroaches ceased to bite and fight
each other when they crowded together in the face of danger.

Of _Blatta orientalis_ Marlatt (1915) stated "This species is notably
gregarious in habit, individuals living together in colonies in the most
amicable way, the small ones being allowed by the larger ones to sit on
them, run over them, and nestle beneath them without any resentment
being shown." Haber (1919) also observed that this species is often
noticed "huddled together, the younger ones crawling over, around, and
beneath the older ones."

Wille (1920) observed that nymphs of _Blattella germanica_ remained
almost constantly in groups during the first and second instars, but
less so during the third instar. He believed that the aggregations of
young occurred because they could occupy narrow crevices where the
larger insects could not penetrate. At usual room temperatures the older
nymphs and adults lived completely isolated, but at certain temperatures
they gathered together in large, tightly pressed groups.

_Supella supellectilium_ is said to be gregarious (Gould and Deay,
1940). The smaller nymphs aggregate in small groups in rearing
containers, but the older ones remain separate from one another (Hafez
and Afifi, 1956). _Leucophaea maderae_ is sociable and rarely found
alone; in their favorite hiding places, hills of these cockroaches can
be seen hanging together (Sein, 1923). Wolcott (1950) also stated that
_L. maderae_ is gregarious. Annandale (1900) observed that in the
"Siamese Malay States" large colonies of _Periplaneta australasiae_
conceal themselves in hollows of bamboo logs from which houses are
built. Moulton (1912) stated that he was astonished at the large numbers
of _P. australasiae_ and _Symploce cavernicola_ that he saw swarming on
the sides of caves of Mt. Jibong, Borneo.

Rehn and Hebard (1905) stated that in Key West, Fla., _Eurycotis
floridana_ fairly swarmed under the coquina boulders in the woods, in
groups of a dozen containing both young and adults; _Pycnoscelus
surinamensis_ was very abundant in the same type of habitat. Caudell
(1905) also found the young of _E. floridana_ with the mature
individuals. Hebard (1917) in his discussion of _Lattiblattella rehni_
again mentioned finding frequent colonies of _E. floridana_ in Florida.
He also found many specimens of _Blaberus craniifer_ under boards on the
ground at Key West. He found _Parcoblatta lata_ numerous under bark of
dead pine trees in Alabama. However, Dowdy (1955), in an ecological
study of oak-hickory forest in Missouri, stated that "_Parcoblatta_
[sp.] were never recorded as being gregarious, in fact they were mostly
solitary. However, in some cases two were found together." Yet Blatchley
(1895) stated of _Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ that in the winter in
Indiana "One cannot pull the loose bark from an old log without
dislodging a colony of from ten to a hundred of the nymphs of various
sizes." Males of _Parcoblatta virginica_ were said to be often
gregarious beneath loose bark and under chunks and rubbish (Blatchley,
1920).

Rehn and Hebard (1927) quoted observations made earlier by Hebard on
_Byrsotria fumigata_ in Cuba: "I found the specimens under flat stones,
sometimes in colonies of 3 or 4 mature specimens and numbers of immature
individuals in all stages of development." These observers also reported
that _Aspiduchus borinquen_ was found in Puerto Rico in a limestone
cavern by thousands in the grass and on the walls. J. W. H. Rehn (1951a)
stated that a related species, apparently _Aspiduchus cavernicola_, was
seen in great numbers on the side walls and roof of a cave in Puerto
Rico, but it was not possible to collect any of these and, we infer,
confirm the species. Rehn and Hebard (1927) in their account of
_Simblerastes jamaicanus_ reported finding it in numbers in a termite
nest. Pemberton and Williams (1938) stated that _Diploptera punctata_ is
of gregarious habits in Hawaii. Saupe (1928) observed a strong "herd
instinct" in all age groups of _Blaberus craniifer_. Bunting (personal
communication, 1956) stated that large nymphs and adults of _Blaberus
discoidalis_ "congregate in narrow cracks or on the underside of some
low object. The younger nymphs keep in close communities of
approximately the same age." Sonan (1924) stated that in Formosa(?)
_Salganea morio_ is usually found in groups of six or seven in decayed
trees. Species of the genus _Litopeltis_ may be found in small groups as
they are somewhat gregarious (Rehn, 1928).

The physiological or psychological effects of gregariousness, or lack of
it, are interesting aspects of the basic phenomenon. Landowski (1937)
studied in _Blatta orientalis_ the effect on development and growth of
the transition from life in complete isolation to life in groups. He
kept nymphs in groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 in jars of identical size
and shape. Landowski found that (1) mortality increased with the size of
the group and with age, as each animal occupied more of the available
space. [Presumably these factors are less detrimental in nature where
the group is unconfined.] He further found that (2) life in complete
isolation extended the time required to produce an adult insect; and (3)
the mean weight of the adult insect was, generally, in inverse
proportion to the number of nymphs raised together; isolated insects
usually attained the greatest adult weight.

Similarly, Griffiths and Tauber (1942a) found that isolation extended
the period of nymphal development in _Periplaneta americana_. As most of
their isolates died before reaching maturity, these workers concluded
that the American cockroach does not thrive when individually isolated
and that several individuals must be together for optimum development to
occur. Pettit (1940, 1940a) observed that isolated nymphs of _Blattella
germanica_ take longer to mature than those reared in groups. Wallick
(1954) found indications in _B. germanica_ that there is an inverse
relationship between population density and individual weight; as the
population decreased the weight increased. He also noted an inverse
relationship between population density and life expectancy in this
species.

We (Willis et al., 1958) have confirmed the above observations that
_Blattella germanica_, _Blatta orientalis_, and _Periplaneta americana_
complete nymphal development in less time when reared in groups rather
than individually. We (loc. cit.) also found that nymphs of the
following additional species matured more quickly when reared in groups:
_Eurycotis floridana_, _Periplaneta fuliginosa_, _Supella
supellectilium_, _Nauphoeta cinerea_, and _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_;
only a very slight decrease in the average length of the developmental
period was found in grouped nymphs of _Leucophaea maderae_.

Wharton et al. (1954) observed that virgin adult males of _Periplaneta
americana_ that had been individually isolated upon emergence were
almost wholly unresponsive to the sexually stimulating, female odor for
a test period of four weeks. Similar males of comparable age that were
kept in groups reacted strongly from the sixth day on. Removal of
reactive males from the group inhibited the reaction in these isolates,
but the response returned when the insects were regrouped. We (1952) had
similarly observed that no isolated male of _Blattella germanica_ was
ever seen to give a courting response without having received some form
of external stimulation. Yet when numbers of males were kept together
isolated from females, on several occasions the males became active and
a few individuals gave a courting response. As the sexual stimulus is
received by the male of _B. germanica_ through contact rather than odor,
as in _P. americana_, presumably it was mutual contact between the
grouped males that released the courting activity.

Cloudsley-Thompson (1953a), in his studies of diurnal rhythms in
_Periplaneta americana_, observed a steady decline in total activity in
successive 24-hour cycles: "When two cockroaches, even of different
species (_P. americana_ and _P. australasiae_) were kept together, this
depression did not appear to set in so readily." The associates
apparently kept each other active.

Isolated females of _Periplaneta americana_ can be conditioned to run a
simple maze with less time and fewer errors per trial than when paired
or when a member of a group of three (Gates and Allee, 1933). There was
less activity, and accordingly fewer errors per minute, among
cockroaches tested as pairs and groups of three than as isolated
individuals. This observation should not be contrasted with that of
Cloudsley-Thompson (1953a), cited above, because the intervals during
which activity was observed were quite different.

In the above account we have presumed that aggregations of some species
are indications of gregariousness. However, until gregariousness has
been proved experimentally for each species, we concede that reactions
to environmental stimuli might be sufficient to bring about some of the
observed groupings without any interaction between individuals.

In concluding this section we note that Tepper (1893) stated that
carnivorous cockroaches in Australia lead more or less solitary lives,
and that one rarely meets several together in close proximity. Takahashi
(1940) observed that in Formosa _Blattella humbertiana_ does not have a
tendency to throng together. Rau (1947) stated that the adults of
_Ischnoptera deropeltiformis_ showed no tendency toward gregariousness,
but in the laboratory newly hatched young lived close together under
bark and remained together throughout the nymphal stages. We wonder
whether this gregariousness was not imposed by the restricted quarters
of the cage. As mentioned above, Dowdy (1955) did not find _Parcoblatta_
sp. to be gregarious in the field.


INTRASPECIES FIGHTING

Fighting occurs among cockroaches of the same species over food or
shelter or between males. Saupe (1928) observed late-instar nymphs of
_Blaberus craniifer_ attack each other and even adults. Additional
records cited in the section on intraspecies predation (p. 322) imply
fighting within a species. Rau (1924) saw a male of _Blatta orientalis_
attack another male in copula and bite away a large portion of its wing.
Two other males in the container had their wings badly torn overnight,
presumably as a result of fighting.

Ehrlich (1943) stated that individuals of _Periplaneta americana_ that
are feeding will ward off intruders by spreading their wings and pushing
with their hind legs. However, the intruder will approach again and
again biting the feeder in the legs and wings. Frequently the odor of
approaching food was sufficient to cause the cockroaches to fight and
bite each other. Biting and fighting also occurred when individuals of
this species defended their daytime hiding places. A position of attack
is assumed when two antagonistic individuals of _P. americana_ meet
(Ehrlich, 1943, fig. 14). The insects raise their bodies slightly above
the ground, by extending their legs, and they stretch their heads
forward horizontally so that their mouth parts protrude; when the
insects jump at each other, they may wound each other severely in the
soft parts of the body. Fighting between sexually excited males resulted
in injury to their legs, wings, cerci, and other parts of the body.
Frequently an insect that could no longer defend itself was killed.
Lederer (1952) also made similar but less extensive observations on
fighting in this species.

Pettit (1940) quoted Woodruff as stating that nymphs of _Blattella
germanica_, apparently healthy and perfectly normal, would do battle for
no apparent cause other than a chance meeting, and that occasionally the
fight was to the finish, the loser being eaten. Pettit could not
substantiate such voracious attacks, although he saw nymphs engage in
fights lasting about two seconds during which one would be driven off by
vigorous bites on legs or cerci. Small nymphs of _B. germanica_ tended
to ignore each other, but third-and later-instar nymphs would engage in
"quarrels" of short duration when two met. Pettit noted that males of
_B. germanica_ that were crowded together quickly set upon, but did not
always kill, other cockroaches introduced into their cage. When he
isolated a dozen males in a small cage, they became quarrelsome and
three of the group were killed and partly eaten. After several days the
surviving males had taken positions so that each was equidistant from
his neighbors. Some of these males attacked other males and a female
that were introduced, by biting their legs and cerci. Females under
similar conditions were much less aggressive, although Pettit saw some
females that roved about biting all large members of the group that were
within easy reach.

We have frequently observed aggressive behavior between males of
_Nauphoeta cinerea_, which resulted in torn wings. The males would
wrestle with each other rolling over and over.


INTERSPECIES COMPATIBILITY

We agree in essence with Chopard (1938) who stated that it is improper
to speak of associations apropos of the ecological distribution of
Orthoptera. He continued that it is clearly evident that different
species of Orthoptera, which are found grouped on a territory more or
less narrowly limited, have no interdependence among them. Their
grouping results uniquely from almost similar reactions to the different
factors which characterize this limited milieu. There is neither
interdependence nor interaction; the grouping is a false biocoenose,
born under the action of the environment, and does not survive a
modification of this milieu.

However, as there are numerous examples of mutual toleration between
different species as well as examples of incompatibility, the subject
has more than academic interest even if no true ecological significance.
On the other hand, further study may show that certain of these
associations are definitely ecological, particularly among the feral
species. As might be expected, most of the following examples pertain to
domiciliary cockroaches.

Dozier (1920) occasionally found _Periplaneta americana_ with _Eurycotis
floridana_ in decaying stumps, beneath loose bark of decayed trees, and
beneath corded wood. Adair (1923) stated that in his house in Egypt
_Periplaneta americana_, _Blatta orientalis_, and _Blattella germanica_
were found together in a cupboard. Sambon (1925) found _B. orientalis_
and _B. germanica_ side by side but not fraternizing in a home in Italy.
Gould and Deay (1938) observed that apartments over stores were infested
with both _B. germanica_ and _P. americana_, but did not indicate
whether these occupied the same microhabitat. Gould and Deay (1940)
observed that in the Purdue University greenhouse _Periplaneta
fuliginosa_ was found "under benches, boxes, pots and other objects in
association with the American roach." Dr. L. A. Hetrick (personal
communication, 1954) wrote us that several summers before he had had a
mixed infestation of cockroaches, which included _Periplaneta
australasiae_, _Periplaneta fuliginosa_, and _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_,
in his chicken shed.

Eads (personal communication, 1955), in response to our inquiry about
the mixed populations of cockroaches that he had reported infesting
sewers in Texas (Eads et al., 1954), stated that "Each of the ten
colonies of _B. orientalis_ found in Tyler manholes were associated with
larger colonies of _P. americana_. True breeding colonies of _B.
orientalis_ appeared to be present since all the developmental stages
were taken. The same situation existed with the _P. fuliginosa_ and the
two species of _Parcoblatta_. Larger colonies of _P. americana_ were
associated with the other species in each case. From our limited
observations the two species always appeared to be perfectly
compatible." Eads et al. (1954) had found _Periplaneta fuliginosa_ in
three manholes, _Parcoblatta bolliana_ in one manhole and _Parcoblatta
pensylvanica_ in one manhole. We assume that the groups of each species
were spacially discrete so that they were recognizable as colonies. Dr.
T. A. Olson (personal communication, 1958) has observed two or more
species of cockroaches in a single structure but never in mixed
colonies. Each species was separated physically from the others. Olson
concluded that cockroaches of different species do not mingle freely
unless forced to do so by some special environmental condition. Pettit
(1940) found _B. germanica_ and _P. americana_ similarly separated in
the same building or even in the same basement laboratory.

Perkins (1899) found _Lobopterella dimidiatipes_ generally living in
company with the young of _Periplaneta australasiae_ in Hawaii. Rehn and
Hebard (1914) in Florida found _P. australasiae_ abundant with
_Periplaneta americana_ on a quarter-boat. They also noted that the
forficulid _Marava_ [= _Prolabia_] _arachidis_ (Yersin) appeared in
numbers in a kitchen after dark accompanied by swarms of _P. americana_.
These workers also found _Leurolestes pallidus_ in a fruit store in Key
West "where the species was common in a pile of old burlap bags and in
cracks under the stands which it shared with one fairly large colony of
_Blattella germanica_, occasional specimens of _Holocompsa nitidula_, a
few specimens of _Periplaneta americana_, and one specimen of _Supella
supellectilium_." They also found _H. nitidula_ with _Blaberus
craniifer_ "between old boards in a woodshed, where nymphs were more
numerous than adults."

Rehn and Hebard (1914) stated of _Supella supellectilium_ in Florida
that "The females were all taken in cupboards where _Blattella
germanica_ was found in swarms." The association in human habitations of
_S. supellectilium_ and _B. germanica_ has been reported also by Sein
(1923), Puerto Rico; Shaw (1924), Australia; Mallis (1954): "German and
brown-banded roaches were often found in the same crevice."; Anonymous
(1958), Texas; and Anonymous (1958a), Georgia. Gould and Deay (1940)
stated that other species of cockroaches, especially _B. germanica_, may
be found with _S. supellectilium_ in the same part of a building. Yet
Shaw (1925) stated that "when _Supella supellectilium_ Serv. invades
places already occupied by _Blattella germanica_ L., it tends to oust
the latter."

_Blaberus discoidalis_ has been found in homes or in fruit debris in
Puerto Rico in company with the more common, domiciliary species
_Leucophaea maderae_, but never in abundance (Sein, 1923; Wolcott,
1950). Illingworth (1915) in Hawaii found _Symploce hospes_ associated
with _Nauphoeta cinerea_, _Graptoblatta notulata_, and _Diploptera
punctata_.

Hebard (1917) found _Aglaopteryx diaphana_ in a bromeliad on a forest
tree in Jamaica together with _Nyctibora laevigata_ and numerous
_Cariblatta insularis_. He also found numerous _Aglaopteryx gemma_ under
signs on longleaf pines in Alabama with occasional specimens of
_Parcoblatta lata_. In Virginia he found _Parcoblatta uhleriana_ in a
decaying chestnut log with _Cryptocercus punctulalus_. In Florida he
found _Latiblattella rehni_ with _Eurycotis floridana_ and, more rarely,
with _Periplaneta australasiae_ under bark of pine trees. In Key West he
found _Symploce hospes_ in the cupboard of a hotel with swarms of
_Blattella germanica_ and a few _Supella supellectilium_.

Rehn and Hebard (1927) in their study of West Indian blattids reported
finding _Neoblattella proserpina_ in epiphytic bromeliads in Jamaica in
company with _Neoblattella eurydice_ and _Neoblattella dryas_. They also
list most of the associations cited by Hebard (1917).

Ramme (1923) reported that he found in Germany four species of
_Ectobius_ (_lapponicus_, _lucidus_, _pallidus_, and _sylvester_) living
together in an area about 50 m. by 200 m. Although he had stated that
his specimens of _E. lucidus_ were a distinct species in 1923, Ramme
(1951) later decided that they were a form of _E. sylvester_, _E.
sylvester_ f. _lucidus_.

Dow (1955) reported trapping _Blattella germanica_, _Periplaneta
americana_, and _Periplaneta brunnea_ in houses and privies in south
Texas. At our request Dr. Dow (personal communication, 1958) analyzed
his records to determine whether there were indications of associations
between these species, with the following results:

     As stated in my published note, the roaches were at first
     classified to genus only. The 83 _Periplaneta_ subsequently
     identified to species represented 28 different collections, 11 from
     houses and 17 from privies, all in Pharr, Texas. Tabulation of the
     data shows first that _P. americana_ was taken only once in a house
     and that _P. brunnea_ was taken only 4 times in privies. Of course
     this distribution greatly reduces the probability that they would
     be caught together, and it is not surprising that _P. americana_
     was trapped alone in the single house collection. _P. brunnea_,
     however, was trapped with _P. americana_ 2 of the 4 times it
     occurred in privy collections.

     To investigate the occurrence of _Periplaneta_ with and without
     _Blattella_, an analysis has been made of 560 trap collections
     taken in 40 houses and 40 associated privies in Pharr, Texas, in
     weekly intervals (from May 14 to June 23 [1948]). In the houses,
     _Periplaneta_ and _Blattella_ were caught in the same jar 26
     times, _Periplaneta_ alone 12 times, _Blattella_ alone 83 times,
     and neither genus 159 times. In a fourfold table, the value of
     chi-square (14.7) is significant and indicates that the
     frequencies are not proportional. The number of times
     _Periplaneta_ and _Blattella_ actually occurred together (26) is,
     however, much larger than the expected number calculated from the
     row and column frequencies (14.8). In the privies, _Periplaneta_
     and _Blattella_ were caught in the same jar 9 times, _Periplaneta_
     alone 50 times, _Blattella_ alone 18 times, and neither genus 203
     times. In a fourfold table, the value of chi-square (1.95) is not
     significant but the same type of disproportion is evident and the
     expected frequency of both genera in one trap is 5.7, lower than
     the actual frequency of 9. Both immature and adult roaches are
     included in this analysis.

     The above evidence would be more satisfactory if based on more
     extensive data. There is also a possible objection in that the
     traps were operated for at least overnight, during which time one
     species could theoretically supplant another. Of course, it is
     doubtful that there is anything involved here like territory (in
     the ornithologists' sense). On the other hand, it is well to
     consider that _Periplaneta_ and _Blattella_ are both likely to be
     more abundant in the same type of favorable location and that this
     factor might offset in part some direct antagonism between the
     species.

The only known specimen of _Ischnoptera podoces_ was captured in company
with the type series of _Cariblatta nebulicola_, in dead leaf litter in
Jamaica (Rehn and Hebard, 1927). In Florida _Periplaneta australasiae_
was often taken in company with _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ and
_Eurycotis floridana_ (Blatchley, 1920).


INTERSPECIES ANTAGONISM

In contrast to the presumably amicable associations mentioned above,
other observations in the literature seem to indicate that some species
of cockroaches are incompatible when they attempt to occupy the same
habitat niche. Marlatt (1915) stated "Rarely do two of the domestic
species occur together in the same house. Often, also, of two
neighboring districts one may be infested with one species, while in the
other a distinct species is the commoner one. The different species are
thus seemingly somewhat antagonistic, and it is even supposed that they
may prey upon one another, the less numerous species being often driven
out." Phelps (1924) stated "Roaches of different species are rarely
found together, although roaches of the same species live together on
very amicable terms."

In 1859 Darwin (1887) stated that "In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach
[_Blattella germanica?_] has everywhere driven before it its great
congener [_Blatta orientalis?_]." Yet in France Girard (1877) suggested
that the oriental cockroach be introduced into a restaurant infested
with the German cockroach as the best way to expel the latter, because
the more robust species drives away cockroaches of smaller size. Wille
(1920) in Germany found usually only one species of cockroach in a
house. Yet when he placed _B. orientalis_ and _B. germanica_ together,
there were no reciprocal attacks even by hungry individuals. Wille
concluded that because of their greater speed, smaller size, greater
number of eggs, and faster development, the German cockroaches eat the
available food and so make the environment unfavorable for the oriental.
However, he noted that cases may be seen in which the opposite is also
possible. Laing (1946; British Museum [Natural History], 1951) observed
that in the British Isles _B. orientalis_ seems to have lost its
dominant position to _B. germanica_ in recent years; it was stated that
these species are not as a rule found together and that the greater
rapidity of breeding and ability to climb of _B. germanica_, as well as
the layout of modern buildings, are some of the factors that favor the
spread of _B. germanica_. Ledoux (1945) found that first-instar nymphs
of _B. germanica_ and fourth-instar nymphs of _B. orientalis_, adults of
_B. germanica_ and sixth-instar nymphs of _B. orientalis_, as well as
adults of both species, did not form mixed groups. However, when he
combined fifth-and sixth-instar nymphs of _B. germanica_ with
fourth-and fifth-instar nymphs of _B. orientalis_, which are all
practically of equal size, sometimes he would find mixed groups, but
generally the groups were distinct. Lucas (1912) stated that Burr had
found _B. germanica_ and _B. orientalis_ swarming within a rubbish heap
in England; presumably both colonies were breeding and multiplying and
one species was not detrimental to the presence of the other.

Shaw (1925) claimed that _Supella supellectilium_ tended to oust
_Blattella germanica_, but Pope (1953) thought it doubtful in
Queensland. Wolcott (1950) stated that "The larger and more powerful
domestic cockroaches, _Periplaneta americana_ (L.), _P. australasiae_
(F.) and _P. brunnea_ Burmeister have very definitely fallen behind in
Puerto Rico in competition with the little German roach." Pessoa and
Corea (1928) observed that other species of cockroaches were rare in
Brazil in houses that were infested with _Leucophaea maderae_. Lederer
(1952) noticed that in the reptile house of the aquarium at Frankfort am
Main _Blatta orientalis_ was obviously kept down by _Blattella
germanica_, even before the appearance of _P. americana_. However, _B.
germanica_ was not driven out of the reptile house by _P. americana_
although the populations of each fluctuated for about 22 years after the
American cockroach had settled there; both species occupied separate
resting places. Lederer further observed that within four years of the
introduction of _P. americana_ into the crocodile house, none of the
original infestation of _B. orientalis_ could be found; a small colony
of _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ in the reptile house was apparently also
driven out by _P. americana_. Chopard (1932, 1938) stated that the
oriental cockroach does not exist in company with _P. americana_ which
very probably destroys it. Pettit (1940) kept _B. germanica_ and _P.
americana_ together in a cage for several weeks but neither species gave
any indication of feeding on the other.

Froggatt (1906) stated that "It is probable that the advent of the
larger and more formidable American cockroach into Australia has led to
the retirement or destruction of our indigenous species" [presumably
_Periplaneta australasiae_]. Tillyard (1926) noted that this statement
is incorrect as neither species is native to Australia. Yet Shaw (1925)
stated that in Australia "When both species live together in the same
places, _australasiae_ Fabr. will probably be found gradually to
displace _americana_ L." Local fluctuations in the relative abundance of
these species could be a basis for such dissimilar observations.
However, MacDougall (1925) observed that in the plant houses of the
Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh, the Australian cockroach seemed to
have overcome the American which had been more numerous in former years.

In conclusion, we emphasize that many of the above observations are
merely tentative impressions gathered by workers who have watched many
species of cockroaches in nature. Obviously, additional observations
coupled with appropriate experimentation will be needed to disclose the
true structure of each presumed association and to resolve apparent
discrepancies. Although we are greatly indebted to the cited authors for
their contributions to the known information, we anticipate that future
results of cleverly designed laboratory experiments will do much to
dispel the uncertainty that still surrounds our knowledge of the
relations of the Blattaria to each other.




XVIII. DEFENSE OF COCKROACHES AGAINST PREDATORS

     Irritating or repellent secretions provide many animals belonging
     to widely unrelated groups with a more or less potent means of
     defence....

     It will be seen that this method of defence does not rest merely
     upon a passive unpalatable attribute, but upon an active emission
     of the unpalatable substance which, since it occurs when the
     animal is seized or threatened by an enemy, enforces its
     effectiveness. In its highest development we find different forms
     whose specialized habits and modified structure enables them to
     _project_ secretion at the enemy, and thus to discourage attack.

                                                           COTT (1940)


There are very few records indicating that cockroaches are unaccepted as
food by other animals. Hutson (1943) found that the duck, guinea fowl,
and pigeon would not normally eat _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, and in his
experiments with the chicken eye worm he had to force-feed his birds
with infected cockroaches. Lederer (1952) found that insectivorous birds
in the Zoological Garden, Frankfurt am Main, either refused hardened (as
opposed to teneral) American cockroaches or ate them unwillingly.
Carpenter (1925) reported that a monkey (_Cercopithecus_) failed to feed
on cockroaches and suggested that the insects' odor made them repugnant;
however, there are a number of positive records of monkeys feeding on
cockroaches (see pp. 284-286).

Cockroaches may escape capture by predators through evasive behavior,
concealment, protective coloration, mimicry, or secretion of malodorous
materials. Nocturnal cockroaches may avoid predators that are active
during the day (Crawford, 1934), but nocturnal predators are apparently
quite successful in capturing cockroaches. Some cockroaches may be
protected by their swiftness, others by their resemblance to vegetation
(Williams, 1928). The habit of squeezing into narrow cracks may afford
cockroaches some protection.

Burrowing forms such as _Pycnoscelus_ may spend much time in underground
cells (Roeser, 1940). Polyphagids rapidly burrow into sand (Fausek,
1906), where they may be protected from predators. Tepper (1893)
discovered that a very large Australian cockroach, _Geoscapheus
robustus_, had its fore legs, especially the tibiae, adapted for
digging. He observed this species in captivity and in 1894 reported that
it appeared to sink into the soil without raising any considerable
amount above the surface and that it did not form an unobstructed
tunnel. Another large Australian cockroach, _Macropanesthia rhinocerus_,
burrows about two feet below the surface of sandy soil; it also makes
nests among pine roots and the nymphs rarely appear above ground (Henson
_in_ Day, 1950). Tepper (1893) observed that Australian cockroaches of
the genera _Epilampra_ and _Oniscosoma_ buried themselves in loose soil
and dust. Baker (_in_ Rehn, 1930) observed that _Styphon bakeri_ is
found in humus and rubble in the Dutch West Indies where "It is sluggish
in the open, but wedges into the humus quite quickly."

_Therea nuptialis_, found in India, conceals itself at the roots of fig
trees, etc. The small hairs on its elytra retain sufficient dust to
conceal it, or at any rate to render it inconspicuous, when not on the
wing (Annandale, _in_ Chopard, 1924c). Rehn and Hebard (1914) observed
that the nymphs of _Blaberus craniifer_[13] at Key West, Fla., "were
usually found half buried in loose damp earth under boards, where they
remained motionless, looking much like lumps of earth (with which they
were usually much dusted) until disturbed." Hebard (1917) reported of
_Monastria biguttata_ from Brazil that "All of the juveniles are heavily
coated with foreign particles" which adhere "to a multitude of closely
placed, minute and usually curved spines, which cover the dorsal surface
and marginal portions of the ventral surface."

It is apparent from the numbers of predators reported herein that many
animals are not deterred by the odorous secretions of cockroaches; these
secretions, because they may seem repugnant to man, are often claimed to
be repellent to predators. However, Cott (1940) points out that "There
are many instances in which protective devices and associated warning
colours are known to be ineffectual against certain enemies. But this
does not necessarily imply that they are not on the whole beneficial to
the species attacked." Certain cockroach secretions may well be
repellent to many predators, but as this is a purely negative aspect of
the predator-prey relationship little thus far has been observed or
published. Potential prey that successfully defends itself against
attack is never found in a predator's stomach.

Cockroaches have a variety of glands which secrete odorous materials.
Certain secretions, produced by tergal or dorsal glands in males, are
involved in sexual behavior; the females feed on the secretion from
these glands prior to copulating (Roth and Willis, 1954). However, other
secretions which are produced by both sexes are ejected or given off
when the insect is disturbed; undoubtedly these are defensive weapons
that are used against predators. Very few experiments or observations
are on record to show how effective these secretions may be in
protecting the cockroach. Although the morphology of some of the glands
has been described, relatively little is known about the chemistry of
their secretions.

Many species of Australian cockroaches have been reported to emit
"disgusting" odors, though the glands producing these secretions have
not been described, nor is the chemistry of the compounds known.
_Cosmozosteria lateralis_ exposed two orange-red spots on the abdomen
while emitting a pungent odor which deterred a collector from capturing
it (Shelford, 1912). Another Australian species, _Platyzosteria
castanea_, when disturbed on barren ground tilts forward on the vertex
and straddles out the posterior legs, supporting itself in a vertical
position on the head and tarsi; in assuming this attitude it will squirt
a foetid fluid as a fine spray for a distance of 6 or 7 inches (Shaw,
1914). Spencer (1892) mentions the pungent odor given off by a cockroach
which had been accidentally cut in two. Rageau (1956) stated that in the
New Hebrides and New Caledonia _Cutilia nitida_ emits, when disturbed, a
corrosive liquid with an extremely disagreeable odor.

The adults of _Eurycotis floridana_ emit an odorous fluid when seized
(Rehn and Hebard, 1905). The fluid, which may irritate sensitive skin
areas, may be ejected as a spray for a distance of several inches. This
secretion has been identified as 2-hexenal (Roth et al., 1956), and the
ventral abdominal glands which produce it have been described (Stay,
1957). Eisner (personal communication, 1958) has found that the toad
_Bufo marinus_ and the frog _Rana pipiens_ invariably spit out adults of
_E. floridana_ which they have seized. The odor of 2-hexenal was
strongly apparent after these attacks, and the insect was never damaged.
However, the lizard _Anolis equestris_ seized and crushed _E.
floridana_ before releasing its hold and dropping the insect 5 to 10
minutes later. The blue jay _Cyanocitta cristata_ readily attacked
adults of _E. floridana_ and killed them but did not eat the insects
until after the odor had dissipated; however, the bird carried nymphs of
_E. floridana_ to its perch and ate them. Nymphs of this species do not
secrete 2-hexenal (Roth et al., 1956). Recently, 2-hexenal has been
tested for its antibacterial activity and has been found to be active
against seven species of pathogenic bacteria (Valcurone and Baggini,
1957). _Eurycotis decipiens_ from Trinidad also ejects a fluid which may
produce toxic symptoms such as vertigo and nausea (Bunting _in_ Roth and
Willis, 1957a).

Large reservoirs of glands similar in appearance and position to those
of _Eurycotis floridana_ are present in the adults of both sexes of
_Neostylopyga rhombifolia_ and _Platyzosteria novae seelandiae_. Walker
(1904) and Longstaff (_in_ Shelford, 1912) noted that the latter species
had a strong odor. Roth (unpublished data, 1957) found that the
secretion of _P. novae seelandiae_ when ejected is grayish or milky in
color. In the reservoirs of the ventral gland of this insect the
secretion is a milky liquid containing floating greenish globules. Both
infrared and mass spectrographic analyses show that the secretion is a
mixture containing 2-hexenal, the aldehyde that is found in _E.
floridana_. Eisner (personal communication, 1958) observed that the
lizard _Anolis carolinensis_ immediately released _Neostylopyga
rhombifolia_ without injury, but that _Bufo marinus_, _Anolis
equistris_, and _Cyanocitta cristata_ ate the insect despite the
secretion; several unidentified spiders and the ant _Pogonomyrmex
badius_ were not repelled by the secretion of _N. rhombifolia_.

Dorsal and ventral glands have been found in both sexes of _Blatta
orientalis_ and _Periplaneta americana_ (Minchin, 1888, 1890; Kul'vets,
1898; Oettinger, 1906; Harrison, 1906; Liang, 1956). The ventral glands
are found in the same general region as those of _Eurycotis_. We have
also found similar ventrally located glands in both _Periplaneta
australasiae_, and _P. brunnea_. The reservoirs which store the
secretion of the ventral glands are smaller in _Blatta_ and
_Periplaneta_ spp. than those found in _Eurycotis_, _Neostylopyga_, or
_Platyzosteria_.

In _Blatta orientalis_ the dorsal glands can be everted by pressure on
the abdomen; the secretion in these glands, according to Haase (1889),
has the typical oriental cockroach odor. Although the dorsal glands of
the oriental cockroach are usually given a defensive role (Haase, 1889,
1889a; Kul'vets, 1898; Oettinger, 1906; Koncek, 1924), the functions of
secretions of these nonepigamic dorsal glands and the ventral glands are
still open to question. It is possible that some of the odors produced
by cockroaches have functions other than defense or sex attraction. For
example, Ledoux (1945) showed that the species odor is largely
responsible for the gregarious behavior shown by _Blatta orientalis_ and
_Blattella germanica_. The olfactory stimulus acts over a short distance
only, and the source of this odor in the insect is unknown. By washing
_Blattella germanica_ in warm chloroform Dusham (1918) extracted a wax
which had the odor of the German cockroach. However, there is no
evidence to show that cockroaches respond to the same cockroach odors
that are detected by man.

Certain cockroaches have recently been found to have odorous secretions
which are produced in tracheal glands. In _Diploptera punctata_ the
tracheae leading to the second abdominal spiracles of nymphs and adults
are modified into odoriferous glands which produce a mixture of
2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone; 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone; and _para_
benzoquinone; this material is ejected as a means of defense. The
offensive odor emitted by adults and nymphs of _Leucophaea maderae_ also
issues from the second abdominal spiracles (Roth and Stay, 1958).

_Diploptera_ is capable of ejecting its quinones from either its right
or left tracheal gland according to which side of the insect is attacked
(pl. 36, A-B). Eisner (1958) found that the secretion repelled the ant
_Pogonomyrmex badius_ (Latreille) (pl. 36, C) and the beetle _Galerita
janus_ Fabricius when they attacked the cockroach. The spider _Lycosa
helluo_ Walckenaer was repelled by large nymphs and adults of _D.
punctata_ but young nymphs were usually eaten promptly (Eisner, 1958).

Bordas (1901, 1908) believed that the "conglobate" gland (Miall and
Denny, 1886), found in males of _Periplaneta americana_ and _Blatta
orientalis_, was an odoriferous gland used for defense, but Gupta (1947)
has shown that in all probability this gland (the phallic gland)
secretes the outermost covering of the spermatophore.

What appears to be mimicry occurs in some species of Blattaria. The
nymphs of many Panchlorini and Blaberinae vaguely resemble sow bugs
(Chopard, 1938). Certain members of the Perisphaerini (e.g.,
_Perisphaerus glomeriformis_) from the Malayan region which resemble sow
bugs (Annandale, 1900; Hanitsch, 1915) can roll themselves up into a
ball thus hiding their antennae and legs (Lucas, 1862). Although these
cockroaches are found among dead leaves or under stones, in places in
which sow bugs are also found, the benefit to either or both forms is
questionable; Annandale (1900) believed that the crustacean and the
cockroach, living under similar conditions, developed the same general
body shape. Rolling up into a ball is nothing more than an exaggeration
of a reflex common to many young cockroaches, that is, an arched
position which these insects assume when they immobilize themselves in
response to certain stimuli (Chopard, 1938).

There are cockroaches that resemble various Coleoptera and Hemiptera
(Belt, 1874; Shelford, 1912; Hanitsch, 1915). Some look like
cerambycids, lampyrids, coccinellids, pentatomids, etc. Perhaps the most
striking examples are the resemblances of cockroaches in the genus
_Prosoplecta_ of the Epilamprinae to beetles of the family
Coccinellidae; Shelford (1912) has figured a number of species of
_Prosoplecta_ together with the species of beetles which they seem to
have taken for models. Williams (1928) mentioned diurnal cockroaches
which by a combination of markings, shape, posture, and active flight
about vegetation suggest certain wasps.

Unfortunately, practically nothing is known about the behavior of these
so-called mimics and models or their relationships with predators in the
field. For the most part, the examples are based on a comparison of
pinned insects from museum collections (Burr, 1899); for this reason
Chopard (1938) believed that not much value should be placed on
superficial resemblances of this kind. However, we believe that a lack
of knowledge of cockroach mimicry is not a valid reason for rejecting
the idea that mimicry, if it occurs, may be of some benefit in the
survival of mimetic species. Certainly Cott's (1940) voluminous
compilation of the literature on adaptive coloration should make the
most skeptic hesitate to conclude dogmatically that these instances of
mimicry are merely accidental and meaningless.




XIX. THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF COCKROACHES

     In the Navy [Japanese] a seaman who has captured 300 cockroaches
     will be granted one day special shore leave. They call it "shore
     leave for cockroaches." The purpose is to promote extermination of
     cockroaches in a warship because, on the one hand, any warship
     suffers from numerous cockroaches, and, on the other hand, any
     seaman likes shore leave.... The formalities for a shore leave for
     cockroaches are as follows. A seaman keeps cockroaches which he
     captured (mainly _B. germanica_, because _P. americana_ and _P.
     australasiae_ are seldom found in Japan) in a bottle or in a bag
     until the number reaches 300. Then he brings them to the deck
     officer to get the confirmation that he has actually captured more
     than 300 cockroaches. If the deck officer confirms it, the seaman
     goes to a cabin where a petty officer reports that the deck
     officer confirmed the number of cockroaches. The petty officer
     signs the seaman's name, name of division, rank, and date to be on
     shore leave in the log book for cockroach shore leaves. The petty
     officer brings the log book again to the deck officer to get his
     approval and then goes to the commander for the final approval. In
     the Navy, they have another special shore leave for rats. In this
     system, a seaman gets one day shore leave for one rat. The
     formalities for the latter are the same as for the former, and
     there is a log book for the rat shore leave in the petty officer's
     quarters. The author took advantage of these systems frequently.

                                                           SONAN (1924)


Little is known of the effects of predatism and parasitism on natural
populations of cockroaches. Many statements in the literature are very
general; yet there are a few data on egg parasites (e.g., _Tetrastichus
hagenowii_) which suggest that, in the absence of parasites, populations
of domestic cockroaches might be much larger than they are in certain
areas. We have summarized the literature on natural control and also
that on the use by man of predators and parasites in the biological
control of cockroaches. However, because of the paucity of information,
we have been unable to evaluate the effectiveness of biological control
in reducing the numbers of pest cockroaches. This is an area that might
reward further investigation.


INVERTEBRATES

_Scorpions._--In Puerto Rico, cockroaches are probably the principal
food of the scorpions which live in old houses, on tree trunks, etc.
(Sein, 1923). The staple diet of scorpions in Arizona is the small
cockroach commonly known as the water bug (Stahnke, 1949); in the part
of Arizona where he resides, Stahnke (personal communication, 1953) says
that the "water-bug" is most generally _Supella supellectilium_ although
_Blattella germanica_ is also found, but less abundantly.

_Spiders._--Jefferys (1760) mentioned a large spider which was protected
in the Antilles and especially on Guadeloupe because it hunted down and
fed on cockroaches; the spider was reputed to be common in every house.
Sir Hans Sloane (1725, _in_ Cowan, 1865) reported that residents of
Jamaica kept spiders in their houses to destroy cockroaches. Takahashi
(1924) reported that, in the Taihoku area of Formosa, human habitations
contained large numbers of spiders which caught and ate cockroaches.
Smith (_in_ Marlatt, 1915) reported that Brazilians encourage large
house spiders because they tend to rid the house of "other insect
pests." In British Guiana tarantulas were kept in a bungalow to control
_Periplaneta_ and _Pycnoscelus_ (Beebe, 1925a).

_Ants._--A Madam Merian noticed that ants cleared houses of cockroaches
(Kirby and Spence, 1822). A small reddish-yellow ant, called Pucchucici
by Peruvian Indians, pursued and destroyed a cockroach called Chilicabra
which was a pest in native huts (Tschudi, 1847). Schwabe (1950b) found
swarms of ants attacking living _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ and stated
that ants are probably the chief enemy of this cockroach in Hawaii.
Wallace (1891) stated that in Africa a band of driver ants may enter a
house and clear it of cockroaches and other arthropods. In British
Guiana, Beebe, (1925) found that several times a year army ants cleared
the laboratory of all cockroaches and tarantulas.

_Wasp egg parasites._--Matsumura (1917, _in_ Asano, 1937) proposed that
parasitic wasps such as _Evania_ and _Brachygaster_ be protected in
Japan as the natural enemies of cockroaches. In one area in France, 20
percent of the oothecae of _Loboptera decipiens_ were parasitized by
_Zeuxevania splendidula_ (Genieys, 1924). Edmunds (1952a) found that 12
percent of 459 oothecae of _Parcoblatta_ collected during December
through April of 1950-51 in Ohio were parasitized; evaniids accounted
for about 7 percent of the parasitization. Additional collection data in
1951-52 Edmunds (1953a) showed that 8.7 percent of 320 wood-cockroach
oothecae were parasitized; 2.8 percent of these parasites were evaniids;
almost 13 percent of the egg capsules collected showed evidence of
previous parasite emergence. Cameron (1957) reported that oothecae of
_Periplaneta americana_ collected in Saudi Arabia were 29 percent
parasitized in March and 25 percent parasitized in October by _Evania
appendigaster_. Sonan (1924) found 1 of 65 oothecae of _P. americana_
and _P. australasiae_ parasitized by _E. appendigaster_ in Formosa.

Cottam (1922) stated that the increase of _Supella supellectilium_ in
Khartoum was checked by a wasp egg-parasite that was later identified as
_Anastatus tenuipes_ (see p. 246) (Ferriere, 1930, 1935). In this
country, this wasp seemed to be effective in decreasing the numbers of
_Supella_ in certain areas in Arizona (Flock, 1941).

In Formosa, _Tetrastichus hagenowii_ was an important parasite of
cockroach eggs (Maki, 1937). Sonan (1924) reported 30 percent
parasitization of 65 oothecae of _Periplaneta americana_ and _P.
australasiae_ collected in Formosa. In Bangalore, India, the natural
parasitization of randomly collected oothecae of _P. americana_ varied
from 21 percent (of 495 oothecae), July 1947-June 1948, and 43 percent
(of 288 oothecae), July-December 1948, to 57 percent (of 178 oothecae),
July-October 1949 (Usman, 1949). Cameron (1955) obtained _T. hagenowii_
from oothecae collected in Trinidad, B.W.I., and Saudi Arabia; some 15
percent of the oothecae of _P. americana_ and _P. australasiae_
collected in October in Trinidad were parasitized; a later collection
(March) was 34 percent parasitized; a small sample of _P. americana_
oothecae was 65 percent parasitized. The oothecae collected in Saudi
Arabia in March were 20 percent parasitized. Plank (1947) found that the
eggs of the American cockroach in Puerto Rico (probably in laboratory
cultures) were so heavily parasitized by _T. hagenowii_ that he had to
use _P. australasiae_ for experimental purposes; in 1950 Plank stated
that more than 50 percent of American cockroach oothecae were
parasitized.

Fahringer (1922) stated that _Prosevania punctata_ could be used to
eradicate cockroaches, but he did not test his hypothesis. Marlatt
(1902) felt that the usefulness of _Evania appendigaster_ in biological
control was impaired by _Tetrastichus_ acting as a hyperparasite (see
footnote 6, p. 236). However, Wolcott (1951) stated that in Puerto Rico
_E. appendigaster_ is quite abundant and is a factor of considerable
importance in controlling cockroaches. Kadocsa (1921) stated that
_Brachygaster minutus_ and _Evania appendigaster_ were not important in
the biological control of cockroaches. These general statements are not
supported by experimental evidence.

It is likely that the smaller wasp egg parasites are more effective than
the evaniids in controlling cockroaches. Only one evaniid develops in a
parasitized ootheca, but many individuals of the other wasps develop in
one ootheca and the number of females that emerge is usually large.
However, Cameron (1957) concluded that, with a parasitism rate of 25 to
29 percent and three to four generations a year, against one or less for
the host, _Evania appendigaster_ in the areas where it is established is
a valuable control agent.

The use of specific egg parasites to control cockroaches has not been
attempted extensively. Cros (1942) liberated a species of _Tetrastichus_
(=_Eulophus_ sp.; see p. 254) in his home in Algeria to control the
oriental cockroach; as far as we know, he did not report the parasite's
effectiveness in reducing the cockroach population. According to
Zimmerman (1948) _Comperia merceti_, when accidentally imported,
practically wiped out _Supella supellectilium_ in parts of Hawaii; he
claimed to have controlled the brown-banded cockroach in a store
building with this parasite. In some parts of Honolulu, almost 100
percent of the oothecae of this cockroach were parasitized (Zimmerman,
1944). We (1954b) ran some simulated field tests in which we liberated
_Tetrastichus hagenowii_ in rooms artificially seeded with oothecae;
from 28 to 83 percent of American cockroach oothecae and 56 percent of
oriental cockroach oothecae were parasitized during these tests.

_Evania appendigaster_ was introduced from Hawaii into Canton Island in
1940 against _Periplaneta americana_, and it has become established
(Dumbleton, 1957). This parasite was also successfully introduced into
Samoa (Dumbleton, 1957).

_Cockroach-hunting wasps._--An earnest attempt has been made to
establish in Hawaii wasps that prey on cockroaches. Just how effective
these wasps are in controlling cockroaches is still unknown. _Dolichurus
stantoni_ was introduced from the Philippines in 1917 and spread to
several of the Islands (Swezey, 1920, 1921; Williams, 1944). Bridwell
(1920) stated that as a result of this introduction there was a great
decrease in cockroaches of the genus "_Phyllodromia_." A number of
_Podium haematogastrum_ from Brazil were liberated in Honolulu
(Williams, 1925) but did not become established (Williams, 1928). The
effectiveness of _Podium_ was questioned by Williams (1928) who observed
that _Podium_ "destroyed innumerable Blattidae, which nonetheless
swarmed in their neighborhood, and I must confess from my observations
on the various cockroach-hunting wasps that the blattid more than holds
its own alongside its enemy."

Introductions of _Ampulex_ have proved more successful. _Ampulex
canaliculata_ was introduced into Hawaii from the United States
(Williams, 1928a, 1929). Williams also introduced _A. compressa_ into
Hawaii in 1940, and the species was reared in large numbers for
distribution (Pemberton, 1942). _A. compressa_ has since become
established on most of the Islands (Pemberton, 1945a, 1947; Williams,
1946; Van Zwaluwenburg, 1950). The thousand of _A. compressa_ now found
in the Hawaiian Islands are all descendants of three wasps captured in
Noumea, New Caledonia (Williams, 1944). According to Williams (1941),
the number of cockroaches was noticeably reduced at the University of
Hawaii poultry farm, where some _A. compressa_ were released. Pemberton
(1953) believed that this wasp has become sufficiently abundant to be of
definite value. Simmonds (1941) recommended importing _A. compressa_
into Fiji for cockroach control. _A. compressa_ was introduced from
Hawaii into Guam in 1954 against _Periplaneta americana_ and into the
Cook Islands in 1955 against _Periplaneta_ spp.; it is not yet known
whether the parasite became established in either place (Dumbleton,
1957).

                                                          GIRARD (1877)


_Toads._--_Bufo marinus_ was first introduced into Puerto Rico from
Barbados in 1920 to reduce several major insect pests including
cockroaches (Leonard, 1933). It was introduced from Puerto Rico into
Hawaii by C. E. Pemberton in 1932 where it rapidly became established;
it has since been distributed throughout the Pacific area. _B. marinus_
is one of the world's largest toads; it attains a body length (exclusive
of the hind legs) of 7 to 9 inches (Oliver, 1949) and has been kept
alive for more than 11 years in captivity (Pemberton, 1945). Alicata
(1938) placed giant toads in a fenced area in Hawaii containing an
infestation of _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_; after 24 hours the toads were
dissected and each was found to have eaten from 11 to 25 cockroaches.
Illingworth (1941) found that 40 to 90 percent of 53 stools of this toad
in Hawaii contained remains of _P. surinamensis_. Alicata (1947)
recommended the maintenance of _B. marinus_ in poultry yards to reduce
the population of _P. surinamensis_, the vector of the chicken eye worm.

Toads have also been recommended for controlling cockroaches in houses
(Meech, 1889; Sweetman, 1936). Girard (1877) cited a note in a French
newspaper which stated that toads were kept in houses in Cuba to control
the American cockroach.

_Tree frogs._--Tree frogs enclosed in a room overnight were said to
effectively clear it of cockroaches (Marlatt, 1915); on sugar
plantations in Australia, these amphibians were encouraged in houses and
kept as pets because they hunted and devoured large brown cockroaches
(Froggatt, 1906).

_Birds._--In Guadeloupe, Dutertre (1654) claimed that all the fowls of
the country were fond of small cockroaches and lived on practically
nothing else. In Hawaii (Zimmerman, 1948) and in the Lesser Antilles
(Ballou, 1912) cockroaches are eaten by poultry whenever the birds can
find them. In Puerto Rico, Wetmore (1916) stated that owls kept in
houses feed extensively on cockroaches; the stomach of one owl which had
been kept in a native house was filled entirely with cockroaches. In
British Guiana, Beebe (1925) found that cockroaches were eaten by 27
species of birds.

_Reptiles._--H. (1800) claimed that two lizards cleared his house of the
"true brown cockroach" and suggested that lizards be used for cockroach
control because the reptiles are docile and harmless. On Arno Atoll
geckos and night-feeding skinks eat large numbers of cockroaches
(Usinger and La Rivers, 1953). According to Wolcott (1924) the number of
cockroaches eaten by lizards is surprisingly large considering the
nocturnal habits of these insects. Beebe (1925a) kept geckos in a
bungalow to help control _Periplaneta_ and _Pycnoscelus_.

_Mammalia._--Cowan (1865) stated that in England hedgehogs were often
kept domesticated in kitchens to destroy cockroaches. This writer also
stated that a lemur was kept on board ship to destroy cockroaches.

Large numbers of the American and Australian cockroaches were eaten by
the mongoose in Hawaii (Perkins, 1913).

INDEX


Plate and page numbers in boldface type indicate illustrations. In
general, entries are placed in the index as unmodified substantives
except where a modifier contributes significantly to the identification
of the item (e.g., blue heads, prairie dog). This index should be used
in conjunction with the indexed check list of natural associations
(pages 290 to 310) because these are not repeated here. All experimental
associations are indexed below except those involving _Blatta
orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, and _Periplaneta americana_ that are
cited on pages that also contain references to the natural associations
of these three species.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] Part of the cost of publication of this monograph was borne
by the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy (through the
American Institute of Biological Sciences), and by the Quartermaster
Research and Engineering Center, Department of the Army.

[2] Present address of both authors, Central Research
Laboratories, United Fruit Co., Upland Road, Norwood, Mass.

[3] Names of organisms preceded by an asterisk (*) are known or
suspected pathogens of vertebrates. These records were presented with
annotations in our 1957a paper on the medical and veterinary importance
of cockroaches. For that reason the annotations have not been repeated
herein, although the records have been included to make the listing of
the biotic associates of cockroaches substantially complete.

[4] The following helminths also have been stated in the
literature to pass their intermediate stages in cockroaches:
_Hymenolepis diminuta_ (Rudolphi, 1819) [Blanchard (1891)];
_Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_ (Davaine in Grenet, 1870) [Baer
(1956)]; _Spirocerca sanguinolenta_ (Rudolphi, 1819) [Seurat (1913)].
These doubtful records are discussed in Roth and Willis (1957a).

[5] Barber (1939) has shown that the correct spelling of the
name of the type genus is _Ripidius_ and not _Rhipidius_, as it is
frequently written, and that, consequently, the family should be
Ripiphoridae and not Rhipiphoridae.

[6] Page 11 of Marlatt (1902) has been cited erroneously so
many times in support of host records for _T. hagenowii_ and _Evania
appendigaster_ that we are quoting the pertinent section below. In the
section preceding the quoted material Marlatt discusses the American,
Australian, oriental, and German cockroaches. There is nothing in the
paper to connect any of these cockroaches specifically with the
parasites mentioned below:

                      NATURAL ENEMIES AND PARASITES

  "In Europe the egg capsules of the cockroach are often parasitized
  by an ichneumon fly (_Evania appendigaster_). This insect has become
  widely distributed over the world following its host insect, and has
  been redescribed under a great many different names. It was found in
  Cuba as early as 1829, and has been several times collected in the
  United States. Unfortunately, its usefulness as a means of keeping the
  roach in check by destroying the egg capsules is greatly impaired by
  the occurrence of another ichneumon fly (_Entedon hagenowi_), which
  is parasitic upon the first. This is also a European species which
  has been brought over with its host parasite. If the true egg capsule
  parasite of the roach could have been introduced into this country
  without this secondary parasite, its usefulness would doubtless have
  been very much greater. The secondary parasite, however, seems to have
  been introduced early, and has been found in Cuba and Florida, and
  probably occurs as widely as its host and prevents the latter from
  multiplying very greatly."

[7] Brues et al. (1954) include this family in the Encyrtidae.

[8] archy (Marquis, 1931) was living in a dream world when he
typed:

    "there is always
    something to be thankful
    for you would not
    think that a cockroach
    had much ground
    for optimism
    but as the fishing season
    opens up i grow
    more and more
    cheerful at the thought
    that nobody ever got
    the notion of using
    cockroaches for bait"

[9] Classification of Amphibia and Reptilia follows Hegner (1936).

[10] Classification of Amphibia and Reptilia follows Hegner (1936).

[11] Classification of Mammalia follows Simpson (1945).

[12] The West Indian "_Blabera fusca_ Brunner" of Saupe (1928)
is obviously _Blaberus craniifer_ as can readily be seen from a
comparison of Saupe's figures of the pronotal shields of his species
with the descriptions by Hebard (1917) of _B. craniifer_ and _Blaberus
atropos_ (Stoll). The Chilean _B. fusca_ Brunner is a junior synonym of
_B. atropos_ (Stoll), a South American insect (Hebard, 1917).

[13] The species was recorded by these authors as _Blaberus
atropos_. (Hebard, 1917 p. 204, footnote 327.)




Transcriber's Notes:

- symbol for: female indiv. replaced by [F]
- symbol for: male indiv. replaced by [M]
- symbol for: 'dagger' replaced by [cross]
- Different languages (English, French, German, Danish, Latin, etc.)
  have different spellings for example in titles of books, etc. These
  remain as in the original.
- Several blank lines inserted to enhance readability of text(!)
- Several page numbers in 'table of contents' corrected, according to
  real page numbers.
- caret used for superscripted characters; eg.: abc^{...}
- underscore used for subscripted characters; eg.: abc_{...}
- [alpha], [beta], [gamma] represent the actual Greek characters

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
