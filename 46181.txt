INTRODUCTION.


No apology can be necessary for the publication of the following
pages, as it is no unworthy or mercenary object they seek to obtain.
They have been elicited by request of numerous friends of the officers
of this regiment and of the colored troops, designed for their own
use; and their object is not simply to give succinct statements of
individual military history, or of any single command of the Colored
Troop, but to furnish, also, at the same time, an unanswerable
argument on the subject of this Troop, as an element in the military
service on the side of Freedom and the Union; their extraordinary good
discipline, efficiency and bravery, and the fact that they are very
susceptible of intellectual and moral culture. We present it in
compliance with the request that has been made, subservient to this
purpose.

COMMISSIONED OFFICERS

FORTY-THIRD REGIMENT

UNITED STATES COLORED TROOPS,

INCLUDING A BRIEF HISTORY OF THEIR MILITARY CAREER.


BREVET BRIG. GEN. S. B. YEOMAN.

This officer, formerly Colonel Commanding this Regiment, is a native
of Washington, Ohio. His great-grand-father, James Yeoman, served
with distinction as a Captain in the war of the Revolution, and his
grand-father as a First Lieutenant in the war of 1812.

Before entering the United States service the General was a sea-man,
whose experience of nautical life extends over a decade of years. He
started as a sailor before the mast at fifteen years of age. His first
voyage was on a whaling expedition of three years in the ship
"Alexander," which was wrecked on the South Island of New Zealand. The
boats, to which all fled for safety, became unmanageable; and not
until after suffering great hardships on the deep, he with a few
others were accidentally rescued. After this he made several voyages
to South America, Asia and Africa; and returned shortly before the
outbreak of the Rebellion. He at once determined to remain and
identify himself with the cause of the Union and its Free
Institutions.

He volunteered as a PRIVATE in Co. F. 22nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry
April 20th 1861, and was afterwards appointed First Sergeant of his
Company. With this command he continued in Western Virginia, under
General Rosencrans until it was discharged by reason of expiration
of term of service. At home he immediately commenced the work of
Recruiting; and returned again to the field September 15th 1861 as
CAPTAIN of Co. A. 54th Ohio Volunteer Infantry.

At Corinth, General Yeoman, then a Captain, was particularly selected
by Maj. General Sherman, to take command of ten picked men, and with
these to penetrate the Rebel lines in order to ascertain their forces,
and more especially the movements they were inaugurating. The task was
a perilous one; but he accomplished it with entire success, returning
with very valuable information, for which he obtained the hearty
thanks of the General in command and of the Department.

While gallantly in the discharge of duty he has received the following
wounds, viz.: In the battle of Shiloh, April 6th and 7th 1862,
slightly wounded in the breast and left leg; in the battle of Russell's
House, June 1862, wounded again in left leg; wounded in arm and
abdomen on different occasions on the picket line; in the battle of
Arkansas Post, January 10th and 11th, 1863, while in command of his
Regiment, severely wounded by a shell in right arm, almost entirely
severing the arm below the elbow. Amputation became necessary
immediately on the field; and after this he was conveyed to a Hospital
Boat on the Mississippi River, and finally reached home. For his
distinguished services he was appointed Major of his Regiment, but
such was the condition of his wound that any attempt to return to the
field was considered unadvisable, and he, therefore, respectfully
declined the promotion. He resigned on account of his serious loss.
This officer won an estimable name in his services with the Western
Army.

He was appointed Captain in the Veteran Reserve Corps, Commanding 6th
Co. 2nd Battalion, on duty in Cincinnati. In May 1864, he received
from the President of the United States the appointment of COLONEL of
this Regiment. Instead of reporting immediately to the command, he was
detailed by order of the War Department to Camp Casey, Virginia, as
_Superintendent of Recruiting Service_ and _Chief Mustering officer of
North East District of Virginia_. He continued in this office until
November 29th, 1864, when he rejoined this Regiment in the field, then
on the Bermuda Front, Virginia. He led this command in all the actions
after that date, including the triumphant capture of Richmond, April
3d, 1865. He has also been _Commanding Officer of 3d Brigade 1st
Division 25th Corps_.

He was promoted by the President of the United States to BREVET
BRIGADIER GENERAL OF VOLUNTEERS, "for gallant and meritorious
services during the war," to rank as such from the 15th day of March,
1865.

The following are engagements in which he has actively participated,
viz.: Shiloh, April 6th and 7th, 1862; Russell's House, June, 1862;
Easel's House, June, 1862; heavy skirmish at Corinth, July, 1862;
heavy skirmish at Holly Springs, July, 1862; Chickasaw Bayou, (lasting
six days,) December, 1862; Arkansas Post, January 10th and 11th, 1863;
siege of Vicksburg, July, 1863; capture of Richmond, April 3d, 1865
and in, at least, fifteen other different skirmishes not mentioned in
the above.

BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL YEOMAN is an officer of ability and
experience in the active service, who has greatly distinguished
himself in action. He now carries the empty sleeve of his right arm as
the unmistakable mark of his devotion and valor.


BREVET COL. H. SEYMOUR HALL.

BREVET COLONEL H. SEYMOUR HALL, formerly Lieutenant Colonel
of this Regiment, and a native of Providence, Saratoga county New
York, is the only son of a very patriotic widow. His grand-father,
Moses Hall, was a soldier of the Revolution of 1776, and served his
country during the entire period of that eventful struggle. The
Colonel was pursuing a Scientific course in Genesee College, New York,
when the intelligence of the Rebel guns against Sumpter was
communicated to the North. With others of his collegiate companions he
immediately tendered his services to the Country, and was enlisted
April 24th, 1861, as a volunteer PRIVATE in Co. G. 27th
Regiment New York Volunteers, which Regiment was first commanded by
Colonel, now Major General Slocum, whose successor in the command was
Lieutenant Colonel, now Major General J. J. Bartlett. Upon the
organization of the Company he was chosen ENSIGN. He
afterwards was appointed SECOND LIEUTENANT, and then promoted
to CAPTAIN.

In the battle of Gaines' Hill, June 27th, 1862, he received a wound in
his left thigh by a musket ball. On account of his distinguished
services in that engagement he is specially spoken of by the
commanding officer of his Brigade, who in submitting names of officers
whose good conduct and gallantry, particularly in that action,
deserved mention, states: "H. Seymour Hall, Captain of Co. G. 27th New
York Volunteers, for coolness and intrepidity in the battle of Gaines'
Hill; and for displaying the traits of a good officer at all times."

January 15th, 1863, he became _Acting Assistant Inspector General_
on the staff of Brigadier General Bartlett, commanding 2nd Brigade
1st Division 6th Corps; and for his services in the battles of
Chancellorsville and Salem Heights, May 3d and 4th ensuing, he is
honorably mentioned in the report by that General commanding, who
states: "during the campaigns I received the most efficient aid from
Captain H. Seymour Hall, Acting Assistant Inspector General. He was
brave, energetic and untiring in his endeavors to promote the
efficiency of my command."

Upon the expiration of term of service of his Regiment he was formerly
mustered-out, but immediately re-commissioned Captain in the 121st New
York Volunteers, and continued on the staff as before. When Colonel
Upton became General Bartlett's successor in command of the Brigade,
he was placed on his staff. He is highly complimented in the report by
this latter officer of his command in the battle of Rappahannock
Station, November 7th, 1863. "From my own staff I received, in every
instance, prompt and gallant assistance, and to their united efforts
may be attributed, in a great measure, the promptness with which both
regiments re-formed inside the works. Captain H. Seymour Hall,
Assistant Inspector General, entered the rifle pits with the men."
After this engagement he was promoted to ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT
GENERAL on the staff of this Brigade commander, which position he
held in connection with the other until his commission in this
Regiment.

It may not be improper to introduce here a few extracts of
communications setting forth the high appreciation of Colonel Hall for
his ability and bravery, by very competent Judges. Brigadier General
Jackson, Commander of 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 12th Corps, in his
letter addressed to Adjutant General of the State of New York,
requesting the appointment of Captain Hall to Colonel of the 145th New
York Volunteers, which Regiment was in his Brigade, and without a
Colonel, states: "I have known Captain Hall for the past fifteen
months, and consider him every way qualified to fill the above
mentioned position." Major General Slocum's endorsement on this paper
testifies: "I know Captain Hall to be a capable, efficient and
faithful officer, and most cordially unite with General Jackson in
this recommendation." Major General Slocum himself, also, in a letter
relating to the same subject, and addressed to the same Officer of
State, closes with the remarks: "I am well acquainted with him
(Captain Hall,) and know him to be a capable and efficient officer,
and think his appointment would be a great benefit to the service.
Captain Hall has no knowledge of my intention to recommend him for
this position, and in doing it I am only actuated by a desire to
improve the condition of the troops under my command." For some reason
or other, left unsatisfactory unexplained, the State Executive made no
appointment whatever. In consequence of this the Regiment alluded to
was obliged to forego its organization, and be consolidated with
others.

Captain Hall was appointed by the President LIEUTENANT
COLONEL of this Regiment, March 20th, 1864. After reporting at
Camp William Penn, Philadelphia, he completed the organization of its
1st Battalion composed of the first six Companies, with which he
joined the 9th Corps at Annapolis, Maryland, April 19th, 1864. He
commanded it through all the engagements in the Wilderness; and in the
memorable battle of the Mine before Petersburg, Virginia, July 30th,
1864, it was the charging Regiment which he led against the enemy's
works. With regard to his own gallantry in that terrible engagement,
the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division, 9th Corps,
testifies: "Lieutenant Colonel H. Seymour Hall, Commanding 43d
Regiment United States Colored Troops, lost his right arm while
bravely leading his Regiment." Such was his anxiety that he reported
again for duty to his Regiment when his wound was but partially
healed. He was afterwards ordered to Camp Casey, Virginia, as
Commander of that _Recruiting Rendezvous_ and _Chief Mustering
Officer_ of the District of Columbia. He remained in this capacity
until March 20th, 1865, the date under order of discontinuing the
Rendezvous, when he returned to his Regiment, then on the front before
Richmond, Virginia. Immediately after the capture of Richmond, April
3d, 1865, he was detailed PROVOST MARSHAL of Manchester, Virginia. He
conducted this office with his usual great ability, and also with
perfect satisfaction to the Government.

He was appointed by the President of the United States COLONEL OF
VOLUNTEERS by Brevet "for gallant and meritorious services in the
service of the United States, to rank as such from the 13th day of
March 1865." This honor from the late lamented Chief Magistrate was
most fittingly awarded.

Colonel Hall was a member of General Court Martial in Camp on the
Chickahominy, Virginia, of which Brigadier General Pratt was
President, in May and June, 1862; Judge Advocate of General Court
Martial in Camp near Bakersville, Maryland, of which Brigadier General
Newton was President, in September, 1862; a member of Military
Commission also in Camp near Bakersville, Maryland, of which now
Brevet Major General Bartlett was President, in October, 1862; a
member of a Board of Officers to examine officers as to qualification
and fitness for their positions in the 1st Division, 6th Corps, of
which now Brevet Major General Torbert was President, in October,
November and December 1862; a member of General Court Martial in Camp
near White Oak Church, Virginia, of which Colonel Cake, 96th Regiment
Pennsylvania Volunteers was President, in January, 1863; a member of
General Court Martial at Headquarters of 2nd Brigade, 4th Division,
9th Corps, near Petersburg, Virginia, of which Brevet Brigadier
General Bates was President, in June and July, 1864, and President of
Military Commission for the Western District of Texas, convened at
Brownsville, Texas, which occupied the place of Civil Court, in August
and September, 1865. Upon the discharge of his Regiment he continues
in service, having reported under orders to Major General Wright,
Headquarters Department of Texas, who assigned him to duty as
Assistant Superintendent in the Freedmen's Bureau, under Brigadier
General E. M. Gregory, Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau in that
State.

The following are actions in which he has participated, a number of
which were the most important of any during the war, viz.: First Bull
Run, July 21st, 1861; West Point, May 7th, 1862; heavy skirmish at
Mechanicsville, May 21st, 1862; Gaines' Hill, June 27th, 1862;
Golden's Farm, June 28th, 1862; Charles City Cross Roads, June 30th,
1862; Second Bull Run, August 30th, 1862; Fredericksburg, December
13th, 14th and 15th, 1862; Chancellorsville, May 3d, 1863; Salem
Heights, May 3d and 4th, 1863; Gettysburg, July 1st, 2d and 3d, 1863;
heavy skirmish at Fairfield, Pennsylvania, July 7th, 1863; heavy
skirmish at Funkstown, Maryland, July 10th, 1863; heavy skirmish at
St. James' College, Maryland, July 13th, 1863; Rappahannock Station,
November 7th, 1863; Locust Grove, November 24th, 1863; Mine Run,
November 27th, 1863; Wilderness, May 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th, 1864;
Spottsylvania, May 7th to 15th, 1864; Tolopotomy Creek, May 19th and
20th, 1864; North Anna, May 22d and 23d, 1864; Cold Harbor, June 1st
to 3d, 1864; Old Church, June 10th, 1864; Siege of Petersburg, June
18th, 1864; Mine before Petersburg, July 30th, 1864; and capture of
Richmond, April 3d, 1865.

Brevet Colonel Hall has risen from a private to his present rank and
office by his excellent military talent, energy, intelligence and
gentlemanliness, and by his great gallantry in all the engagements in
which he has participated. These have been the hand-maids of his
success. He is a patriot who has accomplished a good work for his
country, and who also carries the empty sleeve--the same unmistakable
mark of superior devotion and valor.


MAJOR HORACE BUMSTEAD.

MAJOR HORACE BUMSTEAD of this Regiment is a native of Boston,
Massachusetts, and a regular graduate of Yale College, having
completed his course in that institution in 1863. He was a member of
the _Massachusetts Rifle Club_, which has contributed quite a
number of Field and Officers of other grades to our army during this
war, who are known as worthy commanders, distinguished for their
ability and bravery. In connection with this military organization he
held the position of Sergeant, and was afterwards promoted to Major.
Promotion could be secured only upon very creditable examination. N.
Willis Bumstead, Captain of the 45th Massachusetts Volunteers, a
brother of the Major's, is another representative of this patriotic
family.

Horace Bumstead was appointed by the President MAJOR of this
Regiment, April 8th, 1864. After reporting under order at Camp William
Penn, Philadelphia, he there completed the organization of the
remaining Companies, "H," "I" and "K," of the Regiment. He proceeded
with these in a Provisional Battalion to Havre-de-grace, Maryland, and
thence to the Defences of Baltimore and Washington, to assist in
checking the advance of the enemy, then threatening those cities.
Afterwards in command of these Companies, with detachments also
belonging to other Regiments, he proceeded to the front, joining his
own command August 3d, 1864, then on the line before Petersburg, Va.
In the absence of Colonel Yeoman, (now Brevet Brigadier General) doing
duty at Camp Casey, Va., and Brevet Colonel Hall, severely wounded in
the battle of July 30th, the command devolved upon him. He was
commanding officer of the Regiment in all the actions in which it
participated and other duties until Nov. 29th, ensuing--the date of
Colonel Yeoman's reporting. He has in fact been commanding officer
embracing a considerable period of its service, and was such at the
time of its muster-out at Brownsville, Texas, during its perilous Gulf
and Ocean voyage thence to New York, and up to its final discharge at
Phila.

Major Bumstead has participated in the following actions, viz.: Weldon
Railroad, Aug. 19th and 20th, 1864; Poplar Grove Church, Sept. 29th
and 30th, 1864; Hatchie's Run, Oct. 27th and 28th, 1864; heavy
skirmish on the Bermuda Front, in Dec. 1864; Farra's Island at Dutch
Gap Canal, January 25th, 1865; and capture of Richmond, April 3d,
1865.

He is an officer of fine ability, intelligence and bravery, and whose
very exemplary moral character made his connection with the service an
honor to the country.


SURGEON AI. WATERHOUSE.

SURGEON AI. WATERHOUSE of this command is a native of
Scarborough, Me., whose great-uncles, George, Nathaniel and Joseph
Waterhouse were soldiers of the war of the Revolution, and another
ancestor a soldier of the war of 1812. At the commencement of this
struggle he decided to abandon the practice of his profession at
Buxton, Me., and give his services to the country. The Medical Board
convened at Portland, by which he was examined, unanimously
recommended him for the position of SURGEON. July 24th, 1862,
when he joined the army at Harrison's Landing, Va., he was assigned to
the 7th Maine Infantry, 2d Div., 6th Corps. There was no vacancy for
full Surgeon at that time in the command, although his services were
much needed. On this account, and by the urgent request also of the
Governor of his State, he consented to accept temporarily the position
of Assistant Surgeon. However in the event of a vacancy he was to
obtain the position according to the examination he had passed. Owing
to circumstances, to say the least, very discreditable to the parties
in the case, and who possessed such plasticity of principle and low
estimate of honor, this vacancy was bestowed on another, whose
subsequent history proved him incapable of discharging its duties.
Surgeon Waterhouse suffered this wrong, uncomplainingly, and continued
at his post. His services in connection with his Regt., and also the
6th Me. Infantry, to which he had been temporarily assigned, are
spoken of with great satisfaction.

After an examination before the Surgeon's Examining Board of the Army
of the Potomac, he received the appointment of SURGEON of the
43d Regt. U.S. Colored Troops, March 8th 1864. He continued for a time
as Surgeon in charge of Camp William Penn, Phila., and then joined
this Regiment in the field, Aug. 3d, 1864. In connection with this
command, on _Operating Staff_, in charge of Field Hospitals and
Acting Senior Medical Officer of Brigades and Departments, he has been
frequently complimented for his proficiency and skill in difficult
cases of surgery, and for his sobriety and correct principles. Chief
Medical Officer Hall, of the 6th Corps, says: "I esteem Surgeon
Waterhouse well qualified, in regard to moral character, learning and
ability, to discharge the responsible duties of the position with
honor to himself and the service." Brigadier General Bates, commanding
1st Brig., 4th Div., 9th Corps, testifies of him: "For strict and
unswerving fidelity to duty, for sobriety and high toned morals, for
firm loyalty he has ever won the respect of those who knew him." Major
General Ferrero, commander of the Department of Bermuda Hundred, Va.,
compliments him after this manner: "In parting with this officer the
General Commanding desires to express his regret at parting with an
officer so long associated with him, and his appreciation of the
services he has rendered." Chief Medical Officer Surgeon Prince, says:
"I take pleasure in recommending Surgeon Ai. Waterhouse as a good
Physician and Surgeon. The Doctor served as Brigade Surgeon in my Div.
during the greater part of 1864, and, as such, displayed professional
and executive ability of a very high order; he was always noted for
his promptness and energy in the discharge of his duty."

The following are actions in which he has participated in the duty of
his Department, viz.: Second Bull Run, Aug. 30th, 1862; South
Mountain, Sept. 14th, 1862; Antietam, Sept. 17th, 1862;
Fredericksburg, Dec. 13th and 14th, 1862; Salem Heights, May 3d and
4th, 1863; Gettysburg, July 1st, 2d and 3d, 1863; heavy skirmish at
Fairfield, Pa., July 7th, 1863; heavy skirmish at Monterey House and
Waynesboro', July 5th, 1863; Locust Grove, Nov. 24th, 1863; Mine Run,
Nov. 27th, 1863; Weldon Railroad, Aug. 19th and 20th, 1864; Poplar
Grove Church, Sept. 29th and 30th, 1864; Hatchie's Run, Oct. 27th and
28th, 1864; heavy skirmish on the Bermuda Front, Dec. 1864; capture of
Richmond, April 3d, 1865.


CHAPLAIN J. M. MICKLEY.[1]

CHAPLAIN J. M. MICKLEY is a native of Adams county, Pa., near
the historic town of Gettysburg, and whose family connection have
always been justly celebrated for loyalty and patriotism. His
ancestors took a prominent part in the war of the Revolution, and also
in the war of 1812. Both his brother and himself, who are the only
sons of a patriotic widow, remained in the active field service until
the close of the Rebellion. He is a regular graduate of Franklin and
Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa., and of the Theological Seminary at
Mercersburg, Pa., and a regularly ordained Minister of the Gospel in
the Reformed Church of the United States.

          [1] Communicated by Colonel Hall commanding 43d United
          States Colored Troops.

He entered the service Dec. 2d, 1862, as Chaplain of the 177th Regt.
Pa. Infantry, and remained with this command until its muster-out.
After this he was appointed Chaplain of this Regt. In his connection
with this command he has shown himself fitted for that most delicate
and difficult position, an Army Chaplain. Month after month he has
labored most assiduously, by means of religious exercises, well
conducted schools, providing of excellent books and papers for the use
of the soldier, to contribute to the improvement of their mental,
moral and social condition; and the high esteem he has won for
himself, by his talent, piety, energy and bravery, from every officer
and man of this Regiment and also from Superior Officers and
Commandants, is ample proof of his peculiar fitness for the position.
To him two-thirds of the men of this command are indebted for their
proficiency in reading and writing. Through his disinterested labors,
also, thousands of dollars were saved by the men, and many families
kept from want. His care and attention in forwarding these funds were
so satisfactory in meeting the case. Thousands beside the above were
by him securely deposited for others. During the whole period of his
Chaplaincy he rendered invaluable service in the Camp by his untiring
and well directed efforts to do good; and on the field, often where
the battle raged fiercest, he was among the foremost to minister to
the wounded and dying physical relief and the consolations of
religion, and by his own acts of heroism to inspire others with
confidence and to deeds of valor.

He has actively participated in the following actions, viz.:
Blackwater; South Mills; Union Bridge; Deep Creek; heavy skirmish in
the Dismal Swamp; heavy skirmish on the Hickory Ground Road, Dismal
Swamp; Deserted House; siege of Suffolk; Carrsville; Hatchie's Run;
heavy skirmish on Bermuda Front; Farra's Island, near Dutch Gap Canal;
and capture of Richmond.

JUNE 20TH, 1865.


ASSISTANT SURGEON A. B. LOWE.

ASSISTANT SURGEON A. B. LOWE, a native of Sussex county, New
Jersey, is a regular graduate of the Belview College of Medicine, New
York City. Upon recommendation of Surgeon's Examining Board of New
York, before which he passed examination, he received the appointment
of ASSISTANT SURGEON of this Regt., March 8th, 1864. He
accompanied the First Battalion to the field, and was the Medical
officer in charge of it during the battles of the Wilderness Campaign,
and until after the action before Petersburg, July 30th, 1864. On
detached service, he was in Amputating Hospital of 3d Div., 9th Corps;
Assistant Surgeon in charge of Baptist Church Hospital of Manchester,
Va., after the occupation of Richmond and Manchester by our forces;
and also Medical Officer in the Post Hospital of Brownsville, Texas.
He was again Medical Officer in charge of this Regiment on its
perilous ocean voyage to New York, and until its final discharge. In
all the duties of his department in connection with this command, and
the other positions to which he had been ordered, he manifested
intelligence, ability and skill. As an officer and gentleman he is
deserving of great esteem.

He has been, in the duties of his profession, in the following
engagements, viz.: Wilderness, May 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th, 1864;
Spottsylvania, May 7th to 15th, 1864; Tolopotomy Creek, May 19th and

of the war.

At the time of the terrible battle of the Mine before Petersburg, July
30th, 1864, this officer was entirely unfit for duty by reason of
severe illness, but notwithstanding this indisposition he most
patriotically declined remaining in the Hospital, and gallantly led
his Co. in the Charge on that day. He there received a wound in the

with great honor to himself and the country in the struggle of 1776,
for Independence. The Lieut. first volunteered as a PRIVATE,
March 26th, 1862, in Co. I. 6th Vt. Infantry. At the battle of Savage
Station, June 29th, 1862, he was severely wounded by a ball entering
his back, close to the left side, and passing out at the right side,
and was at the same time taken prisoner. As is very reasonable to
expect, his dangerous wound became aggravated greatly by the cruel
treatment of a Libby Prison life. He was fortunately paroled, July
22nd, before death ensued, and immediately forwarded to West
Philadelphia Hospital. In the battle of the Wilderness, May 4th, 5th,
6th and 7th, 1864, he was severely wounded (second day) in the left
arm, on account of which it became necessary to amputate his arm above
the elbow. He was discharged by reason of this wound Feb., 6th, 1865.
He afterwards received the appointment of SECOND LIEUTENANT
in this Regt. In connection with this command, as well as in his

CAPT. JAMES O'BRIEN.

CAPTAIN JAMES O'BRIEN, assigned to command of Co. C., to
occupy the vacancy made by the promotion of Capt. Bates to Maj. of
45th U.S.C.T., is a native of Glenlough, Ireland, and the son of a
widow. Upon coming to this country he became a citizen of Maulius,
N.Y. In the early stage of the war he volunteered as a
PRIVATE in Co. I, 61st N.Y. Infantry. At the battle of Fair
Oaks, June 1st, 1862, he was severely wounded in the arm, but
continued heroically on the field to the close of the action. At the
battle of Charles City Cross Roads, June 30th, 1862, he received a
severe wound penetrating the left shoulder; and having been left on
the field, helpless and weak by loss of blood, he was taken prisoner.
His wound became alarmingly dangerous, by reason of his cruel
imprisonment in Libby Prison. He was paroled, June 31st, and removed
to Satterlee Hospital, Phila. Little hope was entertained about his
recovery. While yet in the Hospital, and after he had slightly
improved, he resumed his studies with a view to a collegiate course he
had before contemplated. The way also appeared open for the fulfillment
of his purpose in this particular, as the necessity of his discharge
was decided upon. He afterwards, however, concluded if possible to
return to the field. Much praise is due this maimed soldier for his
patriotic determination. Before leaving the Hospital he obtained the
promotion to SECOND LIEUTENANT of his Co. This honor, won by
so many acts of distinguished bravery, he was unable to accept at that
time, on account of his severe disability.

He was appointed FIRST LIEUTENANT of this Regt., March 8th,
1864, and assigned to Co. A. He received the appointment of
ADJUTANT of this command, April 1st, 1864, and in this
position he accompanied it to the front in the army of the Potomac. In
the terrible battle of the Mine before Petersburg, July 30th, 1864,
and the charge by this Regt., he received another severe wound in the
left shoulder. For his great gallantry in this action he is
particularly mentioned by both his Regimental and Brigade Commanders,
and for which, also, he was promoted to CAPTAIN by the
President of the United States. He was afterwards detailed as Post
Adjutant and Recruiting Officer for the North Eastern District of Va.,
at Camp Casey. He remained there until by order the Recruiting
Rendezvous was discontinued, when he reported to the Regt., then on
the Front Line before Richmond, and was assigned to the command of Co.
C.

He has served as A.A.A.G. at Headquarters of the 3d Brig. 1st Div.
25th Corps, and also at same Headquarters, as Acting Asst. Inspector
General, up to date of order returning this Regt. for final muster-out
and discharge. This officer remained in the active field service to
the close of the war, although continuing to suffer very much by
reason of his wounds, which were but partially healed and very
painful. He has proved himself as brave as he is efficient.

The following are engagements in which he has participated, viz.:
heavy skirmish at Rappahannock Bridge, March, 1862; Siege of Yorktown,
May, 1862; Williamsburg, May 5th, 1864; Fair Oaks, June 1st, 1862;

CAPT. JOSEPH FORBES.

CAPT. JOSEPH FORBES, commanding Co. E, is a native of the
City of New York. His grand-father actively participated in the war of
1812, and his brother Thomas H. Forbes was a soldier in the 1st N.Y.
Vols. in this war. The Captain was, during a period of four years
previous to the rebellion, a member of the Engineer Corps of the 71st
N.Y. National Guards. This entire Regiment very promptly volunteered
its services to the Government, the day after the fire upon Fort
Sumter, and was immediately accepted. It was the sixth to arrive in
Washington for the defence of the Capitol. This loyal troop on its
march to that point, passed through disaffected Maryland, uncheered
and unprovided. Disloyalists charged them Twelve Hundred Dollars for
Two Carts, with which to transport necessary baggage, and these even
then failed to answer the purpose. This command with which the Captain
was connected, patriotically volunteered to remain in service for the
battle of Bull Run, although its term had expired. It opened the fight
of that day, and made the brilliant and successful charge upon an
entire Brigade of the enemy, composed of Alabama Regiments. In the
latter campaign, in which this Regiment volunteered its services
again, Capt. Forbes returned as Captain commanding Co. B. He received
the appointment of CAPTAIN in this Regiment (43d U.S.C.T.)
March 30th, 1864. He was wounded in the hand at the battle of
Hatchie's Run, Oct. 27th and 28th, 1864. This officer, who has seen
much service and greatly distinguished himself in connection with the
early organization of the 71st N.Y., and also with this Regiment,
deserves special compliments for his ability and bravery, and the
excellent military standard, to which he brought his command. His
Company was one among the first in neatness, discipline and
efficiency. A circular dated Headquarters 3d Brig. 1st Div. 25th
Corps, Feb. 5th, 1865, issued by order of the Brigade Commander, Brig.
Gen. H. G. Thomas, who reports the result of an Inspection of Quarters
of the different Regiments of his Brigade, states: "Capt. Forbes and
his Company deserve particular notice. Their quarters are far superior
in construction, neatness and ornament, to those of any of the
Companies in this Brigade." As a token of the high appreciation of
this officer, by his Company, they were pleased to present him with
the 25th Corps Badge and pin, pure gold and finely executed, with name
and rank of their commander engraved on the Badge and on the Pin, a
list of the engagements in which he led them, the whole beautifully
prefaced by the following inscription: "Presented to Capt. Forbes Co.
E, 43d U.S.C.T., by his Company for his bravery and impartiality in
command." This officer, also, stands recommended for Captaincy in the
Regular Service, having been so recommended by the Examining Board for

CAPT. H. V. MARTIN.

CAPT. H. V. MARTIN, commander of Co. K, is a native of New
York City. Both his grand-fathers were heroes of the Revolution of
1776, and others of his ancestry served in the War of 1812. He
volunteered April 23rd, 1861, immediately after the attack on Sumpter,
in Co. A, 10th N.Y. Vols., which Regiment was one among the first
two-year organizations from N.Y. State to enter the field. Its career
proved it to be a splendid command. It was particularly selected by
Generals Butler and Wool to do garrison duty in Fort Monroe. In its
connection with the Army of the Potomac, it was associated with Syke's
Division of the 5th Corps, and afterwards with the 2nd Corps, and was
chosen Headquarter Guards to Gen. Sumner, when in command of the Right
Grand Division of the Army. On its retiring from service, at the
expiration of term, Gen. French takes the opportunity of reciting its
achievements and distinguished bravery in a published Circular. Capt.
Martin had enlisted as a PRIVATE in this Regiment, was
promoted to SERGEANT in his Company, July, 1861, and
afterwards to ORDERLY SERGEANT. He became acting SERGEANT
MAJOR of the Regiment, July, 1862, and was promoted to SECOND
LIEUTENANT of Co. H, Oct. 25th, 1862. He received also the
promotion to FIRST LIEUTENANT and ADJUTANT of his

his fine ability and distinguished services. At the battle of
Fredericksburg, Dec. 13th and 14th, 1862, he received a wound on the
cheek.

He was appointed CAPTAIN in this Regiment, April 8th, 1864,
and assigned to the command of Co. K. In his connection with this
Regiment he has won the name of a fine officer and most worthy
commander, whose moral character is unimpeachable, and whose Company
has been complimented for its high standard of discipline, efficiency
and bravery.

He has served as Judge Advocate General Court Martial at Headquarters
4th Div. 9th Corps; and Judge Advocate General Court Martial 1st Div.
25th Corps; and also Provost Marshal of the Post of Brownsville, in

FIRST LIEUT. S. P. STACEY.

FIRST LIEUT. S. P. STACEY, of Co. K, is a native of
Springfield, Bradford county, Pa., and the only son of a widow. Both
his grand-fathers were actively engaged in the Revolutionary War, and
his father, Joseph Stacey, served as a soldier in the war of 1812. The
Lieutenant was a member of an Independent Company of Cavalry of
Springfield, previous to the rebellion. He volunteered, April 22nd,
1861, as a PRIVATE, in Co. H, 6th Pa. Reserves, and was
promoted to CORPORAL in his Company. His name is intimately
associated with the history of the brave Pennsylvania Reserves for
deeds of great gallantry. He was appointed SECOND LIEUTENANT
of Co. C, 171st Pa. Infantry, Dec., 1862, and remained with this
command until its final discharge by reason of expiration of term of
service. In response to the earnest call for men to recruit the
thinned ranks of our army, and with a noble exhibition of patriotism,
he entered the field as a volunteer PRIVATE, in Co. I, 148th
Pa. Vols. At the battle of second Bull Run, Aug. 30th, 1862, he was
wounded by a Buck-shot in the left leg, which continues in the limb.
At the battle of Antietam he suffered a severe wound by a ball
entering below the left eye. He was appointed FIRST
LIEUTENANT of this Regiment, April 14th, 1864. In his connection
with this command he has shown himself to be an officer of military
experience, ability and undoubted bravery.

He has participated in the following engagements, viz.: Drainesville,

SECOND LIEUT. R. C. PHILLIPS.

SECOND LIEUT. R. C. Phillips, of Co. K, is a native of
Naples, N.Y., and whose grand-father, Daniel Phillips, won great
distinction as a soldier in the war of 1812. The Lieutenant enlisted,
Aug. 2nd, 1862, as a PRIVATE in Co. C, 44th N.Y. Vols.,
which command was associated with the 5th Corps. At the battle of
Gettysburg, July 1st, 2nd and 3rd, 1863, he was severely wounded in
the left shoulder and breast. He was appointed SECOND
LIEUTENANT of this Regiment June 8th, 1864, but in consequence of
severe illness he was unable to report before Sept. 1st, ensuing. He
has been Pioneer Officer 1st Brig. 4th Div. 9th Corps, and Assistant
Provost Marshal 1st Div. 25th Corps. His intelligence and services
entitle him to confidence and esteem.

of its final discharge. As a gentleman of strictly honest dealings,
sobriety and intelligence, his relation with this command was
throughout satisfactory. He possessed the confidence and esteem of the
officers and men.


SERGT. MAJ. R. B. FORTEN.

SERGT. MAJ. R. B. FORTEN, of Philadelphia, was appointed
SERGEANT MAJOR of this Regiment, April 8th, 1864, from a
private of Co. A. He died June, 1864. This colored soldier, who was
formerly a resident of London, in Europe, possessed a liberal
education, was intelligent and cultivated in no ordinary degree, but
even to a most favorable comparison with our own race. He discharged
the duties of his position with ability and entire satisfaction.
WESLEY JACKSON, (colored) Sergeant of Co. C, was appointed
SERGEANT MAJOR, July 1st, 1865, for distinguished bravery in
action, and in place of George S. Massey reduced to the ranks.

COMMISSARY SERGEANT of the Regiment, in place of John C.
Brock promoted. The officers in command, as well as others of the
Field, Staff and Line, take great pleasure in giving their uniform
testimony in favor of the good degree of intelligence, true bravery
and faithfulness of the afore-mentioned colored non-commissioned
officers.

Steward, U.S. A., was assigned to this Regiment, March 11th, 1864. At
the battle of Hatchie's Run, Oct. 27th and 28th, 1864, he was taken
prisoner by the enemy, and confined in Libby Prison until Feb. 5th,
1865, when he was paroled. Upon discharge of this Regiment he was
assigned to the 62nd U.S.C.T.




THE REGIMENT.


We take pleasure in mentioning the patriotism, energy and great
activity of the Supervisory Committee who had in charge the recruiting
and organizing of colored troops at Philadelphia, during the war.
Their success in the undertaking, resulted not only complimentary to
themselves, but it was also most opportune to the Government, by
adding to our armies an important element to aid in obtaining the
complete victory; and according to another view of the case, by
introducing the stone that had been so long rejected, or preserved
only as a stumbling stone, but which the builders would then take up
in establishing and cementing a stronger and better Union.

The First Battalion of the 43rd Regt. U.S.C.T., composed of
Companies A, B, C, D, E and F, was recruited and organized, March,
1864, at Camp William Penn, Philadelphia, and left Camp, April 18th,
under command of Lieut. Col., now Brevet Col., H. Seymour Hall. It
proceeded by railroad and steamer to Annapolis, Md., and there joined
the 9th Corps, under command of General Burnside. It was associated
with the 1st Brig. of the 4th Div. of this Corps, commanded by General
Ferrero. The Corps took up its march April 23d, to join the Army of
the Potomac. On their way through Washington they were reviewed by
President Lincoln, in the presence of many other public officers, and
a large assembly of citizens. As these were the first colored troops
destined to the Potomac Army, their soldierly appearance and movements
were closely scanned. In passing in Review they saluted gracefully
with their Colors and by loud hurrahs that Great Emancipator of their
race. This, as President Lincoln afterwards expressed himself, was
most gratifying to him, and riveted the confidence he had in the
devotion of the Freedmen, and their efficiency to do a full share in
the struggle. According to the public press, also, the occasion
inspired the hearts of the large assembly who witnessed it, with a
great degree of favor and interest. On that same day they crossed the
Long Bridge into Virginia, and camped near Alexandria. They had now
returned under the Starry Flag to the soil of their oppressors, ready
by great achievements in the field and with their lives, to express
their sincere gratitude to "Massa Lincoln," and seal their devotion to
the Union. Much as the so-called Confederacy and its _emissaries in
the North_ feigned contempt and ridicule in the case of employing
this troop, the true sequel is that they regarded its advent with no
flattering prospects for the success of the Rebellion, but rather, as
it was, a stunning blow. Going from Alexandria by way of Fairfax
C.H., and Centerville, they arrived at Manassas Junction, and were
immediately stationed to do guard duty on the railroad. Afterwards
they were quickly marched by Rappahannock Station and over the Rapidan
to reinforce the right of the army, which had been partially broken on
that day. During the celebrated Wilderness Campaign, and up to Cold
Harbor and Old Church, their position was on the right flank of the
army. In these engagements they manifested great steadiness and
intrepidity under severe fire, and immediately proved themselves a
reliable troop. Their losses in these actions were comparatively
light. Company G, under command of Capt. A. D. Wright, joined the
First Battalion of the Regiment, June 6th, near Old Church, Va. June
12th, they marched by White House Landing and New Kent C.H., crossing
the Chickahominy at Jones' Bridge, to the James River, where they took
up a position protecting the crossing of the army. They passed over
the James on the 17th, and next day marched to the front before
Petersburg. Here they were employed by working parties in the trenches
and on fortifications, under the almost constant fire of the enemy.
The field works and the "Covered Way," leading to the front line were
mostly constructed by the colored troops.

Preparatory to the battle of July 30th, this Battalion of the 43rd
Regiment, with the addition of Co. G, moved up through the "covered
way" to the ravine at the mouth of the Mine, and there awaited the
explosion and the order to charge. Under command of the brave Brevet
Col. Hall, at that time Lieut. Col., they advanced nobly to the
charge, behaving with great coolness and gallantry, taking the works
which the enemy stubbornly tried to retain, and capturing prisoners
and colors. The lack of an ultimate and permanent triumph on that day,
was, by no means or measure, the fault of this troop, but on account
of other failures and neglects, as was afterwards reported by the
Investigating Committee. In this battle it would be difficult to
enumerate particular cases of great bravery, where all seem to vie
with each other in the brilliancy and gallantry of their achievements.
Colored non-commissioned officers fearlessly took command after their
commandants (white commissioned officers) were killed, or borne
severely wounded from the field, and led on the attack to the close.
As each brave color bearer was shot down, another and another would
immediately grasp the National emblem, all riddled with balls, and
plant it further on the enemies line. In this terrific engagement,
this Battalion, of the 43rd, had its Colors almost entirely cut up by
the fire, and the Color Staffs splintered and broken. Its casualties
were, one officer killed, ten severely wounded, including the gallant
Col. Hall, who sustained the loss of his right arm, and two taken
prisoner; and twenty-eight men killed, ninety-four wounded and twelve
missing. It was afterwards discovered that the missing were men
rendered helpless by reason of severe wounds, and whom the Rebels
deliberately put to death on the field, by bayoneting them. The
following is an extract from the official report of the Brigade
commander, relative to that battle. "The 43d Regt. U.S.C.T. charged
over the crest of the Crater, and right upon the enemies works,
carrying them, capturing a number of prisoners, a Rebel battle flag,
and re-capturing a stand of National colors. Lieut. Col. H. Seymour
Hall, commanding 43rd Regt. U.S.C.T., lost his right arm while bravely
leading his Regiment." Here on this, as on many other fields during
this war, for the sacred cause of our Republican Liberties, Free
Institutions and Union, the blood of the Anglo-Saxon and the African
mingled very freely in the full measure of a devoted offering.

Companies H, I, and K, of this Regiment, left Camp William Penn,
Philadelphia, under orders, July 11th, 1864, in a Provisional
Battalion commanded by Lieut. Col. Wagner, 88th Pa. Vols., and
proceeded by railroad to Havre-de-grace, Md. At this point Company I,
was detached, and sent to Gunpowder Bridge. The remainder of the
Battalion passed on, by transport, to Fort McHenry, and marched
through Baltimore, taking a position near Birney Barracks, in the
defences of the city, which was threatened by a bold and extensive
Rebel raid. These Companies again joined at Camp Casey, Va., and under
command of Maj. Horace Bumstead, embarked on the steamer "Highland
Light," for City Point. They arrived before Petersburg, Aug. 3rd, when
Maj. Bumstead took command of the Regiment entire. After the fight of
July 30th, and until the advance on the Weldon Railroad, this Regiment
served industriously with the spade, working in the trenches and on
almost every part of the extensive line before Petersburg; and the
impregnability of the position afterward, was, to a great measure, the
result of their toil. In the engagements of the Weldon Railroad, Aug.
19th and 20th, and Poplar Grove Church, Sept. 29th and 30th, its
losses were comparatively few. In the battle of Hatchie's Run, Oct.
27th and 28th, it held the position of skirmishers on the advance of
the 9th Corps line of battle, and most gallantly assisted in repulsing
the repeated charges of Hill's Corps. In face of a severe fire it
hastily constructed two lines of breast works. Its losses in this
action were, one officer killed and four wounded, and seven men
killed, eighteen wounded and one taken prisoner.

After portions of Longstreet's Corps had made a favorable attack on
the Union position, on the Bermuda Front, and succeeded in capturing a
part of the line, from the one year Regiments of white troops, lately
stationed there to defend it, with a number also of these troops as
prisoners, this Regiment with some others, were detached from the army
of the Potomac on the left of the line, and sent by forced marching,
across the Appomattox, to regain, if possible, the lost position. It
moved on to the line Sunday, P.M., and was instantly welcomed by
Longstreet's bravadoes, exulting yet in their recent victory, with a
storm of balls and shells, and the significant appellation of "Smoked
Yankees." But when these brave "Smoked Yankees" replied, as they did
at once, by a most brilliant charge, that made them masters of the
situation, driving Longstreet's bravadoes to their old kennels and
recovering the lost ground, the Rebel hilarity ceased. Their
stratagems afterward, massing of troops and charges, accompanied with
terrific firing, and which was persevered in almost daily and nightly
for a month; resulted only in their bitter loss, and was a conclusive
proof to them that their so-called "Smoked Yankees" were of a species
whom they could neither drive nor dismay. They continued to hold the
line against all odds, and ministered to Longstreet's hordes the most
severe castigation for their insolence it was ever their good fortune
to obtain. In an almost incredible short time the "Smoked Yankee"
became a very desirable companion, whose friendly acquaintance the
Rebel Picket would seek to cultivate, at the same time entreating him
that a mutual agreement for the better security of life and limb might
be established. The "Smoked Yankee" soldier invariably answered him:
"I obeys de orders ob de obicers. When de orders be to fire, I fires
on you, and when de orders be to charge, I charges on you, you must
den get out, Johnnie Reb."

The Regiment was now associated with the 3rd Brig. 1st Div. 25th
Corps, and was commanded by Col., now Brevet Brig. Gen., S. B. Yeoman,
who relieved Maj. Bumstead. On the night of December 10th, it was
temporally detached, and hurriedly marched, as a reinforcement, to the
North side of the James, at a point of the line near the New Market
Road. The enemy had contemplated a combined attack on the right wing
of our army, with the intention of turning it. They were, however, not
successful in their purpose, and abandoned it; and this Regiment was
remanded to its former place on the Bermuda Hundred. It remained there
until Dec. 31st, when the whole Brigade again crossed the James, and
took up a position near Fort Harrison, before Richmond.

Jan. 25th, 1865 when the Rebel Gun-boats proceeded down the River, and
engaged the Union fleet from a point in the bend, just below the upper
end of Dutch Gap Canal, intending to oblige the fleet to retire and
then capture City Point, our base of supplies, this Regiment occupied
the river bank from Cox's Landing to Dutch Gap, with a detachment also
across the Canal, that skirmished through Farra's Island, to within a
short distance of the Howlett House Battery. They also kept up such a
continuous hail of their small arms upon the enemy's Gun-boats, as to
prevent them from opening their port-holes, and consequently entirely
silenced their guns. This must be recorded as an instance where, much
to chagrin of the chivalry, our unshod infantry effectually silenced
their iron-clads.

From this time the Regiment was intimately identified with all the
movements occurring on the line, and in all the advances and charges
on the Rebel strongholds, until April 3rd, 1865, with the whole of
General Weitzel's forces, it entered triumphantly the great Babylon of
treason. "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," written in the deserted public
palaces and on the charred timbers of its smoking buildings, was now
explicable, but the Belshazzar of the so-called Confederacy had left
his throne, a hasty fugitive, and his hosts were in a precipitate
retreat. The Union, with its Free Institutions, must and shall be
preserved, rang out all over the land, many who had once been manacled
slaves caught up these notes with a sacred joy, as they marched
victorious Freedmen in the Capitol of their Oppressors. General
Weitzel dispatched, April 3rd, A.M., "We took Richmond at 8.15, this
morning."

    "'Twas three o'clock of a Sabbath day,
    And in St. Paul's Chapel, old and gray,
    With his sad-robed wife, and others too,
    The traitor sat in his cushioned pew,
    List'ning the service halfway through,
    And praying the Lord his soul to shrive,
    On the second of April, 'Sixty-five.

    Three o'clock by the old church dial--
    Past the Sexton and up the aisle
    Walked a trooper with trembling knee,
    Holding a letter from R. E. Lee
    to Jefferson Davis, P.S.C.
    "Up," it said, "out of Richmond drive
    Ere the third of April, 'Sixty-five."

    Twelve at night, and the crashing shell
    Drown the tone of the steeple bells,
    Scared at the thickening thunder peals,
    Hurrying feet and whirling wheels,
    Flee at the fleeing traitor's heels,
    And none to stay them are left alive
    By the third of April, 'Sixty-five'.

    Six in the morning, sunrise red,
    Showed long rows of the Rebel dead,
    Tired Battalion and torn Brigade
    Quivered to Weitzel's cannonade;
    And, half in fury and half afraid,
    Swore for their City still to strive
    On the third of April 'Sixty-five.'

    Eight o'clock, and the battle call
    Sounds at the inmost bulwark wall.
    Hoarser the Rebels' shouts reply--
    Their guns are empty, their lips are dry,
    And hundreds who vowed to win or die
    Sullenly yield themselves alive
    On the third of April 'Sixty-five.

    Eight and a quarter the strife is o'er,
    Blind with powder and red with gore,
    Richmond's garrison, surly and dumb,
    Stand, while by them with bugle and drum
    General Weitzel's Freedmen come;
    And through their streets the cavalry drive
    On the third of April 'Sixty-five.

    And forth from gateway, alley and lane,
    Glad slaves run trooping, a swarthy train,
    And martyrs from Libby's Prison hole
    Laugh and cheer for their long "parole,"
    And a myriad of welcomes heavenward roll,
    As our host in the Rebel-hold arrive
    On the third of April 'Sixty-five.

    Shout, ye millions of brave and free,
    O'er flying Davis, and fallen Lee,
    Honor to Weitzel and Sheridan;
    Honor to Grant, who laid the plan;
    Glory to God, who helpeth man,
    For under his might our cause did thrive
    On the third of April 'Sixty-five."

The importunate cry of the nation,--"On to Richmond," being answered
so successfully by Freedmen clad in blue, must and will appear as a
significant fact in the history of the war.

After the surrender of Lee, and in anticipation of the expedition
southward, this Regiment marched back to Camp Lincoln, near City
Point. May 30th it embarked on the steamer "Atlanta," and proceeding
by the Ocean and Gulf routes, arrived at Brazos Santiago, Texas, on
the Gulf of Mexico, June 23rd. During this expedition it lost, by
death, one man, whose body was committed to the great deep. On its
march thence to Brownsville, it passed over Taylor's battle grounds of
the Mexican war, Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. These preserve some
marks of the conflict, but the achievement of our arms then, has been
greatly surpassed, by victories on fields recently obtained. It
camped, finally, on the bank of the Rio Grande River, opposite the
city of Matamoras, Mexico. The flourishing blockade trade conducted by
the adherents of Maximilian, on the one hand, according to the French
version of neutrality, and by the so-called Confederacy on the other,
was now interrupted by the presence of United States Troops. His
Majesty, in his plea for imperial recognition by the United States,
will not forget to importune by reason of his friendly services during
the war.

The Regiment was ordered North, for final discharge, and returning as
far as New Orleans, after waiting there for transportation, it
embarked Nov. 9th on the steamer Merrimac, having other passengers
besides. After a considerable distance at sea, this vessel sprung a
leak. The water gained so rapidly, as, in a very short time, to put
out the fires, and stop the engine. She now depended entirely on her
sails for motive power. The case was a most critical one. Horses had
to be thrown overboard, as well as a large amount of goods. The pumps
of the main engine were useless, and the other pumps on deck were
discovered, certainly by a criminal neglect, to be out of order.
Buckets, pails, kettles and barrels were all mustered for bailing,
which was conducted through two of the hatchways, fore and aft of the
engine, and for the management of which the Regiment was divided into
two reliefs. This systematized work was continued day and night for
sixty-five hours successively, barely keeping even with the water,
until the steamer was run upon the bar, at the mouth of the
Mississippi. For the credit of the brave men, and in behalf of the
endurance of the race, it ought to be recorded, that they worked
cheerfully and well, during all those weary and anxious hours. The
Regiment was landed again at New Orleans. After a gratuitous issue of
clothing by order of Gen. Sheridan, to supply, in part, the loss
incident to this perilous trip, it embarked in the steamer "Costa
Rica," arrived at New York, Nov. 26th, and was finally discharged at
Philadelphia, Nov. 30th, 1865. Its casualties in service were,
officers killed three, wounded eleven, and three discharged by reason
of wounds; and men killed, died of wounds and disease, three hundred
and six, and missing one hundred and ninety-six.




THE COLORED TROOP.


The object of the Government, in the case of commandants of colored
troops, was to secure officers of acknowledged military talent,
experience, and unexceptionably good moral character. It therefore
instituted the Examining Board for Officers, under the Presidency of
General Casey. The officers assigned to commands in this service,
entered upon the duties of their respective positions in this regular
way. Many of them advanced, battle-scarred, step by step from the
ranks. Some were previously connected with the regular army, and
others with the volunteer forces. Their ability, bravery and
gentlemanly character, in the strictest sense, produced a happy effect
upon the troop. When it is considered that in the face of threatenings
of a merciless death by the Rebels, should the fortunes of war place
them in their hands, and against a current of prejudice, extant almost
everywhere, and the whispered doubts and fears even of friends to the
cause, they assumed command of this troop in its experimental state,
and led it on to victory; their high-toned and unselfish patriotism,
in this respect, is only equaled by the bravery and gallantry of their
services. They are also the fit witnesses of the endurance, efficiency
and bravery of the troop as attested on the field, and their
susceptibility of true progress in intellectual culture. This troop in
military discipline and efficiency bore a very favorable comparison
with any other. Their standard was not simply passable, but excellent.
In battle they were remarkable for their great coolness and courage.
The school system inaugurated for their benefit, and which was
conducted in many commands, in the camp and on the field, in its
result was a decided refutation to the argument, that this race could
not be improved.

Now, however, by more than sixty thousand sons of Liberty, of African
descent, than whom none other fought with greater gallantry, numbered
with the patriot dead, and by the many thousand heroic survivors,
whose maimed bodies and torn and tattered battle flags, tell how
fields were won, what is enjoined on the Nation? This fact alone
forbids that any vestige of the former state of the oppression of this
race should remain. It requires another positive duty. What are
Freedmen without citizenship? Some doubt that they have sufficient
knowledge to participate in this right. The presumptive judges, with
their emissaries, who have forfeited this right to themselves, and are
also culprits, blamable and guilty for any lack of such knowledge, in
the case of this loyal race, entertain the doubt; and their weak faith
cannot truly be shrouded in deeper uncertainty than that of every
intelligent patriot, who contemplates the true exercise of the right
of suffrage and representation by those whose hands are yet red with
the blood of our noble slain. It is also said the liberated race, in
their new relation, will not prove themselves industrious citizens.
This argument by the indolent drones of the States in rebellion, and
whose very sustenance was derived from the unpaid toil of this people,
turns upon them with a peculiar reactionary force. We doubt not, it
will be an easier task to elevate to a degree of intelligence, virtue
and industry, and to imbue with the spirit of our Institutions as
worthy citizens these Freedmen, thousands of whom pressed forward to
the support of the Government, in the dark period of our country's
history, than by any process of legislation that cleanses only the
outside of the platter, to attempt to infuse loyalty into the hearts
of those lately in armed rebellion, and in the name of the public
peace, and in honor to Republican Liberty, to admit the Catalines and
Judas Iscariots to the Senate and Congress of the United States. In a
disregard of justice to the memory of our patriot dead, white and
colored, such legislation would be worse than treason. No man, who
voluntarily raised his hand against the flag, upheld by our patriot
martyrs in the field, should ever participate in our legislation. If
the Republic will be true to itself, it must and will be also to those
who were, and are so eminently true to it. Punish treason, and reward
loyalty.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
