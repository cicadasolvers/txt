    I.

    The blessed Damozel leaned out
      From the gold bar of Heaven:
    Her blue-grey eyes were deeper much
      Than a deep water, even.
    She had three lilies in her hand,
      And the stars in her hair were seven.


    II.

    Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,
      No wrought flowers did adorn,
    But a white rose of Mary's gift
      On the neck meetly worn;
    And her hair, lying down her back,
      Was yellow like ripe corn.


    III.

    Herseemed she scarce had been a day
      One of God's choristers;
    The wonder was not yet quite gone
      From that still look of hers;
    Albeit to them she left, her day
      Had counted as ten years.


    IV.

    (To _one_ it is ten years of years
      . . . Yet now, here in this place,
    Surely she leaned o'er me,--her hair
      Fell all about my face . . .
    Nothing: the Autumn-fall of leaves.
      The whole year sets apace.)



[Illustration: "Surely she leaned o'er me."]



    V.

    It was the terrace of God's house
      That she was standing on,--
    By God built over the sheer depth
      In which Space is begun;
    So high, that looking downward thence,
      She could scarce see the sun.


    VI.

    It lies from Heaven across the flood
      Of ether, as a bridge.
    Beneath, the tides of day and night
      With flame and blackness ridge
    The void, as low as where this earth
      Spins like a fretful midge.


    VII.

    But in those tracts, with her, it was
      The peace of utter light
    And silence.  For no breeze may stir
      Along the steady flight
    Of seraphim; no echo there,
      Beyond all depth or height.


    VIII.

    Heard hardly, some of her new friends,
      Playing at holy games,
    Spake, gentle-mouthed, among themselves,
      Their virginal chaste names;
    And the souls, mounting up to God,
      Went by her like thin flames.


    IX.

    And still she bowed herself, and stooped
      Into the vast waste calm;
    Till her bosom's pressure must have made
      The bar she leaned on warm,
    And the lilies lay as if asleep
      Along her bended arm.


    X.

    From the fixt lull of heaven, she saw
      Time, like a pulse, shake fierce
    Through all the worlds.  Her gaze still strove,
      In that steep gulph, to pierce
    The swarm: and then she spake, as when
      The stars sang in their spheres.


    XI.

    "I wish that he were come to me,
      For he will come," she said.
    "Have I not prayed in solemn heaven?
      On earth, has he not prayed?
    Are not two prayers a perfect strength?
      And shall I feel afraid?


    XII.

    "When round his head the aureole clings,
      And he is clothed in white,
    I'll take his hand, and go with him
      To the deep wells of light,
    And we will step down as to a stream
      And bathe there in God's sight.



[Illustration: "'We two will stand beside that shrine.'"]



    XIII.

    "We two will stand beside that shrine,
      Occult, withheld, untrod,
    Whose lamps tremble continually
      With prayer sent up to God;
    And where each need, revealed, expects
      Its patient period.


    XIV.

    "We two will lie i' the shadow of
      That living mystic tree,
    Within whose secret growth the Dove
      Sometimes is felt to be,
    While every leaf that His plumes touch
      Saith His name audibly.


    XV.

    "And I myself will teach to him--
      I myself, lying so--
    The songs I sing here; which his mouth
      Shall pause in, hushed and slow,
    Finding some knowledge at each pause
      And some new thing to know."


    XVI.

    (Alas! to _her_ wise simple mind
      These things were all but known
    Before: they trembled on her sense,--
      Her voice had caught their tone.
    Alas for lonely Heaven!  Alas
      For life wrung out alone!



[Illustration: "'And I myself will teach to him.'"]



    XVII.

    Alas, and though the end were reached?
      Was _thy_ part understood
    Or borne in trust?  And for her sake
      Shall this too be found good?--
    May the close lips that knew not prayer
      Praise ever, though they would?)


    XVIII.

    "We two," she said, "will seek the groves
      Where the lady Mary is,
    With her five handmaidens, whose names
      Are five sweet symphonies:--
    Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,
      Margaret, and Rosalys.


    XIX.

    "Circle-wise sit they, with bound locks
      And bosoms covered;
    Into the fine cloths, white like flame,
      Weaving the golden thread,
    To fashion the birth-robes for them
      Who are just born, being dead.


    XX.

    He shall fear haply, and be dumb.
      Then will I lay my cheek
    To his, and tell about our love,
      Not once abashed or weak:
    And the dear Mother will approve
      My pride, and let me speak.



[Illustration: "'Herself shall bring us, hand in hand.'"]



    XXI.

    'Herself shall bring us, hand in hand,
      To Him round whom all souls
    Kneel--the unnumber'd solemn heads
      Bowed with their aureoles:
    And Angels, meeting us, shall sing
      To their citherns and citoles.


    XXII.

    "There will I ask of Christ the Lord
      Thus much for him and me:--
    To have more blessing than on earth
      In nowise; but to be
    As then we were,--being as then
      At peace.  Yea, verily.


    XXIII.

    "Yea, verily; when he is come
      We will do thus and thus:
    Till this my vigil seem quite strange
      And almost fabulous;
    We two will live at once, one life;
      And peace will be with us."


    XXIV.

    She gazed, and listened, and then said,
      Less sad of speech than mild;
    "All this is when he comes."  She ceased;
      The light thrilled past her, filled
    With Angels, in strong level lapse.
      Her eyes prayed, and she smiled.



[Illustration: "And laid her face between her hands."]



    XXV.

    (I saw her smile.)  But soon their flight
      Was vague 'mid the poised spheres.
    And then she cast her arms along
      The golden barriers,
    And laid her face between her hands,
      And wept (I heard her tears).

The title of The Lover's Library is sufficiently descriptive to make
explanation of the purpose of the Series almost unnecessary.

It is sought to include in a group of compact little volumes the best
Love Poems of the great British poets; and from time to time a volume of
prose, or a volume of modern verse which may be considered of sufficient
importance, will be added to the Library.

The delicate decorations, on the pages, end papers, and covers, make the
little books dainty enough for small presents, and it is hoped that
those who do not receive them as presents from others will seize the
opportunity of making presents to themselves.

Project Gutenberg(tm) License when you share it without charge with

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg(tm) work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg(tm) collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg(tm)
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg(tm)


Project Gutenberg(tm) is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg(tm)'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg(tm) collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg(tm) and future generations. To
learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org .

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg(tm) depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic
works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg(tm)
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg(tm) eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg(tm) eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

    http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg(tm),
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
