NOTICE.


  MONTEVIDEO, December 31st, 1892.

_To the Hon. President of "Chicago Exhibition" Executive Committee:_

On delivering the Spanish text of these notes and statistical
inquiries, the compiling of which we have taken under our care as
a patriotic duty, it is convenient to observe that, if the present
work principally contains facts and particulars only relative to the
year 1891, it is because complete general statistics covering the
year 1892 are not yet to be had, as the "Board of Statistics" do not
publish the "Annual" till the second quarter of the year 1893, and
also because it has been considered better to conserve a certain
general unity in the compiling of facts and particulars. If, in a few
special cases, any particulars of the year 1892 have been quoted, it
was merely with the purpose of supplying to some deficiency.

The time which the Commission has had to dispose has been very short
for a work of this kind; the particulars that existed at the "Board
of Statistics" had to be used, and it was impossible to get any new
ones, at least as completely and as quickly as it was required; and
that if, notwithstanding so many difficulties, it has been possible
to deliver the present work in due time, it is because the Director
of the "Board of General Statistics" had already compiled nearly all
of it, so that the only thing to be done has been to introduce a few
short amplifications, sometimes to change the order, and some others
to make a few important corrections.

The only thing we are sorry for, is not to have received all the
particulars and information we had asked for, so as to give to the
present work a greater novelty and a more seducing form--that, with a
greater number of facts and particulars, might reveal what is, what
can be, and what is to be, one day or other the Oriental Republic,
with all its economical and social elements, and with all the new
elements that will be created, owing to the benefits of peace and
owing to the work and energy of the inhabitants, under the protecting
shield of a severe and provident Administration.

Having concluded this work which was committed to our care, and
thinking that the translator, Mr. J. J. RETHORE, will finish his in
the first fortnight of the next year, we have the honor of saluting
the Honorable President with all our greatest consideration and
esteem.

  HONORE ROUSTAN.

THE ORIENTAL REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY.

(SOUTH AMERICA.)


Discovery--Situation--Limits--Configuration--Perimeter--Superficies.

The territory of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, situated within
the temperate zone of South America, was discovered in the beginning
of the sixteenth century by the famous Spanish cosmographer, Juan
Diaz de Solis.

Its geographical situation is comprised between the 30 deg., 5' and 35 deg.
degrees of latitude S. and the 56th 15' and 60th 45' of longitude W.,
according to the Paris meridian.

North and eastward it confines with the United States of Brazil, and
westward with the Argentine Republic.

Its limits are: On the north, the river Cuareim, the _cuchilla_ or
ridge of hills of Santa Ana, and the right bank of the river Yaguaron
Grande; on the east, the occidental coast of Lake Merin and the river
Chuy, which empties into the Atlantic ocean; on the west, the river
Uruguay, which separates it from the Argentine Republic; on the
south, the river Plate.

Its configuration is somewhat that of a many-sided polygon,
surrounded in its greatest part by water, except its northern part,
where it is bounded by the terrestrial frontier, which separates it
from the Brazilian Republic.

Its perimeter is of 1846 kilom. 850 m., out of which 1073 kilom.
750 m. are sea and river coasts, remaining 773 kilom. 100 m. of
terrestrial line.

Its superficies is 186,920 square kilom.


Aspect--Climate--Meteorology.

The prevailing aspect of the country presents itself with continuous
undulations, formed by the numerous _cuchillas_ or ridges of hills,
which shoot in all directions.

The hills are covered with rich pasture grounds.

Trees of all kinds stand along the banks of the principal rivers and
rivulets which flow, winding about, over great extensions of land,
and water the fertile meadows, forming, under a quiet and generally
clear sky, a charming landscape all over, which invites to employ
usefully such manifold natural riches that have just begun, being
cultivated and worked in a vast scale and with fruitful results.

Although it is not a mountainous country, its highlands are numerous.
The principal heights are the hills of Santa Ana, 490 m.; the hills
of Haedo, 400 m.; the Cuchilla Grande (high hills), 458 m. To all
these hills join a great many others less high, the declivity of
which form the lakes, ponds and rivers that give a great variety to
the hydrography of the country.

The climate all over the Republic is mild and notably healthy; there
exist no malignous, endemical disease whatever. Neither the cold nor
the heat is excessive.

The middle temperature may be calculated to be, in winter-time of 11
degrees, in spring-time of 17 degrees, in summer of 21 degrees, and
in autumn of 16 degrees.

The maximum of heat in the month of January is 36 deg., and that of cold
in the month of July is 3 deg. above naught.

The climate is a little dryer in the interior than on the coast.
Along the coasts watered by the salt waters of the great mouth of the
river Plate, the climate is thoroughly a sea climate, and the seasons
never get to any extreme.

Meteorological observations, made in Montevideo in the year 1843 and
down to the year 1852 have given a middle term of 244 serene days, 85
cloudy days and 36 rainy days per annum.

The last observations made by the "Uruguay Meteorological Society"
during the year 1891 have given the following results;

Atmospherical pressure, calculated in mm., reduced to 0, middle term,
760,572.

Temperature of the air, in the shade, centigrade degrees, middle
term, 16,23; minimum, m. t. 12.77; maximum, m. t. 19.36.

Tension of the vapor, in mm., middle term, 10.98.

Relative humidity (saturation = 100), middle term, 77.29.

Inferior wind, prevailing direction N. N. E.; rapidity in meters by
second, middle term, 3.81.

Rain, mm., total: 711.8.

Winter is so mild in this country that, in fact, the year may be
divided into two seasons--the hot season, from November till April,
and the cool season, from May till October.

Whatever may be the geographical situation of his own country the
foreigner does not need any previous acclimation; when he comes to
live in this Republic he does not feel any disorder in his health,
owing to the mildness of the temperature.

The most ordinary winds are the N., N. E., E, and S. W. winds. This
last one, called _Pampero_, is pure and vivifying and is rightly
considered as the purifier of the Plate, and one of the principal
causes of the wholesomeness which the country enjoys.


Rivers--Rivulets--Ports--Docks--Dry Docks.

With only looking over the map of the Republic, one gets an idea of
its rich hydrography.

Sixteen rivers flow through the territory, all being joined by more
than 500 rivulets that increase their size and current.

The principal rivers are the Plate and Uruguay, which bathe the
coasts of the Republic, and the Rio Negro (the black river), which
flows all through the center of the territory.

The River plate, at its mouth, between cape Santa Maria and cape
San Antonio, is more than 206 kilometers wide; its superficies are
calculated to be over 39,846 kilom.; its length 361 kilom.; its
breadth, between Colonia and Buenos Ayres, a little more than 51
kilom.

The River Uruguay flows from N. to S., its length through the
Republic is 530 kilom., its breadth from the Guazu down to the point
of Fray Bentos varies from 10 to 15 kilom. After passing Fray Bentos
it becomes narrow, owing to the multitude of islands which form deep
channels. In its normal state it runs three or four miles an hour.
It is navigable up to Paysandu for ships of great tonnage, and up to
Salto for coast trading boats.

The Rio Negro runs through the territory from N. W. to W., with an
extension of 463 kilom. It is navigable for ships of small tonnage
for 94 kilom., more or less.

The other thirteen rivers are: the Cuareim, the Arapey, the Dayman,
the Queguay, the Tacuarembo, the Yi, the Yaguaron, the Tacuari, the
Olimar Grande, the San Jose, the San Salvador and the Santa Lucia.

These powerful arteries, the waters of which are increased by
numberless rivulets that empty into them, flow down to the remotest
parts of the Republic and fertilize them.

The waters of the River Plate, till a little further up than Santa
Lucia are salt; beyond this they always remain fresh.

The waters of the Uruguay, Rio Negro and other rivers of the interior
have the property of petrifying animal and vegetable substances.

Along the 1,073 kilom. of maritime and fluvial coasts, which are
counted from the mouth of the Cuareim River down to the River Chuy,
are the principal ports of the Republic.

The most important ones are Maldonado, Montevideo and Colonia, on
the coasts watered by the River Plate. There exist others of less
importance, like those of Paloma, Coronilla, Castillos Grande, Buceo
and also the bay, called the Englishman's Bay, (Ensenada del Ingles).
Along the River Uruguay we find the ports Nueva Palmira, Carmelo,
Independencia, Paysandu, Salto, Constitucion and Santa Rosa. Along
the Rio Negro, those of Soriano and Mercedes; and along the San
Salvador the port of San Salvador.

The principal port in the Republic is that of Montevideo. It is
estimated as the best port on the River Plate, owing to its natural
conditions. It has the shape of a horse-shoe, being the two extreme
points, which form its entrance, some seven kilom. distant from one
another.

The perimeter of the bay is ten kilom., and six hundred m. It offers
ships a safe shelter, its entrance being towards the N. W. and its
channel between 15 and 17 feet deep. The general depth of the bay is
between 14 and 15 feet. The steamers cast anchor near the entrance of
the port in the exterior bay where the depth gets to 25 feet.

The port of Montevideo is not only the anchoring ground of the ships
that have to load and unload, but it is also the port where all of
the ships stop on their way to the Pacific Ocean, and also all the
men-of-war of the nations which have a naval station in the River
Plate.

All the steamers of the rivers have their anchoring ground in front
of the docks, where they all have their moorings at a distance of 125
m. from the wharf.

Being the principal port where the commercial and naval movement
is most important, Montevideo counts with two beautiful dry docks,
belonging to private persons, one of them is the Maua Dry Dock and
the other one belongs to Jackson and Cibils. They have both been
opened in the quick rock, and have for their service all the most
modern machines, admitting ships of all tonnage.

Besides those two, there are a great many docks, dry docks and
harbors, all over the bay and also in the ports of Salto and Colonia.


Minerals.

The territory of the Republic contains numberless riches not worked
out yet, in precious metals, in copper, iron, lead, etc., in agate
stone, rock, crystal, slate, calcareous stone, marble of all colors,
which could advantageously rival with the marbles of Italy and
Pyrenean mountains.

Rich marble quarries exist in the department of Minas, which could
not have been worked before on account of the difficulties for the
transport, made easier and cheaper now days when the railway reaches
to Minas 123 kilom. distant from the capital.

The Cunapiru gold region is now worked by the following societies:

Zapucay gold mines, with 20 crushing machines.

Uruguay gold fields, with 60 crushing machines.

Hermanos gold minings, with 20 crushing machines.

The French Uruguay gold mine company, the working of which is stopped
for the present, has spent in the region mentioned more than three
millions of dollars, and has established milldams in the rivers
Cunapiru and Corrales so as to employ, for the grinding, a powerful
hydraulic strength.

The working of the mines on a great scale is just beginning now
without interruption.

During the last two years over 72,000 tons of quartz have been
extracted and crushed, giving a result of over 420 kilog. of fine
gold.

Mines of lead and copper and marble quarries are now worked in the
departments of Minas and Maldonado.

The agate stone is exported as it is found in the Catalan hills,
department of Salto, and there exists in Montevideo an agent of the
house established in that department, where are sold the stones
worked out into art objects.

In La Paz, near Montevideo, there exist quarries of red and blue
granite, some beautiful pieces of which are employed as columns in
some important buildings.

Stone is abundant in the Republic. Everywhere in Cerro, La Paz,
Sauce, Colonia and other places they continually open new quarries
which permit a considerable exportation for the works undertaken in
Buenos Ayres and La Plata.

The Colonia quarries alone employ over two thousand workmen.


Vegetation.

The territory does not only count with its native trees the wood of
which is employed in the industries and the rural economy; but all
over its fertile soil do grow, reproducing themselves, and perfectly
accustomed to the climate, nearly all the trees of the other regions.

Among the native trees there are the _nandubay_, that has the
property of petrifying itself under the ground, the _urunday_, the
lapacho, the viraro, the coronilla, the espinillo, quebracho, tala,
araza, the carob-tree, the black laurel, the timbo, guaviyu, copal,
the white, red, brown and yellow willow, the mataojo, paraiso, the
wild acacia, the ceibo and many others, the wood of which may be
employed for making all kinds of casks and buildings, and also for
burning.

"The riches of the forests in this country," says Dr. Ordonana,
perpetual secretary to the Rural Association, "belong to two distinct
categories. The first one extends itself along the banks of the
rivers and rivulets of the interior of the Republic, and the other
is a consequence of the sediments, ground and sands brought down
by the rivers that form the Plate, which, stopped by the banks of
low Uruguay, give birth to plants like those described by clever
botanists as Azara and Bomplan, as belonging to the regions of the
Pilcomayo, Parana and Paraguay.

"The trees are generally represented by a great many out of which no
wood can be made, and small shrubs that give fruits, used in other
times by the natives, gums and resins, stuffs used for weaving and
dyeing, and a great many twining plants, among which there are the
hisipo, of yellow flowers, and also the ilex-mate.

"None of the plants we mention here have been considered, until
now, worth being scientifically cultivated, although our Society
has claimed for it many times, because, neither private persons nor
private congregations, without the help of the government, can
afford the establishment and maintenance of experimental farms, which
are the true guides for studies and observations.

"We have preferred here cultivating foreign trees, whilst we had here
a great many much better than they, as for their wood, shade and
elegance.

"The private efforts of men we cannot forget have changed the aspect
of our forests and also of the cattle of the country, by enriching
it with new seeds and new plants and employing the combined means of
nature and of work."

In many departments the palm tree is found, also many kinds of
fruit and ornamental trees. There are trees, shrubs and herbs with
medicinal properties and good for dyeing and weaving, and also
resinous, aromatic and alkaline ones.

The series of the plants with healing properties is long; there
may be found the sarsaparilla, the marshmallow, the liquorice, the
rhubarb, the camomile, the wild celery and many other plants, which
it would be too long to enumerate here.

Among the fruit trees accustomed to this climate there are: the
orange tree, the apple tree, the pear tree, the apricot tree, the
pomegranate tree, the peach tree, the cherry tree, the lemon tree,
the plum tree, the nut tree, the quince tree, the olive tree, the
medlar tree, the almond tree, the chestnut tree, the fig tree, the
date palm, etc., etc.

Among the other classes we find the poplar, the cypress, the elm,
the oak, the plantain, the acacia, the eucalyptus, the cedar, the
magnolia, the white mulberry tree, etc.

As for the cereals and vegetables, all kinds of them grow here
perfectly and abundantly. Wheat, maize, barley, lucerne, are the
principal rural products. The chick-pea, the French bean, the
gray pea, the bean, the sugar-pea, the hastings, the lentils, the
potatoes, the Spanish potatoes, the carrot, the radishes, the
turnips, the pumpkins, the beet root, etc., and all kinds of pot
herbs, the watermelons, the melon and the strawberry grow also
abundantly.

The grape vine, the flax, the tobacco, the canary seed, the cotton,
the anise-seed, the hemp, the currin seed, the peanuts and many other
classes give good results. During these last years the nursing of the
vine, the olive, the lucerne, and the tobacco has spread itself a
great deal.

As for the flowers, there is such an immense variety of them and such
a plenty that the Republic has deserved the name of "The country of
sun and flowers." The industry of nosegays and crowns has reached an
unheard-of development. Beside the garden plants that belong to the
country, they nurse here all the varieties known in Europe.

The environs of Montevideo count a great many important
establishments dedicated to the commerce of plants, ornamental and
fruit trees, all of the most valuable kinds.


Animals.

The native animal reign counts thirty-nine families; among them we
find the deer, the buck, the otter, the _carpincho_ and many others,
the skins of which are exported.

There are more than 500 species of birds, among them the ostrich, the
white stork, the wood turkey, the swan, the water duck, the heath
cock, the moor cock, the partridge, the wood pigeon, etc. Among the
singing birds the varieties are innumerable. Among the fowl, they
bring up all kinds of hens, the duck, the goose, the pigeon, the
turkey, etc.

There are fourteen species of shells, and seven among the crustaceous.

As for fishes, there are to be found numerous and rich varieties of
salt and fresh water ones. Large quantities of the first class are
taken over to Buenos Ayres every day by the steamers. Pisiculture
is destined to have a great development here. An important fishery
is already established on the coasts of Maldonado. The bringing up
of salmon has already been tried. The only things wanting still are
money and technical directions for the reproduction of the richest
kinds of fishes, so as to supply with great advantage the Montevideo
and Buenos Ayres markets.

The principal industry in the country is the cattle and
horse-breeding, which, as will further on be seen, produces in a
prodigious way. This industry was introduced into the country in the
time of the conquest by the Spaniards.

Actually they improve and refine the cattle and horses by the
crossing with the pure blood animals which continually come from
Europe and the Argentine Republic. Already there exist important
establishments with thoroughly pure blood animals born in the
country, having already begun the wholesale of oxen and cows for
consumption, and of horses for races and coach. The sheep are now a
great deal finer. The improvement began in the year 1832, with two
Negretti and Rambouillet rams, and this is the reason why the wool,
for its good quality, is so much valued in European markets. Besides
the merino sheep, a great many other races have been introduced, and
among them some of very good flesh, like the Southdowns, of which
there are already numerous herds.


Division of the Territory--Situation of the Departments--Centre of
Population.

The territory is divided into nineteen departments. The superficial
area of each of them is as follows:

In the centre of the territory are the departments of Durazno,
Flores, Minas, Tacuarembo, Treinta y Tres, and Florida, surrounded
by those of Artigas, Rivera and Cerro Largo, situated on the very
frontier of Brazil; the Department of Rocha on the Atlantic Ocean;
those of Maldonado, Canelones, Montevideo, San Jose and Colonia on
the River Plate; and those of Soriano, Rio Negro, Paysandu and Salto
on the River Uruguay.

All those departments count over a hundred centres of population,
that is to say, seven towns, forty-eight villages, and thirty-nine
colonies or smaller centres.


Political Organization.

_Government._--The constitution of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay
establishes the representative republican system.

_Sovereignty._--The sovereignty in all its fullness exists radically
in the Nation, which has the exclusive right of establishing its own
laws in the way determined by the Constitution.

_Religion._--The Religion of the state is the Roman Apostolic
Catholic Church. However, all dissident churches are tolerated and
their religion can be freely practiced; the inhabitants enjoy the
full liberty of thought.

_High Powers._--The three high powers of the state are the
legislative power, the executive power and the judicial power.

_Legislative Powers._--This power is formed by two chambers,
the Senate and Deputies' Chamber. The Senate is compounded with
as many members as departments, these forming the political and
administrative division of the Republic. The election is indirect.

The President of the Senate is the Vice-President of the Republic,
and performs the functions of the first magistrate in case of
absence, illness, resignation or death.

The _Deputies' Chamber_ is composed of 69 members, directly elected
by the people in the way determined by the law on elections.

_Executive Power._--The executive power is represented by the
President of the Republic, who is elected in a general assembly of
the two chambers by nominal voting, being required the absolute
majority of suffrages expressed on ballots which are publicly read
out by the secretary. His functions last four years, and he cannot be
re-elected unless four other years have passed.

The President appoints the Secretaries of State, or Ministers, who
are five--one of Government, one of _Fomento_ (Public Education,
Commerce, Industry and Railways), one of Finance, one of War and
Navy, and one of Foreign Affairs.

_Delegates of the Executive Power._--In every town, the capital of
a department, there is a delegate of the Executive Power called
Political and Police Chief (_Jefe politico y de policia_), and
entrusted to make his dispositions obeyed.

_Judicial Power._--This power is composed of the High Court of
Justice. But as this court has not yet been regularly established,
the United Tribunals of Appeal, composed each of them of three
members, perform the functions of the High Court. It is entrusted
with the superintendence of all the other judges.

There exist in the Republic three Superior Judges (_Jueces
Letrados_), for the civil, two for the commerce, one for the
treasure, one for the criminal, and one for the correctional, and
also nineteen ordinary judges for the departments.

_Justice of the Peace._--There exist a justice of the peace and an
attorney in every one of the sections into which are divided the
departments. The members of the Justice of the Peace are elected by
the people. They give sentence in all the affairs of small importance.

The law of the 11th of February, 1879, has created the Civil State
Register in all the Republic, and the inscription in this Register
has been made obligatory the 1st of July of the same year.

This Register is entrusted to the care of the Justice of the Peace,
who performs the functions of Civil State Register Officer, and in
it are inscribed all the births, marriages, deaths, recognizance and
legitimation of the sons.

The law of the 22d of May, 1885, declared Civil Matrimony obligatory
throughout all the Republic, no other one being acknowledged as
legitimate besides the one celebrated according to the law and
according to the dispositions established in the Civil State
Registers of the 11th of February, 1879, and their regulation and
laws of the 1st of June, 1880, and 1st of July, 1884.

_Municipality_ (Junta Economico-Administrativa.)--There exists a
_Junta_ or Municipality in each department. The members of the
municipality are elected by the people, and they are entrusted with
the care of the municipal interests. The Montevideo municipality has
a very great importance, being entrusted with the care of all the
municipal services except that of the police.

_Citizenship._--The citizens of the state are either natural or
legal. Natural are all those born in the territory; legal, all the
foreigners who ask for citizenship, after having proved their
residence in the country for a determined time.

All the citizens, whether natural or legal, enjoy the right of voting
and _may be elected_ in certain conditions.

The constitution of the Republic sworn on the 18th of July, 1830,
among other articles, contains the following ones:

Art. the 130th. The inhabitants of the state have a right to be
protected in their life, honor, liberty, security and property.
Nobody can be deprived of these rights, but according to the laws.

Art. the 131st. In the territory of the state nobody can be a slave
by birth; the slave trade and introduction of slaves are forever
forbidden in the Republic.

Art. the 132d. All men are equal before the law, be it preceptive,
penal or defensive; the only distinction acknowledged is that of
talent and virtue.

Art. the 134th. The private actions of men, that do not by any way
attack the public order nor harm any third person, belong only to
God, and, therefore, remain beyond the authority of the magistrates.
No inhabitant of the state will be obliged to do what the law does
not bid, neither prevented from doing what the law does not forbid.

Art. the 141st. Thoroughly free is the communication of thought,
by words, private writings, or publications in the public papers,
whatever be the subjects, without requiring any previous censure; the
only responsible person is the author, or, in his stead, the printer,
whenever the writing be abusive, according to the law.

Art. the 146th. All the inhabitants of the state may undertake any
work, industry or commerce they like, provided they do not harm the
public order or the other citizens' rights.

Art. the 147th. The entrance into the territory of the Republic is
free to any one, as also his staying in it or going away with his
goods, provided he respect the police laws and do not harm any third
person.


Language and Customs.

The national language is the Spanish tongue. However, nearly all the
languages are known in the Republic, on account of the great number
of foreigners established here, and the great number of them who have
continuous relations with the country.

Nearly every native who has received a fairly good instruction speaks
some foreign language. In Montevideo, where continually stop boats of
all nations, the practice of French, Italian, English and German is
quite general.

In nearly every department in the Republic, and above all in
Montevideo, exist a great many good schools belonging to the above
mentioned nations.

The foreigner who treads the Uruguay soil does not miss the customs
of his own country, since the ones he meets here are nearly the same
as in the principal European cities.

A great many years of continuous communication with all the nations
of the world has made, that the customs of all the civilized nations
are quite familiar to the natives.


Population--Its Density.

In the Statistical Annuary corresponding to the year 1891 the
population of the Republic has been calculated thus:

  Departments.      Population in 1891.

  Montevideo             234,688
  Canelones               64,772
  Colonia                 39,309
  Soriano                 32,617
  San Jose                26,528
  Flores                  13,737
  Florida                 29,078
  Rocha                   22,237
  Maldonado               15,757
  Cerro-Largo             25,741
  Minas                   23,466
  Treinta y Tres          17,297
  Salto                   32,827
  Artigas                 17,367
  Durazno                 25,020
  Paysandu                29,962
  Rio Negro               15,970
  Tacuarembo              25,166
  Rivera                  16,629
                         -------
      Total              708,168

In the year 1829 the population of the Republic was 74,000 souls, and
in the year 1879, 438,245.

The increase of the population has produced itself according to the
following proportions:

  In 1882   505,207 inhabitants.
     1883   520,536     "
     1884   559,668     "
     1885   582,858     "
     1886   596,463     "
     1887   614,257     "
     1888   648,297     "
     1889   683,943     "
     1890   706,524     "
     1891   708,168     "

The increase of the population during the year 1891, if compared with
the population in 1879, is of 269,923 souls, that is to say, 61.59
per cent.

If we add to the total of inhabitants during the year 1891 a 6 per
cent. on account of the omissions which probably took place in the
calculations (omission of inscriptions of births, of declarations in
the lists of passengers, etc.), we have a population for the whole
Republic of, more or less, 750,658 inhabitants.

Dividing the population into nationalities we see that out of a
hundred inhabitants there are 70 natives and 30 foreigners. In
Montevideo, however, the proportion varies, being of 53 natives and
47 foreigners.

The density of the population throughout the Republic is of 3.78
inhabitants for each square kilometre.

The Department of Montevideo, which has the smallest superficial
area, is the most peopled of all the Republic, (353.44 inhabitants
for each square kilometre); in it resides nearly the third part of
the population of the country. Next to Montevideo, the Department of
Canelones is the most peopled, (13.63 inhabitants for each square
kilometre.)

The above mentioned results are an evident proof that the territory
of the Republic is still very little peopled, and that there is very
easily room enough in it for many millions of inhabitants.

Although the density of the population be but of 3.78 inhabitants
for each square kilometre, it is, however, superior to the density
of the population in the Argentine Republic, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia,
Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and Nicaragua, none of which get to that
figure.


Movement of the Population.

From the year 1887 till the year 1891 have taken place in the
Republic:

  Years.      Births.    Deaths.    Marriages.

  1887         25,132    12,573       3,428
  1888         25,832    12,077       3,976
  1889         26,981    12,882       4,175
  1890         27,899    15,174       4,082
  1891         28,696    13,146       3,524
              -------    ------      ------
              134,540    65,852      19,185

  Middle yearly
    term:
               26,908    13,170       3,837

  Proportion out
    of 1000
    inhabitants:
                 37.9      18.5         5.4

So as to appreciate better the rank occupied by the Republic among
the other countries as regards the movement of the population, the
following figures may be considered as points of comparison:

                Births per      Deaths per       Marriages
  Countries.      1000             1000           per 1000
               Inh'bit'nts.    Inh'bit'nts.     Inhabitants.

  France          25.8            23.8              7.7
  Italy           37              29.1              7.8
  Scotland        35              21.4              7.1
  Ireland         26.9            17.8              4.8
  Austria         38.6            31                8.5
  Swiss           30.1            23.2              7.4
  Belgian         32              22.4              7.2
  Sweden          27.1            18.9              6.5
  Norway          31.3            17.2              6.9
  Denmark         31.1            19.7              7.8
  Oriental Repub.
    of Uruguay    37.9            18.5              5.4

Therefore the births in the Republic prove to be in a greater
proportion than in any of the mentioned countries, Austria being
excepted, while the deaths, with the exception of Sweden and Norway,
is in a smaller proportion, as also the marriages, Ireland being
excepted.

This great number of births and the corresponding diminution in the
figures of death prove how easy is the purchase of the elements
necessary to life; and how very excellent are the climate and the
salubrity in the Republic.


Movement of Passengers.

Though the Republic has many ports Montevideo is, nevertheless, where
takes place the greatest concourse of passengers.

The movement from abroad and from the Argentine and Uruguay coasts
has given the following results:

  Years.    Passengers.    Per Month.    Per Day.

  1883        60,388         5,033         167
  1884        91,872         7,656         255
  1885        99,059         8,255         275
  1886        89,567         7,464         248
  1887       102,396         8,533         284
  1888       133,033        11,086         366
  1889       153,811        12,817         427
  1890       150,447        12,537         417
  1891       104,945         8,745         291

The diminution which begins in the year 1890 is due to the economical
crisis that began in that year, and the consequences of which are
still to be felt.


Immigration.

The territory of the Republic being abundant in all natural resources
and elements necessary to make easy any kind of work or industry one
chooses to undertake, and the immigrant getting very soon accustomed
to a climate and customs very little different from those of his own
country, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay offers therefore all kinds
of advantages to the honest and laborious immigrant who comes here
in search of a remuneration greater than that he can earn in his own
country.

Thus is explained the large number of foreigners of all nationalities
who have chosen this country as their second countryland, settling
themselves here definitely and partaking with their families a wealth
which allows them a good living, and is the base of their future
modest or great fortune.

In spite of the political disorders, the time of which, it may be
said, has passed, and in spite of the economical crisis that, with
more or less intensity, are common to all the countries that rapidly
advance and progress, the Oriental Republic has always seen a great
and constant affluence of arms and capital, that have contributed in
a few years to display powerfully its productive energy, to create
establishments and manufactures which, with their products, have
increased the relations of exchange with all the markets of the world.

Although the present times be not very favorable to the immigratory
movement, the country is bound to recover soon, very soon, from the
disorders suffered during the last crisis.

Our own history, and also that of the other American nations, teach
us that in a period of restrictions in business and settling
accounts, the immigration always diminishes, but increases again as
soon as it begins to feel the first symptoms of reaction towards a
period of prosperity.

The following figures demonstrate the oscillations in the immigratory
movement, coinciding with critical or prosperous periods:

Immigration has come here of its own accord, during times of
prosperity; but the government has also tried to call it here by
making easier the coming of immigrants from Europe, and their being
led into the interior of the country, and also by giving land to
colonists or by exhonerating others from all duties and taxes, either
direct or indirect.

During the years hereafter mentioned the government has given the
following number of passages to immigrants who required them:

  In the year 1887   255 passages.
      "  "    1888   124    "
      "  "    1889  2727    "
      "  "    1890  1133    "

The immigrant enjoys here a complete and perfect liberty. Being a
foreigner he owes no service whatever to the state. Dedicated to
work, he is always respected, and wherever he may go in the Republic,
he is always sure to find some of his countrymen who, knowing well
the country and talking his own language, will give him all the
information and references he may require. Besides this, on landing,
he always finds interpreters who give him all the explanations he may
need.

Territorial Property.

According to the declarations made in the year 1882 for the payment
of the contribution tax, called the Immovable Contribution, the value
of the property in the Republic rose to $211,991,679.00.

In the year 1890, eight years later, although the cattle and some
other products were declared free from contribution tax the value of
property was $265,871,559, an increase of $53,879,880.

The number of proprietors in 1882 were 39,590, and in the year 1890
50,189, an increase of 10,599.

By nationalities, the proprietors in 1890 were in the following
proportion:

Natives, 24,946, or 49.70 per cent.

Foreigners 25,243, or 50.30 per cent.

How Easily One Becomes a Land Owner.

There exist in Montevideo great agencies, like the one called the
"Industrial" created in the year 1874, by Mr. Francis Piria, the sole
object of which is to make easy the division of the property in the
capital and the neighborhood, by purchasing large zones of land and
by dividing them into square _cuadras_, or fractions of over four
English acres, when they belong to the town district, and into the
best possible form outside.

This agency has created many villages out of the Department of
Montevideo, as "Recreo de las Piedras," "Joaquin Suarez," "Buenos
Ayres," "Bella Italia" and many others.

The centres of population created by the "Industrial" are over a
hundred; some of them have been aggregated to the town district,
everyone of them becoming important centres, on account of the number
of the inhabitants, and of the increasing value of the land, sold
formerly very cheap, and payable at the rate of $2.00 per month.

All the fractions of land have generally been bought by work-people
who have built their own houses.

According to the general balance and informations collected down to
the year 1891, the "Industrial" agency had made 52,317 proprietors,
and the fractions of land sold up to that time were 183,000, the
result of the sale being $79,411. The number of houses was 8000.

Those who bought some of those fractions of land a few years ago,
payable in the above mentioned conditions, at the rate of 20 or 25
cents per metre, are now-a-days owners of properties which are worth
two, three, four and five times more.

The very same thing happens in the colonies or agricultural centres
established in many departments of the Republic, the founders
of which have given to the settlers all kinds of easy means for
establishing themselves.

Families of work-people that had arrived here with nothing but the
means of facing the very first necessities have become, after a few
years, owners of the land they had bought, payable monthly, and
having increased their possessions by buying new land, they have
enlarged the sphere of their operations and are now able to work over
their own properties in a fully independent and easy situation.

The advantages of such a system will be easily understood.

With what a workman or settler pays monthly for the rent of the land,
he makes himself, after a short time, the owner of the land and of
the house he lives in, as the monthly rent redeems with a small
interest the value of the property.

In such conditions great many people are known who enjoy all these
advantages, and many more, who being the proprietors of the land
purchased in such a way have made small fortunes.

There cannot be a better way imagined of fixing the immigrants or
giving to the peasant all the means of becoming a proprietor and of
consecrating himself to highly profitable agricultural industries.


Value of the Land.

The population has not yet reached a great density. The best part
of the territory is destined to cattle, sheep, and horse breeding,
in establishments called _estancias_. _A suerte or estancia_ is
equivalent to 1992 hectares 2787 metres, or one league and a half
in length by a half league in width, or three quarters of a square
league or 4,923 square acres 333 square yards.

The price of a _suerte_ varies according to the department and also
to its situation. The lowest price of a _suerte_ is generally no less
than $7,000 and rises above $50,000 in the departments quite close to
the capital, that are still devoted to pastoral land.

In the north, next to the frontier, land may be purchased at the rate
of $3 to $10 an hectare.

In the centre, from $6 to $15.

In the south, the land rises to higher prices, which vary from $10 to
$100 per hectare.

The agricultural land in the environs of towns and villages, and in
the departments of Canelones, Colonia, Soriano, San Jose, Paysandu,
Salto costs $10, $20, $40, $50 and $100 an hectare. In the department
of Montevideo it rises to $100, $200 and $300, according to the
situation.

There are no restrictions or difficulties in purchasing or transfer.

Great companies established abroad, above all in England, and others
in the Republic have purchased great tracts of land in order to
improve cattle breeding, agriculture, sand and stone extraction along
the banks of the River Plate and Uruguay, and other important rural
industries.

During these last two years the agricultural industry has notably
spread itself, above all that of cereals, forage, firewood trees,
vine, olive trees, tobacco and oleoginous and textile plants.

The lowest rate at which a _suerte_ of land for cattle feeding can
be hired is $400 a year. There are fields, however, that can produce
two, three and four times more. The hectare of agricultural land may
be hired at a yearly price of $1.20. In some departments, like that
of Canelones, where the agricultural industry has improved a great
deal, the yearly renting is $4.00 and more.

The land pays the property tax or _Contribucion Inmobiliaria_, at the
uniform rate of 6-1/2 per thousand in relation with the value that
the law has fixed to the land according to the departments.


Agriculture.

The Oriental Republic of Uruguay is an essentially pastoral country.

Its fields, covered with good and nutritive grass, are nearly all
of them divided into _estancias_ for cattle breeding, that, to the
present time, is the principal source of riches of the country.

Agriculture, however, has already reached a high degree of importance
in the departments of Montevideo, Canelones, Colonia, San Jose,
Soriano, Paysandu, Salto, Florida, Durazno, Maldonado. It is not
quite so important in the other departments as in the three first
ones. However, in the environs of the villages and centres of
population, there are great many farms and agricultural centres that
produce cereals and vegetables for local consumption. The exceeding
crop, in the prosperous years, is immediately sent to the principal
commercia centres of the Republic, which allows the export of corn,
flour, wheat, canary-seed, flax, trefoil, barley, etc.

Although the Republic counts with a fertile soil, and finds itself
in the very best conditions for any kind of agricultural industry,
agriculture, however, remains still in a secondary degree, in spite
of its late improvements, and in spite of the large extension of
land which began last year to be cultivated.

However, after all the necessities of the country have been satisfied
there generally remains an important surplus of agricultural and
rural products, when the crop is good, that may be calculated over
$1,200,000.00.

The wheat grown in Uruguay is reputed to be the best in all South
America, and effectively got the gold medal in the Universal Paris
Exhibition in the year 1878.

In this country one _fanega_ of wheat (the fanega is equivalent to
105 or 113 kilogs more or less) produces sometimes from 20 to 30
fanegas; one of maize produces from 150 to 200, one of barley from 18
to 30.

Besides wheat and maize, the sowing of which is most important, the
grape vine, the olive, tobacco, flax, canary-seed, hemp, chick-pea,
beans of all kinds, potatoes, (two crops a year,) peas, lentils,
Spanish potatoes, beet-roots, etc., etc., are also cultivated with
very good results.

As we have said, the vegetables are produced in a great variety and
abundance.

The tobacco culture is also a new source of wealth opened to the
economical movement of the country. Although this industry still goes
rather slowly, there are already many establishments in the interior
where it has been undertaken with very good results.


Agricultural Centres.

Many are the agricultural centres, generally known by the name of
_colonies_, established all over the Republic, that, owing to the
special conditions of the land which is fit for all cultures, have
notably improved.

Among the principal colonies, or agricultural settlements, there are:

1st. The _Valdense Colony_, founded in 1858. It has an area of 19,432
square cuadras (14,338 hectares 5,035 metres).

Its population in 1884 was 306 families, forming a total of 1,681
inhabitants. To-day, there are more than 2,200 inhabitants. It
possesses the best agricultural machinery, steam-mills, and steam
and water mills, good carpenters, blacksmiths, and in a word all
the establishments necessary to the unceasing progress of such
agricultural centres. It has two Evangelical churches, a public
library with over a thousand books, eight schools, a postoffice, a
municipal commission and a police office.

2d. _Swiss_, _Quevedo_ and _Spanish Colonies_. The _Swiss Colony_ was
founded in 1863. It has an area of 8,782 square cuadras, or 6,480
hectares, 709 metres. The _Quevedo Colony_ has an area of 5,091
square cuadras, or 3,756 hectares and 5,521 metres, and the _Spanish
Colony_ 9,600 square cuadras, or 7,083 hectares, 6,576 metres.

These three agricultural centres form a total of 17,320 hectares,
over which live more than 420 families. They possess steam-mills,
schools, many commercial establishments. In the Swiss Colony
there are two churches--a Catholic and Protestant. The public
administration of these settlements consist of a municipal
commission, a justice of peace and an attorney. They also have a
postoffice.

3d. _Sauce Colony._ The first settlers who cultivated the soil in
this agricultural centre were some Swiss people who, in the year
1879, hired the land where it now exists, In the years 1880 and 1881
other families came and settled themselves close to the first ones.
In 1883, thirty families more came from the Valdense Colony; so that
in 1884 the Sauce Colony counted 59 families.

4th. _Riachuelo Colony._ It is 10 kilometres distant, eastward, from
Colonia del Sacramento. The first settlers have paid for all the land
they had bought, being now the sole owners of it.

The formation and improvements of this colony are owed to the mere
intelligence and work of the settlers. The land is of a very good
quality and especially fit for wheat. The other plants like maize,
barley, beans, potatoes, etc., give also a very good result. The
settlers are mostly foreigners; and most of them are Italians. The
colony possesses a large public building, which is destined to be the
school and the church; besides this, it has also a national school
of the first degree. The steam-mill that exists works only for the
colony.

The above-mentioned colonies are situated in the Department of
Colonia, and besides those, there are also the _Arrue_ and _Belgrano
Colonies_.

5th. _Nuevo Berlin Colony._ In the Department of Rio Negro there
exists, since a few years, the Nuevo Berlin Colony. It has over 1,033
hectares in full culture, and possesses steam ploughs and all kind of
agricultural machinery.

6th. _Porvenir Colony._ The colonies in the Department of Paysandu
are the _Villa Rosalia_ and _Esperanza_ colonies, of recent
foundation, and the so-called _Porvenir_ colony. This last one is
the most important one, counting already over 1,690 inhabitants.
The languages spoken in the colony are Spanish and Italian. The
soil cannot be better, and is fit for all kinds of culture. It
possesses steam and water mills, a threshing Rausanes machine and a
Hornsby. It has three schools--a public one and two private ones--and
many societies, every one of them working for the improvement of
the colony, and also other societies, the object of which is the
purchase of all the necessary agricultural machinery. The public
administration consists of a justice of peace, two attorneys, a
police officer and a postoffice.

7th. _General Rivera Colony._ It is situated in the Department of
Artigas, and has an extension of 4,987 hectares, over which they
cultivate tobacco, maize, _mani_ and _mandioca_; it counts now over a
hundred families.

8th. _Francisco Aguilar_ and _Francisco Dastre Colonies_. They are
situated in the Department of Maldonado. The executive power, in
the year 1883, ordered the necessary studies to be made for the
demarcation of the land where the Francisco Aguilar Colony was to be
established. Out of the 2,114 hectares which formed it, 1,359 were
destined to general cattle feeding ground, and 755 to ploughing. The
administration of the colony is intrusted to a directive commission.

In the year 1884 was established the Francisco Dastre Colony, in
which 368 hectares are destined to ploughing and 59 to cattle feeding.

9th. _Santa Teresa Colony._ Situated in the Department of Rocha and
founded on June 24th, 1885; it has 5,534 hectares, more or less.

10th. _Igualdad Colony._ It was founded in 1875, in the Department of
Minas. It has a church and a school.

11th. _Harriague_, _San Antonia_ and _Lavalleja Colonies_. In the
Department of Salto exist the colonies called, "Harriague," "San
Antonio," "Lavalleja," "Cosmopolita" and "Estrella" that have all
been founded a short time ago.

The Harriague colony has an area of 1860 square cuadras, or 1372
hectares. The principal culture is wheat and maize.

The San Antonio colony was founded by the government. The land was
divided into small _estancias_ or _chacras_, or farms of 20 cuadras,
more or less, each, that were given to some old servants of the state
and settlers and are now consecrated to the sowing of cereals.

The Lavalleja colony was founded in a field of government land, and
occupied by many native families. The government ordered the land to
be divided into _chacras_, every one of them being given to the first
settlers and some old servants as a reward for their services.

12th. _Paullier Colony._ In the department of San Jose is situated
the colony of Paullier Brothers, founded in the year 1883. Its
extension is 6,298 square cuadras or 4,647 hectares. In 1884 its
population was 400 inhabitants; now it may be calculated to be more
than 500. The quality of the soil cannot be better. The cheeses of
this colony are the best made in the country, and constitute an
important industry. The cows are all of good breed, and besides them
the colony possesses a large number of valuable animals imported
directly from Europe and bred and fed under shed.

13th. _Rio Negro Colony._ This colony is situated in the tenth
district of the department of Tacuarembo, between the Rio Negro and
the rivulets Cardozo and Cacique grande. It has a superficies of
38,216 square cuadras, (28,198 hectares, 8,602 metres), out of which
1,249 square cuadras, (921 hectares, 6,133 metres) form the district
of the village called "Teniente General M. Tajes"; the remaining part
is divided into 361 _chacras_ or farms.

The area of each _chacra_ varies from 29-1/2 to 88-1/2 hectares.

A third part of the _chacras_ are already occupied, and although
the colony is of a quite recent foundation the results obtained by
the settlers cannot be hoped to be better. The colony possesses
already six dairies. It is sure to become, very soon, one of the most
important agricultural settlements, on account of its good situation,
which permits the easy exporting of its products by the railway, not
only to the interior of the Republic but also to the very frontier of
Brazil.

The land is very good for plowing, on account, also, of its situation
and of the many rivers that run through it, and is quite fit for the
sowing of wheat and maize, and also for the culture of tobacco and
the grape vine.

The village "Maximo Tajes" that belongs to the same colony has a
railway station, a fruit market, a public square, a postoffice, a
police-office, and very soon they are going to build a church and a
school.

14th. _Antonio Crespo Colony._ It was founded in 1891 in the sixth
district of the department of Tacuarembo, in the place called
"Aldea," a league and a half distant from San Fructuoso.

15th. _Stajano Colony._ In the department of Durazno and at a short
distance of the so-called town, the capital of the department, was
recently founded a new colony, called "Stajano Colony." It has an
area of 7,378 hectares and between 300 and 400 inhabitants; all along
the river Yi it possesses many thick woods. The railway station is
only one kilometre distant from the town.

During these last two years, in all the rural districts devoted to
cattle feeding, they have everywhere begun preserving part of the
land for the culture of cereals, potatoes, etc. ... forages and trees
fit for cutting and burning. Thus the production of the land has
been increased still, and also the rural activity, preparing a total
transformation in the cattle feeding and general rural industry of
the country.

16th. _Piriapolis._ So as to give an idea of what the collective
capital can do and what results all undertakings may obtain, the
object of which is to foment agricultural industry and colonization,
something is to be said here of what has already been done by that
intelligent and indefatigable business man, Mr. Francisco Piria.

At a distance of some 140 kilometres from Montevideo, by land, and
50 miles by river, over a superficies of 1,992 hectares, among very
picturesque hills, watered by the River Plate and bounded northward
by the ridge of hills of Pan de Azucar, lies the new establishment
called _Piriapolis_, divided into two large fractions, one of which
is devoted to general culture and various industries, and the other
intended to be a bathing town, with its own port, a beautiful bay,
and a large, neat and secure harbor.

_Piriapolis_ was founded, at the most, two years ago, still it
already possesses a large building for the direction of the colony,
houses for two hundred workmen, 400 kilometres of land all surrounded
by iron wire fencing, many natural wells, and brick ovens. They have
also begun the drilling of many artesian wells.

The plantations are 80 hectares, planted with vines (the plants are 2
and 3 years old); three millions of vine-shoot of the best varieties;
a nursery with 200,000 olive trees; another nursery with a million
of plants, ash trees, maple trees, acacias, etc., ... 300,000 trees
to be planted next autumn in the streets and avenues of the bathing
town. Groves of eucalyptuses, acacias and other quick-growing trees
have already been planted all around the town, covering an extension
of 400 hectares.

Two hundred and sixty hectares have been sowed with wheat, beans,
French beans, Spanish beans, potatoes and other vegetables.

Great plantations of fruit trees have also been made, and the culture
of tobacco has been tried over 80 hectares.

Next year 50 houses more are going to be built, and also a church, a
school, a municipal house and a police office.

When all these works are concluded then will take place the solemn
inauguration of _Piriapolis_.

The soil in _Piriapolis_ is very good. The bed of _humus_ or arable
ground is 30 centim., and sometimes 1 met., 20 centim. deep. In
some parts there are beneath that bed of humus other large beds of
carbonate of lime, from one to two metres thick.

There are various springs of mineral waters, the properties of which
have been officially recognized.

Among the natural extractive riches of the colony, there are some
300 hectares of forests, the trees of which are between five and six
metres high. The cutting of trees has already begun, and a result may
be hoped of 6,000 carts of wood, that will give a liquid product of
$1.20 each cart.

There are also beautiful granite quarries, with pieces of stone some
metres high. The granite of _Piriapolis_ can be extracted and cut
very easily. Its price is hardly 20 per cent. of what it generally
costs in the other quarries. A contract has been recently made for
the purchase of 20,000 posts, 1^m 80 high, by 0^m 25 thick, at the
rate of 15c. each. The Directive Commission intends to work the
quarries on a great scale, and to establish the working of the stone.

Actually, in _Piriapolis port_, they have begun to build a quay, a
100 m. long. The depths of the bay varies between 4 and 7 fathoms, at
a distance of some 250 m. from the coast.

A road is already opened to public service. It is 30 m. broad and on
each side of it a double row of trees has been planted. This road
puts _Piriapolis_ in communication with the rest of the Department
of Maldonado, and will be useful for the trade and commerce of the
Department of Minas.

_Piriapolis_ is actually a reunion of farms and a territorial
speculation, which is called to foment the density of the population
and also the improvement of all kind of production; it divides the
land and gives it every day more value, making it every day more
productive by its agricultural industries, and also by the foundation
of that bathing town, which secures a great consumption of the
products, whilst at the same time the River Plate and the ocean
permit the easy exporting of the same.


The Grape-Vine in the Republic.

The culture of the vine is improving a great deal in the Republic
owing to the good results obtained by those, who some years ago,
tried the establishing of vine plots, which is now one of the most
important industries of the country and will soon be an inexhaustible
source of riches for the Republic.

Since a few years, great many people have consecrated important areas
of their lands to the establishing of vine-plots, and to-day the
extension of land covered with them is more than 2,000 hectares, the
greatest part of which are already producing.

Many societies have been created for fomenting that new industry,
among which we may mention the _Viticola Uruguaya_ with a capital of
$120,000 and the _Viticola Saltena_ with a capital $200,000.

The _Viticola Uruguaya_ counts with:


_Vine-Plots._

  17 hectares, with plants 5 years old, $3,500   $59,500.00
  51    "          "       3   "         1,500    76,500.00

  1,283 hectares, which have cost                $28,279.65
        Fencing                                    2,000.00


_Other Plantations._

  150,000 forest trees, 2, 3 and 4 years old
          at 10 cents each                       $15,000.00
    8,000 olive trees, in nurseries, 10 cents
          each                                       800.00
    2,000 fruit trees, 20 cents each                 400.00
          Various Plants                           1,000.00


_Materials for Construction._

  Existing materials                                $800.00


_Buildings and Cellars._

  Existing buildings and cellars                  $8,000.00
                                                ___________
                                                $197,079.65

Although the culture of the vine was introduced into the country
a great many years ago by Mr. F. Vidiella in the South, and Mr.
Harriague in the North, it may be said that it is only six years ago
since this culture has been really improved and spread with great
intensity all over the Republic.

The actual products of the best vine-plots may be calculated for each
vintage over 6,000 barrels, that is to say over 1,400,000 litres,
without counting the small vine-plots that, however, gives a fair
contingent for domestic consumption.

Owing to this production and also to the diminution in the
consumption on account of the crisis of 1890, an important diminution
is noted in the year 1891 in the importation of ordinary wines.

  Red and White Wines.    Litres.      Value.

  Imported in 1889      33,549,815   $4,173,917
     "        1890      29,327,420    3,632,490
     "        1891      21,483,614    2,634,547

After a few years more the importation of ordinary wines from France,
Spain and Italy will be reduced to nearly nothing.

A vine-plot, 30 hectares large and 14 years old, has given a liquid
product, free from all duties, of $20,000.

Therefore, owing to the advantages that the country presents for the
culture of the vine, and owing also to the vigorous impulse given
to that culture during the last few years, it may be said that the
day is not far remote in which the Uruguay fields will be covered
with vine-plots, producing all sorts of wines, not only for local
consumption, but also for exportation to Brazil and the Argentine
Republic.


Uruguay Rural Association.

Under this name there exists since the year 1871, in Montevideo,
an important institution dedicated to protecting the rural rights
and interests, and propagating all the sciences that may be useful
to agriculture, cattle-breeding and all other rural industries.
The Association is the editor of an interesting publication which,
with the same name as that of the society, is issued twice a month.
The members of the Association continually study all that may
be of interest for the progress and improvement of agriculture,
cattle-feeding and all rural industries; and their studies have been
extremely useful to the country.

Among the services rendered by the _Uruguay Rural Association_ may
be mentioned the compiling of the _Rural Code_, which is considered
now as one of the laws of the nation. This "Rural Code" entrusts to
the Association the rural administration of the country, and the
Government consults its members over all that concerns the rural
interests.

The Association possesses a large library with all the papers,
reviews and books concerning rural industries. Frequently some of
the members deliver lectures, which are afterwards published in the
_Review_.


Cattle.

The war which ended in the year 1851, and, on account of its
duration, was called the "Guerra Grande" (the great war), and the
siege of Montevideo during nine years, contributed in a notable way
to produce a diminution in the quantity of cattle and flocks which
existed before in the Republic.

The census one year after that war (1852) only gave as the number of
live stock 3,858,176, thus distributed: 1,888,622 cattle, 1,127,069
horses, 19,490 asses and mules, 796,289 sheep, 25,300 pigs, and 1,406
goats.

Eight years after (1860) when the second census was made, according
to the declarations made for the payment of the Direct Contribution,
there were 6,159,909 animals--that is to say: 3,632,203 cattle,
518,208 horses, 8,301 asses and mules, 1,939,929 sheep, 5,831 pigs,
and 5,437 goats.

In 1886, when the farmers had still to pay the tax, according to
the declarations, there were 23,967,263 animals--6,254,490 cattle,
17,245,977 sheep, 442,525 horses, 7,032 mules, 5,405 goats and 11,833
pigs.

These last figures, if compared with the former ones, prove an
increase of 2,301,733 animals, or 59.65 per cent. over 1852, in favor
of 1860; and of 20,109,087 animals, or 21.20 per cent. over 1852, in
favor of 1886.

This increase could produce itself, notwithstanding the great
quantity of animals killed every year for consumption, slaughter
of the _Saladeros_ and exportation of live stock, which represent
considerable quantities.

If we bear in mind the increase that corresponds to every kind
of live stock in these last years, and the quantities of animals
possessed by many thousands of inhabitants who do not pay any tax for
them, it may be said that the number of live stock and the value it
represents in the Republic is more or less, as follows:

  Cattle alone for breeding, and
      young bulls ($6.00 each)             8,000,000  $48,000,000
  Oxen ($15.00 each)                         690,000   10,350,000
  Horses ($6.00 each)                        599,000    3,594,000
  Asses and mules ($12.00 each)               11,000      132,000
  Sheep ($0.60 each)                      23,000,000   13,800,000
  Goats ($1.00 each)                          24,000       24,000
  Pigs ($6.00 each)                           23,000      138,000
                                          ----------   -----------
                         Animals          32,347,000   $73,038,000

If we distribute the 32,347,000 of live stock of all kinds over the
186,920 kilometres which is the total superficies of the Republic,
we find for each square kilometre 173.05 animals; if we distribute
them among the 708,168 inhabitants, we find that 45.67 animals of all
kinds correspond to each inhabitant.

As regards the value represented by live stock and corresponding to
each inhabitant, we find $103.13 for each.

The following table shows what place the Republic occupies among
other nations:

  ======================+=========+==========+========

The rather cruel experience acquired during the crisis of the year
1890, the effects of which are still to be felt, has opened new
ways to the economical activity of the country, and has given a new
impulse to all agricultural pursuits. Notwithstanding the scarcity
of capital and the difficulties of the ways of communication, the
cattle feeding has improved a great deal, with the sowing of hay and
pasture of all kinds, and with the crossing of the best varieties
cattle imported from Europa or bred in many important national farms.

The improvement of the varieties, in order to obtain better flesh,
fat, milk, butter, wool and hides, and the taming of all the native
animals, is absolutely necessary, and therefore is a powerful
attraction for those who would come over to this country and dedicate
themselves to cattle feeding and breeding, being sure, beforehand, of
getting good profits by exporting live animals and also dead animals,
by the frigorific system, to the Brazilian and European markets.

The last two years have not been very favorable to cattle industry;
but the present year shows itself as if going to be very propitious
to that industry, which is in such a perfect harmony with the
excellent qualities of our natural fields and meadows.

Here, no pest, no contagious disease is to be feared for the cattle.
The forage and water are wholesome, nutritive and pure; the climate
cannot be better.

With such conditions as these, it will be easily understood why
cattle industry gives a profit of more than 20 per cent. and why
it is generally a sufficient compensation to the scarce production
of the bad years produced by an excessive dryness or a transitory
diminution in the consumption of Brazil and Europe.


Slaughter in the Saladeros.

KILLING SEASON IN THE KILLING GROUNDS.

There exist various _saladeros_ or killing grounds in the Department
of Montevideo and along the coasts of the Uruguay. Some of them are
very important.

There they dry the flesh, prepare the _tasajo_ or dried meat, salt
the hides, burn the bones and elaborate extracts of meat.

To prove the importance of the _faena_ or killing season in those
establishments in the Republic of Uruguay, we give the following
comparative table:

A description of every one of the saladeros that exist in the
Republic cannot be given here, being so limited in the space to be
disposed of; however, it is necessary to make known the importance of
the great establishment for elaborating the extract of meat by the
Liebig system.

The establishment is situated on the coast of the River Uruguay, and
is known to be the first establishment of its kind, not only in the
River Plate, but also in all South America. The following lines will
give an idea of it.

Two kilometres southward from Villa Independencia, in Fray-Bentos,
Department of Rio Negro, is the great establishment of "_Liebig's
Extract of Meat Co._" which forms by itself an important center of
population.

It was founded in the year 1864 by M. Gibert. The first exportation
of 230 kilogs of extract of meat got to Antwerp in November of the
same year, and Baron Liebig declared that it surpassed all his hopes.
Soon over 918 kilogs were exported monthly. In the year 1866 the
Company was founded in London, and M. Gibert had all the machinery
made in Scotland for the establishment, which began working in May,
1868. All the world knows now the extract, and its use is everywhere
adopted, in the hospitals as well as in the barracks. At the Paris
Exhibition in 1867 the highest prizes were given to M. Gibert for his
_Extractum Carnis_, this extract being the only product out of 75,000
sent to the Exhibition rewarded with two gold medals. In Vienna
also in 1873 it won the great gold medal over all the other systems
employed in Australia and other countries. M. Gibert died in 1874.
The establishment has gone on as prosperous as ever.

It possesses great and valuable buildings with powerful steam engines
to put in motion the great machines destined to all the different
preparations. The _galpon_ or shed where the animals are skinned and
cut up is a first-class one and permits the killing of 1,000 animals
per diem. During the killing season of 1891 208,800 animals were
killed, and in 1892 156,200. The extract exported during the year
1890, represents, according to the customhouse statistics, 820,670
kilogs, and during 1891, 711,564, giving a value the first year of
$1,677,408, and the second year of $2,134,692.00

The establishment is provided with great platforms for the drying
of all the materials necessary to prepare the guano or artificial
manure, with spacious sheds and machinery for reducing the materials
to powder, and also another shed for the grinding of bones.

Over 7,500 tons of coal and 3,500 of salt are employed yearly.

The different works in the establishment employ more than 600
persons: and the population all around the establishment is of 2,500
souls.

It has good quays where ships of all draughts can come and be quickly
loaded by powerful steam-cranes.

It has a school where a good education is given to more than a
hundred children, the sons of the workingmen; it has also a social
club and a band, composed of the workmen.

It possesses also all the workhouses necessary for the good
preparation and packing of its products.

Many _suertes_ of land belong to this important association in the
place called "Rincon de las Gallinas," where more than 35,000 heads
of cattle feed.

The capital of the society is L500,000, divided into 25,000 shares,
out of which only 24,300 were issued, the putting out of the other
being quite unnecessary.

The shares, the primitive price of which was L20 in London are now
quoted more than double. (L42 or L44.) The dividend received by the
shareholders varies between 10 and 12 per cent.

This establishment gives life and activity to the important
commercial centre of "Villa Independencia" and is a great stimulus
for the cattle industry in the country.


Trade and Commerce.

The Republic has important commercial relations with all the
principal European and American markets.

Its commerce is represented by the variety of goods imported into the
country and the agricultural products and cattle exported to other
countries.

The imported goods are, according to the statistics, all sorts of
drinks, food and provisions, cereals and spices, stuffs of all kinds,
clothes, materials for industry, machines and many other goods that
cannot be classed here.

The principal exports of the country are salted meat, _tasajo_,
preserved meat, extracts of meat, tallow, horns, bones, hides, wools,
preserved and dried tongues, ostrich feathers, live stock, corn,
flour, wheat, canary seed, hay, oats, bran, barley, flax, vermicelli,
potatoes, stone, lime, granite, pavements, agate stone, etc., etc.

The following table gives an idea of the exports and imports of the
Republic from the year 1862 to the year 1891.

The trade and exterior commerce of the Republic in relation with
its population has always been superior to that of the Argentine
Republic and Chile.

The following table shows that out of the imported goods during the
year 1891, there correspond to each inhabitant $13.50 more than to
each inhabitant of the Argentine Republic, and $3.61 more than to
each inhabitant of Chile. It shows also that each inhabitant has
exported $10.19 more than each inhabitant of the first country, and
$14 more than each one of the second country.

The annual middle term of the commerce between this country and the
United States of America from the year 1887 to the year 1891 is, for
imports $2,014,267, and for exports $1,828,947; which proves a very
important commerce between both countries, representing an annual
value of $3,843,214 or $320,267, more or less, per month.

Money.

The coined money, imported and exported, has been during the last
five years:

  Years.      Import.          Export.

Navigation.

The general navigation movement in the various ports of the Republic
has become of great importance, owing to the commercial improvements
and to the exemption from taxes granted by national legislation.

The following table gives an idea of it:

  Years.   Ships.     Tonnage.

  1891     27,207    9,482,644

During the last two years a diminution is observed, owed
to the crisis and to the competition made by the Argentine
ports--competition which will disappear when the work undertaken
to improve Montevideo's port is complete, the project of which is
already studied.

During the year 1891 have entered the ports of the Republic:

                                             Tons.
  From abroad            1,092 ships, with 1,429,661

                                           4,742,260

The ships were:

                                       Tons.
   7,099 steamers, with              4,157,905
   6,571 sailing vessels, with         584,295
                                     ---------
  13,670 vessels, with               4,742,200

That is to say, 1,139 vessels with 395,183 tons per month, or 37
vessels with 13,006 tons per day.

As regards the nationality of the 13,670 vessels entered, there were
5,229 national vessels, with 460,467 tons, and 8,441 foreign vessels,
with 4,281,793 tons.

Of all the ports in the Republic Montevideo is the most important one.

During the year 1891 there entered:


_From Abroad._

                                  Tons.
    434 sailing vessels, with    275,184

Which gives a total of 4,033 vessels, with 2,732,309 tons, for the
year 1891.

Goods.

According to the statistics the goods moved in the harbor of
Montevideo during the last five years are calculated thus:


  1887           1,187,557
  1888           1,411,686
  1889           1,773,610

                 ---------
                 6,779,141

That is to say, a middle term of 1,355,828 tons moved per year, or
112,985 per month.


Lighthouses.

Along the coasts of the Republic, watered by the Atlantic Ocean and
the River Plate, there are eleven lighthouses, established in the
most convenient points, to guide and advise the sailors. To them must
be attributed the notable diminution in the number of shipwrecks.

Lazaretto.

The Republic possesses one Lazaretto, established in the Isle of
Flores, at a distance of 17 miles southeast from Montevideo.

It is quite comfortable and provided with everything that may be
required for disinfecting and fumigating luggage and correspondence.

There is a telegraph and telephone line established between
Montevideo and the Lazaretto.


Interior Commerce.

It has not yet been possible to calculate exactly and completely the
interior commerce of the Republic, between Montevideo and all the
other Departments. Statistics only give the figures representing the
cattle and rural products imported to Montevideo by the Departments
and that come by railway for local consumption and export.

This commerce gave, during the last five years, a total of 143,446
carts, that is to say a yearly middle term of 28,689.

There arrive daily to the Montevideo markets, by railroad and by
the rivers, great quantities of skins, (oxen, horses, sheep) wool,
horns, bones, tallow, ostrich feathers and other products of cattle
industry, and among rural products great quantities of corn, wheat,
flour, canary-seed, barley, mustard-seed, potatoes, garlick, French
beans, onions, pumpkins, eggs, butter, fowl, cheeses, paving and lime
stone, spirits and many other goods it would be too long to mention
here.

There is an important increase every year in the quantity of cattle
destined to local consumption, to the Montevideo saladeros and export.


Trade-Houses, Industries, Professions.

During the year 1891, 20,328 licenses were paid for by trade-houses,
industries, professions and work-houses. The nationality of those who
asked for their trade patent was:

  Natives             4,134
  Argentines            370
  Brazilians            166
  Italians            7,995

  Chilians               12
  Paraguayan             11
  Other Nations         262

Among the most important industries, must be mentioned: the Liebig
Extract of Meat Company, the _saladeros_ or killing grounds, the
spirits, wine and beer manufactures, flour mills, the starch and
vermicelli manufactures, the soap, suet and oil manufactures, the
gas, electric light and water companies, the match, brick, shoe and
wooden shoe manufactures, the tan-yards, saw-mills, etc., etc.

There are in Montevideo a great many important spirit, wine, brandy,
beer and match manufacturers; and there are sixteen of them in the
departments. The Montevideo manufacturers give an annual product of:

  Alcohol,        2,000,000 litres.
  Beer,           1,700,000    "
  Matches,           55,000 grosses.
  Wine and Spirits, 400,000 litres.

According to the declarations made for the payment of the license
tax, the capital represented by the trade houses, industries, etc, is
$89,329,539.

The clerks employed by all these houses, manufactures and industries,
were 11,639, and the workmen of various nationalities 16,621.

As a demonstration of the industrial importance and progress of the
country, among many other establishments, the description of which
cannot be made here for want of space, one may mention the great
brewery _Germania_, established under the direction of Engineer J. A.
Capurro.

It occupies a magnificent building situated in the "Playa Honda"
in front of the Montevideo Bay. Its construction and interior
distribution completely corresponds to all the technical necessities
required for beer manufacturing. It is provided for night working,
with electric light produced by a eight-horse dynamo and 68 lamps.

The establishment was built and is worked by a stock company.

It receives the waters of the River Santa Lucia, the very purest,
the same that is drank in the town. It possesses, nevertheless, two
immense filters, so as to make the water still purer.

The machinery comes from the renowned German manufacture of Chemnitz;
it is 25 horse-power, and can give from 18,000 to 20,000 litres per
day. The receiving depositories are two, the first one of a capacity
of 12,000 litres, and the second of 8,000 litres; the cooling
depositories can receive 9,000 litres every hour and a-half, with
a temperature that can go to 14 deg. under naught. The clarifying is
made by three filters of the most modern system, without any paper
application. The fermentation cellar contains three large tubs of a
capacity of 3,000 and 3,500 litres. There are also 6 great cellars,
for depositories, with 34 tubs each; 18 of them can contain 5,000
litres each and the other 16, 3,500 litres.

With a compressed air machine they cork 10,000 bottles a day.

The ice depositories are beautiful; they always remain at a
temperature of 12 or 20 deg. under nought.

The "_Germania_" also has many other depositories for the raw
materials, empty bottles and casks, another for 5,000 litre tubs,
brought on purpose from Germany; a forge, a workshop for cask-making,
ten carts and stables for 30 horses, and many offices.

It possesses a quay on the bay for loading and unloading and, during
the season of most activity, employs over a hundred workmen and
clerks.

This establishment represents a capital of over half a million
dollars.

During the season it sells over 200,000 litres per month to nearly
1,500 or 2,000 establishments.

The same society possesses also a starch and an alcohol manufactory.
They are very important establishments, provided with the very latest
inventions of European and North American manufacture.

In the same conditions are also the Richling and Niding Beer
Manufactories.


Banks, Anonymous Societies.

The Republic counts with a great many banks and anonymous societies,
that make easier all commercial transactions.

The emission banks are: The _London and River Plate Bank_, that on
December 31, 1891, had an active capital of $8,911,000; the _Italian
Uruguay Bank_, with an active capital of $7,714,521; the _Spain
and River Plate Bank_, with $4,614,752; the _Italo-Oriental_, with
$10,432,276, and the other banks called _National Bank_, _English
and River Plate Bank_, which actually are in liquidation, being the
active of the first bank, 31st December, 1890, $61,630,320, and that
of the second, $15,298,406.

Among the discounting banks, there are the _Commercial Bank_, the
_French Bank_, the _South America British Bank_, the _Anglo-Argentine
Bank_.

The principal anonymous societies are; The "Credito Real Uruguayo,"
the "Industrial," the "Cobranzas, locacion y Anticipos," the "Agencia
de Tierras," the "Colonization y Fomento del Uruguay," the "Caja
de Credito Uruguayo," the "Auxiliar de Credito y Alquileres,"
the "Co-operativa de Consumo," the "Caja Nacional Uruguaya," the
"Edificadora de Montevideo," the "Mercantil del Plata," the "Vegas
Uruguayas," the "Viticola Uruguaya," the "Viticola Saltena" and many
others that represent important capitals.


Commerce Halls.

In Montevideo there is the important commercial centre called "Bolsa
Montevideana," or Montevideo Exchange Hall. There are also the
French, the Italian and the Spanish Commercial Boards, that make
easier and easier the exchange of goods between the Republic and
France, Italy and Spain.


Means of Communication and Conveyance.

All the towns and villages of Uruguay littoral communicate with
the capital by the regular service of beautiful steamers between
Montevideo and Salto, stopping in all the ports of the Uruguay and
Argentine Republic littoral.

Other steamers start from Montevideo for Paraguay and Matto-Grosso
(Brazil.)

The lines of transatlantic steamers establish constant communications
between the Republic and European and American ports.

By land, a great many places in the Republic are put in communication
by the railways and by the telegraph, established also between
Montevideo and Europe, Brazil, the Pacific and Argentine Republic.

Where the railways are not yet established, there is a good and
regular service of stage-coaches.


Railways.

There are already seven railway lines in the Republic, the service
of which is quite regular and comprehends an extension of 1,567
kilometres.

Some other lines are in way of formation, and for some others the
necessary preliminary studies have begun, comprising a new extension
of 1,231 kilometres.

The railways already established are:

1st. _The Central Uruguay Railway._ It starts from Montevideo, runs
through the whole territory of the Republic, till it reaches the
capital of the Department of Rivera, on the very frontier of Brazil,
in front of "Santa Ana do Livramento," that is to say, with an
extension of 575 kilometres. Besides this, it has also another line
of 32 kilometres from "25 de Agosto" to "San Jose."

2d. _The Northeast Uruguay Railway_, between Montevideo and Minas,
with an extension of 122 kilometres.

3d. _The "East Extension" Railway_, between Toledo Station, which
belongs to the Northeast Uruguay Railway and Nico Perez, with an
extension of 206 kilometres.

4th. _The North Railway_, between Montevideo and Santa Lucia,
where are established the municipal slaughter houses. This railway
furnishes with meat all the Montevideo markets and has an extension
of 23 kilometres.

5th. _The Northwest Uruguay Railway_, from Salto to the River
Cuareim, through the Department of Artigas, with an extension of 178
kilometres. In "Paso del Correo," where this line stops, begins the
Brazilian Uruguayana Line.

6th. _The Midland Uruguay Railway_ joins with the Central Railway in
"Paso de los Toros" and with the Northwest Railway in the town of
Salto and has its principal station in Paysandu, with an extension of
317 kilometres.

7th. _The North Uruguay Railway_ between Isla Cabellos, which belongs
to the Northwest Line and San Eugenio in front of San Juan Bautista
(Brazil). It runs through the Department of Artigas and has an
extension of 114 kilometres.


River Steamers.

There exist many important navigation companies with beautiful and
comfortable steamers for the service of the River Plate, Uruguay and
Parana.

Among these companies the English company _Platense_ must be
mentioned. With its twenty steamers it represents an important
capital. It possesses its own docks and wharfs in this republic and
in the Argentine Republic. The principal steamers of the _Platense_
are called: _Venus_, _Eolo_, _Apolo_, _Minerva_, _Olimpo_, _Saturno_,
_Cosmos_ and _Helios_, the finest of all, recently constructed. All
these steamers have electric light on board. They all go to Buenos
Ayres and stop in Martin Garcia, Nueva Palmira, Mercedes, Fray
Bentos, Gualeguaychu, Concepcion del Uruguay, Paysandu, Villa Colon,
Guaviyu, Concordin, Salto and vice versa.

The steamers of the other companies have more or less the same
itinerary.

The movement of goods and passengers is important and has always
given good benefits to all the companies.

The journey between Montevideo and Buenos Ayres is of a few hours.
The steamers start from Montevideo at 6 p.m. and get to Buenos Ayres,
generally, at 4 next morning. The very same day, at 10 a.m. they
start again for the ports of the Uruguay; getting to Salto the next
day.


Stage Coaches.

In all the departments where railways are not yet established there
is a regular service of stage coaches putting the various railway
lines in communication and making easier the conveyance of goods and
passengers.


Tramways.

In Montevideo there are nine tramway lines: 1st Union and Maronas
Tramway; 2nd Paso del Molino and Cerro Tramway; 3rd Eastern Tramway;
4th Buceo and Union Tramway; 5th North Tramway; 6th Oriental Tramway;
7th Reducto Tramway; 8th Montevideo Tramway; 9th Central Tramway. In
nearly all the streets of Montevideo there is a tramway line and with
such a shortening of the distances life and activity are a great deal
increased.

In the centre of the town the tramway ticket costs 4 cents, and from
one extremity of the line to the other it costs 10 cents.

During the year 1891 all these tramways made 916,798 journeys, which
represent 9,285,940 kilometres, they conveyed 18,000,000 passengers.
They possess 507 coaches and 3,622 horses. The number of men employed
by the tramway companies is 1029. They have 14 stations.

In the town of Paysandu there is also a tramway line.


Telegraph.

The telegraph, as it may be seen on the map, is established all over
the Republic and in communication with all the towns of Europe and
America. The different telegraph companies are:

                                        Telegraph   Cable.

  The National Telegraph Co      kilom.    951        15

                                    "    5,373       914

There are two telegraph companies more between Salto and Concordia
and between Paysandu and Concepcion del Uruguay (Argentine Republic).
But they are of little importance.

The number of telegrams sent by the various companies was, in 1891,
256,467.


Navigation Companies.

Many European and American Companies have their agencies in
Montevideo. The principal ones are:

  Italian Company        _La Veloce._
  French Company         _Chargeurs Reunis._
  English Company        _Royal Mail Steam Packet Company._

Barcelona, Genoa, Naples, Dakar, Lisbon, Bourdeaux, Rio Janeiro,
Saint Vincent, Vigo, Bahia, Pernambuco, Marseilles, Havre, Santa Cruz
of Tenerif, Dunkirk, Plymouth, Liverpool, London, New Zealand and
also the ports of the Pacific Ocean and those of North America.


Telephone.

In many points of the Republic telephone lines are established.
The principal lines in Montevideo are: The Co-operative Co., the
Telefonica Nacional Co., the Telefonica de Montevideo Co.

During the year 1891 these lines have had 21,000 daily
communications. They have 3,600 subscribers and the wires they employ
represent 5,500 miles. They have 10 offices and employ 174 persons,
74 men and 100 women. The capital of each company is: The Telefonica
de Montevideo $220,000, the Telefonica Nacional $105,000, the
Telegrafica Telefonica del Plata Company has established a telephone
line between Montevideo and Buenos Ayres.


Postage.

The movement in the Postoffices of the Republic is greater every day,
owing to the continual improvement of the ways of communication.

The following table gives an idea of the movement in the Montevideo
Postoffice:

                 Letters,
  Years.       Papers, etc.

  1885,         12,203,381

  1887,         17,157,345
  1888,         20,171,929
  1889,         21,366,472
  1890,         21,534,209
  1891,         20,105,295

                             20,105,295


Carriages, Coaches, Etc.

The number of coaches is very considerable in the Republic.

Montevideo alone counts over 4,000 carts and more than 700 carriages.


Public Education.

Primary education is gratuitous and obligatory in all the Republic.

The public schools are at the expense of the State, that gives the
books and all the necessary materials.

Since the year 1877, in which was issued the law on public education,
the primary education has improved a great deal.

The reform of the primary schools was initiated in the year 1868 by
a private society, founded by the great reformer, Jose Pedro Varela,
the Horace Mann of Uruguay, under the name of "Friends of Popular
Education Society," which created an application school, called
"Elbio Fernandez," in honor of one of the founders of the society.
Various North American books and manuals were then translated for the
use of the schools and masters. Varela's ideas soon were diffused
among the people, and the reformer was appointed to a high situation
in the Public Instruction Board, in the year 1876. Immediately
he reformed all the official schools, and organized the scholar
administration, being himself appointed principal director of it,
with the title of "National Primary Instruction Inspector."


University.

The number of the students in the University of Montevideo during the
year 1891 was 668, distributed thus:

  For law,                   377
  For social sciences,       176
  For medicine,               85
  For mathematics,            30
                             ---
                             668

Out of those 668 students, 631 were natives and 37 foreigners.

The professors were 75: 14 for law and social sciences, 23 for
medicine, 19 for mathematics and 19 for the preparatory studies;
being 58 of them natives, 12 Spaniards, 3 Italians, 1 German and 1
Frenchman.


Public Schools.

In the year 1891 there were in the Republic 483 public schools; that
is to say, 143 more than in the year 1886.

The number of pupils was then for the whole Republic 43,676 (24,541
boys, 19,135 girls)--14,763 boys and girls in the capital, and 28,913
in the departments.

All the schools cost $690,574, the education of each pupil
representing a value of $13.27.

The professors were 863--272 men and 591 women.

Ninety-four schools were established in buildings belonging to the
National Educational Board and representing a value of $448,541,
and 11 of them in buildings belonging to the State, with a value of
$45,942.


Private Schools.

In 1891 there existed in the Republic 375 private schools, with
21,945 pupils and 930 professors (381 men and 549 women).

We obtain, therefore, the following result:

                       No.        Pupils.

Under this name there exists in Montevideo an important
establishment, the object of which is to improve and foment
the primary, secondary, superior, artistical and professional
instruction, not only in Montevideo but also throughout the whole
country. It has also founded an important college.


National Library.

During the 185 days in which that important establishment remained
opened, in the year 1891, the number of the readers have been 2,849.
The number of the books asked for was 2,698 and 64 manuscripts.

The library possesses over 21,000 volumes and 2,500 manuscripts, a

Although the State Religion is the Roman Catholic Apostolic Religion,
all the other religions are tolerated in the Republic owing to
the liberality of the laws and to the independent spirit of the

was owed for the guarantee to railways, and also what remained due of
the external debt service. The interest to be paid has been lessened
and definitely established at the rate of 3-1/2 per cent., and the
redemption by the outbidding system has been restored.

The internal consolidated debt has also been unified with an interest
of 4 per cent., and redeemable at the rate of 1 per per cent.,
accumulatively and by outbiddings.

The external consolidated debt (3-1/2 per cent.) is $90,710,000.

The internal unified debt (4 per cent.) is $7,500,000.

The international debts, according to treaties with Italy, France and
Spain, are $1,987,125.

All these debts that will be issued when these lines are published
will form, more or less, a total of $104,000,000, mortgage bank
warranty debt included.


Budget of Expenditure.[1]

  [1] Whilst the present monography is being printed the Deputy
  Chamber is studying a new project for the budget, the base of
  which is the project proposed for the financial year 1891-92,
  with a diminution of 10 per cent., which would allow the complete
  payment of the expenditure.

The financial year begins on the 1st of July and concludes on the
30th of June of the next year.

From the financial year of 1889-90 it has been the anterior budget
which has gone on ruling, with a general deduction of 10 per cent.,
and with some augments and changes in other parts of the budget.

A new budget for the financial year 1892-93 is going to be voted,
which will consist of the following amounts:

  _I.--Administration:_
    After a discount of 20 per cent. on
      the wages                                       $ 5,840,306.41
  _II.--House of Legislation_                             582,558.00
  _III.--Passive Classes:_
    That is to say, annual allowances paid
      to pensioners, civil and military,
      soldiers disabled by wounds or age,
      widows and sons of the 33 Orientals
      who assegurated the national independence
      in 1825, citizens who took
      part in the Independence wars,
      etc. After a discount between 4
      and 15 per cent                                   1,324,503.32
  _IV.--Public Debt and Guarantee to Railways_          5,724,620.24
  Various credits                                         144,394.52

of 25 grammes and 900 milles standard.

The other minor silver coins are: $0.50, $0.20, $0.10.

In all accounts, the limited quantity that can be paid in silver, is
determined by the law, according to the total amount.


Police.

The police under the care of the Political and Police Chief (jefe
politico y de policia) of each department and depending on the
Executive power employs a great many persons, the wages of which are
relatively very small. However, the police service goes on with a
perfect regularity in the capital and in the departments. The whole
police administration costs half a million to the state.


Army.

The organization of the Uruguayan army is perfect, as well in regard
to the discipline as in regard to the military tactics. They are
dressed as well as the best European soldier. They use the Remington
gun; but they are going to be provided with the reformed Mauser
gun. The artillery regiments have 67 Krup, Armstrong and Nordenfeld
cannons.

The army is composed of 23 chiefs, 202 officers and 3,425 soldiers,
forming 10 battalions, that is to say: 4 Hunters battalions, 1
artillery battalion, 4 cavalry battalions and 1 light artillery
battalion, besides which must be counted the general Artigas fort
garrison and the "Prague Nacional" or Arsenal detachment.

One Hunters Battalion and the four Cavalry ones serve as garrisons in
the departments. The other battalions remain in the capital.


Navy.

The national fleet is employed for coast and fort guarding. It is
composed of three large gun-boats and 6 small steamers. They all use
Remington guns; as for the cannons, they belong to various systems.


Montevideo, the Capital of the Republic.

The great maritime town of Montevideo, the capital of the Republic
and the so-called department, was founded in the year 1726 by the
Spanish marshal Don Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, with some Spanish
families, who came from Buenos Ayres and Canary Islands.

The town is built over a rocky peninsula, in the middle of the salt
waters of the River Plate, with a height of over 100 feet above the
sea.

It is actually divided into three large sections called the Antigua
(old) town, the Nueva (new) town and the Novisima (newest) town. All
around the town will run the great boulevard General Artigas. The
whole town consists in 1,600 _manzanas_ or square cuadras, more than
600 of which are already edificed; it must be added that every day
new buildings are begun everywhere about the town. In all directions
new streets are opened and new houses are built and new suburbs
created, making Montevideo larger and larger every day.

The streets are all straight and nearly all of them well paved with
granite stone. In the old town they are 10 and 11 metres wide and in
the new town 17 metres, with broad pavements and trees planted on
both sides.

The principal roads that lead to the town are broad, part of them
covered with a bed of macadam and the others with a bed of stones.

There are six public squares, called, Zabala, Constitucion,
Independencia, Libertad, Treinta y Tres, General Flores, and the
smaller ones called Solis and Muelle Viejo.

In all these squares there are trees and banks; they are lit with
electric light and the paths that surround them are made of the
finest granite.

Most of them are one manzana large, that is to say 7,378 square
metres. The square called Independencia is a parallelogram 221 metres
long by 232 metres broad with an area of 29,260 metres. In it is
situated the government palace. The boulevard called 18 de Julio is
the continuation of the Independencia Square, from W. to E., being 26
metres broad.

The common sewer has an extension of 93,000 metres and more than
7,500 are directly its conduits.

The drinkable water comes from Santa Lucia (61 kilometres from
Montevideo); the various conduits have an extension of over 180
kilometres.

All the streets and even the suburbs have the electric light; some
others have still the gas light.

Three gasometres, two of them 100,000 cubic feet and one 70,000, are
employed for the preparation of the gas. The gas pipes represent an
extension of 128 kilometres. The power of each light is equivalent to
that of 18 candles.

There are two important establishments for the preparation of the
electric light, which is now used by a great many trade houses and
shops.

The town is composed of over 19,000 houses--20 per cent. of them
being houses with two stories; a good many of them have three and
four stories. The architecture of the houses is most elegant,
especially of those which were built during the last fifteen years.

Among the public buildings remarkable for their importance are: the
Cathedral, the Charity Hospital, the Insane Asylum, the Central
Cemetery, Solis Theater, Normal School, Government Palace, Parliament
House, Custom House, Professional School, National Bank, San Felipe
and Cibils Theatres, London Bank, South America British Bank, Uruguay
Club, Gas Works, Prison, San Francisco, Capuchin Friars, Concepcion
and Carmen Churches, Orphan Asylum, Seminary, English Church, Music
Academy, Oriental Hotel, Gounouilhou Baths, etc.

The suburbs and environs are most picturesque, with a great quantity
of the most elegant country houses, built all along the avenues
called Agraciada, Paso del Molino, Duranas, Miguelete, Sierra, Goes,
Suarez, Larranaga and many others.

Being the capital of the Republic, Montevideo is the residence of the
three high powers of the state, of the aggregate of foreign ministers
and consuls and also of the bishop. It is the centre of all the
most important business of the Republic and reputed one of the best
markets in the River Plate.

In Montevideo reside all the principal Societies and Associations in
the Republic.

The aspect of the town is agreeable and quite that of a European
city, and its population is quite a cosmopolitan one.

The census of the year 1891, Dec. 31, gave a result of 234,688 souls
for the department of Montevideo, 190,000 more or less belonging
exclusively to Montevideo, and 53 per cent. of them being natives and
47 per cent. foreigners.

All the most important trade-houses are in Montevideo, the largest
and finest hotels; there are three theatres, fifteen churches and
nine chapels, three cemeteries and three markets, etc.

During the bathing season a great many foreigners come to Montevideo,
owing to its fine shore and beautiful bathing establishments, like
the one called Los Pocitos, where exists a beautiful and elegant
building for the foreigners, and those called Romirez and Capurro.

Custom-House.

The Montevideo custom-house produces the principal revenue the public
treasury counts with. The other custom-houses all over the littoral
and in the Brazilian frontiers are comparatively a great deal less
important.

Imports have to pay general duties _ad valorem_, which vary between 8
and 51 per cent., and also specific duties, such as for wine, brandy,
tobacco, rice, sugar, petroleum, olive oil, beer, matches, etc.

There is a law regulating these specific duties.

According to the law of the year 1888 all national products were free
from duty; but in the year 1890 a new law restored the specific duty.

Corn, wheat, flour and lucerne pay also the specific duty.

Since the year 1888 many modifications have been introduced in the
custom duties laws, in order to increase the revenue and also to
protect national industry.

Besides the duties _ad valorem_ there is also an additional duty of 5
per cent.

Historical Sketch.

(A COMPILATION.)

Four years after the River Plate was discovered by Juan Diaz de
Solis, Hernando de Magallanes, following the same route as the
former, went up the River Plate and discovered part of the rivers
Uruguay, Guazu and Parana. But as he could not find the channel,
which, he thought, ought to lead him to the East Indies, he soon came
back and sailed southward, discovering afterwards the strait.

In the year 1527, Sebastian Gaboto who had travelled over the Rivers
Uruguay, Parana and Paraguay, built the first fort on the coast of
the River San Salvador at a short distance from the Uruguay, so as to
defend himself against the Indians who peopled the territory that now
belongs to the Republic.

Then began the first essays of colonization made by the Spaniards,
notwithstanding all kinds of difficulties and fights against the
Indians who, with great constance and heroism, went on defending the
land that was theirs.

In the year 1550, Irala sends from the Asuncion a few people over to
the Oriental territory; and the first settlement is there founded, on
the banks of the river San Juan, with the name of San Juan Bautista.
Two years after the settlers gave up the place and went away, on
account of the increasing attacks of the Indians which they could not
resist.

In the year 1574, Zarate had a new fort built in the very same place
where Gaboto in 1527 had already built one and gave it the name of
San Salvador. Two years later, the settlers had to go away for want
of resources and on account of the continuous wars with the natives.

In the year 1624, Fray Bernardo de Guzman began founding a new
settlement, the most ancient one in the Republic, called Santo
Domingo de Soriano, two leagues distant from the mouth of the Black
River, Rio Negro.

In 1680 was founded Colonia del Sacramento, by Don Manuel de Lobo,
the governor of Janeiro.

In 1724 the field-marshal, Don Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, founded the
town of Montevideo.

From that time many more towns and important settlements went on
being founded. In 1762, Villa de San Carlos, in 1763, the town of
Maldonado, in 1778, Villa de San Juan Bautista, now Santa Lucia,
1782, the settlement of Paysandu, in 1783, Minas and in 1793, Rocha.

Early in the nineteenth century, the question of dominion was finally
settled in favor of the Spaniards; and in the mean time, in spite of
wars, the Banda Oriental was being peopled and civilization continued
to advance. In the central districts, as well as on the coasts of
the Atlantic and of the large rivers, the Spaniards had founded many
small towns and ports, the most important of which was Montevideo.

In the early days of the Spanish settlements in these regions, the
whole of the River Plate district was included in the Viceroyalty
of Peru. Subsequently a separate viceroyalty was created in Buenos
Ayres and the Banda Oriental, which had been subject to the Colonial
Government of Paraguay, was transferred to that of Buenos Ayres. At
the beginning of the century, Montevideo was ruled by a military and
political governor appointed by the Crown of Spain. Since the year
1730, Montevideo had a _Cabildo_ or Municipality.

Soriano, Maldonado, Colonia and other places were subject to
military commands and also had their own cabildos. The population
of Montevideo was then about 15,000 inhabitants; the same number of
people existed in the interior of the province.

At the beginning of the century Montevideo already possessed a
gratuitous school, paid by private persons, and also primary schools,
under the care of friars of the Order of St. Francis; it had a
comedy hall, had finished giving names to all its streets, and
established the light service in the principal ones; and its cabildo
or municipality, listening to the proposals made by the Governor
Bustamante y Guerra, was already thinking of providing the town
with a good hygiene service, with pavement, with causeways, with a
regular drinkable water service, with a public washing place, with
a complete service for the cleaning and conservation of the port,
with the building of bridges over the Miguelete, Paso del Molino and
Arroyo Seco, designing for the public municipal service the amount
of $47,600, which would be taken from the product of the cattle
outbidding sales for the slaughterhouses during the years 5th and 6th.

Undoubtedly the administration of the Governors Bustamante y Guerra
and Ruiz Huidobio was an era of prosperity for Montevideo (1797 to
1807). Uruguay had lived under despotism until those governors came
and raised it to the very rank it deserved by its topographical
position and natural riches.

Such was the situation of Montevideo when took place the English
invasions in the River Plate.

On the 27th of June, 1806, Buenos Ayres fell to the power of the
expedition commanded by Berresford and Popham.

Montevideo, with all its war elements and all the popular elements
enrolled in the very moment, succeeded in reconquering Buenos Ayres.
The first English invasion was repelled. A new attack of the English
gave as a result the taking of Montevideo after a furious fight on
the 3d of February, 1807.

Seven months later the English had to withdraw from Montevideo after
the defeat suffered in Buenos Ayres by General Whitelock, who, on
capitulating, had to surrender Montevideo and all other places
occupied by his troops.

On the 25th of May, 1810, the people in Buenos Ayres gave the
first decisive step for the conquering of the independence of this
continent.

The Governor and Municipality of Montevideo did not join then the
movement.

The Junta or Revolutionary Committee, established in Buenos Ayres,
sends regular troops to the Banda Oriental. General Don Jose G.
Artigas commands the Oriental troops.

After various encounters and fights that were all favorable to the
Revolution, the Spanish power was forever destroyed in the River
Plate, on the 23d of June, 1814.

General Artigas does all he can that the Banda Oriental be one of the
confederate provinces among the united ones of the River Plate. There
occur some difficulties and the general government is obliged to
surrender Montevideo, and the troops retire on the 23d of February,
1815.

The Portuguese, who greedily sought after possessing this territory,
invades it then with a powerful army. Fortune is first favorable
to them; and, on the 20th of January, 1817, General Lecor takes
possession of Montevideo and other places, giving to the Banda
Oriental the name of Cisplatine State (Estado Cisplatino).

The Brazilians part from the crown of Portugal, and after they have
declared themselves independent the new Cisplatine state becomes a
dependence of the Brazilian empire, the troops of which enter into
Montevideo on the 28th of February, 1824, and take possession of the
whole land.

Some emigrated Orientals, residing in Buenos Ayres, do all that they
possibly can so as to conquer again their independence and native
country.

They join the few elements they can dispose of and on the 19th of
April, 1825, thirty-three fearless patriots, under the command of
the Oriental General D. Juan Antonio Lavalleja, tread the shore of
the Agraciada, near Nueva Palmira, and with the device, "_Libertad o
Muerte_" (Liberty or Death), written on the national flag, begin the
heroic campaign--the liberating expedition to which the whole country
joins.

The first encounters were favorable to the Oriental arms. General
Lavalleja convokes the people for the electing of Deputies, and in
the Villa de la Florida establishes itself the Deputy Chamber, which,
on the 25th of August, 1825, sanctions--giving the strength of a
law--the Declaration of the Independence of the River Plate Oriental
Province.

The Brazilians complain to the Argentine government on account of the
decided protection it had given to the Oriental Revolution, and a war
ensues between both nations that obliges the Argentines to send an
auxiliary army to this territory.

The struggle went on, being a series of victories for the united
republican arms: the Imperial power was defeated, the last encounter,
that put that memorable campaign to an end, taking place in Bacacay.
Negotiations of peace were undertaken, and on the 27th of August,
1828, the preliminary treaty was signed, by which the Oriental
Province of Uruguay was declared sovereign and independent.

A provisional government was appointed and, after the country had
recovered peace and quiet, a constituent and legislative Assembly was
elected which compiled and published the Constitution that nowadays
is still ruling, and that was solemnly sworn amid the greatest
popular joy on the 18th of July, 1830.

It was at this period that a man rose into note in the Argentine
Confederation who was destined to exercise an overshadowing and
pernicious influence on both sides of the River Plate. In 1829 Don
Juan Manuel Rosas became Governor of Buenos Ayres. Possessed of
great capacity he maintained tranquility in his native province and
extended his sway over the neighboring states of the Confederation;
but his system of government was despotic, and his rule was for some
years one of sanguinary terror. His intervention in the intestine
quarrels of the Republic of Uruguay, and his attempt to close the
River Parana to foreign vessels, led him into hostilities with
England and France, whose joint naval squadrons protected Montevideo
from his attacks by sea, whilst his troops and their Oriental allies,
under General Oribe, besieged the city. The siege of Montevideo by
the _Blancos_ or _Whites_, as the Oriental partizans of Oribe were
called, continued for nine years, and for that period, from 1843 to
1851, the history of the Republic of Uruguay is the history of the
defence of Montevideo.

The defence concluded with a treaty of peace on the 8th of October,
1851, in which it was declared that there were neither conquered or
conquerors.

On the 3rd of February in the following year, Rosas himself was
completely overthrown at Monte Caseros, near Buenos Ayres, by the
combined forces of Brazil, Oriental Republic and the Argentines in
revolt under the governor of Entre Rios General Justo Jose Urquiza,
the commander-in-chief of the allied army. From that date, when the
normal intercourse of Montevideo with Buenos Ayres and the riverain
ports of the Uruguay and Parana, as well as with the interior of
the Republic itself and with Brazil, was resumed, the Oriental
Republic may be said to have recommenced its national existence.
Whilst her material progress has continued with little intermission,
her political history during the last thirty or forty years has
been again chequered by many internal troubles and domestic events,
one too recent, the others too insignificant to be included in
the present historical sketch. But the old parties, _Blanco_ and
_Colorado_, have long since been transformed; and at the same time
that new rivalries and new parties were coming out, the hatreds and
exclusive passions of the ancient times have all disappeared; the
constant communication with Europe, and the general influence of a
newer education and of different ideas is permeating all classes
in the capital, and gradually extending to the rural districts,
where foreigners are introducing the habits and industrial methods
of European countries: all which, owing to the national culture
and civilization permits to count for the future with a complete
stability in the institutions and government of the country, this
stability being the strongest wish of all the parties, whilst it is
also the best and most solid warranty of the progress and increase of
the Oriental Republic of Uruguay.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
