Notes.

ENGLISH BOOKS OF EMBLEMS.

It is a remarkable circumstance that whilst the emblems of Alciatus Vent
through almost innumerable editions, and were translated into most of the
continental languages, no version of these Emblems should ever have been
printed in this country, although we believe that MS. translations of them
are in existence. It is remarkable also that more than half century should
have elapsed after their appearance, before any English publication on this
subject should have been committed to the press. Our English authors of
Books of Emblems were not only late in their appearance, but are few in
number, and in their embellishments not very original, the plates being for
the most part mere copies of those already published abroad by Herman Hugo,
Rollenhagius, and others. The notices of the English writers on this
entertaining subject are also but meagre and imperfect, and restricted to a
very few works; both Dibdin, in his slight and rapid sketch on Books of
Emblems in the _Bibliogr. Decam._, vol. i. p. 254., and the writer in the
_Retrosp. Rev._, vol. ix. p. 123., having confined their remarks to some
one or two of the leading writers only, Arwaker, Peacham, Quarles, Whitney,
and Wither. With the exception of an occasional article in the _Bibl. Ang.
Poet._, _Cens. Liter. Restituta_, and similar bibliographical volumes, we
are not aware that any other notice has been taken of this particular
branch of our literature[1], nor does there exist, {470} that we know of,
any complete, separate, and distinct catalogue of such works.

Being anxious, therefore, to obtain a correct account of what may be termed
the English Series of Books of Emblems, I inclose a list of all those in my
own possession, and of the titles of such others as I have been able to
collect; and I shall be glad if any of your readers can make any additions
to the series, confining them at the same time strictly to Books of
Emblems, and not admitting fables, heraldic works, or older publications
not coming within the same category. A good comprehensive work on this
subject of Books of Emblems, not confined merely to the English series, but
embracing the whole foreign range, giving an account both of the writers of
the verses, and also of the engravers, and the different styles of art in
each, is still a great desideratum in our literary history; and if ably and
artistically done, with suitable illustrations of the various engravings
and other ornaments, would form a very interesting, instructive, and
entertaining volume; and I sincerely hope that the time will not be far
distant when such a volume will be found in our libraries.

I conclude with a Query of inquiry, whether anything is known of the
present resting-place of a _Treatise on Emblems_, which the late Mr. Beloe
informs us, at the close of his _Literary Anecdotes_, vol. vi. p. 406., he
had written at "considerable length," from communications furnished him by
the Marquis of Blandford, whose collection of Emblems was at that time one
of the richest and most extensive in the kingdom, and whose treatise, if
published, might perhaps prove a valuable addition to our information on
this portion of our literature.

I would also inquire who was Thomas Combe, and what did he write, who is
thus mentioned by Meres in his _Palladis Tamia: Wits Treasury_, Lond. 1598,
8vo., as one of our English writers of Emblems: "As the Latines have those
emblematists, Andreas Alciatus, Reusnerus, and Sambucus, so we have these,
Geffrey Whitney, Andrew Willet, and _Thomas Combe_." Is anything known of
the latter, or of his writings?

[Footnote 1: We must exempt from this sweeping assertion a very interesting
and well-written account of works on this subject, entitled "A Sketch of
that Branch of Literature called Books of Emblems, as it flourished during
the 16th and 17th centuries, by Joseph Brooks Yates, Esq., F.S.A.," of West
Dingle, near Liverpool, the friend of Roscoe, and the worthy and
intelligent President of the Literary and Philosophical Society of
Liverpool, read at their meetings, and of which two parts have already been
printed in their volumes of _Proceedings_. This "Sketch" only requires to
be enlarged and completed, with specimens added of the different styles of
the engravings, to render it everything that is to be desired on the
subject.]

[Footnote 2: Perhaps this, and the works of Colman and Heywood, are
scarcely to be considered as _Books of Emblems_.]

AUTHOR OF TRACT ON "ADVANTAGES OF THE EAST INDIA TRADE, 1720, 8vo."

Of this pamphlet, originally published in 1701, 8vo., under the title of
_Considerations upon the East India Trade_, and afterwards in 1720, 8vo.,
with a new title-page, _The Advantages of the East India Trade to England
considered_, containing {472} 128 pages, inclusive of Preface, the author
never yet been ascertained.

Mr. M^cCulloch accords to it, and very deservedly, the highest praise. He
styles it (_Literature of Political Economy_, p. 100.) "a profound, able,
and most ingenious tract;" and observes that he has "set the powerful
influence of the division of labour in the most striking point of view, and
has illustrated it with a skill and felicity which even Smith has not
surpassed, but by which he most probably profited." Addison's admirable
paper in _The Spectator_ (No. 69.) on the advantages of commerce, is only
an expansion of some of the paragraphs in this pamphlet. In some parts I
think he has scarcely equalled the force of his original. Take, for
instance, the following sentences, which admit of fair comparison:

    "We taste the spices of Arabia, yet never feel the scorching sun which
    brings them forth; we shine in silks which our hands have never
    wrought; we drink of vineyards which we never planted; the treasures of
    those mines are ours which we have never digged; we only plough the
    deep, and reap the harvest of every country in the world."--_Advantages
    of East India Trade_, p. 59.

    "Whilst we enjoy the remotest products of the north and south, we are
    free from those extremities of weather which give them birth; our eyes
    are refreshed with the green fields of Britain, at the same time that
    our palates are feasted with fruits that rise between the
    tropics."--_Spectator_, No. 69.

Mr. M^cCulloch makes no conjecture as to the probable author of this very
able tract; but it appears to me that it may on good grounds be ascribed to
Henry Martyn, who afterwards--not certainly in accordance with the
enlightened principles he lays down in this pamphlet--took an active part
in opposing the treaty of commerce with France, and was rewarded by the
appointment of Inspector-General of the exports and imports of the customs.
(See an account of him in Ward's _Lives of Gresham Professors_, p. 332.) He
was a contributor to _The Spectator_, and Nos. 180. 200. and 232. have been
attributed to him; and the matter of Sir Andrew Freeport's speculations
appears to have been furnished by him as Addison and Steele's oracle on
trade and commerce. It will be seen that in No. 232. he makes exactly the
same use of Sir William Petty's example of the watch as is done in the
tract (p.69.), and the coincidence seems to point out one common author of
both compositions. But, without placing too much stress on this similarity,
I find, that Collins's _Catalogue_, which was compiled with great care, and
where it mentions the authors of anonymous works may always be relied upon,
attributes this tract to Martyn (Collins's _Cat_. 1730-1, 8vo., Part I.,
No. 3130.). I have a copy of the edition of 1701, in the original binding
and lettering--lettered "Martyn on the East India Trade "--and copies of
the edition of 1720 in two separate collections of tracts; one of which
belonged to A. Chamier, and the other to George Chalmers; in both of which
the name of Martyn is written as its author on the title-page, and in the
latter in Chalmers's handwriting. I think therefore we may conclude that
this tract, which well deserves being more generally known than it is at
present, was written by Henry Martyn.

"AKE" AND ACHE.

John Kemble, it is well known, maintained that the latter was the mode of
pronouncing this word in Shakspeare's days. He was right, and he was wrong;
for, as I shall show, both modes prevailed, at least in poetry, till the
end of the seventeenth century. So it was with some other words, _show_ and
_shew_, for instance. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to observe that the
sounds _k, ch, sh, kh_ (guttural) are commutable. Thus the letter _h_ is
named in Italian, _acca_; in French, _ache_, in English, _aitch_, perhaps
originally _atch_: our _church_ is the Scottish _kirk_, &c. Accordingly, we
meet in Shakspeare _reckless_ and _rechless_, _reeky_ and _reechy_; "As I
could _pike_ (pitch) my lance." (Coriol., Act I. Sc. 1.) Hall has (_Sat_.
vi. 1.) "Lucan _streaked_ (stretched) on his marble bed." So also there
were _like_ and _liche_, and the vulgar _cham_ for _I am_ (_Ic eom_, A.-S.)

Having now to show that both _ake_ and _ache_ were in use, I commence with
the former:

 "Like a milch-doe, whose swelling dugs do _ake_,
  Hasting to find her fawn hid in some brake."
              Shakspeare's _Venus and Adonis_

 "By turns now half asleep, now half awake,
  My wounds began to smart, my hurt to _ake_."

INEDITED LETTER.

Dear S^r,

I heartily thank you for the favour of your letter, and to shew itt will
not fail to write as often as anything does occurr worth sending, if you
think the accountt I give not troublesome. Dr. Adams, Dr. Rudston, and
Delaune have promis'd to write this post: we remembred you both before and
after your letters came w^{th} S^r John Matthews, who staid here 3 nights
this weeke. Our militia is gone home cloath'd in Blew coates but many
coxcombs of this city have refused to pay their quota towards the buying of
them, railing against my L^d Abington, who has smooth'd the mob by giving a
brace of Bucks last Friday in Port Meed. J. M. has bin expected here this
fortnight: the Lady that calls herselfe by his nane has bin a good while at
Astrop, and has discover'd her displeasure there, that her husband as shee
calls him keeps the coach so long from her at Oxford: upon hearing of
w^{ch} S^r W. H. in a blunt way gave her the old name, w^{ch} caus'd some
dissatisfaction and left her smal acquaintance: I heare that the
understanding between our Friend and his uncle is not so good as formerly,
but I do not think it will end in Abdication. Mr. Painter is admitted
Rector of Exeter. The _Naked Gospel_[3] was burnt on y^e 19th in the
Scholes Quadrangle. The Regents first drew up a Petition to have it
censured; then some others more busy than wise tooke upon them to gett it
subscribed, and went to coffee houses and taverns as well as colleges for
that purpose: these proceedings being ag^{st} statute, and reflecting upon
the vice ch., gave great offence; at last he call'd a meeting of y^e {474}
heads of houses, who deputed 6 to examine it: they pick'd several Proposit.
w^{ch} were read. The sentence was in this form: Propositions &^c tanqu[=a]
falsas et impias in Chris. Relig. et in Ecc. praecipue Anglican[=a]
contumeliosas damnamus, plerasq; insuper haereticas esse decernimus et
declaramus, &^c. This was first subscribed by all y^e heads of Coll. and
then condemn'd unanimously in a full convocation. The Decree is printed,
but is too large to send. The Author of y^e Booke has sent about a soft
vindication of himselfe, that he is unwilling to be accounted a Socinian,
&c. If I can gett a sight of it I will send you the contents. I do not know
how far you are in the right about guessing at a Bursar: Tim. seems
resolv'd to act according to y^e song; but I to shew good nature even
w^{th}out a tree have promis'd to make him a Dial: and when that's done I
will doe y^e like at Astrop. I am

Your very humble serv^t,
W. R.

If you see Coll. Byerly, give my service to him.

Directed thus: These to George Clark, Esq., Secretary of War in Ireland.

By y^e way of London.

A SHAKSPERIAN BOOK.

"There exists," says Mr. John Wilson, "as it were a talismanic influence in
regard to the most trivial circumstances connected with Shakspeare," and
yet this enthusiast has not, in his _Shaksperiana_, alluded to the dramatic
works of Mary Hornby, written under, and dated from, the _dear_ old roof at
Stratford-upon-Avon!

It was my late good fortune, after filling my pockets from the twopenny
boxes of the suburban bookstalls, to find, on turning out the heterogeneous
contents, that I had accidentally become possessed of _The Broken Vow_, a
comedy by the aforesaid lady, who waits to be enrolled in that much wanted
book, a new edition of the _Biographia Dramatica_. This _Broken Bow_ which
looks like a re-cooking of the _Merry Miller_ of Thomas Sadler, 1766, bears
to be "printed at Stratford-upon-Avon, for the Author, by W. Barnacle,
1820." Mary Hornby, following the example of the _preoccupier of the
butcher's shop_, tries her hand at both tragedy and comedy; in the first
line she stands charged with the perpetration of _The Battle of Waterloo_,
which, I doubt not, rivalled its original enactment in its _sanguinary_
character. I have not been lucky enough to fall in with this, which was a
_hit_; our fair authoress, in her preface to the comedy under notice,
modestly attributing its great success more to the kindness of her friends
than to its literary merit.

Mrs. Hornby sustains the dignity of the drama by adhering to her five acts,
with prologue and epilogue according to prescription. Looking to the
prologue for the _who_, the _why_, and the _wherefore_, I am sorry to say I
find no materials for the concoction of a biographical note; upon the
second point, the _why_, she tells us:

 "When women teem, be it with bad or good,
  They must bring forth--forsooth 'tis right they should,
  But to produce a bantling of the brain,
  Hard is the task, and oft the labour vain."

That her literary _accouchement_ should not be a failure, she further says:

 "Lord, how I've bother'd all the gods and graces,
  Who patronize _some_ mortals, in such cases."

I take the expressive use of the word "some" here to indicate her
predecessor, the ancient occupier of the tenement, who certainly was a
_protege_ of the said parties.

Mrs. Hornby then goes on to relate how that during her _gestation_ she
invoked Apollo, Thalia, and Erato:

 "Soon they arrived, with Hermes at their side,
  By Jove commission'd, as their friend and guide.
  But when the mirth-inspiring dames stepp'd o'er
  The sacred threshold of _great Shakspeare's door_,
  The heav'nly guests, _who came to laugh with me_,
  Oppress'd with grief, wept with _Melpomene_;
  Bow'd pensive o'er the Bard of Nature's tomb,
  Dropt a sad tear, then left me to my doom!"

I leave the reader to judge for himself whether the Muses really "came to
laugh" with Mary Hornby, or whether, under the belief of the immortality of
our Bard, they did not rather expect a pleasant _soiree_ with Gentle Will,
and naturally enough went off in a huff when they found themselves
inveigled into a tea-party at Mrs. Hornby's.

Mr. Wilson, in the work above quoted, does condescend to notice Mrs.
Hornby,--

    "Who rented the butcher's shop under the chamber in which the poet was
    born, and kept the _Shaksperian Album_, an interesting record of the
    visitors to that shrine. Some of the subscribers having given vent to
    original stanzas suggested by the scene, those effusions," continues
    the lofty bookseller, "_the female in question_ caused to be inscribed
    and printed in a small pamphlet, which she sells to strangers."

Not a word, you will see, about the poet's mantle having descended upon the
shoulders of our Mary,--which was unpolite of him, seeing that both the
tragedy and comedy had the precedence of his book by some years. Not having
before me the later history of Shakspeare's house, I am unable to say
whether our subject deserved more consideration and gallant treatment at
the hands of MR. COLLIER, when he and his colleagues came into possession.

Minor Notes.

_Shakspeare's Monument._--When I was a young man, some thirty or forty
years ago, I visited the monument of Shakspeare, in the beautiful church of
Stratford-upon-Avon, and there copied, from the Album which is kept for the
names of visitors, the following lines:

 "Stranger! to whom this monument is shown,
  Invoke the poet's curse upon Malone!
  Whose meddling zeal his barbarous taste displays,
  And smears his tombstone, as he marr'd his plays.
                                  R. F.
  Oct. 2, 1810."

This has just now been brought to my mind by reading, in page 155. of the
second volume of Moore's Journal, the following account of a conversation
at Bowood:

    "Talked of Malone--a dull man--his whitewashing the statue of
    Shakspeare, at Leamington or Stratford (?), and General Fitzpatrick's
    (Lord L.'s uncle) epigram on the subject--very good--

     'And smears his statue as he mars his lays.'"

I cannot but observe that the doubt expressed in the Diary of
Moore--whether Shakspeare's monument is "at Leamington or Stratford
(?)"--is curious, and I conceive my version of the last line, besides being
more correct, is also more pithy. It is incorrect, moreover, to call it a
_statue_, as it is a three-quarters bust in a niche in the wall.

The extract from _Moore's Diary_, however, satisfactorily explains the
initials "R. F.," which have hitherto puzzled me.

WALMER CASTLE.

In Hasted's _History of Kent_, vol. iv. p. 172., folio edition, we have as
follows:

    "Walmer, probably so called _quasi vallum maris_, i. e. the wall or
    fortification made against the sea, was expressed to have been a member
    of the port of Sandwich time out of mind," &c.

Again, p. 165., note _m_, we find:

    "Before these three castles were built, there were, between Deal and
    Walmer Castle, two eminences of earth, called 'The Great and Little
    Bulwark;' and another, between the north end of Deal and Sandwich
    Castle (all of which are now remaining): and there was probably one
    about the middle of the town, and others on the spots where the castles
    were erected. They had embrasures for guns, and together formed a
    defensive line of batteries along that part of the coast," &c.

To the new building of these castles Leland alludes, in his _Cygnea
Cantio_:

 "Jactat Dela novas celebris arces
  Notus Caesareis locus trophaeis."--Ver. 565.

There are clear remains of a Roman entrenchment close to Walmer Castle.
(See _Hasted_, vol. iv. p. 162., notes.)

Any of your correspondents who could give me any information tending to
show that an old fortification had existed on the site of Walmer Castle,
previous to the erection of the present edifice--or even _almost_ upon the
same site--would do me a very great kindness if he would communicate it,
through the columns of "N. & Q.," or by a private letter sent to the
Editor.

SCOTCHMEN IN POLAND.

Can any of your readers throw any light on this passage in Dr. Johnson's
_Life of Sir John Denham_?

    "He [Sir John Denham] now resided in France, as one of the followers of
    the exiled king; and, to divert {476} the melancholy of their
    condition, was sometimes enjoined by his master to write occasional
    verses; one of which amusements was probably his ode or song upon the
    Embassy to Poland, by which he and Lord Crofts procured a contribution
    of ten thousand pounds from the Scotch, that wandered over that
    kingdom. Poland was at that time very much frequented by itinerant
    traders, who, in a country of very little commerce and of great extent,
    where every man resided on his own estate, contributed very much to the
    accommodation of life, by bringing to every man's house those little
    necessaries which it was very inconvenient to want, and very
    troublesome to fetch. I have formerly read, without much reflection, of
    the multitude of Scotchmen that travelled with their wares in Poland;
    and that their numbers were not small, the success of this negociation
    gives sufficient evidence."

The title of Denham's poem is "On my Lord Crofts' and my journey into
Poland, from whence we brought 10,000l. for his Majesty by the decimation
of his Scottish subjects there."

BISHOP JUXON AND WALTON'S POLYGLOTT BIBLE.

In the library at this island, which formerly belonged to the Knights of
Malta, there is an edition of Walton's Polyglott Bible, which was published
in London in 1657. This work is in a most perfect state of preservation.

On the title-page of the first of the eleven volumes, there is written, in
a bold and perfectly legible manner, the following words:

    "Liber Coll. Di Joannis Bapt^a Oxon Ex dono Reverendiss. in Xt^o Patris
    Gvil^i Jvxon Archiep. Cantvariensis. A^o D^{ni} 1663."

Just below, but on the right of the above, there is written in a clear hand
as follows:

    "Ex Libris domus Abbatialis S. Antonij Viennensis, Catalogo Inscript
    an. 1740. No. 11."

That the question which I shall ask at the end of this Note may be the more
easily answered, it will perhaps be necessary for me to state, that in the
year 1777, Rohan, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, succeeded in
annexing the property belonging to the Order of St. Antonio de Vienna to
that of Malta. In accepting of these estates, which were situated in France
and Savoy, Rohan bound himself to pay the many mortgages and debts with
which they were encumbered; and so large an amount had to be thus defrayed,
that for a hundred years the convent would not be reimbursed for its
advances, and receive the 120,000 livres, at which sum their annual rental
would then be valued. Of the foundation of this Order a recent writer
(Thornton) thus remarks:

    "In 1095 some nobles of Dauphiny united for the relief of sufferers
    from a kind of leprosy called St. Anthony's fire, which society, in
    1218, was erected into a religious body of Hospitallers, having a
    grand master for chief. This order, after many changes in its
    constitution, having been left the option between extinction and
    secularisation, or union with another order, accepted the latter
    alternative, and selected that of St. John of Jerusalem."

Among the moveable effects which came to the Knights of Malta by this
arrangement, was a small and well-selected library, and in it this edition
of Walton's Bible.

Without, therefore, writing more at length on this subject, which might
take up too much space in "N. & Q.," I would simply add, that my attention
was called to this work by the Rev. Mr. Howe, chaplain of H.B.M. ship
"Britannia," and for the purpose of asking, At what time, by whom, and in
what manner, were these volumes removed from St. John's College at Oxford,
and transferred to the library of the Order of St. Antonio de Vienna in
France?

Minor Queries.

_Was Andrew Marvell poisoned?_--I have just been reading the three
ponderous quarto volumes comprising _The Works_ of Andrew Marvell, as
collected and edited by his townsman, Capt. Edward Thompson of Hull. In the
"Life," near the end of vol. iii., we are told that the patriot died on
Aug. 16, 1678, "and by poison for he was healthful and vigorous to the
moment he was seized with the premeditated ruin." And again, in a summary
of his merits, we are told that "all these patriot virtues were
insufficient to guard him against the jesuitical machinations of the
_state_; for what vice and bribery could not influence, was perpetrated by
poison." This heinous crime, so formally averred against the enemies of
Marvell, may have been committed by "some person or persons unknown;" but,
as not a tittle of evidence is adduced or indicated by the zealous
biographer in support of the charge--Query, had it any foundation in fact?
In the court, and out of the court, the anti-popish, anti-prelatical
Puritan had enemies numerous and bitter enough; but is there really any
other ground for the abominable imputation of foul play alluded to, beyond
his actually sudden death? Is the hypothesis of poison coeval with the date
of Marvell's demise? If so, was there any official inquiry--any "crowner's
quest?" Surely his admiring compatriots on the banks of the Humber did not
at once quietly sit down with the conviction, that _thus_ "fell one of the
first characters of this kingdom or of any other."

_Purlieu._--Some of your correspondents seem afraid that an attempt to
repair the deficiencies of our English dictionaries, by research into
disputed etymologies in "N. & Q.," would tend to produce too much and too
tedious discussion, and fill its space too much. Could _this_, at least,
not be done without much objection? Could we not co-operate in finding the
earliest known mention of words, and thus perhaps trace the occasion and
manner of their introduction?

At any rate, this word _purlieu_ is certainly in want of some examination.
Johnson has adopted the wretched etymology of _pur_, Fr. for pure, and
_lieu_, Fr. for place; and he defines it as a place on the outskirts of a
forest free of wood.

The earliest record in which this word occurs, so far as I have seen, is in
an act of Edward III., quoted by Manwood, and it is there spelt _puraley_;
and it relates to the disafforested parts which several preceding kings
permitted to be detached from their royal forests.

Might I ask if any of your correspondents find an earlier use of the word;
and can it be gifted with a probable paternity?

The tracing of the earliest known mention of disputed words is a task
capable of being finished, and might perhaps be attended, in many cases,
with happy results. It would rid us probably of many puerilities which
degrade our current dictionaries.

_Jennings Family._--Some time since I requested as a great favour that your
correspondent PERCURIOSUS would kindly inform me where I could get a sight
of the Spoure MSS. I repeat that I should feel greatly obliged if he would
do so: and as this is of no public interest, I send postage envelope, in
the event of PERCURIOSUS obliging me with the desired information.

_Latimer's Brothers-in-Law._--In Bishop Latimer's first sermon, preached
before King Edward VI., we find the quaint martyr-bishop magnifying the
paternal prudence for having suitably "married his sisters with five
pounds, or twenty nobles, apiece;" but neither the editors of the sermon,
nor the writers of several biographical notices of Latimer consulted by me,
and in which the extract appears, give any account of the fortunate
gentlemen whom the generous parent thus doubly blessed with his twofold
treasure.

Can you, or any of your readers, oblige by furnishing the _names_ of Bishop
Latimer's brothers-in-law, or by giving some references or brief account of
them?

_Autobiographical Sketch._--A fragment came into my possession some time
ago, among a quantity of waste paper in which books were wrapped, which,
from the singularity of its contents, I felt desirous to trace to the book
of which it forms a part, but my research has hitherto proved unsuccessful.
It consists of two leaves of a large octavo sheet, probably published some
twenty years back, and is headed "Autobiographical Sketch of the Editor."
It commences with the words: "The Commissioners of the Poor Laws will
understand me, when I say, that I was born at Putney, in Surrey." The pages
are of course not consecutive: so after an allusion to the wanderings of
the writer, I have nothing more up to p. 7., at which is an account of a
supposed plot against the lord mayor and sheriffs, concocted by him with
the assistance of some school-boy coadjutors; the object of which appears
to have been, to overturn the state-coach of the civic functionary, as it
ascended Holborn Hill, by charging it with a hackney coach, in which sat
the writer and certain widows armed with bolsters in pink satin bags. The
word having been given to "Charge!" this new kind of war-chariot was driven
down the hill at full speed, gunpowder ignited on its roof, and blazing
squibs protruded {478} through its back, sides, and front. The ingenious
author declares that the onslaught was crowned with complete success; but
here, most unfortunately, the sheet ends: and unless you, Mr. Editor, or
some of your correspondents, will kindly help me to the rest of the
narrative, I must, I fear return unexperienced to my grave. I have omitted
to mention, that the date of this event is given as the 4th of July, 1799.

_Schonbornerus._--Can any of your readers give me information about a book
I became possessed of by chance a short time ago, or tell me anything
respecting its author, for whom I have vainly sought biographical
dictionaries? The volume is a duodecimo, and bears the following
title-page:

    "Georgii Schonborneri Politicorum, Libri Septem. Editio ad ipsius
    Authoris emendatum Exemplar nunc primum vulgata. Amsterodami: apud L.
    Elzevirium, anno 1642."

It is written in Latin, and contains as many quotations as the _Anatomy of
Melancholy_, or Mr. Digby's _Broad Stone of Honour_.

_Symbol of Globe and Cross._--Can any one oblige me with an explanation of

_Booth Family._--Can any of your Lancashire correspondents afford
information bearing on the families of Booth of Salford, and Lightbown of
Manchester? Is any pedigree extant of either of these families, and what
arms did they bear? Humphrey Booth founded, I believe, a church in Salford
about the year 1634, the patronage of which still remains, as it might
seem, in the family, the _Clergy List_ describing it as in the gift of Sir
R. G. Booth.

There is a Booth Hall in Blackley, a small village lying by the road side,
between Manchester and Middleton; and from the _inquisitio post mortem_ of
Humphrey Booth, 12 Car. I., it appears that he died seised of lands in
Blackley as well as Salford.

Is there any evidence to connect him with this hall, as the place of his
residence?

A JESUIT.

Jesus College, Cambridge.

_Ennui._--What is our nearest approach to a correct rendering of this
expression? Some English writer (Lady Morgan, I believe) has defined it
"mental lukewarmness:" but, if it be true, as La-Motte Houdart says, that--

    "L'ennui naquit un jour de l'uniformite."

the above definition would seem to indicate rather the cause of _ennui_
than _ennui_ itself.

_The Grindstone Oak._--Can any of your topographical correspondents state
what is the earliest mention made of an oak tree well known in this part of
the country, and the destruction of which by fire, on the 5th of November,
1849, was the subject of regret to all who had seen or heard of it? It was
called the _Grindstone Oak_, and had been a denizen of the forest of Alice
Holt, as many suppose, since the days of the Confessor. It measured
thirty-four feet in circumference, at the height of seven feet from the
ground; and is mentioned by Gilbert White, in his _History of Selborne_, as
"the great oak in the Holt, which is deemed by Mr. Marsham to be the
biggest in this island."

_Adamsons of Perth._--Can any of your Scottish correspondents inform me
what relationship existed between Patrick Adamson, titular Archbishop of
St. Andrew's, and the two learned brothers, Henry Adamson, author of the
_Muses' Threnodie_, and John Adamson, principal of the college at
Edinburgh, and editor of the _Muses' Welcome_; and whether any existing
family claims to be descended from them? They were all born at Perth. Henry
and John were the sons of James Adamson, a merchant and magistrate of the
fair city. Probably the archbishop was a brother of this James Adamson, and
son of Patrick Adamson, who was Dean of the Guild when John Knox preached
his famous sermon at St. John's. Mariota, a daughter of the archbishop, is
said by Burke to have married Sir Michael {479} Balfour, Bart., of Nortland
Castle Orkney. Another daughter would appear to have become the wife of
Thomas Wilson, or Volusenus, as he calls himself, the editor of his
father-in-law's poems and other publications.

E. H. A.

_Cursitor Barons of the Exchequer._--Will you allow me to repeat a question
which you inserted in Vol. v., p. 346., as to a list of these officers, and
any account of their origin and history? Surely some of your
correspondents, devoted to legal antiquities, can give note a clue to the
labyrinth which Madox has not ventured to enter. The office still
exists--with peculiar duties which are still performed--and we know that it
is an ancient one; all sufficient grounds for inquiry, which I trust will
meet with some response.

PSALMANAZAR.

(Vol. vii., pp. 206. 435.)

Having long felt a great respect for this person, and a great interest in
all that concerns his history, I am induced to mention the grounds on which
I have been led to doubt whether the letter in the _Gentleman's Magazine_,
to which MR. CROSSLEY refers, is worthy of credit. When I first saw it, I
considered it as so valuable an addition to the information which I had
collected on the subject, that I was anxious to know who was the writer. It
had no signature; but the date, "Sherdington, June, 1704," which was
retained, gave me a clue which, by means not worth detailing, led me to the
knowledge that what thus appeared in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for
February, 1765, had issued from "Curll's chaste press" more than thirty
years before, in the form of a letter from the person now known in literary
history as "Curll's Corinna," but by her cotemporaries (see the index of
Mr. Cunningham's excellent _Handbook of London_) as Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas,
sometime of Dyot Street, St. Giles's, and afterwards of a locality not
precisely ascertained, but within the rules of the Fleet, and possibly
(though Mr. Cunningham does not corroborate this) at some period of her
life resident in the more genteel quarters which Curll assigns to her. To
speak more strictly, and make the matter intelligible to any one who may
look at it in the Magazine, I should add that the first paragraph
(seventeen lines, on p. 78., dated from "Sherdington," and beginning "I
dined," says the letter writer, "last Saturday with Sir John Guise, at
Gloucester") is part of a letter purporting to be written by her lover;
while all the remainder (on pp. 79-81.) is from Corinna's answer to it.

The worthless and forgotten work of which these letters form a part,
consists of two volumes. The copy which I borrowed when I discovered what I
have stated, consisted of a first volume of the second edition (1736), and
a second volume of the first edition (1732). The title of the second volume
(which I give as belonging to the earlier edition) is:

    "The Honourable Lovers: or, the second and last Volume of Pylades and
    Corinna. Being the remainder of Love Letters, and other Pieces (in
    Verse and Prose), which passed between Richard Gwinnett, Esq.; of Great
    Shurdington, in Gloucestershire, and Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, Jun., of
    Great Russel Street, Bloomsbury. To which is added, a Collection of
    familiar Letters between Corinna, Mr. Norris, Capt. Hemington, Lady
    Chudleigh, Lady Pakington, &c. &c. All faithfully published from their
    original Manuscripts. London: printed in the Year M.DCC.XXXII. (Price
    5s.)"

The title-page of the first volume (second edition) differs principally in
having the statement that the book was "printed for E. Curll" (whose name
does not appear in the earlier second volume, though perhaps it may have
done so in the first of that earlier edition), and an announcement that the
fidelity of the publication is "attested, by Sir Edward Northey, Knight."

The work is a farrago of low rubbish utterly beneath criticism; and I
should perhaps hardly think it worth while to say as much as I have said of
it, had it not been that, in turning it about, I could not help feeling a
suspicion that Daniel Defoe's hand was in the matter, at least so far as
that papers that had belonged to him might have come into Curll's hands,
and furnished materials for the work. It would be tedious to enter into
details; but the question seemed to me to be one of some interest, because,
in my own mind, it was immediately followed by another, namely, whether
Daniel had not more to do than has been suspected with the _History of
Formosa_? Those who are more familiar with Defoe than I am, will be better
able to judge whether he was, as Psalmanazar says, "the person who
Englished it from my Latin;" for the youth was as much disqualified for
writing the book in English, by being a Frenchman, as he would have been if
he had been a Formosan. He acknowledges that this person assisted him to
correct improbabilities; but I do not know that he anywhere throws further
light on the question respecting the help which he must have had. Daniel
would be just the man to correct some gross improbabilities, and at the
same time help him to some more probable fictions. Under this impression I
recently inquired (see "N. & Q.," Vol. vii., p. 305.) respecting the
authorship of {480} _Pylades and Corinna_, and the possibility that it
might be the work of Defoe; but I believe that my question has not been
answered.

I have already trespassed unreasonably on your columns; but still I must
beg, in justice to a man whose character, as I have said, I very highly
respect, to add one remark. When his imposture is referred to, it is not
always remembered that when he came to this country he was not his own
master. It seems that he rambled away from his home in the South of France,
when about fifteen years old; that he spent about two years in wandering
about France and Germany, and astonishing people by pretending to be, at
first a converted, and afterwards an unconverted, Formosan; that when
performing this second, pagan, character, he arrived at Sluys, where a
Scotch regiment in the Dutch service, under Brigadier Lauder, was
stationed; that the chaplain, named Innes, detected the fraud, but instead
of reproving the lad for his sin and folly, only considered how he might
turn the cheat to his own advantage, and render it conducive to his own
preferment. The abandoned miscreant actually went through the blasphemous
mockery of baptizing the youth as a convert from heathenism; named him
after the brigadier, who stood godfather: claimed credit from the Bishop of
London for his zeal; and was by the kind prelate invited to bring his
convert to London. The chaplain lost no time in accepting, was graciously
received by the bishop and the archbishop, snapped up the first piece of
preferment that would answer his views (it happened to be the office of
chaplain-general to the forces in Portugal), and made off, leaving his
convert to bear the storm which was sure to burst on him, as best he might.
That a youth thus tutored and thus abandoned, before Johnson was born,
should have lived to attract his society, and win from him the testimony
that he was "the best man" whom he had ever known, gives him a claim to our
respect, which seems to me to be strengthened by everything which I have
been able to learn respecting him.

CONSECRATED ROSES, ETC.

(Vol. vii., p. 407.)

Had G.'s Query referred solely to the consecration of _The Golden Rose_, I
might have given him a satisfactory answer by referring him to Cartari's
essay on the subject entitled _La Rosa d'Ora Pontificia, &c._, 4to. 1681,
and to the account (with accompanying engraving) of the _Rose, Sword, and
Cap_ consecrated by Julius III., and sent by him to Philip and Mary; and to
Cardinal Pole's exposition of these Papal gifts, which are to be found in
the 1st volume of F. Angeli Rocca, _Opera Omnia_ (fol. Rome, 1719). In the
authors to whom I have referred, much curious information will, however, be
found. I take this opportunity of saying, that as I am about to submit a
communication on the subject of _The Golden Rose_ to the Society of
Antiquaries, I shall feel obliged by any hints which may help me to render
it more complete; and of putting on record in "N. & Q." the following
particulars of the ceremonial, as it was performed on the 6th of March
last, which I extract from the _Dublin Weekly Telegraph_ of the 9th of
April.

    "On Sunday, the 6th [March, 1853], the Benediction of the Golden Rose,
    was, according to annual usage, performed by the Pontiff previously to
    High Mass, in the Sistine Chapel, celebrated by a cardinal, at which he
    assists every Sunday during Lent. To the more ancient practice of
    blessing, on the fourth Sunday of 'Quaresima,' a pair of gold and
    silver keys, touched with filings from the chains of St. Peter (which
    are still preserved in Rome), the Holy See has substituted that of the
    Benediction of the 'Rosa d'Oro,' to be presented, within the year, to
    some sovereign or other potentate, who has proved well deserving of the
    Church. The first positive record respecting the Golden Rose has been
    ascribed to the Pontificate of Leo IX. (1049-53); but a writer in the
    _Civitta Catolica_ states that allusion to a census levied for its cost
    may be found in the annals of a still earlier period. The Pontiffs used
    formerly to present it annually to the Prefect of Rome, after singing
    Mass, on this Sunday, at the Lateran, and pronouncing a homily, during
    which they lifted the consecrated object in one hand whilst expounding
    to the people its mystic significance. Pius II. (1458) is the last Pope
    recorded to have thus preached in reference to and thus conferred the
    Golden Rose; and the first foreign potentate recorded to have received
    it from the Holy See is Fulk, Count of Anjou, to whom it was presented
    by Urban II. in 1096. A homily of Innocent III. also contains all
    explanation of this beautiful symbol--the precious metal, the balsam
    and musk used in consecrating it, being taken in mystic sense as
    allusion to the triple substance in the person of the Incarnate
    Lord--divinity, soul, and body. It is not merely a single flower, but
    an entire rose-tree that is represented--the whole about a foot in
    height, most delicately wrought in fine lamina of gold. This being
    previously deposited between lighted candelabra, on a table in the
    sacristy, is taken by the youngest cleric of the camera, to be
    consigned to his Holiness, after the latter has been vested for the
    solemnity, but before his assuming the mitre. After a beautiful form of
    prayer, with incense and holy water, the Pontiff then, holding the
    object in his hand, imparts the Benediction, introducing into the
    flower which crowns the graceful stem, and is perforated so as to
    provide a receptacle, balsam of Peru and powder of musk. He then passes
    with the usual procession into the Sistine, still carrying the rose in
    his left hand; and during the Mass it remains beneath the crucifix over
    the altar. If in the course of the year no donation of the precious
    object is thought advisable, the same is consecrated afresh on the
    anniversary following. Some have conjectured that the Empress of France
    will be selected {481} by Pius IX. to receive this honour in the
    present instance; but this is mere conjecture. On a former occasion, it
    is true, the Golden Rose was conferred by him on another crowned head
    of the fairer sex--one entitled to more than common regards from the
    Supreme Pastor in adversity--the Queen of Naples."

CAMPBELL'S IMITATIONS.

(Vol. vi., p. 505.)

It is curious that two of the passages pointed out by MR. BREEN, as
containing borrowed ideas, are those quoted by Alison in his recent volume
(_Hist. Eur._, vol. i. pp. 429, 430.) to support his panegyric on Campbell,
of whose "felicitous images" he speaks with some enthusiasm.

The propensity of Campbell to adapt or imitate the thoughts and expressions
of others has often struck me. Let me then suggest the following (taken at
random) as further, and I believe hitherto unnoticed, illustrations of that
propensity:

  1. "When front to front the banner'd hosts combine,
      Halt ere they close, and form the dreadful line."
                          _Pleasures of Hope._

     "When front to front the marching armies shine,
      Halt ere they meet, and form the lengthening line."
                          Pope, _Battle of Frogs and Mice_.

  2. "As sweep the shot stars down the troubled sky."
                          _Pleasures of Hope._

     "And rolls low thunder thro' _the troubled sky_."
                          Pope, _Frogs and Mice_.

  3. "With meteor-standard to the winds unfurl'd."
                          _Pleasures of Hope._

     "The imperial _standard_ which full high advanc'd,
      Shone _like a meteor_ streaming _to the wind_."
                          Milton, _Par. Lost_, i. 535.

  4. "The dying man to Sweden turn'd his eye,
      Thought of his home, and clos'd it with a sigh."
                          _Pleasures of Hope._

     "Sternitur infelix alieno vulnere, coelumque
      Aspicit, _et dulces moriens reminiscitur Argos_."
                          Virgil, _AEn._, x. 782.

  5. "... Red meteors flash'd along the sky,
      And conscious Nature shudder'd at the cry."
                          _Pleasures of Hope._

     "... _Fulsere ignes, et conscius_ aether."
                          Virgil, _AEn._, iv. 167.

  6. "In hollow winds he hears a spirit moan."
                          _Pleasures of Hope._

Shakespeare has the _hollow whistling_ of the southern _wind_.

  7. "The strings of Nature crack'd with agony."
                          _Pleasures of Hope._

     "His _grief_ grew puissant. and _the strings of life_
      Began _to crack_."--Shakspeare, _King Lear_.

  8. "The fierce extremes of good and ill to brook."
                          _Gertrude of Wyoming._

     "... And feel by turns the bitter change
      Of _fierce extremes, extremes_ by change more _fierce_."
                          Milton, _Par. Lost_, ii. 599.

  9. "His tassell'd horn beside him laid."
                          _O'Connor's Child._

     "... Ere th' odorous breath of morn
      Awakes the slumbering leaves, or _tassell'd horn_
      Shakes the high thicket."--Milton, _Arcades_.

  10. "The scented wild-weeds and enamell'd moss."
                          _Theodric._

Campbell thinks it necessary to explain this latter epithet in a note: "The
moss of Switzerland, as well as that of the Tyrol, is remarkable for a
bright smoothness approaching to the appearance of enamel." And yet was no
one, or both, of the following passages floating in his brain when his pen
traced the line?

 "O'er the _smooth enamell'd green_
  Where no print of sleep hath been."
                          Milton, _Arcades_.

 "Here blushing Flora paints _th' enamell'd ground_."
                          Pope, _Winsdor Forest_.

"THE HANOVER RAT."

(Vol. vii. p. 206.)

_An Essay on Irish Bulls_ is said to have found its way into a catalogue of
works upon natural history; with which precedent in my favour, and pending
the inquiries of _naturalists_, _ratcatchers_, and _farmers_ into the
history of the above-named formidable invader, I hope MR. HIBBERD will have
no objection to my intruding a bibliographical curiosity under the
convenient head he has opened for it in "N. & Q."

My book, then, bears the appropriate title, _An Attempt towards a Natural
History of the Hanover Rat, dedicated to P***m M******r, M.D., and S----y
to the Royal Society_, 8vo., pp. 24.: London, 1744.

The writer of this curious piece takes his _cue_ from that remarkable
production, _An Attempt towards a Natural History of the Polype_, 1743; in
which the learned Mr. Henry Baker, in a letter to Martin Folkes, of 218
pages, 8vo., illustrated by a profusion of woodcuts, elaborately describes
this link between the animal and vegetable creation, and the experiments he
practised upon the same: commencing with "cutting off a polype's head," and
so on through a series of scientific barbarities upon his _little
creature_, which ended only in "turning a polype inside out!"

Following the plan of Mr. Baker, the anonymous author of _The Hanover Rat_
tells us, that, after thirty years' laborious research, he had {482}
satisfied himself that this animal was not a native of these islands: "I
cannot," he says, "particularly mark the date of its first appearance, yet
I think it is within the memory of man;" and finding favour in its original
_mine affamee_ state with a few of the most starved and hungry of the
English rats from the common sewer, he proceeds to show that it _did_
extirpate the natives; but whether this is the best account, or whether the
facts of the case as here set forth will satisfy your correspondent, is
another thing. According to _my_ authority, the aboriginal rat was, at the
period of writing, sorely put to it to maintain his ground against the
invading colonists and their unnatural allies the _providers_; and the
present work seems to have been an effort on the part of one in the
interest of the former to awaken them to a sense of their danger. In his
laudable attempts to rally their courage, this advocate reminds them of a
similar crisis when their country was infested with a species of frog
called _Dutch frogs_: "which no sooner," says he, "began to be mischievous,
than its growth and progress was stopped by the natives." "Had we," he
continues, "but the same public spirit with our ancestors, we need not
complain to-day of being eaten up by _rats_. Our country is the same, but
alas! we feel no more the same affection for it." In this way he stimulates
the invaded to a combined attack upon the common enemy, and we need not
tell _our_ readers how successfully, nor how desperate the struggle, the
very next year; which ended in the complete ascendancy of the _Hanover
rat_, or reigning family, over the unlucky Jacobite native. Under his
figure of a rat, this Jacobite is very scurrilous indeed upon the
Hanoverian succession; and, continuing his _polypian_ imitations, relates a
few coarse experiments upon _his subject_ illustrative of its destructive
properties, voracity, and sagacity, which set at nought "all the
contrivances of the farmer to defend his barns; the trailer his warehouse;
the gentleman his land; or the inferior people their cup-boards and small
beer cellars. No bars or bolts can keep them out, nor can any gin or trap
lay hold of them."

Luckily for us living in these latter days, we can extract amusement from
topics of this nature, which would have subjected our forefathers to severe
pains and penalties; and looking at the character and mischievous tendency
of _The Hanover Rat_, I am curious to know if Mary Cooper, the publisher,
was put under surveillance for her share in its production; for to me it
appears a more aggravated libel upon the reigning family than that of the
_Norfolk Prophecy_--for the publication of which, Boswell says, the great
Samuel Johnson had to play at hide and seek with the officers of justice.

The advent of both Pretenders was preceded by _straws_ like these cast out
by their adherents, to try _how the current set_. The present _jeu
d'esprit_, however, is a double-shotted one: for, not content with
tampering with the public allegiance, this aboriginal rat seems more
innocently enjoying a laugh at the Royal Society, and its ingenious
_fellow_ Mr. Baker, in as far as regards the aforesaid elaborate treatise
upon _polypes_.

FONT INSCRIPTIONS.

(Vol. vii., p. 408.)

MR. ELLACOMBE desires examples of these. I can supply the following:--

At Bradley, Lincolnshire, is a very large font, of the Decorated period,
with this inscription round the bowl in black letter:

    "Pater Noster, Ave Maria, and Criede, leren ye chyld yt es nede."

This is an early instance of the use of _English_ for inscriptions. The
sketch was engraved in the work on _Baptismal Fonts_.

At Threckingham, Lincolnshire, I believe I succeeded in deciphering an
inscription round the font, which was said to have been previously studied
in vain. It is somewhat defaced; but in all probability the words are,--

    "Ave Maria gracia p... d... t..."

_i. e._ of course, "plena, dominus tecum." The bowl of the font is Early
English; but the base, round which the inscription runs, appears to be of
the fifteenth century.

At Burgate, Suffolk, an inscription in black letter is incised on the upper
step of the font:

    "[Orate pro an--b'] Will'mi Burgate militis et d[=n]e Elionore uxoris
    eius qui istum fontem fieri fecerunt."

Sir William Burgate died in 1409. It is engraved in the _Proceedings of the
Bury and West Suffolk Archaeological Institute_.

At Caistor, by Norwich:

    "Orate pro animab ... liis ... ici de Castre."

At Walsoken, Norfolk:

    "Remember the soul of S. Honyter and Margaret his wife, and John
    Beforth, Chaplain."

with the date 1544.

At Gaywood, Norfolk, is a font of Gothic design, lust probably of
post-Reformation date. On four of the eight sides of the bowl are these
inscriptions:

 "QVI . CREDIDE         "VOCE . PATER
  RIT . ET . BAPTI       NATUS . CORPORE
  ZATVS . FVERIT         FLAMEN . AVE.
  SALVVS . ERIT."          MAT. 3."

 "CHRISTVM . IN         "I . AM . THY . GOD
  DVISTIS . QVOT         AND . THE . GOD
  QVOT . BAPTI           OF . THY . SEEDE.
  ZATI . ESTIS."           GEN."

{483}

At Tilney, All Saints, Norfolk, is an inscribed font so similar to the one
last mentioned that they are probably the works of the same designer.

On the _cover_ of the font at Southacre, Norfolk, is this inscription:

    "Orate p. aia. M[=r]i. Ri[=c]i. Gotts et d[=n]i Galfridi baker,
    Rectoris huj' [eccl[=i]e qui hoc] opus fieri fece^t."

I may take the opportunity of adding two _pulpit_ inscriptions; one at
Utterby, Lincolnshire, on the sounding-board:

 "Quoties conscendo animo contimesco."

The other at Swarby, in the same county:

 "O God my Saviour be my sped,
  To preach thy word, men's soulls to fed."

IRISH RHYMES--ENGLISH PROVINCIALISMS--LOWLAND SCOTCH.

(Vol. vi., pp. 605, 606.)

MR. BEDE, who first called attention to a class of rhymes which he
denominated "Irish," seems to take it ill that I have dealt with his
observations as somewhat "hypercritical." I acknowledge the justness of his
criticism; but I did, and must still, demur to the propriety of calling
certain false rhymes peculiarly _Irish_, when I am able to produce similes
from poets of celebrity, who cannot stand excused by MR. BEDE'S
explanation, that the rhymes in question "made music for their Irish ear."
If, as he tells us, MR. BEDE was not "blind to similar imperfections in
English poets," I am yet to learn why he should fix on "Swift's Irishisms,"
and call those errors a national peculiarity, when he finds them so freely
scattered through the standard poetry of England?

Your correspondent J. H. T. suggests a new direction for inquiry on this
subject when he conjectures that the pronunciation now called _Irish_ was,
"during the first half of the eighteenth century, the received
pronunciation of the most correct speakers of the day;" and MR. BEDE
himself suggests that _provincialisms_ may sometimes modify the rhymes of
even so correct a versifier as Tennyson. I hope some of your contributors
will have "drunk so deep of the well of English undefiled" as to be
competent to address themselves to this point of inquiry. I cannot pretend
to do much, being but a shallow philologist; yet, since I received your
last Number, I have lighted on a passage in that volume of "omnifarious
information" Croker's _Boswell_, which will not be deemed inapplicable.

Boswell, during a sojourn at Lichfield in 1776, expressed a doubt as to the
correctness of Johnson's eulogy on his townsmen, as "speaking the purest
English," and instanced several provincial sounds, such as _there_
pronounced like _fear_, _once_ like _woonse_. On this passage are a
succession of notes: Burney observes, that "David Garrick always said
_shupreme, shuperior_." Malone's note brings the case in point to ours when
he says, "This is still the vulgar pronunciation in Ireland; the
pronunciation in Ireland is doubtless that which generally prevailed in
England in the time of Queen Elizabeth." And Mr. Croker sums up the case
thus:

    "No doubt the English settlers carried over, and may have in some cases
    preserved, the English idiom and accent of their day. Bishop Kearny, as
    well as his friend Mr. Malone, thought that the most remarkable
    peculiarity of Irish pronunciation, as in _say_ for _sea_, _tay_ for
    _tea_, was _the English mode, even down to the reign of Queen Anne_;
    and there are rhymes in Pope, and more frequently in Dryden, that
    countenance that opinion. But rhymes cannot be depended upon for minute
    identity of sound."--Croker's _Notes_, A.D. 1776.

If this explanation be adopted, it will account for the examples I have
been furnishing, and others which I find even among the harmonious rhymes
of Spenser (he might, however, have caught the brogue in Ireland); yet am I
free to own that to me popular pronunciation scarcely justifies the
committing to paper such loose rhymes as ought to grate on that fineness of
ear which is an essential faculty in the true poet; "here or awa'," in
England or Ireland, I continue to set them down to "slip-slop composition."

It may not be inappropriate to notice, that among Swift's eccentricities,
we find a propensity to "out-of-the-way rhymes." In his works are numerous
examples of couplets made apparently for no other purpose but to show that
no word could baffle him; and the anecdote of his long research for a rhyme
for the name of his old enemy Serjent _Betsworth_, and of the curious
accident by which he obtained it, is well known; from which we may conclude
that he was on the watch for occasions of exhibiting such rhymes as
_rakewell_ and _sequel_, _charge ye_ and _clergy_, without supposing him
ignorant that he was guilty of "lese majeste" against the laws of correct
pronunciation.

When I asked MR. BEDE'S decision on a _palpable Cockneyism_ in verse, I did
so merely with a view, by a "_tu quoque_ pleasantry," to enliven a
discussion, which I hope we may carry on and conclude in that good humour
with which I accept his parenthetic hint, that I have made "a bull" of my
Pegasus. I beg to submit to him, that, as I read the _Classical
Dictionary_, it is from the _heels_ of Pegasus the fount of poetic
inspiration is supposed to be derived; and, further, that the _brogue_ is
not so _malapropos_ to the _heel_ as he imagines, for in Ireland the
_brogue_ is in use as well to cover the _understanding_ as to _tip the
tongue_. Could I enjoy the pleasure of MR. BEDE'S company in a stroll over
my native mountains, he might find that there are occasions on which he
might be glad to put off {484} his London-made shoe, and "to _wear_ the
_brogue_, though _speak_ none."

A. B. R.

P.S.--The _postscriptum_ of J. H. T. respecting the pronunciation of
English being preserved in Scotland, goes direct to an opinion I long since
formed, that the Lowland Scotch, as we read it in the Waverley Novels, is
the only genuine unadulterated remains we have of the Saxon language, as
used before the Norman Conquest. I formed this opinion from continually
tracing what we call "braid Scotch" to its root, in Bosworth's, and other
Saxon dictionaries; and I lately found this fact confirmed and accounted
for in a passage of Verstegan, as follows:--He tells us that after the
battle of Hastings Prince Edgar Atheling, with his sisters Margaret and
Christian, retired into Scotland, where King Malcolm married the former of
these ladies; and proceeds thus:

    "As now the English court, by reason of the aboundance of Normannes
    therein, became moste to speak French, so the Scottish court, because
    of the queen, and the many English that came with her, began to speak
    English; the which language, it would seem, King Malcolm himself had
    before that learned, and now, by reason of his queen, did more affecte
    it. But the English toung, in fine, prevailed more in Scotland than the
    French did in England; _for English became the language of all the
    south part of Scotland_, the Irish (or Gaelic) having before that been
    the general language of the whole country, since remaining only in the
    north."--Verstegan's _Restitution of Antiquities_, A.D. 1605.

Many of your accomplished philological readers will doubtless consider the
information of this Note trivial and puerile; but they will, I hope, bear
with a tyro in the science, in recording an original remark of his own,
borne out by an authority so decisive as Verstegan.

PICTURES BY HOGARTH.

(Vol. vii., pp. 339. 412.)

In reply to AMATEUR, I can inform him that at the sale of the Marlborough
effects at Marlborough House about thirty years ago, there were sold four
or five small whole-lengths in oil of members of that family. They were
hardly clever enough for what Hogarth's after-style would lead us to
expect, but there were many reasons for thinking they were by him. They
came into the possession of Mr. Croker, who presented them, as family
curiosities, to the second Earl Spencer, and they are now, I presume, in
the gallery at Althorpe. One of them was peculiarly curious as connected
with a remarkable anecdote of the great Duchess. Horace Walpole tells us in
the _Reminiscences_, her granddaughter, Lady Bateman, having persuaded her
brother, the young Duke of Marlborough, to marry a Miss Trevor without the
Duchess's consent:

    "The grandam's rage exceeded all bounds. Having a portrait of Lady
    Bateman, she blackened the face, and then wrote on it, '_Now her
    outside's as black as her inside._'"

One of the portraits I speak of was of Lady Bateman, and bore on its face
evidence of having incurred some damage, for the coat of arms with which
(like all the others, and as was Hogarth's fashion) it was ornamented in
one corner, were angrily scratched out, as with a knife. Whether this
defacement gave rise to Walpole's story, or whether the face had been also
blackened with some stuff that was afterwards removed, seems doubtful; the
picture itself, according to my recollection, showed no mark but the
armorial defacement.

I much wonder this style of small whole-lengths has not been more
prevalent; they give the general air and manner of the personage so much
better than the bust size can do, and they are so much more suited to the
size of our ordinary apartments.

C.

Referring to AN AMATEUR'S inquiry as to where any pictures painted by
Hogarth are to be seen, I beg to say that I have in my possession, and
should be happy to show him, the portrait of Hogarth's wife (Sir William
Thornhill's daughter), painted by himself.

The late Bishop Luscombe showed me, at Paris, in 1835, a picture of "The
Oratorio,"--a subject well known from Hogarth's etching. He told me that he
bought it at a broker's shop in the Rue St. Denis; that, on examination, he
found the frame to be English; and that, as the price was small--thirty
francs, if I remember rightly--he bought the piece, without supposing it to
be more than a copy. Sir William Knighton, on seeing it in the bishop's
collection, told him that Hogarth's original had belonged to the Dukes of
Richmond, and had been in their residence at Paris until the first
Revolution, since which time it had not been heard of; and Sir William had
no doubt that the bishop had been so fortunate as to recover it. Perhaps
some of your readers may have something to say on this story.

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_Washing Collodion Process._--In "N. & Q.," No. 153., p. 320., your valued
correspondent DR. DIAMOND states "that up to the _final_ period of the
operation, no washing of the plate is requisite. It prevents, rather than
assists, the necessary chemical action.".

Now, in all other instructions I have yet seen, it is directed to wash off
the iron, or other developing solution, _prior_ to immersing in the hypo.,
and after {485} such immersion, again to wash well in water. I shall feel
greatly obliged if DR. D. will be kind enough to state whether the
first-named washing is requisite, or whether the properties of the hypo.,
or the beauty of the picture, will be in any way injured by the previous
solutions _not_ having been washed off, prior to the fixings.

C. W.

    [We have submitted this Query to DR. DIAMOND, who informs us that he
    never adopts the practice of washing off the developing fluid, and
    considers it not only needless, but sometimes prejudicial, as when such
    washing has not been resorted to, the hyposulphite solution flows more
    readily over the picture, and causes none of the unpleasant stains
    which frequently occur in pictures which have been previously washed,
    especially if hard water has been used. But besides this, and the
    saving of time, the doing away with this unnecessary washing economises
    water, which in out-door practice is often a great consideration. DR.
    DIAMOND would again impress upon our readers the advantage of using the
    hyposulphite over and over again, merely keeping up its full strength
    by the addition of fresh crystals of the salt from time to time, as
    such practice produces pictures of whiter and softer tone than are ever
    produced by the raw solution.]

_Colouring Collodion Pictures_ (Vol. vii., p. 388.)--A patent has just been
taken out (dated September 23, 1852) for this purpose, by Mons. J. L.
Tardieu, of Paris. He terms his process _tardiochromy_. It consists in
applying oil or other colours at the back of the pictures, so as to give
the requisite tints to the several parts of the photograph, without at all
interfering with its extreme delicacy. It may even, in some cases, be used
to remedy defects in the photographic picture. The claim is essentially for
the application of colours at the back, instead of on the surface of
photographs, whatever kind of colours may be used. It is therefore, of
course, applicable only to photographs taken on paper, glass, or some
transparent material.

A. C. WILSON.

_Wanted, a simple Test for a good Lens._--As all writers on Photography
agree that the first great essential for successful practice is a good
lens--that is to say, a lens of which the visual and chemical foci
coincide--can any of the scientific readers of "N. & Q." point out any
simple test by which unscientific parties desirous of practising
photography may be enabled to judge of the goodness of a lens? A country
gentleman, like myself, may purchase a lens from an eminent house, with an
assurance that it is everything that can be desired (and I am _not_ putting
an imaginary case), and may succeed in getting beautiful images upon his
focussing-glass, but very unsatisfactory pictures; and it may not be until
he has almost abandoned photography, in despair at his own want of skill,
that he has the opportunity of showing his apparatus, manipulation, &c. to
some more practised hand, who is enabled to prove that _the lens was not
capable_ of doing what the vendors stated it could do. Surely scientific
men must know of a simple test which would save the disappointment I have
described; and I hope some one will take pity upon me, and send it to "N. &
Q.," for the benefit of myself and every other

COUNTRY PRACTITIONER.

_Photographic Tent--Restoration of Faded Negatives._--In Vol. vii., p.
462., I find M. F. M. inquiring for a cheap and portable tent, effective
for photographic operations out of doors. I have for the last two years,
and in mid-day (June), prepared calotype paper, and also the collodion
glass plates, for the camera, under a tent of glazed yellow calico of only
a single thickness: the light admitted is very great, but does not in the
least injure the most sensitive plate or paper. It is made square like a
large bag, so that in a room I can use it double as a blind; and out of
doors, in a high wind, I have crept into it, and prepared my paper opposite
the object I intended to calotype.

I should be glad it any of your readers would inform me how a failed
negative calotype can be restored to its original strength. I last year
took a great number, some of which have nearly faded away; and others are
as strong, and as able to be used to print from, as when first done. The
paper was prepared with the single iodide of silver solution, and rendered
sensitive with aceto-nitrate sil. and gallic acid in the usual way. I
attribute the fading to the hyposulphate not being got rid of; and the
question is, Can the picture he restored?

Are DR. DIAMOND'S _Notes_ published yet?

_Wives of Ecclesiastics_ (Vol. i., p. 115.).--In considering "the statutes
made by Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas, Archbishop of York, and
all the other bishops of England," ann. 1108, interdicting the marriage of
ecclesiastics, might it not be worth investigating, by such of your
correspondents as are curious on the subject, what had been the antecedents
of the several bishops themselves?

With respect to Thomas II., Archbishop of York, it is historically certain,
that he was the _son_ of an ecclesiastic, and likewise the _grandson_ of an
ecclesiastic (his _father_ being one of the bishops who concurred in these
statutes). Neither does it seem altogether unlikely that Thomas himself
also had spent some part of his early life in bonds of wedlock, since we
learn from the _Monasticon_ (vol. iii. p. 490. of new edit.), that "Thomas,
_son of Thomas_ (_the second of that name_), _Archbishop of York_,
confirmed what his predecessors, Thomas and Girard, had given," &c. If this
be correct, as stated[4], the conclusion is inevitable; but possibly some
error may have arisen out of the circumstance, that Thomas I. and Thomas
II., Archbishops of York, were uncle and nephew.

_Athenaeum_), but not having secured a copy of it at the time, now ten or
twelve years ago, I have had occasion to regret it ever since, and am
consequently much obliged to BALLIOLENSIS for his preservation of it in "N.
& Q." "It is needless," as he well observes, "to say anything in its
praise." I should add, that my strong impression is that this sonnet was
written _by_ Blanco White.

_The Ribston Pippin_ (Vol. vii., p. 436.).--The remarks of your

pippin, reminded me of a communication which I received about fifty years
ago, from one of the sisters of the late Sir Henry Goodricke, the last of
the family who possessed Ribston. Though it leaves the question concerning
the origin of that excellent apple unsettled, yet it may not be
uninteresting to {487} H. C. K. and some others of your numerous readers. I
therefore send a transcript:

"_Tradition of the Ribston Pippin Tree._

"About the beginning of the last century, Sir Henry Goodricke, father of
the late Sir John Goodricke, had three pips sent by a friend in a letter
from Rouen in Normandy, which were sown at Ribston. Two of the pips
produced nothing: the third is the present tree, which is in good health,
and still continues to bear fruit."

"_Another Account._

"Sir Henry, the father of the late Sir John Goodricke, being at Rouen in
Normandy, preserved the pips of some fine flavoured apples, and sent them
to Ribston, where they were sown, and the produce in due time planted in
what then was the park. Out of seven trees planted, five proved decided
crabs, and are all dead. The other two proved good apples; they never were
grafted, and one of them is the celebrated original Ribston pippin tree."

The latter tradition has, I believe, always been considered as the most
correct.

_Cross and Pile_ (Vol. vi., _passim._).--The various disquisitions of your

_Ellis Walker_ (Vol. vii., p. 382.).--

    "Ellis Walker, D.D.," according to Ware, "was born in the city of York;
    but came young into Ireland, and was educated in the college of Dublin,
    where he passed through all his degrees. He fled from thence in the
    troublesome reign of King James II., and lived with an uncle at York,
    where he translated _Epictetus_ into verse. After the settlement of
    Ireland he returned, and for seven years employed himself with great
    reputation in teaching a public school at Drogheda, where he died on
    the 17th April, 1701, in the fortieth year of his age; and was buried
    there in St. Peter's Church, and twenty years after had a monument
    erected to his memory by one of his scholars."

_Blackguard_ (Vol. vii., pp. 77. 273.).--I am not aware that the following
extract from Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_ has ever yet been quoted
under this heading. Would it not be worth the while to add it to the
extract from Hobbes's _Microcosmos_, quoted by JARLTZBERG, Vol. ii., p.
134. and again, by SIR J. EMERSON TENNENT at Vol. vii., p. 78.:

    "The same author, Cardan, in his _Hyperchen_, out of the doctrine of
    the Stoicks, will have some of these genii (for so he calls them) to be
    desirous of men's company, very affable and familiar with them, as dogs
    are; others again, to abhor as serpents, and care not for them. The
    same, belike, Trithemius calls _igneos et sublunares, qui numquam
    demergunt ad inferiora, aut vix ullum habent in terris commercium:
    generally they far excel men in worth, as a man the meanest worm_;
    though some there are _inferiour to those of their own rank in worth,
    as the black guard in a princes court, and to men again, as some
    degenerate, base, rational creatures are excelled of brute
    beasts_."--_Anat. of Mel._, Part I. sec. 2. Mem. 1. subs. 2. [Blake,
    1836, p. 118.]

In looking over the second volume of "N. & Q.," I find the use of the word
_blackguard_ is referred to, and passages illustrative of its meaning are
given from the works of Beaumont and Fletcher, Hobbes, Butler, &c. To these
may be added the following fanciful use of the word, which occurs in the
poems of Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset; the author of the well-known
naval song "To all you Ladies now at Land:"

 "Love is all gentleness, all joy,
    Smooth are his looks, and soft his pace.
  Her [Belinda's] Cupid is a blackguard boy,
    That rubs his link full in your face."

_High Spirits a Presage of Evil._--The Note of your correspondent CUTHBERT
BEDE (Vol. vii., p. 339.) upon this very interesting point recalls to my
recollection a line or two in Gilfillan's _First Gallery of Literary
Portraits_, p. 71., which bears directly upon it. Speaking of the death of
Percy Bysshe Shelley, the author says, "During all the time he spent in
Leghorn, he was in brilliant spirits, _to him a sure prognostic of coming
evil_." I may add, that I have been on terms of intimacy with various
persons who entertained a dread of finding themselves in good spirits, from
a strong conviction that some calamity would be sure to befall them. This
is a curious psychological question, worthy of attention.

_Colonel Thomas Walcot_ (Vol. vii., p. 382.) married Jane, the second
daughter of James Purcel of Craugh, co. Limerick, and had by her six sons
and two daughters: John, the eldest, who married Sarah Wright of Holt, in
Denbighshire; Thomas, Ludlow, and Joseph, which last three died unmarried;
Edward (who died an infant); William (of whom I have no present trace);
Catherine and Bridget. The latter married, first, Mr. Cox of Waterford, and
second, Robert Allen of Garranmore, co. Tipperary. John, the eldest son,
administered to his father, and possessed himself of his estates and
effects. I think his son was a John Minchin Walcot, who represented
Askeaton in Parliament in 1751, died in London in 1753, and was buried in
St. Margaret's churchyard. Two years after his death his eldest daughter
married William Cecil Pery, of the line of Viscount Pery, and had by him
Edmund Henry Pery, member of parliament for Limerick in 1786. A William
Walcot was on the Irish establishment appointed a major in the 5th Regiment
of Foot in 1769, but I cannot just now say whether, or how, he was related
to Colonel Thomas Walcot.

_Wood of the Cross: Mistletoe_ (Vol. vii., p. 437.).--Was S. S. S.'s farmer
a native of an eastern county? If he came from any part where Scandinavian
traditions may be supposed to have prevailed, there may be some connexion
between the myth, that the mistletoe furnished the wood for the cross, and
that which represents it as forming the arrow with which Hoedur, at the
instigation of Lok, the spirit of evil, killed Baldyr. I have met with a
tradition in German, that the aspen tree supplied the wood for the cross,
and hence shuddered ever after at the recollection of its guilt.

T. H. L.

The tradition to which I have been always accustomed is, that the aspen was
the tree of which the cross was formed, and that its tremulous and
quivering motion proceeded from its consciousness of the awful use to which
it had once been put.

_Andries de Graeff: Portraits at Brickwall House_ (Vol. vii, p.

related to, or the father of, Regulus de Graef, a celebrated physician and
anatomist, born in July, 1641, at Scomharen, a town in Holland, where his
father was the first architect? Regulus de Graef married in 1672, and died
in 1673, at the early age of thirty-two. He published several works,
chiefly _De Organis Generationis_, &c. (See Hutchinson's _Biographia
Medica_; and, for a complete list of his works, _Lindonius Renovatus_, p.

"_Qui facit per alium, facit per se_" (Vol. vii., p. 382.).--This is one of
the most ordinary maxims or "brocards" of the common law of Scotland, and
implies that the employer is responsible for the acts of his servant or
agent, done on his employment. Beyond doubt it is borrowed from the civil
law, and though I cannot find it in the title of the digest, _De Diversis
Regulis Juris Antiqui_ (lib. 1. tit. 17.), I am sure it will be traced
either to the "Corpus Juris," or to one of the commentators thereupon.

W. H. M.

_Christian Names_ (Vol. vii., p. 406.).--When Lord Coke says "a man cannot
have two names of baptism, as he may have divers surnames," he does not
mean that a man may not have two or more Christian names given to him at
the font, but that, while he may have "divers surnames at divers times," he
may not have divers Christian names _at divers times_.

When a man changes his Christian name, he alters his legal identity. The
surname, however, is assumable at pleasure. The use of surnames came into
England, according to Camden, about {489} the time of the Conquest, but
they were not in general use till long after that. Many branches of
families used to substitute the names of their estate or residence for
their patronymic, which often makes the tracing of genealogies a difficult
matter. It was not till the middle of the fourteenth century that surnames
began to descend from father to son, and a reference to any old document of
the time will show how arbitrarily such names were assumed.

A surname, in short, may be called a matter of convenience; a Christian
name, a matter of necessity. The giving two Christian names at baptism did
not come generally into use till, owing to the multiplication of the
patronymic, a single Christian name became insufficient to identify the
individual. Consequently an instance of a double Christian name, previous
to the commencement of the eighteenth century, is a rarity. The fifth and
sixth earls of Northumberland bore the names of Henry-Algernon Percy. The
latter died in 1537.

As to the period at which Christian names were assumed as surnames, your
correspondent ERICAS is referred to Lower's _English Surnames_.

H. C. K.

---- Rectory, Hereford.

Your correspondent ERICA will not, I think, find an instance in this
country of a person having more than one Christian name before the last
century. Charles James Fox and William Wyndham Grenville are the two
earliest instances I can find. It is trivial but curious to observe, that
in the lists given at the beginning of the _Oxford Calendar_ of the heads
of colleges and halls from their several foundations, the first who appears
with two Christian names is the venerable president of Magdalene College.
Antony Ashley Cooper is only a seeming exception; his surname was
Ashley-Cooper, as is proved by his contributing the letter _a_ to the word
_cabal_, the nickname of the ministry of which he formed a part. We find
the custom common enough in Germany at the time of the Reformation, and
still earlier in Italy. I apprehend that its origin is really in the _tria
nomina_ of Roman freemen. It was introduced into this country through our
royal family, but I am not aware of any prince who had the benefit of it
before Charles James.

I apprehend the passage which ERICA quotes from Lord Coke has not the
significance which he attributes to it. A man can have but one Christian or
baptismal name, of however many single names or words that baptismal name
may be composed. I have spoken in this letter of two Christian names, in
order to be more intelligible at the expense of correctness.

_Lamech's War-song_ (Vol. vii., p. 432.).--There have been many
speculations about the origin and meaning of these lines. I agree with
EWALD in _Die Poetischen Buecher des Alten Bundes_, vol. i., who calls it a
"sword-song;" and I imagine it might have been preserved by tradition among
the Canaanitish nations, and so quoted by Moses as familiar to the
Israelites. I should translate it--

 "Adah and Zillah, hear ye my voice!
  Wives of Lemek, heed ye my saying!
  For man do I slay, for my wound;
  And child, for my bruise.
  For seven-fold is Cain avenged,
  And Lemek seventy-fold and seven."

Bishop Hall, in his _Explication of Hard Texts_, paraphrases it thus:

    "And Lamech said to his wives, 'Adah and Zillah, what tell you me of
    any dangers and fears? Hear my voice, oh ye faint-hearted wives of
    Lamech, and hearken unto my speech; I pass not of the strength of my
    adversary: for I know my own valour and power to revenge; if any man
    give me but a wound or a stroke, though he be never so young and lusty,
    I can and will kill him dead.'"

Your correspondent H. WALTER says that "every branch of Cain's family was
destroyed by the Deluge." Where is the authority to be found for the
tradition, quoted in an _Introduction to the Books of Moses_, by James
Morison, p. 26., that Naameh, the daughter of Lamech the Cainite and
Zillah, married Ham, the son of Noah, and thus survived the Flood?

_Traitor's Ford_ (Vol. vii., p. 382.).--Nothing is known of any legend in
connexion with the stirring events of the battle of Edgehill, or its times,
and the origin of the name is a matter of speculation. One _Trait_ had
lands near this stream, and it is thought by some that, from this
circumstance, it is properly _Trait's_ Ford, corrupted into Traitor's
Ford,--a locality well known to sportsmen as a favourite meet of the
Warwickshire hounds.

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

We understand the Committee appointed by the Society of Antiquaries to
consider the best mode of restoring the Society to its former efficient
state, have agreed upon their Report, and also to the revised laws to be
recommended to the Fellows for adoption. Of the nature of alterations
suggested, we know nothing; for while, on the one hand, it is stated that
the Report recommends changes of a most sweeping character, on the other it
is rumoured that the changes to be proposed are neither many nor important.
The truth in this, as in most cases, no doubt lies midway between {490} the
two: and the Report will probably be found to breathe a spirit of
conservative reform. Embracing, as the proposed changes necessarily must,
points on which great difference of opinion has existed, and may continue
to exist, we hope they will receive the impartial consideration of the
Fellows; and that they will bear in mind, that in coming to the conclusions
at which they have arrived, the Committee have had the advantage of sources
of information, necessarily beyond the reach of the body generally; and
that those very recommendations, which at first sight may seem most open to
objection, may probably be those which their information most completely
justifies.

FIVE BONUSES have been declared: at the last in January, 1852, the sum of
131,125l. was added to the Policies, producing a Bonus varying with the
different ages from 24-1/2 to 55 per cent. on the Premiums paid during the
five years, or from 5l. to 12l. 10s. per cent. on the Sum Assured.

The small share of Profit divisible in future among the Shareholders being
now provided for, the ASSURED will hereafter derive all the benefits
obtainable from a Mutual Office, WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY OR RISK OF
PARTNERSHIP.

POLICIES effected before the 30th of June next, will be entitled, at the
next Division, to one year's additional share of Profits over later
Assurers.

On Assurances for the whole of Life only one half of the Premiums need be
paid for the first five years.

INVALID LIVES may be Assured at rates proportioned to the risk.

* EXAMPLE.--At the commencement of the year 1841, a person aged thirty took
out a Policy for 1000l., the annual payment for which is 24l. 1s. 8d.; in
1847 he had paid in premiums 168l. 11s. 8d.; but the profits being 2-1/4
per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22l. 10s. per annum for
each 1000l.) he had 157l. 10s. added to the Policy, almost as much as the
premiums paid.

The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
Director.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
