Book 41 Mark

001:001 The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

001:002 As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet, "See, I am sending My
        messenger before Thee, Who will prepare Thy way";

001:003 "The voice of one crying aloud:  'In the Desert prepare a road
        for the Lord:  Make His highways straight.'"

001:004 So John the Baptizer came, and was in the Desert proclaiming
        a baptism of the penitent for forgiveness of sins.

001:005 There went out to him people of all classes from Judaea,
        and the inhabitants of Jerusalem of all ranks, and were
        baptized by him in the river Jordan, making open confession
        of their sins.

001:006 As for John, his garment was of camel's hair, and he wore
        a loincloth of leather; and his food was locusts and wild honey.

001:007 His announcement was, "There is One coming after me mightier
        than I--One whose sandal-strap I am unworthy to stoop
        down and unfasten.

001:008 I have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you
        with the Holy Spirit."

001:009 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized
        by John in the Jordan;

001:010 and immediately on His coming up out of the water He saw
        an opening in the sky, and the Spirit like a dove coming
        down to Him;

001:011 and a voice came from the sky, saying, "Thou art My Son dearly loved:
        in Thee is My delight."

001:012 At once the Spirit impelled Him to go out into the Desert,

001:013 where He remained for forty days, tempted by Satan; and He
        was among the wild beasts, but the angels waited upon Him.

001:014 Then, after John had been thrown into prison, Jesus came
        into Galilee proclaiming God's Good News.

001:015 "The time has fully come," He said, "and the Kingdom of God
        is close at hand:  repent, and believe this Good News.

001:016 One day, passing along the shore of the Lake of Galilee, He saw
        Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, throwing their nets in the Lake;
        for they were fisherman.

001:017 "Come and follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you
        fishers for men."

001:018 At once they left their nets and followed Him.

001:019 Going on a little further He saw James the son of Zabdi and his
        brother John:  they also were in the boat mending the nets,
        and He immediately called them.

001:020 They therefore left their father Zabdi in the boat with
        the hired men, and went and followed Him.

001:021 So they came to Capernaum, and on the next Sabbath He went
        to the synagogue and began to teach.

001:022 The people listened with amazement to His teaching--
        for there was authority about it:  it was very different
        from that of the Scribes--

001:023 when all at once, there in their synagogue, a man under the power
        of a foul spirit screamed out:

001:024 "What have you to do with us, Jesus the Nazarene?  Have you
        come to destroy us?  I know who you are--God's Holy One."

001:025 But Jesus reprimanded him, saying, "Silence! come out of him."

001:026 So the foul spirit, after throwing the man into convulsions,
        came out of him with a loud cry.

001:027 And all were amazed and awe-struck, so they began to ask one another,
        "What does this mean?  Here is a new sort of teaching--
        and a tone of authority!  And even to foul spirits he issues
        orders and they obey him!"

001:028 And His fame spread at once everywhere in all that part of Galilee.

001:029 Then on leaving the synagogue they came at once, with James
        and John, to the house of Simon and Andrew.

001:030 Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill in bed with a fever,
        and without delay they informed Him about her.

001:031 So He went to her, and taking her hand He raised her to her feet:
        the fever left her, and she began to wait upon them.

001:032 When it was evening, after sunset people came bringing Him
        all who were sick and the demoniacs;

001:033 and the whole town was assembled at the door.

001:034 Then He cured numbers of people who were ill with various diseases,
        and He drove out many demons; not allowing the demons to speak,
        because they knew who He was.

001:035 In the morning He rose early, while it was still quite dark,
        and leaving the house He went away to a solitary place
        and there prayed.

001:036 And Simon and the others searched everywhere for Him.

001:037 When they found Him they said, "Every one is looking for you."

001:038 "Let us go elsewhere, to the neighbouring country towns,"
        He replied, "that I may proclaim my Message there also;
        because for that purpose I came from God."

001:039 And He went through all Galilee, preaching in the synagogues
        and expelling the demons.

001:040 One day there came a leper to Jesus entreating Him,
        and pleading on his knees.  "If you are willing," he said,
        "you are able to cleanse me."

001:041 Moved with pity Jesus reached out His hand and touched him.
        "I am willing," He said; "be cleansed."

001:042 The leprosy at once left him, and he was cleansed.

001:043 Jesus at once sent him away, strictly charging him,

001:044 and saying, "Be careful not to tell any one, but go and show
        yourself to the Priest, and for your purification present
        the offerings that Moses appointed as evidence for them."

001:045 But the man, when he went out, began to tell every one and to
        publish the matter abroad, so that it was no longer possible
        for Jesus to go openly into any town; but He had to remain
        outside in unfrequented places, where people came to Him
        from all parts.

002:001 After some days He entered Capernaum again, and it soon became
        known that He was at home;

002:002 and such numbers of people came together that there was no
        longer room for them even round the door.  He was speaking
        His Message to them,

002:003 when there came a party of people bringing a paralytic--
        four men carrying him.

002:004 Finding themselves unable, however, to bring him to Jesus
        because of the crowd, they untiled the roof just over His head,
        and after clearing an opening they lowered the mat on which
        the paralytic was lying.

002:005 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "My son,
        your sins are pardoned."

002:006 Now there were some of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning
        in their hearts.

002:007 "Why does this man use such words?" they said; "he is blaspheming.
        Who can pardon sins but One--that is, God?"

002:008 At once perceiving by His spirit that they were reasoning
        within themselves, Jesus asked them, "Why do you thus argue
        in your minds?

002:009 Which is easier?--to say to this paralytic, 'Your sins are pardoned,'
        or to say, 'Rise, take up your mat, and walk?'

002:010 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth
        to pardon sins"--He turned to the paralytic, and said,

002:011 "To you I say, 'Rise, take up your mat and go home.'"

002:012 The man rose, and immediately under the eyes of all took
        up his mat and went out, so that they were all filled
        with astonishment, gave the glory to God, and said,
        "We never saw anything like this."

002:013 Again He went out to the shore of the Lake, and the whole
        multitude kept coming to Him, and He taught them.

002:014 And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus
        sitting at the Toll Office, and said to him, "Follow me."
        So he rose and followed Him.

002:015 When He was sitting at table in Levi's house, a large number
        of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners were at table
        with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many such who
        habitually followed Him.

002:016 But when the Scribes of the Pharisee sect saw Him eating with
        the sinners and the tax-gatherers, they said to His disciples,
        "He is eating and drinking with the tax-gatherers and sinners!"

002:017 Jesus heard the words, and He said, "It is not the healthy
        who require a doctor, but the sick:  I did not come to appeal
        to the righteous, but to sinners."

002:018 (Now John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were keeping
        a fast.)  And they came and asked Him, "How is it that
        John's disciples and those of the Pharisees are fasting,
        and yours are not?"

002:019 "Can a wedding party fast while the bridegroom is among them?"
        replied Jesus.  "So long as they have the bridegroom with them,
        fasting is impossible.

002:020 But a time will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away
        from them; then they will fast.

002:021 No one mends an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth.
        Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away from it--
        the new from the old--and a worse hole would be made.

002:022 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins.  Otherwise the wine
        would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost.
        New wine needs fresh skins!"

002:023 One Sabbath He was walking through the wheatfields when His
        disciples began to pluck the ears of wheat as they went.

002:024 So the Pharisees said to Him, "Look! why are they doing what on
        the Sabbath is unlawful?"

002:025 "Have you never read," Jesus replied, "what David did when
        the necessity arose and he and his men were hungry:

002:026 how he entered the house of God in the High-priesthood of Abiathar,
        and ate the Presented Loaves--which none but the priests
        are allowed to eat--and gave some to his men also?"

002:027 And Jesus said to them:  "The Sabbath was made for man,
        not man for the Sabbath;

002:028 so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

003:001 At another time, when He went to the synagogue, there was a man
        there with one arm shrivelled up.

003:002 They closely watched Him to see whether He would cure him
        on the Sabbath--so as to have a charge to bring against Him.

003:003 "Come forward," said He to the man with the shrivelled arm.

003:004 Then He asked them, "Are we allowed to do good on the Sabbath,
        or to do evil? to save a life, or to destroy one?"
        They remained silent.

003:005 Grieved and indignant at the hardening of their hearts,
        He looked round on them with anger, and said to the man,
        "Stretch out your arm."  He stretched it out, and the arm
        was completely restored.

003:006 But no sooner had the Pharisees left the synagogue than they
        held a consultation with the Herodians against Jesus,
        to devise some means of destroying Him.

003:007 Accordingly Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the Lake,
        and a vast crowd of people from Galilee followed Him;

003:008 and from Judaea and Jerusalem and Idumaea and from beyond
        the Jordan and from the district of Tyre and Sidon there came
        to Him a vast crowd, hearing of all that He was doing.

003:009 So He gave directions to His disciples to keep a small
        boat in constant attendance on Him because of the throng--
        to prevent their crushing Him.

003:010 For He had cured many of the people, so that all who had any
        ailments pressed upon Him, to touch Him.

003:011 And the foul spirits, whenever they saw Him, threw themselves
        down at His feet, screaming out:  "You are the Son of God."

003:012 But He many a time checked them, forbidding them to say
        who He was.

003:013 Then He went up the hill; and those whom He Himself chose
        He called, and they came to Him.

003:014 He appointed twelve of them, that they might be with Him,
        and that He might also send them to proclaim His Message,

003:015 with authority to expel the demons.

003:016 These twelve were Simon (to whom He gave the surname of Peter),

003:017 James the son of Zabdi and John the brother of James
        (these two He surnamed Boanerges, that is 'Sons of Thunder'),

003:018 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son
        of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananaean,

003:019 and Judas Iscariot, the man who also betrayed Him.

003:020 And He went into a house.  But again the crowd assembled,
        so that there was no opportunity for them even to snatch a meal.

003:021 Hearing of this, His relatives came to seize Him by force,
        for they said, "He is out of his mind."

003:022 The Scribes, too, who had come down from Jerusalem said,
        "He has Baal-zebul in him; and it is by the power of the Prince
        of the demons that he expels the demons."

003:023 So He called them to Him, and using figurative language He
        appealed to them, saying, "How is it possible for Satan
        to expel Satan?

003:024 For if civil war breaks out in a kingdom, nothing can make
        that kingdom last;

003:025 and if a family splits into parties, that family cannot continue.

003:026 So if Satan has risen in arms and has made war upon himself,
        stand he cannot, but meets his end.

003:027 Nay, no one can go into a strong man's house and carry off
        his property, unless he first binds the strong man, and then
        he will plunder his house.

003:028 In solemn truth I tell you that all their sins may be pardoned
        to the sons of men, and all their blasphemies, however they
        may have blasphemed;

003:029 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, he remains
        for ever unabsolved:  he is guilty of a sin of the Ages."

003:030 This was because they said, "He is possessed by a foul spirit."

003:031 By this time His mother and His brothers arrive, and standing
        outside they send a message to Him to call Him.

003:032 Now a crowd was sitting round Him; so they tell Him, "Your mother
        and your brothers and sisters are outside, inquiring for you."

003:033 "Who are my mother and my brothers?"  He replied.

003:034 And, fixing His eyes on the people who were sitting round Him
        in a circle, He said,

003:035 "Here are my mother and my brothers.  For wherever there
        is one who has been obedient to God, there is my brother--
        my sister--and my mother."

004:001 Once more He began to teach by the side of the Lake,
        and a vast multitude of people came together to listen to Him.
        He therefore went on board the boat and sat there, a little
        way from the land; and all the people were on the shore close
        to the water.

004:002 Then He proceeded to teach them many lessons in figurative language;
        and in His teaching He said,

004:003 "Listen: the sower goes out to sow.

004:004 As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds
        come and peck it up.

004:005 Some falls on the rocky ground where it finds but little earth,
        and it shoots up quickly because it has no depth of soil;

004:006 but when the sun is risen, it is scorched, and through having
        no root it withers away.

004:007 Some, again, falls among the thorns; and the thorns spring up
        and stifle it, so that it yields no crop.

004:008 But some of the seed falls into good ground, and gives a return:
        it comes up and increases, and yields thirty, sixty,
        or a hundred-fold."

004:009 "Listen," He added, "every one who has ears to listen with!"

004:010 When He was alone, the Twelve and the others who were about Him
        requested Him to explain His figurative language.

004:011 "To you," He replied, "has been entrusted the secret truth
        concerning the Kingdom of God; but to those others outside
        your number all this is spoken in figurative language;

004:012 that "'They may look and look but not see, and listen and
        listen but not understand, lest perchance they should return
        and be pardoned.'"

004:013 "Do you all miss the meaning of this parable?"  He added;
        "how then will you understand the rest of my parables?"

004:014 "What the sower sows is the Message.

004:015 Those who receive the seed by the way-side are those in whom
        the Message is sown, but, when they have heard it, Satan comes
        at once and carries away the Message sown in them.

004:016 In the same way those who receive the seed on the rocky
        places are those who, when they have heard the Message,
        at once accept it joyfully,

004:017 but they have no root within them.  They last for a time;
        then, when suffering or persecution comes because of the Message,
        they are immediately overthrown.

004:018 Others there are who receive the seed among the thorns:
        these are they who have heard the Message,

004:019 but worldly cares and the deceitfulness of wealth and the excessive
        pursuit of other objects come in and stifle the Message,
        and it becomes unfruitful.

004:020 Those, on the other hand, who have received the seed on
        the good ground, are all who hear the Message and welcome it,
        and yield a return of thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold."

004:021 He went on to say, "Is the lamp brought in in order to be put
        under the bushel or under the bed?  Is it not rather in order
        that it may be placed on the lampstand?

004:022 Why, there is nothing hidden except with a view to its being
        ultimately disclosed, nor has anything been made a secret
        but that it may at last come to light.

004:023 Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"

004:024 He also said to them, "Take care what you hear.
        With what measure you measure, it will be measured to you,
        and that with interest.

004:025 For those who have will have more given them; and from those
        who have not, even what they have will be taken away."

004:026 Another saying of His was this:  "The Kingdom of God is as if
        a man scattered seed over the ground:

004:027 he spends days and nights, now awake, now asleep, while the seed
        sprouts and grows tall, he knows not how.

004:028 Of itself the land produces the crop--first the blade, then the ear;
        afterwards the perfect grain is seen in the ear.

004:029 But no sooner is the crop ripe, than he sends the reapers,
        because the time of harvest has come."

004:030 Another saying of His was this:  "How are we to picture the Kingdom
        of God? or by what figure of speech shall we represent it?

004:031 It is like a mustard-seed, which, when sown in the earth,
        is the smallest of all the seeds in the world;

004:032 yet when sown it springs up and becomes larger than all the herbs,
        and throws out great branches, so that the birds build
        under its shadow."

004:033 With many such parables He used to speak the Message to them
        according to their capacity for receiving it.

004:034 But except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them;
        while to His own disciples He expounded everything, in private.

004:035 The same day, in the evening, He said to them, "Let us cross
        to the other side."

004:036 So they got away from the crowd, and took Him--as He was--
        in the boat; and other boats accompanied Him.

004:037 But a heavy squall came on, and the waves were now dashing
        into the boat, so that it was fast filling.

004:038 But He Himself was in the stern asleep, with His head on the cushion:
        so they woke Him.  "Rabbi," they cried, "is it nothing to you
        that we are drowning?"

004:039 So He roused Himself and rebuked the wind, and said to
        the waves, "Silence!  Be still!"  The wind sank, and a perfect
        calm set in.

004:040 "Why are you so timid?"  He asked; "have you still no faith?"

004:041 Then they were filled with terror, and began to say to one another,
        "Who is this, then?  For even wind and sea obey Him."

005:001 So they arrived at the opposite shore of the Lake, in the country
        of the Gerasenes.

005:002 At once, on His landing, there came from the tombs to meet
        Him a man possessed by a foul spirit.

005:003 This man lived among the tombs, nor could any one now secure
        him even with a chain;

005:004 for many a time he had been left securely bound in fetters
        and chains, but afterwards the chains lay torn link from link,
        and the fetters in fragments, and there was no one strong
        enough to master him.

005:005 And constantly, day and night, he remained among the tombs or on
        the hills, shrieking, and mangling himself with sharp stones.

005:006 And when he saw Jesus in the distance, he ran and threw himself
        at His feet,

005:007 crying out in a loud voice, "What hast Thou to do with me,
        Jesus, Son of God Most High?  In God's name I implore Thee
        not to torment me."

005:008 For He had said to him, "Foul spirit, come out of the man."

005:009 Jesus also questioned him.  "What is your name?"
        He said.  "Legion," he replied, "for there are a host of us."

005:010 And he earnestly entreated Him not to send them away out
        of the country.

005:011 Feeding there, on the mountain slope, was a great herd of swine.

005:012 So they besought Jesus.  "Send us to the swine," they said,
        "so that we may enter into them."

005:013 He gave them leave; and the foul spirits came out and entered
        into the swine, and the herd--about 2,000 in number--
        rushed headlong down the cliff into the Lake and were drowned
        in the Lake.

005:014 The swineherds fled, and spread the news in town and country.
        So the people came to see what it was that had happened;

005:015 and when they came to Jesus, they beheld the demoniac quietly seated,
        clothed and of sane mind--the man who had had the legion;
        and they were awe-stricken.

005:016 And those who had seen it told them the particulars of what had
        happened to the demoniac, and all about the swine.

005:017 Then they began entreating Him to depart from their district.

005:018 As He was embarking, the man who had been possessed asked
        permission to accompany Him.

005:019 But He would not allow it.  "Go home to your family," He said,
        "and report to them all that the Lord has done for you,
        and the mercy He has shown you."

005:020 So the man departed, and related publicly everywhere in the Ten Towns
        all that Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.

005:021 When Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the other side,
        a vast multitude came crowding to Him; and He was on the shore
        of the Lake,

005:022 when there came one of the Wardens of the Synagogue--
        he was called Jair--who, on beholding Him, threw himself
        at His feet,

005:023 and besought Him with many entreaties.  "My little daughter,"
        he said, "is at the point of death:  I pray you come and lay
        your hands upon her, that she may recover and live."

005:024 And Jesus went with him.  And a dense crowd followed Him,
        and thronged Him on all sides.

005:025 Now a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,

005:026 and had undergone many different treatments under a number
        of doctors and had spent all she had without receiving benefit
        but on the contrary growing worse,

005:027 heard of Jesus.  And she came in the crowd behind Him and
        touched His cloak;

005:028 for she said, "If I but touch His clothes, I shall be cured."

005:029 In a moment the flow of her blood ceased, and she felt in herself
        that her complaint was cured.

005:030 Immediately Jesus, well knowing that healing power had gone
        from within Him, turned round in the crowd and asked,
        "Who touched my clothes?"

005:031 "You see the multitude pressing you on all sides,"
        His disciples exclaimed, "and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"

005:032 But He continued looking about to see the person who had done this,

005:033 until the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what
        had happened to her, came and threw herself at His feet,
        and told Him all the truth.

005:034 "Daughter," He said, "your faith has cured you:  go in peace,
        and be free from your complaint."

005:035 While He is yet speaking, men come from the house to the Warden,
        and say, "Your daughter is dead:  why trouble the Rabbi further?"

005:036 But Jesus, overhearing the words, said to the Warden, "Do not
        be afraid; only have faith."

005:037 And He allowed no one to accompany Him except Peter and
        the brothers James and John.

005:038 So they come to the Warden's house.  Here He gazes on a scene
        of uproar, with people weeping aloud and wailing.

005:039 He goes in.  "Why all this outcry and loud weeping?"
        He asks; "the child is asleep, not dead."

005:040 To this their reply is a scornful laugh.  He, however, puts them
        all out, takes the child's father and mother and those He has
        brought with Him, and enters the room where the child lies.

005:041 Then, taking her by the hand, He says to her, "Talitha, koum;"
        that is to say, "Little girl, I command you to wake!"

005:042 Instantly the little girl rises to her feet and begins to walk
        (for she was twelve years old).  They were at once beside
        themselves with utter astonishment;

005:043 but He gave strict injunctions that the matter should not be
        made known, and directed them to give her something to eat.

006:001 Leaving that place He came into His own country, accompanied
        by His disciples.

006:002 On the Sabbath He proceeded to teach in the synagogue; and many,
        as they heard Him, were astonished.  "Where did he acquire all this?"
        they asked.  "What is this wisdom that has been given to him?
        And what are these marvellous miracles which his hands perform?

006:003 Is not this the carpenter, Mary's son, the brother of James
        and Joses, Jude and Simon?  And do not his sisters live
        here among us?"  So they turned angrily away.

006:004 But Jesus said to them, "There is no Prophet without honour
        except in his own country, and among his own relatives,
        and in his own home."

006:005 And He could not do any miracle there, except that He laid His
        hands on a few who were out of health and cured them; and

006:006 He wondered at their unbelief.  So He went round the
        adjacent villages, teaching.

006:007 Then summoning the Twelve to Him, He proceeded to send them
        out by twos, and gave them authority over the foul spirits.

006:008 He charged them to take nothing for the journey except a stick;
        no bread, no bag, and not a penny in their pockets,

006:009 but to go wearing sandals.  "And do not," He said, "put on
        an extra under garment.

006:010 Wherever you enter a house, make it your home till you
        leave that place.

006:011 But wherever they will not receive you or listen to you,
        when you leave shake off the very dust from under your feet
        to bear witness concerning them."

006:012 So they set out, and preached in order that men might repent.

006:013 Many demons they expelled, and many invalids they anointed
        with oil and cured.

006:014 King Herod heard of all this (for the name of Jesus had become
        widely known), and he kept saying, "John the Baptizer has
        come back to life, and that is why these miraculous Powers
        are working in him."

006:015 Others asserted that He was Elijah.  Others again said,
        "He is a Prophet, like one of the great Prophets."

006:016 But when Herod heard of Him, he said, "The John, whom I beheaded,
        has come back to life."

006:017 For Herod himself had sent and had had John arrested and had
        kept him in prison in chains, for the sake of Herodias,
        his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.

006:018 For John had repeatedly told Herod, "You have no right to be
        living with your brother's wife."

006:019 Therefore Herodias hated him and wished to take his life,
        but could not;

006:020 for Herod stood in awe of John, knowing him to be an upright
        and holy man, and he protected him.  After listening to him he was
        in great perplexity, and yet he found a pleasure in listening.

006:021 At length Herodias found her opportunity.  Herod on his birthday
        gave a banquet to the nobles of his court and to the tribunes
        and the principal people in Galilee,

006:022 at which Herodias's own daughter came in and danced,
        and so charmed Herod and his guests that he said to her,
        "Ask me for anything you please, and I will give it to you."

006:023 He even swore to her, "Whatever you ask me for I will give you,
        up to half my kingdom."

006:024 She at once went out and said to her mother:  "What shall I ask for?"
        "The head of John the Baptizer," she replied.

006:025 The girl immediately came in, in haste, to the King and made
        her request.  "My desire is," she said, "that you will give me,
        here and now, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist."

006:026 Then the King, though intensely sorry, yet for the sake of his oaths,
        and of his guests, would not break faith with her.

006:027 He at once sent a soldier of his guard with orders to bring
        John's head.  So he went and beheaded him in the prison,

006:028 and brought his head on a dish and gave it to the young girl,
        who gave it to her mother.

006:029 When John's disciples heard of it, they came and took away
        his body and laid it in a tomb.

006:030 When the Apostles had re-assembled round Jesus, they reported
        to Him all they had done and all they had taught.

006:031 Then He said to them, "Come away, all of you, to a quiet place,
        and rest awhile."  For there were many coming and going,
        so that they had no time even for meals.

006:032 Accordingly they sailed away in the boat to a solitary place apart.

006:033 But the people saw them going, and many knew them; and coming
        by land they ran together there from all the neighbouring towns,
        and arrived before them.

006:034 So when Jesus landed, He saw a vast multitude; and His heart
        was moved with pity for them, because they were like sheep which
        have no shepherd, and He proceeded to teach them many things.

006:035 By this time it was late; so His disciples came to Him, and said,
        "This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late:

006:036 send them away that they may go to the farms and villages near
        here and buy themselves something to eat."

006:037 "Give them food yourselves," He replied.  "Are we," they asked,
        "to go and buy two hundred shillings' worth of bread and
        give them food?"

006:038 "How many loaves have you?"  He inquired; "go and see."
        So they found out, and said, "Five; and a couple of fish."

006:039 So He directed them to make all sit down in companies on
        the green grass.

006:040 And they sat down in rows of hundreds and of fifties.

006:041 Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and lifting His eyes
        to Heaven He blessed the food.  Then He broke the loaves into
        portions which He went on handing to the disciples to distribute;
        giving pieces also of the two fish to them all.

006:042 All ate and were fully satisfied.

006:043 And they carried away broken portions enough to fill twelve baskets,
        besides pieces of the fish.

006:044 Those who ate the bread were 5,000 adult men.

006:045 Immediately afterwards He made His disciples go on board
        the boat and cross over to Bethsaida, leaving Him behind
        to dismiss the crowd.

006:046 He then bade the people farewell, and went away up the hill to pray.

006:047 When evening was come, the boat was half way across the Lake,
        while he Himself was on shore alone.

006:048 But when He saw them distressed with rowing (for the wind was
        against them), towards morning He came towards them walking
        on the Lake, as if intending to pass them.

006:049 They saw Him walking on the water, and thinking that it was
        a spirit they cried out;

006:050 for they all saw Him and were terrified.  He, however,
        immediately spoke to them.  "There is no danger," He said;
        "it is I; be not alarmed."

006:051 Then He went up to them on board the boat, and the wind lulled;
        and they were beside themselves with silent amazement.

006:052 For they had not learned the lesson taught by the loaves,
        but their minds were dull.

006:053 Having crossed over they drew to land in Gennesaret and
        came to anchor.

006:054 But no sooner had they gone ashore than the people
        immediately recognized Him.

006:055 Then they scoured the whole district, and began to bring Him
        the sick on their mats wherever they heard He was.

006:056 And enter wherever He might--village or town or hamlet--
        they laid their sick in the open places, and entreated
        Him to let them touch were it but the tassel of His robe;
        and all, whoever touched Him, were restored to health.

007:001 Then the Pharisees, with certain Scribes who had come from Jerusalem,
        came to Him in a body.

007:002 They had noticed that some of His disciples were eating their
        food with 'unclean' (that is to say, unwashed) hands.

007:003 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews--being, as they are,
        zealous for the traditions of the Elders--never eat without
        first carefully washing their hands,

007:004 and when they come from market they will not eat without
        bathing first; and they have a good many other customs
        which they have received traditionally and cling to,
        such as the rinsing of cups and pots and of bronze utensils,
        and the washing of beds.)

007:005 So the Pharisees and Scribes put the question to Him:  "Why do
        your disciples transgress the traditions of the Elders,
        and eat their food with unclean hands?"

007:006 "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites," He replied;
        "as it is written, "'This People honour Me with their lips,
        while their hearts are far away from Me:

007:007 But idle is their devotion while they lay down precepts
        which are mere human rules.'

007:008 "You neglect God's Commandment:  you hold fast to men's traditions."

007:009 "Praiseworthy indeed!"  He added, "to set at nought
        God's Commandment in order to observe your own traditions!

007:010 For Moses said, 'Honour thy father and thy mother' and again,
        'He who curses father or mother, let him die the death.'

007:011 But *you* say, 'If a man says to his father or mother, It is
        a Korban (that is, a thing devoted to God), whatever it is,
        which otherwise you would have received from me--'

007:012 And so you no longer allow him to do anything for his
        father or mother,

007:013 thus nullifying God's precept by your tradition which you
        have handed down.  And many things of that kind you do."

007:014 Then Jesus called the people to Him again.  "Listen to me,
        all of you," He said, "and understand.

007:015 There is nothing outside a man which entering him can make
        him unclean; but it is the things which come out of a man
        that make him unclean."

007:016 []

007:017 After He had left the crowd and gone indoors, His disciples
        began to ask Him about this figure of speech.

007:018 "Have *you* also so little understanding?"  He replied;
        "do you not understand that anything whatever that enters
        a man from outside cannot make him unclean,

007:019 because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach,
        and passes away ejected from him?"  By these words Jesus
        pronounced all kinds of food clean.

007:020 "What comes out of a man," He added, "that it is which
        makes him unclean.

007:021 For from within, out of men's hearts, their evil purposes proceed--
        fornication, theft, murder, adultery,

007:022 covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy,
        reviling, pride, reckless folly:

007:023 all these wicked things come out from within and make
        a man unclean."

007:024 Then He rose and left that place and went into the neighbourhood
        of Tyre and Sidon.  Here He entered a house and wished no
        one to know it, but He could not escape observation.

007:025 Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by a foul
        spirit heard of Him, and came and flung herself at His feet.

007:026 She was a Gentile woman, a Syro-phoenician by nation:
        and again and again she begged Him to expel the demon
        from her daughter.

007:027 "Let the children first eat all they want," He said;
        "it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it
        to the dogs."

007:028 "True, Sir," she replied, "and yet the dogs under the table
        eat the children's scraps."

007:029 "For those words of yours, go home," He replied; "the demon
        has gone out of your daughter."

007:030 So she went home, and found the child lying on the bed,
        and the demon gone.

007:031 Returning from the neighbourhood of Tyre, He came by way
        of Sidon to the Lake of Galilee, passing through the district
        of the Ten Towns.

007:032 Here they brought to Him a deaf man that stammered, on whom
        they begged Him to lay His hands.

007:033 So Jesus taking him aside, apart from the crowd, put His
        fingers into his ears, and spat, and moistened his tongue;

007:034 and looking up to Heaven He sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!"
        (that is, "Open!")

007:035 And the man's ears were opened, and his tongue became untied,
        and he began to speak perfectly.

007:036 Then Jesus charged them to tell no one; but the more He charged them,
        all the more did they spread the news far and wide.

007:037 The amazement was extreme.  "He succeeds in everything
        he attempts," they exclaimed; "he even makes deaf men hear
        and dumb men speak!"

008:001 About that time there was again an immense crowd, and they
        found themselves with nothing to eat.  So He called His
        disciples to Him.

008:002 "My heart yearns over the people," He said; "for this is now
        the third day they have remained with me, and they have
        nothing to eat.

008:003 If I were to send them home hungry, they would faint on the way,
        some of them having come a great distance."

008:004 "Where can we possibly get bread here in this remote place
        to satisfy such a crowd?" answered His disciples.

008:005 "How many loaves have you?"  He asked.  "Seven," they said.

008:006 So He passed the word to the people to sit down on the ground.
        Then taking the seven loaves He blessed them, and broke them
        into portions and proceeded to give them to His disciples for
        them to distribute, and they distributed them to the people.

008:007 They had also a few small fish.  He blessed them, and He told
        His disciples to distribute these also.

008:008 So the people ate an abundant meal; and what remained over they
        picked up and carried away--seven hampers of broken pieces.

008:009 The number fed were about 4,000. Then He sent them away,

008:010 and at once going on board with His disciples He came into
        the district of Dalmanutha.

008:011 The Pharisees followed Him and began to dispute with Him,
        asking Him for a sign in the sky, to make trial of Him.

008:012 Heaving a deep and troubled sigh, He said, "Why do the men
        of to-day ask for a sign?  In solemn truth I tell you that no
        sign will be given to the men of to-day."

008:013 So He left them, went on board again, and came away to
        the other side.

008:014 Now they had forgotten to take bread, nor had they more than
        a single loaf with them in the boat;

008:015 and when He admonished them, "See to it, be on your guard
        against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod,"

008:016 they explained His words to one another by saying,
        "We have no bread!"

008:017 He perceived what they were saying, and He said to them,
        "What is this discussion of yours about having no bread?
        Do you not yet see and understand?  Are your minds so
        dull of comprehension?

008:018 You have eyes! can you not see?  You have ears! can you not
        hear? and have you no memory?

008:019 When I broke up the five loaves for the 5,000 men, how many
        baskets did you carry away full of broken portions?"
        "Twelve," they said.

008:020 "And when the seven for the 4,000, how many hampers full
        of portions did you take away?"  "Seven," they answered.

008:021 "Do you not yet understand?"  He said.

008:022 And they came to Bethsaida.  And a blind man was brought
        to Jesus and they entreated Him to touch him.

008:023 So He took the blind man by the arm and brought him out
        of the village, and spitting into his eyes He put His hands
        on him and asked him, "Can you see anything?"

008:024 He looked up and said, "I can see the people:  I see them
        like trees--only walking."

008:025 Then for the second time He put His hands on the man's eyes,
        and the man, looking steadily, recovered his sight and
        saw everything distinctly.

008:026 So He sent him home, and added, "Do not even go into the village."

008:027 From that place Jesus and His disciples went to the villages
        belonging to Caesarea Philippi.  On the way He began to ask
        His disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"

008:028 "John the Baptist," they replied, "but others say Elijah,
        and others, that it is one of the Prophets."

008:029 Then He asked them pointedly, "But you yourselves, who do you
        say that I am?"  "You are the Christ," answered Peter.

008:030 And He strictly forbad them to tell this about Him to any one.

008:031 And now for the first time He told them, "The Son of Man
        must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the Elders
        and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death,
        and after two days rise to life."

008:032 This He told them plainly; whereupon Peter took Him and began
        to remonstrate with Him.

008:033 But turning round and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter.
        "Get behind me, Adversary," He said, "for your thoughts are
        not God's thoughts, but men's."

008:034 Then calling to Him the crowd and also His disciples, He said
        to them, "If any one is desirous of following me, let him
        ignore self and take up his cross, and so be my follower.

008:035 For whoever is bent on securing his life will lose it,
        but he who loses his life for my sake, and for the sake
        of the Good News, will secure it.

008:036 Why, what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world
        and forfeit his life?

008:037 For what could a man give to buy back his life?

008:038 Every one, however, who has been ashamed of me and of my
        teachings in this faithless and sinful age, of him the Son
        of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in His Father's
        glory with the holy angels."

009:001 He went on to say, "In solemn truth I tell you that some of
        those who are standing here will certainly not taste death till
        they have seen the Kingdom of God already come in power."

009:002 Six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John,
        and brought them alone, apart from the rest, up a high mountain;
        and in their presence His appearance underwent a change.

009:003 His garments also became dazzling with brilliant whiteness--
        such whiteness as no bleaching on earth could give.

009:004 Moreover there appeared to them Elijah accompanied by Moses;
        and the two were conversing with Jesus,

009:005 when Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, we are thankful to you
        that we are here.  Let us put up three tents--one for you,
        one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

009:006 For he knew not what to say:  they were filled with such awe.

009:007 Then there came a cloud spreading over them, and a voice
        issued from the cloud, "This is my Son, dearly loved:
        listen to Him."

009:008 Instantly they looked round, and now they could no longer see
        any one, but themselves and Jesus.

009:009 As they were coming down from the mountain, He very strictly
        forbad them to tell any one what they had seen "until after
        the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."

009:010 So they kept the matter to themselves, although frequently
        asking one another what was meant by the rising from the dead.

009:011 They also asked Him, "How is it that the Scribes say that Elijah
        must first come?"

009:012 "Elijah," He replied, "does indeed come first and reforms everything;
        but how is it that it is written of the Son of Man that He
        will endure much suffering and be held in contempt?

009:013 Yet I tell you that not only has Elijah come, but they have
        also done to him whatever they chose, as the Scriptures
        say about him."

009:014 As they came to rejoin the disciples, they saw an immense crowd
        surrounding them and a party of Scribes disputing with them.

009:015 Immediately the whole multitude on beholding Him were astonished
        and awe-struck, and yet they ran forward and greeted Him.

009:016 "What is the subject you are discussing?"  He asked them.

009:017 "Rabbi," answered one of the crowd, "I have brought you my son.
        He has a dumb spirit in him;

009:018 and wherever it comes upon him, it dashes him to the ground,
        and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is
        pining away.  I begged your disciples to expel it, but they
        had not the power."

009:019 "O unbelieving generation!" replied Jesus; "how long must
        I be with you? how long must I have patience with you?
        Bring the boy to me."

009:020 So they brought him to Jesus.  And the spirit, when he saw Jesus,
        immediately threw the youth into convulsions, so that he fell
        on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.

009:021 Then Jesus asked the father, "How long has he been like this?"
        "From early childhood," he said;

009:022 "and often it has thrown him into the fire or into pools
        of water to destroy him.  But, if you possibly can, have pity
        on us and help us."

009:023 "'If I possibly can!'" replied Jesus; "why, everything is
        possible to him who believes."

009:024 Immediately the father cried out, "I do believe:
        strengthen my weak faith."

009:025 Then Jesus, seeing that an increasing crowd was running
        towards Him, rebuked the foul spirit, and said to it,
        "Dumb and deaf spirit, *I* command you, come out of him
        and never enter into him again."

009:026 So with a loud cry he threw the boy into fit after fit, and came out.
        The boy looked as if he were dead, so that most of them said
        he was dead;

009:027 but Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood
        on his feet.

009:028 After the return of Jesus to the house His disciples asked
        Him privately, "How is it that we could not expel the spirit?"

009:029 "An evil spirit of this kind," He answered, "can only be driven
        out by prayer."

009:030 Departing thence they passed through Galilee, and He was
        unwilling that any one should know it;

009:031 for He was teaching His disciples, and telling them,
        "The Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of men,
        and they will put Him to death; and after being put to death,
        in three days He will rise to life again."

009:032 They, however, did not understand what He meant, and were afraid
        to question Him.

009:033 So they came to Capernaum; and when in the house He asked them,
        "What were you arguing about on the way?"

009:034 But they remained silent; for on the way they had debated
        with one another who was the chief of them.

009:035 Then sitting down He called the Twelve, and said to them,
        "If any one wishes to be first, he must be last of all and
        servant of all."

009:036 And taking a young child He made him stand in their midst,
        then threw His arms round him and said,

009:037 "Whoever for my sake receives one such young child as this,
        receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not so much
        me as Him who sent me."

009:038 "Rabbi," said John to Him, "we saw a man making use of your name
        to expel demons, and we tried to hinder him, on the ground
        that he did not follow us."

009:039 "You should not have tried to hinder him," replied Jesus,
        "for there is no one who will use my name to perform a miracle
        and be able the next minute to speak evil of me.

009:040 He who is not against us is for us;

009:041 and whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you
        belong to Christ, I solemnly tell you that he will certainly
        not lose his reward.

009:042 "And whoever shall occasion the fall of one of these little
        ones who believe, he would be better off if, with a millstone
        round his neck, he were lying at the bottom of the sea.

009:043 If your hand should cause you to sin, cut it off:
        it would be better for you to enter into Life maimed, than remain
        in possession of both your hands and go away into Gehenna,
        into the fire which cannot be put out.

009:044 []

009:045 Or if your foot should cause you to sin, cut it off:
        it would be better for you to enter into Life crippled, than remain
        in possession of both your feet and be thrown into Gehenna.

009:046 []

009:047 Or if your eye should cause you to sin, tear it out.
        It would be better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God
        half-blind than remain in possession of two eyes and be
        thrown into Gehenna,

009:048 where their worm does not die and the fire does not go out.

009:049 Every one, however, will be salted with fire.

009:050 Salt is a good thing, but if the salt should become tasteless,
        what will you use to give it saltness?  Have salt within you
        and live at peace with one another."

010:001 Soon on His feet once more, He enters the district of Judaea
        and crosses the Jordan:  again the people flock to Him,
        and ere long, as was usual with Him, He was teaching
        them once more.

010:002 Presently a party of Pharisees come to Him with the question--
        seeking to entrap Him, "May a man divorce his wife?"

010:003 "What rule did Moses lay down for you?"  He answered.

010:004 "Moses," they said, "permitted a man to draw up a written
        notice of divorce, and to send his wife away."

010:005 "It was in consideration of your stubborn hearts," said Jesus,
        "that Moses enacted this law for you;

010:006 but from the beginning of the creation the rule was,
        'Male and female did God make them.

010:007 For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother,
        and shall cling to his wife,

010:008 and the two shall be one'; so that they are two no longer, but 'one.'

010:009 What, therefore, God has joined together let not man separate."

010:010 Indoors the disciples began questioning Jesus again on
        the same subject.

010:011 He replied, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman,
        commits adultery against the first wife;

010:012 and if a woman puts away her husband and marries another man,
        she commits adultery."

010:013 One day people were bringing young children to Jesus for Him
        to touch them, but the disciples interfered.

010:014 Jesus, however, on seeing this, was moved to indignation,
        and said to them, "Let the little children come to me:
        do not hinder them; for to those who are childlike the Kingdom
        of God belongs.

010:015 In solemn truth I tell you that no one who does not receive
        the Kingdom of God like a little child will by any
        possibility enter it."

010:016 Then He took them in His arms and blessed them lovingly,
        one by one, laying His hands upon them.

010:017 As He went out to resume His journey, there came a man running
        up to Him, who knelt at His feet and asked, "Good Rabbi,
        what am I to do in order to inherit the Life of the Ages?"

010:018 "Why do you call me good?" asked Jesus in reply; "there is no
        one truly good except One--that is, God.

010:019 You know the Commandments--'Do not murder;' 'Do not commit adultery;'
        'Do not steal;' 'Do not lie in giving evidence;' 'Do not defraud;'
        'Honour thy father and thy mother.'"

010:020 "Rabbi," he replied, "all these Commandments I have carefully
        obeyed from my youth."

010:021 Then Jesus looked at him and loved him, and said, "One thing
        is lacking in you:  go, sell all you possess and give
        the proceeds to the poor, and you shall have riches in Heaven;
        and come and be a follower of mine."

010:022 At these words his brow darkened, and he went away sad;
        for he was possessed of great wealth.

010:023 Then looking round on His disciples Jesus said, "With how hard
        a struggle will the possessors of riches enter the Kingdom of God!"

010:024 The disciples were amazed at His words.  Jesus, however,
        said again, "Children, how hard a struggle is it for those
        who trust in riches to enter the Kingdom of God!

010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
        than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."

010:026 They were astonished beyond measure, and said to one another,
        "Who then *can* be saved?"

010:027 Jesus looking on them said, "With men it is impossible,
        but not with God; for everything is possible with God."

010:028 "Remember," said Peter to Him, "that we forsook everything
        and have become your followers."

010:029 "In solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that there
        is no one who has forsaken house or brothers or sisters,
        or mother or father, or children or lands, for my sake
        and for the sake of the Good News,

010:030 but will receive a hundred times as much now in this present life--
        houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, lands--
        and persecution with them--and in the coming age the Life
        of the Ages.

010:031 But many who are now first will be last, and the last, first."

010:032 They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus
        was walking ahead of them; they were full of wonder, and some,
        though they followed, did so with fear.  Then, once more
        calling to Him the Twelve, He began to tell them what was
        about to happen to Him.

010:033 "See," He said, "we are going up to Jerusalem, where the Son
        of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and the Scribes.
        They will condemn Him to death, and will hand Him over
        to the Gentiles;

010:034 they will insult Him in cruel sport, spit on Him, scourge Him,
        and put Him to death; but on the third day He will rise
        to life again."

010:035 Then James and John, the sons of Zabdi, came up to Him
        and said, "Rabbi, we wish you would grant us whatever request
        we make of you."

010:036 "What would you have me do for you?"  He asked.

010:037 "Allow us," they replied, "to sit one at your right hand
        and the other at your left hand, in your glory."

010:038 "You know not," said He, "what you are asking.  Are you able
        to drink out of the cup from which I am to drink, or to be
        baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?"

010:039 "We are able," they replied.  "Out of the cup," said Jesus,
        "from which I am to drink you shall drink, and with the baptism
        with which I am to be baptized you shall be baptized;

010:040 but as to sitting at my right hand or at my left, that is not
        mine to give:  it will be for those for whom it is reserved."

010:041 The other ten, hearing of it, were at first highly indignant
        with James and John.

010:042 Jesus, however, called them to Him and said to them, "You are
        aware how those who are deemed rulers among the Gentiles lord it
        over them, and their great men make them feel their authority;

010:043 but it is not to be so among you.  No, whoever desires to be
        great among you must be your servant;

010:044 and whoever desires to be first among you must be the
        bondservant of all.

010:045 For the Son of Man also did not come to be waited upon, but to
        wait on others, and to give His life as the redemption-price
        for a multitude of people."

010:046 They came to Jericho; and as He was leaving that town--
        Himself and His disciples and a great crowd--Bartimaeus (the son
        of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting by the way-side.

010:047 Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out,
        "Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me."

010:048 Many angrily told him to leave off shouting; but he only cried
        out all the louder, "Son of David, have pity on me."

010:049 Then Jesus stood still.  "Call him," He said.  So they called
        the blind man.  "Cheer up," they said; "rise, he is calling you."

010:050 The man flung away his outer garment, sprang to his feet,
        and came to Jesus.

010:051 "What shall I do for you?" said Jesus.  "Rabboni," replied the
        blind man, "let me recover my sight."

010:052 "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has cured you."  Instantly he
        regained his sight, and followed Him along the road.

011:001 When they were getting near Jerusalem and had arrived at
        Bethphage and Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent
        two of his disciples on in front, with these instructions.

011:002 "Go," He said, "to the village facing you, and immediately
        on entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no
        one has ever yet ridden:  untie him and bring him here.

011:003 And if any one asks you, 'Why are you doing that?' say, 'The Master
        needs it, and will send it back here without delay.'"

011:004 So they went and found a young ass tied up at the front door
        of a house.  They were untying it,

011:005 when some of the bystanders called out, "What are you doing,
        untying the foal?"

011:006 But on their giving the answer that Jesus had bidden them give,
        they let them take it.

011:007 So they brought the foal to Jesus, and threw their outer
        garments over him; and Jesus mounted.

011:008 Then many spread their outer garments to carpet the road,
        and others leafy branches which they had cut down in the fields;

011:009 while those who led the way and those who followed kept shouting
        "God save Him!"  Blessed be He who comes in the Lord's name.

011:010 Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our forefather David!  God in
        the highest Heavens save Him!"

011:011 So He came into Jerusalem and into the Temple; and after looking
        round upon everything there, the hour being now late He went
        out to Bethany with the Twelve.

011:012 The next day, after they had left Bethany, He was hungry.

011:013 But in the distance He saw a fig-tree in full leaf, and went
        to see whether perhaps He could find some figs on it.
        When however He came to it, He found nothing but leaves
        (for it was not fig time);

011:014 and He said to the tree, "Let no one ever again eat fruit from thee!"
        And His disciples heard this.

011:015 They reached Jerusalem, and entering the Temple He began to drive
        out the buyers and sellers, and upset the money-changers'
        tables and the stools of the pigeon-dealers,

011:016 and would not allow any one to carry anything through the Temple.

011:017 And He remonstrated with them.  "Is it not written," He said,
        "'My House shall be called The House of Prayer for all the nations?'
        But you have made it what it now is--a robbers' cave."

011:018 This the High Priests and Scribes heard, and they began
        to devise means to destroy Him.  For they were afraid of Him,
        because of the deep impression produced on all the people
        by His teaching.

011:019 When evening came on, Jesus and His disciples used to
        leave the city.

011:020 In the early morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree
        withered to the roots;

011:021 and Peter, recollecting, said to Him, "Look, Rabbi, the fig-tree
        which you cursed is withered up."

011:022 Jesus said to them, "Have faith in God.

011:023 In solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall say
        to this mountain, 'Remove, and hurl thyself into the sea,'
        and has no doubt about it in his heart, but stedfastly believes
        that what he says will happen, it shall be granted him.

011:024 That is why I tell you, as to whatever you pray and make
        request for, if you believe that you have received it it
        shall be yours.

011:025 But whenever you stand praying, if you have a grievance
        against any one, forgive it, so that your Father in Heaven
        may also forgive you your offences."

011:026 []

011:027 They came again to Jerusalem; and as He was walking in the Temple,
        the High Priests, Scribes and Elders came to Him

011:028 and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things?
        and who gave you authority to do them?"

011:029 "And I will put a question to you," replied Jesus; "answer me,
        and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

011:030 John's Baptism--was it of Heavenly or of human origin?
        Answer me."

011:031 So they debated the matter with one another.
        "Suppose we say, 'Heavenly,'" they argued, "he will ask,
        'Why then did you not believe him?'

011:032 Or should we say, 'human?'"  They were afraid of the people;
        for all agreed in holding John to have been really a Prophet.

011:033 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know."  "Nor do I tell you,"
        said Jesus, "by what authority I do these things."

012:001 Then He began to speak to them in figurative language.
        "There was once a man," He said, "who planted a vineyard,
        fenced it round, dug a pit for the wine-tank, and built
        a strong lodge.  Then he let the place to vine-dressers
        and went abroad.

012:002 At vintage-time he sent one of his servants to receive from
        the vine-dressers a share of the grapes.

012:003 But they seized him, beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.

012:004 Again he sent to them another servant:  and as for him,
        they wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully.

012:005 Yet a third he sent, and him they killed.  And he sent
        many besides, and them also they ill-treated, beating some
        and killing others.

012:006 He had still one left whom he could send, a dearly-loved son:
        him last of all he sent, saying, "'They will treat my
        son with respect.'

012:007 "But those men--the vine-dressers--said to one another,
        "'Here is the heir:  come, let us kill him, and then the property
        will one day be ours.'

012:008 "So they took him and killed him, and flung his body
        outside the vineyard.

012:009 What, therefore, will the owner of the vineyard do?"
        "He will come and put the vine-dressers to death," they said;
        "and will give the vineyard to others."

012:010 "Have you not read even this passage," He added, "'The stone
        which the builders rejected has become the Cornerstone:

012:011 this Cornerstone came from the Lord, and is wonderful
        in our esteem?'"

012:012 And they kept looking out for an opportunity to seize Him,
        but were afraid of the people; for they saw that in this parable
        He had referred to *them*. So they left Him and went away.

012:013 Their next step was to send to Him some of the Pharisees
        and of Herod's partisans to entrap Him in conversation.

012:014 So they came to Him.  "Rabbi," they said, "we know that you
        are a truthful man and you do not fear any one; for you do
        not recognize human distinctions, but teach God's way truly.
        Is it allowable to pay poll-tax to Caesar, or not?

012:015 Shall we pay, or shall we refuse to pay?"  But He,
        knowing their hypocrisy, replied, "Why try to ensnare me?
        Bring me a shilling for me to look at."

012:016 They brought one; and He asked them, "Whose is this likeness
        and this inscription?"  "Caesar's," they replied.

012:017 "What is Caesar's," replied Jesus, "pay to Caesar--and what is God's,
        pay to God."  And they wondered exceedingly at Him.

012:018 Then came to Him a party of Sadducees, a sect which denies that
        there is any Resurrection; and they proceeded to question Him.

012:019 "Rabbi," they said, "Moses made it a law for us:
        'If a man's brother should die and leave a wife, but no child,
        the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family
        for his brother.'

012:020 There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife,
        but at his death left no family.

012:021 The second married her, and died, leaving no family;
        and the third did the same.

012:022 And so did the rest of the seven, all dying childless.
        Finally the woman also died.

012:023 At the Resurrection whose wife will she be?  For they all
        seven married her."

012:024 "Is not this the cause of your error," replied Jesus--"your
        ignorance alike of the Scriptures and of the power of God?

012:025 For when they have risen from among the dead, men do not marry
        and women are not given in marriage, but they are as angels
        are in Heaven.

012:026 But as to the dead, that they rise to life, have you never
        read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush,
        how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
        and the God of Jacob?'

012:027 He is not the God of dead, but of living men.
        You are in grave error."

012:028 Then one of the Scribes, who had heard them disputing and
        well knew that Jesus had given them an answer to the point,
        and a forcible one, came forward and asked Him, "Which is
        the chief of all the Commandments?"

012:029 "The chief Commandment," replied Jesus, "is this:
        'Hear, O Israel!  The Lord our God is one Lord;

012:030 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart,
        thy whole soul, thy whole mind, and thy whole strength.'

012:031 "The second is this:  'Thou shalt love thy fellow man as thou
        lovest thyself.'  "Other Commandment greater than these
        there is none."

012:032 So the Scribe said to Him, "Rightly, in very truth, Rabbi, have you
        said that He stands alone, and there is none but He;

012:033 and To love Him with all one's heart, with all one's understanding,
        and with all one's strength, and to love one's fellow man
        no less than oneself, is far better than all our whole
        burnt-offerings and sacrifices."

012:034 Perceiving that the Scribe had answered wisely Jesus said
        to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God."
        No one from that time forward ventured to put any question to Him.

012:035 But, while teaching in the Temple, Jesus asked, "How is it
        the Scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?

012:036 David himself said, taught by the Holy Spirit, "'The Lord said
        to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I have made thy foes
        a footstool under thy feet.'

012:037 "David himself calls Him 'Lord:' how then can He be his son?"
        And the mass of people found pleasure in listening to Jesus.

012:038 Moreover in the course of His teaching He said, "Be on your
        guard against the Scribes who like to walk about in long
        robes and to be bowed to in places of public resort,

012:039 and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues and at dinner parties,

012:040 and who swallow up the property of widows and then mask their
        wickedness by making long prayers:  these men will receive
        far heavier punishment."

012:041 Having taken a seat opposite the Treasury, He observed
        how the people were dropping money into the Treasury,
        and that many of the wealthy threw in large sums.

012:042 But there came one poor widow and dropped in two farthings,
        equal in value to a halfpenny.

012:043 So He called His disciples to Him and said, "In solemn truth I
        tell you that this widow, poor as she is, has thrown in more
        than all the other contributors to the Treasury;

012:044 for they have all contributed out of what they could well spare,
        but she out of her need has thrown in all she possessed--
        all she had to live on."

013:001 As He was leaving the Temple, one of His disciples exclaimed,
        "Look, Rabbi, what wonderful stones! what wonderful buildings!"

013:002 "You see all these great buildings?"  Jesus replied; "not one
        stone will be left here upon another--not thrown down."

013:003 He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite to the Temple,
        when Peter, James, John, and Andrew, apart from the others asked Him,

013:004 "Tell us, When will these things be? and what will be the sign
        when all these predictions are on the point of being fulfilled?"

013:005 So Jesus began to say to them:  "Take care that no one misleads you.

013:006 Many will come assuming my name and saying, 'I am He;'
        and they will mislead many.

013:007 But when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed:
        come they must, but the End is not yet.

013:008 For nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom
        against kingdom.  There will be earthquakes in various places;
        there will be famines.  These miseries are but like the early
        pains of childbirth.

013:009 "You yourselves must be on your guard.  They will deliver
        you up to Sanhedrins; you will be brought into synagogues
        and cruelly beaten; and you will stand before governors
        and kings for my sake, to be witnesses to them for me.

013:010 But the proclamation of the Good News must be carried to all
        the Gentiles before the End comes.

013:011 When however they are marching you along under arrest,
        do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say,
        but speak what is given you when the time comes; for it
        will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.

013:012 "Brother will betray brother to be killed, and fathers will
        betray children; and children will rise against their parents
        and have them put to death.

013:013 You will be objects of universal hatred because you are called
        by my name, but those who stand firm to the End will be saved.

013:014 "As soon, however, as you see the Abomination of Desolation
        standing where he ought not"--let the reader observe these
        words--"then let those in Judaea escape to the hills;

013:015 let him who is on the roof not come down and enter the house
        to fetch anything out of it;

013:016 and let not him who is in the field turn back to pick up
        his outer garment.

013:017 And alas for the women who at that time are with child
        or have infants!

013:018 "But pray that it may not come in the winter.

013:019 For those will be times of suffering the like of which has
        never been from the first creation of God's world until now,
        and assuredly never will be again;

013:020 and but for the fact that the Lord has cut short those days,
        no one would escape; but for the sake of His own People whom
        He has chosen for Himself He has cut short the days.

013:021 "At that time if any one says to you, 'See, here is the Christ!'
        or 'See, He is there!' do not believe it.

013:022 For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets,
        displaying signs and prodigies with a view to lead astray--
        if indeed that were possible--even God's own People.

013:023 But as for yourselves, be on your guard:  I have forewarned
        you of everything.

013:024 "At that time, however, after that distress, the sun will be
        darkened and the moon will not shed her light;

013:025 the stars will be seen falling from the firmament, and the forces
        which are in the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.

013:026 And then will they see the Son of Man coming in clouds with
        great power and glory.

013:027 Then He will send forth the angels and gather together His chosen
        People from north, south, east and west, from the remotest
        parts of the earth and the sky.

013:028 "Learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches.  As soon
        as its branch has become soft and it is bursting into leaf,
        you know that summer is near.

013:029 So also do you, when you see these things happening, be sure
        that He is near, at your very door.

013:030 I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will
        certainly not pass away without all these things having
        first taken place.

013:031 Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words
        will not pass away.

013:032 "But as to that day or the exact time no one knows--not even
        the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.

013:033 Take care, be on the alert, and pray; for you do not know
        when it will happen.

013:034 It is like a man living abroad who has left his house, and given
        the management to his servants--to each one his special duty--
        and has ordered the porter to keep awake.

013:035 Be wakeful therefore, for you know not when the master of
        the house is coming--in the evening, at midnight, at cock-crow,
        or at dawn.

013:036 Beware lest He should arrive unexpectedly and find you asleep.

013:037 Moreover, what I say to you I say to all--Be wakeful!"

014:001 It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of
        Unleavened Bread, and the High Priests and Scribes were bent
        on finding how to seize Him by stratagem and put Him to death.

014:002 But they said, "Not on the Festival-day, for fear there should
        be a riot among the people."

014:003 Now when He was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
        while He was at table, there came a woman with a jar of pure,
        sweet-scented ointment very costly:  she broke the jar
        and poured the ointment over His head.

014:004 But there were some who said indignantly among themselves,
        "Why has the ointment been thus wasted?

014:005 For that ointment might have been sold for fifteen pounds
        or more, and the money have been given to the poor."
        And they were exceedingly angry with her.

014:006 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone:  why are you troubling her?
        She has done a most gracious act towards me.

014:007 For you always have the poor among you, and whenever you
        choose you can do acts of kindness to them; but me you
        have not always.

014:008 What she could she did:  she has perfumed my body in preparation
        for my burial.

014:009 And I solemnly tell you that wherever in the whole world
        the Good News shall be proclaimed, this which she has done
        shall also be told in remembrance of her."

014:010 But Judas Iscariot, already mentioned as one of the Twelve,
        went to the High Priests to betray Jesus to them.

014:011 They gladly listened to his proposal, and promised to give
        him a sum of money.  So he looked out for an opportunity
        to betray Him.

014:012 On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread--the day for
        killing the Passover lamb--His disciples asked Him, "Where shall
        we go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"

014:013 So He sent two of His disciples with instructions, saying,
        "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher
        of water:  follow him,

014:014 and whatever house he enters, tell the master of the house,
        'The Rabbi asks, Where is my room where I can eat the Passover
        with my disciples?'

014:015 Then he will himself show you a large room upstairs, ready furnished:
        there make preparation for us."

014:016 So the disciples went out and came to the city, and found everything
        just as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.

014:017 When it was evening, He came with the Twelve.

014:018 And while they were at table Jesus said, "I solemnly tell you
        that one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."

014:019 They were filled with sorrow, and began asking Him, one by one,
        "Not I, is it?"

014:020 "It is one of the Twelve," He replied; "he who is dipping
        his fingers in the dish with me.

014:021 For the Son of Man is going His way as it is written about Him;
        but alas for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!
        It had been a happy thing for that man, had he never been born."

014:022 Also during the meal He took a Passover biscuit, blessed it,
        and broke it.  He then gave it to them, saying, "Take this,
        it is my body."

014:023 Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and handed it to them,
        and they all of them drank from it.

014:024 "This is my blood," He said, "which is to be poured out on
        behalf of many--the blood which makes the Covenant sure.

014:025 I solemnly tell you that never again will I taste the produce
        of the vine till I shall drink the new wine in the Kingdom of God."

014:026 After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

014:027 Then said Jesus to them, "All of you are about to stumble
        and fall, for it is written, 'I will strike down the Shepherd,
        and the sheep will be scattered in all directions.'

014:028 But after I have risen to life again I will go before
        you into Galilee."

014:029 "All may stumble and fall," said Peter, "yet I never will."

014:030 "I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that to-day--this night--
        before the cock crows twice, you yourself will three
        times disown me."

014:031 "Even if I must die with you," declared Peter again and again,
        "I will never disown you."  In like manner protested also
        all the disciples.

014:032 So they came to a place called Gethsemane.  There He said
        to His disciples, "Sit down here till I have prayed."

014:033 Then He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began
        to be full of terror and distress,

014:034 and He said to them, "My heart is oppressed with anguish
        to the very point of death:  wait here and keep awake."

014:035 Going forward a short distance He threw Himself upon His face
        and prayed repeatedly that, if it was possible, He might be
        spared that time of agony;

014:036 and He said, "Abba! my Father! all things are possible for Thee:
        take this cup of suffering away from me:  and yet not what
        I desire, but what Thou desirest."

014:037 Then He came and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, "Simon,
        are you asleep?  Had you not strength to keep awake a single hour?

014:038 Be wakeful, all of you, and keep on praying, that you may
        not come into temptation:  the spirit is right willing,
        but the body is frail."

014:039 He again went away and prayed, using the very same words.

014:040 When He returned He again found them asleep, for they were
        very tired; and they knew not how to answer Him.

014:041 A third time He came, and then He said, "Sleep on and rest.
        Enough! the hour has come.  Even now they are betraying
        the Son of Man into the hands of sinful men.

014:042 Rouse yourselves, let us be going:  my betrayer is close at hand."

014:043 Immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve,
        came and with him a crowd of men armed with swords and cudgels,
        sent by the High Priests and Scribes and Elders.

014:044 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them.
        "The one I kiss," he said, "is the man:  lay hold of him,
        and take him safely away."

014:045 So he came, and going straight to Jesus he said, "Rabbi!"
        and kissed Him with seeming affection;

014:046 whereupon they laid hands on Him and held Him firmly.

014:047 But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck a blow
        at the High Priest's servant, cutting off his ear.

014:048 "Have you come out," said Jesus, "with swords and cudgels
        to arrest me, as if you had to fight with a robber?

014:049 Day after day I used to be among you in the Temple teaching,
        and you never seized me.  But this is happening in order
        that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.'

014:050 Then His friends all forsook Him and fled.

014:051 One youth indeed did follow Him, wearing only a linen cloth
        round his bare body.  Of him they laid hold,

014:052 but he left the linen cloth in their hands and fled without it.

014:053 So they led Jesus away to the High Priest, and with him there
        assembled all the High Priests, Elders, and Scribes.

014:054 Peter followed Jesus at a distance, as far as the outer court
        of the High Priest's palace.  But there he remained sitting
        among the officers, and warming himself by the fire.

014:055 Meanwhile the High Priests and the entire Sanhedrin were
        endeavouring to get evidence against Jesus in order to put
        Him to death, but could find none;

014:056 for though many gave false testimony against Him, their statements
        did not tally.

014:057 Then some came forward as witnesses and falsely declared,

014:058 "We have heard him say, 'I will pull down this Sanctuary
        built by human hands, and three days afterwards I will erect
        another built without hands.'"

014:059 But not even in this shape was their testimony consistent.

014:060 At last the High Priest stood up, and advancing into the midst
        of them all, asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make?
        What is the meaning of all this that these witnesses
        allege against you?"

014:061 But He remained silent, and gave no reply.  A second time
        the High Priest questioned Him.  "Are you the Christ,
        the Son of the Blessed One?" he said.

014:062 "I am," replied Jesus, "and you and others will see the Son
        of Man sitting at the right hand of the divine Power,
        and coming amid the clouds of the sky."

014:063 Rending his garments the High Priest exclaimed, "What need
        have we of witnesses after that?

014:064 You all heard his impious words.  What is your judgement?"
        Then with one voice they condemned Him as deserving of death.

014:065 Thereupon some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him,
        while striking Him with their fists and crying, "Prove that you
        are a prophet."  The officers too struck Him with open hands
        as they took Him in charge.

014:066 Now while Peter was below in the quadrangle, one of the
        High Priest's maidservants came,

014:067 and seeing Peter warming himself she looked at him and said,
        "You also were with Jesus, the Nazarene."

014:068 But he denied it, and said, "I don't know--I don't understand--
        What do you mean?"  And then he went out into the outer court.
        Just then a cock crowed.

014:069 Again the maidservant saw him, and again began to say to
        the people standing by, "He is one of them."

014:070 A second time he repeatedly denied it.  Soon afterwards
        the bystanders again accused Peter, saying, "You are surely
        one of them, for you too are a Galilaean."

014:071 But he broke out into curses and oaths, declaring, "I know
        nothing of the man you are talking about."

014:072 No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed for the second time,
        and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, "Before the
        cock crows twice, you will three times disown me."
        And as he thought of it, he wept aloud.

015:001 At earliest dawn, after the High Priests had held a consultation
        with the Elders and Scribes, they and the entire Sanhedrin
        bound Jesus and took Him away and handed Him over to Pilate.

015:002 So Pilate questioned Him.  "Are *you* the King of the Jews?"
        he asked.  "I am," replied Jesus.

015:003 Then, as the High Priests went on heaping accusations on Him,

015:004 Pilate again and again asked Him, "Do you make no reply?
        Listen to the many charges they are bringing against you."

015:005 But Jesus made no further answer:  so that Pilate wondered.

015:006 Now at the Festival it was customary for Pilate to release to
        the Jews any one prisoner whom they might beg off from punishment;

015:007 and at this time a man named Barabbas was in prison
        among the insurgents--persons who in the insurrection
        had committed murder.

015:008 So the people came crowding up, asking Pilate to grant them
        the usual favour.

015:009 "Shall I release for you the King of the Jews?" answered Pilate.

015:010 For he could see that it was out of sheer spite that the
        High Priests had handed Him over.

015:011 But the High Priests urged on the crowd to obtain Barabbas's
        release in preference;

015:012 and when Pilate again asked them, "What then shall I do to
        the man you call King of the Jews?"

015:013 they once more shouted out, "Crucify Him!"

015:014 "Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.
        But they vehemently shouted, "Crucify Him!"

015:015 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the mob, released Barabbas for them,
        and after scourging Jesus handed Him over for crucifixion.

015:016 Then the soldiers led Him away into the court of the Palace
        (the Praetorium), and calling together the whole battalion

015:017 they arrayed Him in crimson, placed on His head a wreath
        of thorny twigs which they had twisted,

015:018 and went on to salute Him with shouts of "Long live the King
        of the Jews."

015:019 Then they began to beat Him on the head with a cane, to spit
        on Him, and to do Him homage on bended knees.

015:020 At last, having finished their sport, they took the robe off Him,
        put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.

015:021 One Simon, a Cyrenaean, the father of Alexander and Rufus,
        was passing along, coming from the country:  him they compelled
        to carry His cross.

015:022 So they brought Him to the place called Golgotha, which,
        being translated, means 'Skull-ground.'

015:023 Here they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He refused it.

015:024 Then they crucified Him.  This done, they divided His garments
        among them, drawing lots to decide what each should take.

015:025 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified Him.

015:026 Over His head was the notice in writing of the charge
        against Him:  THE KING OF THE JEWS.

015:027 And together with Jesus they crucified two robbers, one at His
        right hand and one at His left.

015:028 []

015:029 And all the passers-by reviled Him.  They shook their heads
        at Him and said, "Ah! you who were for destroying the Sanctuary
        and building a new one in three days,

015:030 come down from the cross and save yourself."

015:031 In the same way the High Priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on
        scoffing at Him, saying to one another, "He has saved others:
        himself he cannot save!

015:032 This Christ, the King of Israel, let him come down now from
        the cross, that we may see and believe."  Even the men
        who were being crucified with Him heaped insults on Him.

015:033 At noon there came a darkness over the whole land, lasting till
        three o'clock in the afternoon.

015:034 But at three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
        "Elohi, Elohi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, My God,
        why hast Thou forsaken me?"

015:035 Some of the bystanders, hearing Him, said, "Listen, he is
        calling for Elijah!"

015:036 Then a man ran to fill a sponge with sour wine, and he put it
        on the end of a cane and placed it to His lips, saying at
        the same time, "Wait! let us see whether Elijah will come
        and take him down."

015:037 But Jesus uttered a loud cry and yielded up His spirit.

015:038 And the curtain in the Sanctuary was torn in two,
        from top to bottom.

015:039 And when the Centurion who stood in front of the cross saw that He
        was dead, he exclaimed, "This man was indeed God's Son."

015:040 There were also a party of women looking on from a distance;
        among them being both Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother
        of James the Little and of Joses, and Salome--

015:041 all of whom in the Galilaean days had habitually been with Him
        and cared for Him, as well as many other women who had come
        up to Jerusalem with Him.

015:042 Towards sunset, as it was the Preparation--that is, the day
        preceding the Sabbath--

015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea came, a highly respected member of the Council,
        who himself also was living in expectation of the Kingdom of God.
        He summoned up courage to go in to see Pilate and beg for
        the body of Jesus.

015:044 But Pilate could hardly believe that He was already dead.
        He called, however, for the Centurion and inquired whether
        He had been long dead;

015:045 and having ascertained the fact he granted the body to Joseph.

015:046 He, having bought a sheet of linen, took Him down, wrapped Him
        in the sheet and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock;
        after which he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.

015:047 Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses were looking
        on to see where He was put.

016:001 When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother
        of James, and Salome, bought spices, in order to come and
        anoint His body.

016:002 So, very soon after sunrise on the first day of the week,
        they came to the tomb;

016:003 and they were saying to one another, 'Who will roll away
        the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"

016:004 But then, looking up, they saw that the stone was already
        rolled back:  for it was of immense size.

016:005 Upon entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting
        at their right hand, clothed in a long white robe.
        They were astonished and terrified.

016:006 But he said to them, "Do not be terrified.  It is Jesus you
        are looking for--the Nazarene who has been crucified.
        He has come back to life:  He is not here:  this is the place
        where they laid Him.

016:007 But go and tell His disciples and Peter that He is going
        before you into Galilee:  and that there you will see Him,
        as He told you."

016:008 So they came out, and fled from the tomb, for they were greatly
        agitated and surprised; and they said not a word to any one,
        for they were afraid.

016:009 [But He rose to life early on the first day of the week,
        and appeared first to Mary of Magdala from whom He had
        expelled seven demons.

016:010 She went and brought the tidings to those who had been with Him,
        as they were mourning and weeping.

016:011 But they, when they were told that He was alive and that she
        had seen Him, could not believe it.

016:012 Afterwards He showed Himself in another form to two of them
        as they were walking, on their way into the country.

016:013 These, again, went and told the news to the rest; but not even
        them did they believe.

016:014 Later still He showed Himself to the Eleven themselves
        whilst they were at table, and He upbraided them with their
        unbelief and obstinacy in not having believed those who had
        seen Him alive.

016:015 Then He said to them, "Go the whole world over, and proclaim
        the Good News to all mankind.

016:016 He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who
        disbelieves will be condemned.

016:017 And signs shall attend those who believe, even such as these.
        By making use of my name they shall expel demons.
        They shall speak new languages.

016:018 They shall take up venomous snakes, and if they drink any deadly
        poison it shall do them no harm whatever.  They shall lay
        their hands on the sick, and the sick shall recover."

016:019 So the Lord Jesus after having thus spoken to them was taken
        up into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.

016:020 But they went out and made proclamation everywhere, the Lord
        working with them and confirming their Message by the signs
        which accompanied it.]

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
