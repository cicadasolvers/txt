PREFACE.


This lesson-book was prepared in order to meet a need realized in my own
work as a pastor; a need which is felt by many pastors and workers among
the young.

In the Home, Sunday-School and Church are children of all ages, from six
to sixteen. It is found impracticable to give to all this varied company
the same teaching. The lessons that are admirably adapted for boys and
girls between ten and fifteen are utterly unsuited to the children
between six and ten. Moreover after looking carefully, I have not been
able to find satisfactory lessons which can be taught to the young
children except by one especially trained for the work; and such
instructions are hard to find.

After various experiments I adopted in my own teaching the following
plan. We divided the children into two sections; the First Section
including all over nine years old, the Second Section all those under
nine.

I selected for twelve lessons, twelve Bible stories following in
succession, beginning with the story of Adam and Eve. On each of these
stories I prepared a catechism of very simple questions and answers, and
printed them by a duplicating process. After the opening of "The
Children's Hour," I told the story to all present in simple language,
explaining that while the story was told to all it was for the special
benefit of the smaller children; but =I noticed even the oldest boys and
girls listened to it with interest equal to the youngest=.

After the Bible story and the singing of a hymn, the Second Section
withdrew to another room. There the children were divided into classes,
and taught the questions and answers. A copy of the leaflet containing
the questions and answers of the story for the day was given to each
child, to be taken home and reviewed by parents or the older members of
the family.

By separating the children into two grades, the older young people can
receive instruction suited to their age, and the little ones are also
provided for.

So many pastors and others have requested copies of the leaflets
containing the questions and answers, that it has seemed desirable to
publish them; and they are now completed upon the entire Bible story,
and brought together in book form for the use of teachers of children.

These lessons may be used in classes of the Sunday School, by teachers
who desire a more consecutive treatment of the Bible story than is given
in the International Sunday School lessons, and by parents.

There are many families where "The Story of the Bible" has been read to
the interest and profit of the children. Parents will find that these
lessons will help to fix the important facts of the Bible story in the
minds of the little ones.

It will be seen that the questions and answers do not embrace all the
stories in the book. A selection has been made of what seem to be the
most important subjects, affording weekly lessons for one year, with
allowance for vacations, in the Old Testament, and another year in the
New Testament.

In the hope that these lessons may aid the children of to-day, who are
to be the men and women of to-morrow, to gain a definite knowledge of
the Word of God these lessons are sent forth.

                                                JESSE LYMAN HURLBUT.




SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHING.


1. Let the teacher in advance read over the questions and answers of the
lesson, note their relation to the story as told in "The Story of the
Bible," and to some extent fit the story to the lesson which is to be
taught.

2. Tell the story (or stories) of the day's lesson to the children,
following the plan given in the book. Use very simple words and avoid
all that are in any sense technical, or above the mind of a child.

3. After telling the story for the day, the children may be divided into
classes, and assistants may teach the questions and answers. But before
the close of the session it would be well to ask all the questions, and
have the answers given by the children.

4. In order to complete each course, in the Old Testament and in the
New, within a year, it may be necessary to omit some of the lessons,
where classes take a vacation in the summer. To complete the course of
each year in such classes the Reviews at the end of each series of
lessons might be omitted, although they will be valuable as summaries of
the important facts of the lesson. Some teachers might prefer to omit
from the Old Testament lessons, some of the following in order to
complete the course in a year. Lesson XXVIII David and Absalom; XXX The
Temple; XXXVI Elisha and Jonah; XXXVIII, XXXIX The Kings of Judah; XLIV
Queen Esther. These are suggested for omission not because they are
unimportant or uninteresting, but in case some lessons must be omitted.
In order to complete the course in one year in the New Testament
lessons, the following might be omitted, if some must be. XVI The
Mothers Prayer; XX The Good Shepherd; XXIII Jesus and the Children;
XXVI, XXVII The Last Teachings.




OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.




PART FIRST.--FROM ADAM TO MOSES.


Lesson I. The Beautiful Garden.

(Tell Story 1 in "Hurlbut's Story of the Bible.")

=To the Teacher:=

Under the title of each lesson throughout these pages will be seen
instructions to tell certain lessons, with numbers. These numbered
lessons and parts correspond with the numbered lessons and parts in
"Hurlbut's Story of the Bible."

Let the teacher begin by asking, "Who can tell us what is the first
verse of the Bible?" When hands are raised, call on three or four
children to repeat the verse in turn; then let all the class repeat it
in concert. Explain what the verse means, that God made the world, and
all the things in it. Tell the story of the creation of the world; of
the first man and the first woman; the Garden of [=E]´d[)e]n, and how
[)A]d´[)a]m and [=E]ve lost their home, and were driven out. Then teach
the class the answers to the following questions. At the close of the
lesson, see that every young pupil is shown just where the questions and
answers on the lesson are found. The answers should be reviewed by
parents, or older brothers and sisters, until the child can repeat them
thoroughly, and can tell in his own language, the story of the lesson.


Questions and Answers.

=1.= What is the first verse in the Bible? ="In the beginning God
created the heavens and the earth."=

=2.= What does this mean? =That God made all things.=

=3.= In how many days does the Bible tell us that God made the world?
=In six days.=

=4.= On what day did God rest from his work? =On the seventh day.=

=5.= Whom did God make as the first man? =[)A]d´[)a]m.=

=6.= Who was the first woman? =[=E]ve.=

=7.= What place did God give to [)A]d´[)a]m and [=E]ve as their home?
=The garden of [=E]´d[)e]n.=

=8.= How long did [)A]d´[)a]m and [=E]ve live in the beautiful garden?

=9.= What became of them when they did not obey God's word? =They were
driven out of the garden.=


Lesson II. The Earliest People.

(Tell Stories 2 and 3.)

=To the Teacher:=

1. In the story of C[=a]in and [=A]´b[)e]l, explain carefully what is
meant by "an altar"; and how in early times people came to God in
prayer. With little children, use the word "praying," rather than
"worship," and "gift to God" or "offering," rather than "sacrifice."

2. In the story of "The Great Ship," explain what "an ark" was, properly
a chest or box; in this story, a great ship, built not to sail fast, but
to float on the water, and to hold a great amount. Perhaps it was made
so large, not only to carry many animals and their food, but also very
many people, if the people had been willing to be saved by it.

God.=

=8.= What was the end of [=E]´n[)o]ch's life? =He did not die, but God
took him to himself.=

people? =A great flood.=

=10.= What good man with his family was saved from the flood? =N[=o]´ah

teach the class the answers to the following questions on the subject of
this lesson, and explain to the little pupils just where to find the
answers to the questions of the first lesson, and have them answer the

Lesson II. The Stable and Shepherds.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
