already an enigma to the tyro, the most striking and characteristic
features of the Coin are dissected and placed by themselves, so that the

OUR NINTH VOLUME.

The commencement of a New Year, and of our Ninth Volume, imposes upon Us
the pleasant duty of wishing many happy returns of the season to all our
Friends, Correspondents, and Readers.

Those of the latter class, who have so earnestly impressed upon Us the
propriety and advisableness of placing our Advertisements on the outside
leaves of each Number, will see that their wishes have at length been
complied with. We trust they will be pleased with this change, and receive
it as a proof of our readiness to attend to every reasonable suggestion for
the improve of "NOTES AND QUERIES." We can assure them that it is no less
our desire to do so than our interest.

Notes.

A STRAWBERRY-HILL GEM.

    "_Pour qui se donne la peine de chercher, il y a toujours quelque
    trouvaille a faire, meme dans ce qui a ete le plus visite_.--Henry
    PATIN.

I take up a work of European celebrity, and reflect awhile on its
bibliographic peculiarities--which may almost pass for romance.

It is a _Scottish_ work with regard to the family connexion of its author:
it is an _Irish_ work with regard to the place of his nativity. It is an
_English_ work as to the scenes which it represents; a _French_ work as to
the language in which it was written; a _Dutch_ work as to the country in
which it came to light. It was formerly printed anonymously: it has since
borne the name of its author. It was formerly printed for public sale: it
has been twice printed for private circulation. It was formerly classed as
fiction: it is now believed to be history.

But we have too many enigmas in the annals of literature, and I must not
add to the number. The work to which I allude is the _Memoires du comte de
Grammont par le comte Antoine Hamilton_.

The various indications of a projected re-impression of the work remind me
of my _portefeuille Hamiltonien_, and impose on me the task of a partial
transcription of its contents.

Of the numerous editions of the _Memoires de Grammont_ as recorded by
Brunet, Renouard, or Querard, or left unrecorded by those celebrated
bibliographers, I shall describe only four; which I commend to the critical
examination of future editors:

    1. "_Memoires de la vie du comte de Grammont; contenant
    particulierement l'histoire amoureuse de la cour d'Angleterre, sous le
    regne de Charles II._ A Cologne, chez Pierre Marteau, 1713. 12^o, pp. 4
    + 428.

    "AVIS DU LIBRAIRE.--Il seroit inutile de recommander ici la lecture des
    memoires qui composent ce volume: le titre seul de _Memoires du comte
    de Grammont_ reveillera sans doute la curiosite du public pour un homme
    qui lui est deja si connu d'ailleurs, tant par la reputation qu'il a
    scu se faire, que par les differens portraits qu'en ont donnez Mrs. de
    Bussi et de St. Evremont, dans leurs ouvrages; et l'on ne doute
    nullement qu'il ne recoive, avec beaucoup de plaisir, un livre, dans
    lequel on lui raconte ses avantures, sur ce qu'il en a bien voulu
    raconter lui-meme a celui qui a pris la peine de dresser ces memoires.

    "Outre les avantures du comte de Grammont, ils contiennent
    particulie[re]ment l'histoire amoureuse de la cour d'Angleterre, sous
    le regne de Charles II; et, comme on y decouvre quantite de choses, qui
    ont ete tenues cachees jusqu'a present, et qui font voir jusqu'a quel
    exces on a porte le dereglement dans cette cour, ce n'est pas le
    morceau le moins interessant de ces memoires.

    "On les donne ici sur une copie manuscrite, qu'on en a recue de Paris:
    et on les a fait imprimer avec le plus d'exactitude qu'il a ete
    possible."

The above is the _first_ edition. The imprint is fictitious. It was much
used by the Elzevirs, and by other Dutch printers. The second edition, with
the same imprint, is dated in 1714 (Cat. de Guyon de Sardiere, No. 939.).
The third edition was printed at Rotterdam in 1716. The _avis_ is omitted
in that edition, and in all the later impressions which I have seen. Its
importance as a history of the publication induces one to revive it. There
is also an edition printed at Amsterdam in 1717 (Cat. de Lamy, No. 3918.);
and another at La Haye in 1731 (Cat. de Rothelin, No. 2534*). Brunet omits
the edition of 1713. Renouard and Querard notice it too briefly.

    "AVERTISSEMENT. Le public a fait un accueil si favorable a ces
    _Memoires_, que nous avons cru devoir en procurer une nouvelle edition.
    Outre les avantures du comte de Grammont, tres-piquantes par
    elles-memes, ils contiennent l'histoire amoureuse d'Angleterre sous le
    regne de Charles II. Ils sont d'ailleurs ecrits d'une maniere si vive
    et si ingenieuse, qu'ils ne laisseroient pas de plaire infiniment,
    quand la matiere en seroit moins interessante.

    "Le heros de ces _Memoires_ a trouve dans le comte Hamilton un
    historien digne de lui. Car on n'ignore plus qu'ils sont partis de la
    meme main a qui l'on doit encore d'autres ouvrages frappes au meme
    coin.

    "Nous avons enrichi cette edition d'un discours mele de prose et de
    vers, ou l'on exagere la difficulte qu'il y a de bien representer le
    comte de Grammont. On reconnoitra facilement que ce discours est du
    meme auteur que les _Memoires_, et qu'il devoit naturellement en {4}
    orner le frontispice. Au reste il ne nous appartient point d'en
    apprecier le merite. Nous dirons seulement que des personnes d'un gout
    sur et delicat le comparent au _Voyage de Chapelle_, et qu'ils y
    trouvent les memes graces, le meme naturel et la meme legerete.

    "Il ne nous reste plus qu'a dire un mot de M. Hamilton lui-meme, auteur
    de ces memoires, et du discours qui les precede.

    "Antoine Hamilton dont nous parlons, etoit de l'ancienne et illustre
    maison de ce nom en Ecosse. Il naquit en Irlande. Il eut pour pere le
    chevalier Georges Hamilton, petit-fils du duc d'Hamilton, qui fut aussi
    duc de Chatelleraud en France.

    "Sa mere etoit madame Marie Butler, soeur du duc d'Ormond, viceroi
    d'Irlande, et grand maitre de la maison du roi Charles.

    "Dans les revolutions qui arriverent du tems de Cromwel, ils suivirent
    le roi et le duc d'Yorck son frere qui passerent en France. Ils y
    amenerent leur famille. Antoine ne faisoit a peine que de naitre.

    "Lorsque le roi fut retabli sur son trone, il ramena en Angleterre les
    jeux et la magnificence. On voit dans les memoires de Grammont combien
    cette cour etoit brillante; la curiosite y attira le comte de Grammont.
    Il y vit mademoiselle d'Hamilton, il ne tarda pas a sentir le pouvoir
    de ses charmes, il l'epousa enfin; et c'est la tendresse qu'_Antoine_
    avoit pour sa soeur, qui l'engagea a faire plusieurs voyages en France,
    ou il etoit eleve, et ou il a passe une partie de sa vie.

    "M. Antoine Hamilton etant catholique, il ne put obtenir d'emploi en
    Angleterre; et rien ne fut capable d'ebranler ni sa religion, ni la
    fidelite qu'il devoit a son roi.

    "Le roi Jaques etant monte sur le trone, il lui donna un regiment
    d'infanterie en Irlande et le gouvernement de Limeric. Mais ce prince,
    ayant ete oblige de quitter ses etats le comte Hamilton repassa avec la
    famille royale en France. C'est-la et pendant le long sejour qu'il y a
    fait, qu'il a compose les divers ouvrages qui lui ont acquis tant de
    reputation. Il mourut a S. Germain le 21 Avril 1720. dans de grands
    sentimens de piete, et apres avoir recu les derniers sacremens. Il
    etoit age alors d'environ 74 ans. Il a merite les regrets de tous ceux
    qui avoient le bonheur de le connoitre. Ne serieux, il avoit dans
    l'esprit tous les agremens imaginables; mais ce qui est plus digne de
    louanges, a ces agremens, qui vent frivoles sans la vertu, il joignoit
    toutes les qualitez du coeur."

If the above _avertissement_ first appeared in 1746, which I have much
reason to conclude, this is certainly a very important edition. The
biographical portion of the advertisement is the foundation of the later
memoirs of Hamilton. In the Moreri of 1759, we have it almost _verbatim_,
but taken from the _Oeuvres du comte Antoine Hamilton_, 1749. Neither
Brunet, nor Renouard, nor Querard notice the edition of 1746. The copy
which I have examined has the book-plate G. III. R.

    3. "_Memoires du comte de Grammont, par le C. Antoine Hamilton_. 1760."
    [De l'imprimerie de Didot, rue Pavee, 1760.] 12^o. I. partie, pp. 36 +
    316. II. partie, pp. 4 + 340.

This edition has the same _avertissement_ as that of 1746. The imprint is
M.DCC.LX. The type resembles our small pica, and the paper has the
water-mark _Auvergne_ 1749. At the end of the second part appears, _De
l'imprimerie de Didot, rue Pavee_, 1760. This must be M. Francois Didot of
Paris. I find the same colophon in the _Bibliographie instructive_, 1763-8.
v. 631. This very neat edition has also escaped the aforesaid bibliographic
trio!

    4. "_Memoires du comte de Grammont, par monsieur le comte Antoine

    "L'editeur vous consacre cette edition, comme un monument de son
    amitie, de son admiration, et de son respect; a vous, dont les graces,
    l'esprit, et le gout retracent au siecle present le siecle de Louis
    quatorze et les agremens de l'auteur de ces memoires."

Such are the inscriptions on the _Strawberry-Hill gem_. Much has been said
of its brilliancy--and so, for the sake of novelty, I shall rather dwell on
its flaws.

The volume was printed at the private press of M. Horace Walpole at
Strawberry-Hill, and the impression was limited to one hundred copies, of
which thirty were sent to Paris. So much for its attractions--now for its
flaws. In reprinting the dedication to madame du Deffand, I had to insert
_eight_ accents to make decent French of it! The _avis_ is a mere medley of
fragments: I could not ask a compositor to set it up! The _avertissement_
is copied, without a word of intimation to that effect, from the edition of
1746. The notes to the _epitre_ are also copied from that edition, except
_L'abbe de Chaulieu_; and two of the notes to the memoirs are from the same
source. The other notes, in the opinion of sir William Musgrave, are in
part taken from an erroneous printed _Key_. Where are the
_eclaircissements_? I find none except a list of proper names--of which
about one-third part is omitted!

In quoting Brunet, I have used the fourth edition of the _Manuel du
libraire_, 1842-4; in quoting Renouard, I refer to the _avis_ prefixed to
the _Oeuvres du comte Antoine Hamilton_, 1812; in quoting Querard, to _La
France litteraire_, 1827-39. The other references are to sale catalogues.
The titles of the books described, and the extracts, are given _literatim_,
and, except as above noted, with the same accentuation and punctuation.

To revert to the question of a new edition: I should prefer the French
text, for various reasons, to any English translation that could be made.
That of Abel Boyer is wretched burlesque!

The chief requirements of a French edition would be, a collation of the
editions of 1713 and 1746--the rectification of the names of persons {5}
and places--a revision of the punctuation--and a strict conformity, as to
general orthography and accentuation, with the _Dictionnaire de l'Academie
francaise_, as edited in 1835. The substance of the _avis_ of 1713 might be
stated in a preface; and the _avertissement_ of 1746, a clever composition,
would serve as an introduction and memoir of the author. Those who doubt
its value may consult the _Grand dictionnaire historique_, and the
_Biographie universelle_. As one hundred and sixty persons are noticed in
the work, brevity of annotation is very desirable. It would require much
research. The manuscript notes of sir William Musgrave would, however, be
very serviceable--more so, I conceive, than the printed notes of M. Horace
Walpole.

As the indications of a projected re-impression may be fallacious, I shall
conclude with a word of advice to inexperienced collectors. Avoid the
_jolie edition_ printed at Paris by F. A. Didot, _par ordre de monseigneur
le comte d'Artois_, in 1781. It is the very worst specimen of editorship.
Avoid also the London edition of 1792. The preface is a piratical
pasticcio; the verbose notes are from the most accessible books; the
portraits, very unequal in point of execution, I believe to be chiefly
copies of prints--not _d'apres des tableaux originaux_. The most desirable
editions are, 1. The edition of 1760; 2. That of 1772, as a _curiosity_; 3.
That edited by M. Renouard, Paris, 1812, 18^o. 2 vols.; 4. That edited by
M. Renouard in 1812, 8^o. with eight portraits. The latter edition forms
part of the _Oeuvres du comte Antoine Hamilton_ in 3 vols. It seldom occurs
for sale.

THE "ANCREN RIWLE."

The publication of this valuable semi-Saxon or Early English treatise on
the duties of monastic life, recently put forth by the Camden Society,
under the editorship of the Rev. James Morton, is extremely acceptable, and
both the Society and the editor deserve the cordial thanks of all who are
interested in the history of our language. As one much interested in the
subject, and who many years since entertained the design now so ably
executed by Mr. Morton, I may perhaps be allowed to offer a few remarks on
the work itself, and on the manuscripts which contain it. Mr. Morton is
unquestionably right in his statement that the Latin MS. in Magdalen
College, Oxford, No. 67., is only an abridged translation of the original
vernacular text. Twenty-three years ago I had access to the same MS. by
permission of the Rev. Dr. Routh, the President of Magdalen College, and
after reading and making extracts from it[1], I came to the same conclusion
as Mr. Morton. It hardly admits, I think, of a doubt; for even without the
internal evidence furnished by the Latin copy, the age of the manuscripts
containing the Early English text at once set aside the supposition that
Simon of Ghent (Bishop of Salisbury from 1297 to 1315) was the original
author of the work. The copy in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, I have
not seen, but of the three copies in the British Museum I feel confident
that the one marked Cleopatra C. vi. was actually written before Bishop
Simon of Ghent had emerged from the nursery. This copy is not only the
oldest, but the most curious, from the corrections and alterations made in
it by a somewhat later hand, the chief of which are noticed in the printed
edition. The collation, however, of this MS. might have been, with
advantage, made more minutely, for at present many readings are passed
over. Thus, at p. 8., for _unweote_ the second hand has _congoun_; at p.
62., for _herigen_ it has _preisen_; at p. 90., for _on cheafle_, it reads
_o muthe_, &c. The original hand has also some remarkable variations, which
would cause a suspicion that this was the first draft of the author's work.
Thus, at p. 12., for _scandle_, the first hand has _schonde_; at p. 62.,
for _baldeliche_ it reads _bradliche_; at p. 88., for _nout for_, it has
_anonden_, and the second hand _aneust_; at p. 90., for _sunderliche_ it
reads _sunderlepes_, &c. All these, and many other curious variations, are
not noticed in the printed edition. On the fly-leaf of this MS. is written,
in a hand of the time of Edward I., as follows: "_Datum abbatie et
conventui de Leghe per Dame M. de Clare._" The lady here referred to was
doubtless Maud de Clare, second wife of Richard de Clare, Earl of Hereford
and Gloucester, who, at the beginning of the reign of Edward I., is known
to have changed the Augustinian Canons of Leghe, in Devonshire, into an
abbess and nuns of the same order; and it was probably at the same period
she bestowed this volume on them. The conjecture of Mr. Morton, that Bishop
Poore, who died in 1237, might have been the original author of the _Ancren
Riwle_, is by no means improbable, and deserves farther inquiry. The error
as to Simon of Ghent is due, in the first place, not to Dr. Smith, but to
Richard James (Sir Robert Cotton's librarian), who wrote on the fly-leaves
of all the MSS. in the Cottonian Library a note of their respective
contents, and who is implicitly followed by Smith. Wanley is more blamable,
and does not here evince his usual critical accuracy, but (as remarked by
Mr. Morton) he could only have looked at a few pages of the work. The real
fact seems to be that Simon of Ghent made the abridged Latin version of the
seven books of the _Riwle_ now preserved in Magdalen College, and this
supposition may well enough be reconciled with the words of Leland, who
says of him,--

    "Edidit inter caetera, libros _septem_ de Vita Solitaria, {6} ad
    Virgines Tarentinas, Duriae cultrices."--_Comment_., p. 316.

A second copy of the Latin version was formerly in the Cottonian collection
(Vitellius E. vii.), but no fragment of it has hitherto been recovered from
the mass of burnt crusts and leaves left after the fire of 1731. I am
happy, however, to add, that within the last few months, the manuscript
marked Vitellius F. vii., containing a French translation of the _Riwle_,
made in the fourteenth century (very closely agreeing with the vernacular
text), has been entirely restored, except that the top margins of the
leaves have been burnt at each end of the volume. This damage has,
unfortunately, carried away the original heading of the treatise, and the
title given us by Smith is copied partly from James's note. This copy of
the French version appears to be unique, and is the more interesting from
its having a note at the end (now half obliterated by the fire), stating
that it belonged to Eleanor de Bohun, Duchess of Gloucester, whose motto is
also added, "_Plesance. M [mil]. en vn_." The personage in question was
Eleanor, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and wife of
Thomas of Woodstock, who ended her days as a nun in the convent at Barking
in 1399. Is any other instance known of the use of this motto? Before I
conclude these brief remarks, I may mention a _fifth_ copy of the _Ancren
Riwle_, which has escaped the notice of Mr. Morton. It is buried in the
enormous folio manuscript of old English poetry and prose called the Vernon
MS., in the Bodleian Library, written in the reign of Richard II., and
occurs at pp. 371^b.--392. In the table of contents prefixed to this volume
it is entitled "The Roule of Reclous;" and although the phraseology is
somewhat modernised, it agrees better with the MS. Cleopatra C. vi, than
with Nero A. xiv., from which Mr. Morton's edition is printed. This copy is
not complete, some leaves having been cut out in the sixth book, and the
scribe leaves off at p. 420. of the printed edition.

It is very much to be wished that Mr. Morton would undertake the task of
editing another volume of legends, homilies, and poems, of the same age as
the _Ancren Riwle_, still existing in various manuscripts. One of the
homilies, entitled "Sawles Warde," in the Bodley MS. 34., Cott. MS. Titus
D. xviii., and Old Royal MS. 17A. xxvii., is very curious, and well
deserves to be printed.

ORDER FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VAGRANCY, A.D. 1650-51.

At a time when the question of "What is to be done with our vagrant
children?" is occupying the attention of all men of philanthropic minds, it
may be worth while to give place in your pages to the following order
addressed by the Lord Mayor of London to his aldermen in 1650-51, which
applies, amongst other things, to that very subject. It will be seen that
some of the artifices of beggary in that day were very similar to those
with which we are now but too familiar. The difference of treatment between
vagrant children over and under nine years of age, is worthy of
observation.

    "BY THE MAYOR.

    "Forasmuch as of late the constables of this city have neglected to put
    in execution the severall wholsome laws for punishing of vagrants, and
    passing them to the places of their last abode, whereby great scandall
    and dishonour is brought upon the government of this city; These are
    therefore to will and require you, or your deputy, forthwith to call
    before you the several constables within your ward, and strictly to
    charge them to put in execution the said laws, or to expect the penalty
    of forty shillings to be levyed upon their estates, for every vagrant
    that shal be found begging in their several precincts. And to the end
    the said constables may not pretend ignorance, what to do with the
    several persons which they shal find offending the said laws, these are
    further to require them, that al aged or impotent persons who are not
    fit to work, be passed from constable to constable to the parish where
    they dwel; and that the constable in whose ward they are found begging,
    shal give a passe under his hand, expressing the place where he or she
    were taken, and the place whither they are to be passed. _And for
    children under five years of age, who have no dwelling, or cannot give
    an account of their parents, the parish where they are found are to
    provide for them; and for those which shall bee found lying under
    stalls, having no habitation or parents (from five to nine years old),
    are to be sent to the Wardrobe House_[2], _to be provided for by the
    corporation for the poore; and all above nine years of age are to be
    sent to Bridewel._ And for men or women who are able to work and goe
    begging with young children, such persons for the first time to be
    passed to the place of their abode as aforesaid; and being taken
    againe, they are to be carryed to Bridewel, to be corrected according
    to the discretion of the governours. _And for those persons that shal
    be found to hire children, or go begging with children not sucking,
    those children are to be sent to the several parishes wher they dwel,
    and the persons so hiring them to Bridewel, to be corrected and passed
    away, or kept at work there, according to the governour's discretion._
    And for al other vagrants and beggars under any pretence whatsoever, to
    be forthwith sent down to Bridewel to be imployed and corrected,
    according to the statute laws of this commonwealth, except before
    excepted; and the president and governours of Bridewel are hereby
    desired to meet twice every week to see to the execution of this
    Precept. _And the steward of the workehouse called the Wardrobe, is {7}
    authorised to receive into that house such children as are of the age
    between five and nine, as is before specified and limited_; and the
    said steward is from time to time to acquaint the corporation for the
    poor, what persons are brought in, to the end they may bee provided
    for. Dated this four and twentyeth day of January, 1650.

    Sir,

    Riding out this morning to dine here with Mr. Grattan, I saw at his
    house the poor lame boy that gives you this: he was a servant to a
    plow-man near Lusk, and while he was following the plow, a dog bit him
    in the leg, about eleven weeks ago. One Mrs. Price endeavored six weeks
    to cure him, but could not, and his Master would maintain him no
    longer. Mr. Grattan and I are of opinion that he may be a proper object
    to be received into Dr. Stephen's Hospital. The boy tells his story
    naturally, and Mr. Grattan and I took pity of him. If you find him
    curable, and it be not against the rules of the Hospitall, I hope you
    will receive him.

  I am, Sir,
    Your most humble Servt.

    Worthy Sir

    I am glad to hear Mrs. Elstob is in a condition to pay her debts, for
    me she may be very easy: tho' I could wish for the sake of the
    University (tho' I am no way engaged, having taken up my obligation)
    that you could recover the Book, or at least could find where it is
    lodged, that Mr. Brook may know where to demand it. This, I presume,
    may be done.

    If you have met with Books printed by Guttenberg, you have made a great
    discovery. I thought there had been none such in the world, and began
    to look upon Fust as the first Printer. I have seen the Bishop of Ely's
    Catholicon (now with us), which, for aught I know, may have been
    printed by Guttenberg; for tho' it be printed at Ments, yet there is no
    name of the Printer, and the character is more rude than Fust's
    Tullie's Offices, whereof there are two Copies in 1465 and 1466, the
    first on vellum, the other on paper.

    May I make a small enquiry, after the mention of so great a name as
    Guttenberg? I remember, you told me, my Lord Harley had two Copies of
    Edw. the Sixth's first Common Prayer Book. Do you remember whether
    either of them be printed by Grafton, the King's Printer? I have seen
    four or five Editions by Whitchurch, but never could meet with any by
    Grafton, except one in my custody, which I shall look upon to be a
    great Rarity, if it be likewise wanting to my Lord's Collection. It
    varies from all the other Copies, and is printed in 1548. All the rest,
    I think, in 1549. One reason of my enquiry is, because I want the
    Title, for the date is at the end of the Book, and indeed twice; both
    on the end of the Communion Office, and of the Litany. But I beg your
    pardon for so small an enquiry, whilst you are in quest of Guttenberg
    and Nic. Jenson. My business consists much in trifles.

  I am, Sir,
    Your most ob. humble
      Servant,
          THO. BAKER.

Taunton, dated Dunsland, March_ 7, 1731.

[MS. Addit., Brit. Mus., 4309, fol. 358.]

    I cannot forbear acquainting you of a very curious passage in relation
    to Charles the Second's Restoration. Sir Wm. Morrice, who was one of
    the Secretaries of State soon after, was the person who chiefly
    transacted that affair with Monk, so that all the papers in order to it
    were sent him, both from King Charles and Lord Clarendon. Just after
    the thing was finished, Lord Clarendon got more than 200 of these
    Letters and other papers from Morrice under pretence of finishing his
    History, and which were never returned. Lord Somers, when he was
    chancellor, told Morrice's Grandson that if he would file a Bill in
    Chancery, he would endeavour to get them; but young Morrice having
    deserted the Whig Interest, was {8} prevailed upon to let it drop. This
    I know to be fact, for I had it not only from the last-mentioned
    Gentleman, but others of that family, especially a son of the
    Secretaries. As soon as I knew this, I took the first opportunity of
    searching the study, and found some very curious Letters, which one
    time or other I design to publish together with the account of that
    affair. My mother being Niece to the Secretary, hath often heard him
    say that Charles the Second was not only very base in not keeping the
    least of the many things that he had promised; but by debauching the
    Nation, had rendered it fitt for that terrible fellow (meaning the Duke
    of York) to ruin us all, and then Monk and him would be remembred to
    their Infamy.

BURIAL-PLACE OF ARCHBISHOP LEIGHTON.

On a visit this autumn with some friends to the picturesque village and
church of Horsted-Keynes, Sussex, our attention was forcibly arrested by
the appearance of two large pavement slabs, inserted in an erect position
on the external face of the south wall of the chancel. They proved to be
those which once had covered and protected the grave of the good Archbishop
Leighton, who passed the latter years of his life in that parish, and that
of Sir Ellis Leighton, his brother. On inquiry, it appeared that their
remains had been deposited within a small chapel on the south side of the
chancel, the burial-place of the Lightmaker family, of Broadhurst, in the
parish of Horsted. The archbishop retired thither in 1674, and resided with
his only sister, Saphira, widow of Mr. Edward Lightmaker. Broadhurst, it
may be observed, is sometimes incorrectly mentioned by the biographers of
Archbishop Leighton as a parish; it is an ancient mansion, the residence
formerly of the Lightmakers, and situated about a mile north of the village
of Horsted. There it was that Leighton made his will, in February, 1683;
but his death occurred, it will be remembered, in singular accordance with
his desire often expressed, at an inn, the Bell, in Warwick Lane, London.

The small chapel adjacent to the chancel, and opening into it by an arch
now walled up, had for some time, as I believe, been used as a school-room;
more recently, however, either through its becoming out of repair, or from
some other cause, the little structure was demolished. The large slabs
which covered the tombs of the good prelate and his brother were taken up
and fixed against the adjoining wall. The turf now covers the space thus
thrown into the open churchyard; nothing remains to mark the position of
the graves, which in all probability, ere many years elapse, will be
disturbed through ignorance or heedlessness, and the ashes of Leighton
scattered to the winds.

In times when special respect has been shown to the tombs of worthies of
bygone times, with the recent recollection also of what has been so well
carried out by MR. MARKLAND in regard to the grave of Bishop Ken, shall we
not make an effort to preserve from desecration and oblivion the
resting-place of one so eminent as Leighton for his learning and piety, so
worthy to be held in honoured remembrance for his high principles and his
consistent conduct in an evil age?

_Grammars, &c. for Public Schools._--Would it not be desirable for some
correspondents of "N. & Q." to furnish information respecting grammars,
classics, and other works which have been written for the various public
schools? Such information might be useful to book collectors; and would
also serve to reflect credit on the schools whose learned masters have
prepared such books. My contribution to the list is small: but I remember a
valuable Greek grammar prepared by the Rev. ---- Hook, formerly head master
of the College School at Gloucester, for the use of that establishment; as
also a peculiar English grammar prepared by the Rev. R. S. Skillern, master
of St. Mary de Crypt School, in the same place, for the use of that school.
I also possess a copy (1640) of the _Romanae Historiae Anthologia_, for the
use of Abingdon School, and _Moses and Aaron, or the Rites and Customs of
the Hebrews_ (1641), both by Thos. Godwin, though the latter was written
after he ceased to be master of the schools.

"_To captivate._"--Moore, in his Journal, speaking of the Americans
(January 9th, 1819), says:

    "They sometimes, I see, use the word _captivate_ thus: 'Five or six
    ships captivated,' 'Five or six ships captivated.'"

Originally, the words _to captivate_ were synonymous with _to capture_, and
the expression was used with reference to warlike operations. To captivate
the affections was a secondary use of the phrase. The word is used in the
original sense in many old English books. It is not used so now in the
United States.

_Bohn's Edition of Matthew of Westminster._--Under the year A.D. 782, the
translator informs us that "Hirenes and _his_ son Constantine became
emperors." Such an emperor is not to be found {9} in the annals of
Constantinople. If Mr. Yonge, who shows elsewhere that he has read Gibbon,
had referred to him on this occasion, he would probably have found that the
Empress Irene, a name dear to the reverencers of images, was the person
meant. The original Latin probably gives no clue to the sex; but still this
empress, who is considered as a saint by her church, notwithstanding the
deposition and blinding of her own son, was not a personage to be so easily
forgotten.

Queries.

DOMESTIC LETTERS OF EDMUND BURKE.

In the curious and able article entitled "The Domestic Life of Edmund
Burke," which appeared in the _Athenaeum_ of Dec. 10th and Dec. 17th (and
to which I would direct the attention of such readers of "N. & Q." as have
not yet seen it), the writer observes:

    "There is not in existence, as far as we know, or have a right to infer
    from the silence of the biographers, one single letter, paper, or
    document of any kind--except a mysterious fragment of one
    letter--relating to the domestic life of the Burkes, until long after
    Edmund Burke became an illustrious and public man; no letters from
    parents to children, from children to parents, from brother to brother,
    or brother to sister."

And as Edmund Burke was the last survivor of the family, the inference
drawn by the writer, that they were destroyed by him, seems, on the grounds
which he advances, a most reasonable one. But my object in writings is to
call attention to a source from which, if any such letters exist, they may
yet possibly be recovered; I mean the collections of professed collectors
of autographs. On the one hand, it is scarcely to be conceived that the
destroyer of these materials for the history of the Burkes, be he who he
may, can have got _all_ the family correspondence into his possession. On
the other, it is far from improbable that in some of the collections to
which I have alluded, some letters, notes, or documents may exist,
treasured by the possessors as mere autographs; but which might, if given
to the world, serve to solve many of those mysteries which envelope the
early history of Edmund Burke. The discovery of documents of such a
character seems to be the special province of "N. & Q.," and I hope,
therefore, although this letter has extended far beyond the limits I
originally contemplated, you will insert it, and so permit me to put this
Query to autograph collectors, "Have you any documents illustrative of the
Burkes?" and to add as a Note, "If so, print them!"

    resides at Woodburne, in Maryland, United States."

Fairfax is not a Scotch name. And I can find no trace of any person of that
family taking a part in Scotch affairs. _Cameron_ is, I suppose, the parish
of that name in the east of Fife.

Scotland, if they ever held any?

5thly. If he be a subject of the United States, and have taken, expressly
or by implication, the oath of citizenship (which pointedly renounces
allegiance to our sovereign), how is it that his name is retained on the

existence is a denial of the first proposition in the constitution of his

_Naval Atrocities._--In the article on "Wounds," in the _Encyc. Brit._, 4th

that "this is particularly necessary on board ship, where, as soon as any
man is pronounced by the surgeon to be mortally wounded, he is forthwith,
while still living and conscious, thrown overboard," or words to this
effect, as I quote from memory. That such horrid barbarity was not
practised in 1810, it is needless to say; and if it had been usual at any
previous period, Smollett and other writers who have exposed with unsparing
hand all the defects in the naval system of their day, would have scarcely
left this unnoticed when they attack much slighter abuses. If such a thing
ever occurred, even in the worst of times, it must have been an isolated
case. I have not met elsewhere with any allusion to this passage, or the

    feet long, and so bulky that two tall men placed one on each side of
    the fish could not see one another."--_The History and Antiquities of

Minor Queries with Answers.

_Lawless Court, Rochford, Essex._--A most extraordinary custom exists, in a
manor at Rochford, in the tenants holding under what is called the "Lawless
Court." This court is held at midnight, by torch-light, in the centre of a
field, on the first Friday after the 29th Sept., and is presided over by
the steward of the manor, who, however, appoints a deputy to fulfil this
part of his duty. The tenants of the manor are obliged to attend to answer
to their names, when called upon, under pain of a heavy fine, or at all
events have some one there to respond for them. All the proceedings are
carried on in a whisper, no one speaking above that tone of voice; and the
informations as to deaths, names, &c. are entered in a book by the
president with a piece of charcoal. I may add, the business is not
commenced until a cock has crowed three times, and as it is sometimes a
difficult matter to get Chanticleer to do his duty, a man is employed to
crow, whose fee therefor is 5s.

Now Morant, in his _History of Essex_, merely cursorily mentions this most
singular custom, and has nothing as to its antiquity or origin; I should
therefore feel much obliged for any information concerning it.

RUSSELL GOLE.

    [The singular custom at Rochford is of uncertain origin: in old authors
    it is spoken of as belonging to the manor of Rayleigh. The following
    account of "The Lawless Court," at that place, is printed by Hearne
    from the Dodsworth MSS. in the Bodleian, vol. cxxv.:--"The manor of
    Raylie, in Essex, hath a custome court kept yearly, the Wednesday nexte
    after Michael's day. The court is kept in the night, and without light,
    but as the skye gives, att a little hill without the towne, called the
    King's Hill, where the steward writes only with coals, and not with
    inke. And many men and mannors of greate worth hold of the same, and do
    suite unto this strange court, where the steward calls them with as low
    a voice as possibly he may; giving no notice when he goes to the hill
    to keepe the same court, and he that attends not is deepely amerced, if
    the steward will. The title and entry of the same court is as
    followeth, viz.:

     'Curia de domino rege,
      Dicta _sine lege_,
      Tenta est ibidem,
      Per ejusdem consuetudinem,
        Ante ortum solis,
      Luceat nisi polus,
      Seneschallus solus,
        Scribit nisi colis.
      Clamat clam pro rege
      In curia _sine lege_:
      Et qui non cito venerit
      Citius poenitebit:
      Si venerit cum lumine
      Errat in regimine.
      Et dum sine lumine
      Capti sunt in crimine,
      Curia sine cura
      Jurata de injuria
        Tenta est die Mercuriae
          prox. post festum S. Michaelis.'"

    Weever, who mentions this custom, says, that he was informed that "this
    servile attendance was imposed, at the first, upon certaine tenants of
    divers mannors hereabouts, for conspiring in this place, at such an
    unseasonable time, to raise a commotion."]

_Motto on old Damask._--Can your correspondents furnish an explanation of
the motto herewith sent? It is taken from some damask table napkins which
were bought many years back at Brussels; not at a shop in the ordinary way,
but privately, from the family to whom they belonged. I presume the larger
characters, if put together, will indicate the date of the event, whatever
that may be, which is referred to in the motto itself.

The motto is woven in the pattern of the damask, and consists of the
following words in uncials, the letters of unequal size, as subjoined:

    "SIGNUM PACIS DATUR LORICAE."

the larger letters being IUMCIDULIC. If the U's are taken as two V's, and
written thus X, it gives the date MDCCLXIII. Perhaps this can be explained.

    [The chronogram above, which means "The signal of peace is given to the

    the year 1763. This event is noticed in the _Annual Register_, and in
    most of our popular histories. Keightley says, "The overtures of France
    for peace were readily listened to; and both parties being in earnest,
    the preliminaries were readily settled at Fontainebleau (Nov. 3rd). In
    spite of the declamation of Mr. Pitt and his party, they were approved
    of by large majorities in both Houses of Parliament, and a treaty was
    finally signed in Paris, Feb. 18, 1763." The napkins were probably a

_Explanation of the Word "Miser."_--Can any of your readers explain how and

Spenser's _Faerie Queene_, II. l. 8., it is used in its nearly primary
sense of "wretch:"

 "Vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble _miser's_ sake."

Again, _Faerie Queene_, II. 3. 8.:

 "The _miser_ threw himself, as an offall,
  Straight at his foot in base humility."

In Milton's _Comus_, which was written about fifty years after the first
three books of the _Faerie Queene,_ the present signification of the word
is complete:

 "You may as well spread out the unsunn'd heaps
  Of _miser's_ treasure by an outlaw's den,
  And tell me it is safe, as bid one hope
  Danger will sink on opportunity," &c.

     "Decrepit _miser_! base ignoble wretch!"

    Steevens says has no relation to avarice, but simply means a
    _miserable_ creature. So in the interlude of _Jacob and Esau_, 1568:

     "But as for these _misers_ within my father's tent."

    Again, in Lord Stirling's tragedy of _Croesus_, 1604:

     "Or think'st thou me of judgement too remiss,
      A _miser_ that in miserie remains."

    Otway, however, in his _Orphan_, published in 1680, uses it for a
    covetous person:

     "Though she be dearer to my soul than rest
      To weary pilgrims, or to _misers_ gold,
      Rather than wrong Castalio, I'd forget thee."

    So also does Pope:

were written by Gay? Hawkins merely states that they "are said to have been
written by Mr. Gay." I have no copy of Burney at hand to refer to; but I
find the same statement repeated by various other musical historians,
without, however, any authority being given for it. The words in question

RAPPING NO NOVELTY.

(Vol. viii., pp. 512. 632.)

The story referred to is certainly a very curious one, and I should like to
know whether it is exactly as it was told by Baxter, especially as there
seems to be reason for believing that De Foe (whom on other grounds one
would not trust in such a matter) did not take it from the work which he
quotes. Perhaps if you can find room for the statement, some correspondent
would be so good as to state whether it has the sanction of Baxter:

    "Mr. Baxter, in his _Historical Discourse of Apparitions_, writes thus:
    'There is now in London an understanding, sober, pious man, oft one of
    my hearers, who has an elder brother, a gentleman of considerable rank,
    who having formerly seemed pious, of late years does often fall into
    the sin of drunkenness; he often lodges long together here in his
    brother's house, and whensoever he is drunk and has slept himself
    sober, something knocks at his bed's head, as if one knocked on a
    wainscot. When they remove his bed it follows him. Besides other loud
    noises on other parts where he is, that all the house hears, they have
    often watched him, and kept his hands lest he should do it himself. His
    brother has often told it me, and brought his wife, a discreet woman,
    to attest it, who avers moreover, that as she watched him, she has seen
    his shoes under the bed taken up, and nothing visible to touch them.
    They brought the man himself to me, and when we asked {13} him how he
    dare sin again after such a warning, he had no excuse. But being
    persons of quality, for some special reason of worldly interest I must
    not name him.'"--De Foe's _Life of Duncan Campbell_, 2nd ed. p. 107.

After this story, De Foe says:

    "Another relation of this kind was sent to Dr. Beaumont (whom I myself
    personally knew, and which he has inserted in his account of genii, or
    familiar spirits) in a letter by an ingenious and learned clergyman of
    Wiltshire," &c.

But he does not say that the story which he has already quoted as from
Baxter stands just as he has given it, and with a reference to Baxter, in
Beaumont's _Historical, Physiological, and Theological Treatise of
Spirits_, p. 182. Of course one does not attach any weight to De Foe's
saying that he knew Dr. Beaumont "personally," but does anybody know
anything of him? Nearly four years ago you inserted somewhat similar
inquiry about this Duncan Campbell, but I believe it has not yet been
answered.

From a volume of Forms of Prayer in the library of Sir Robert Taylor's
Institution, I send you the following list, as supplementary to MR.
LATHBURY'S. This volume forms part of a collection of books bequeathed to
the University by the late Robert Finch, M.A., formerly of Baliol College:

    A Form of Prayer for a General Fast, &c. 4to. London. 1762.

In both the Morning and Evening Services of this Form "A Prayer for the
Reformed Churches" is included, which is omitted in all the subsequent
Forms. This is a copy of it:

    "_A Prayer for the Reformed Churches._

    "O God, the Father of Mercies, we present our Supplications unto Thee,
    more especially on behalf of our Reformed Brethren, whom, blessed be
    Thy Name, Thou hast hitherto wonderfully supported. Make them perfect,
    strengthen, 'stablish them: that they may stand fast in the Liberty
    wherewith Christ hath made them free, and adorn the Doctrine of God our
    Saviour in all things. Preserve the Tranquillity of those who at
    present enjoy it: look down with compassion upon such as are persecuted
    for Righteousness' sake, and plead Thy cause with the oppressors of Thy
    people. Enlighten those who are in Darkness and Error; and give them
    Repentance to the Acknowledgment of the Truth: that all the Ends of the
    World may remember themselves, and be turned unto the Lord; and we all
    may become one Flock, under the great Shepherd and Bishop of our Souls,
    Jesus Christ, our only Mediator and Advocate. Amen."

    his Majesty's present Indisposition. 1788.

The following MS. note is inserted in the handwriting of Mr. Finch, father
of the gentleman who bequeathed the collection:

    "Mrs. Finch accompanied my Father (Rev. Dr. Finch, Rector of St.
    Michael's, Cornhill) to the Cathedral, where he had a seat for himself
    and his lady assigned him under the Dome, as Treasurer to the Society
    for Promoting Christian Knowledge, the original patrons of the Charity
    Schools. Mrs. F. was so fortunate as to obtain a seat in the choir, and
    saw the procession from the choir gate. Myself and Robert saw the
    cavalcade (which was extremely grand, and continued for the space of
    more than three hours, both Houses of Parliament with their attendants
    preceding their Majesties) from Mrs Townsend's house in Fleet
    Street."--April 23, 1789.

CELTIC AND LATIN LANGUAGES.

(Vol. viii., p. 174.)

There was a Query some time ago upon this subject, but though it is one
full of interest to all scholars, I have not observed any Notes worth
mentioning in reply. The connexion between these two languages has only of
late occupied the attention of philologers; but the more closely they are
compared together, the more important and the more striking do the
resemblances appear; and the remark of Arnold with regard to Greek
literature applies equally to Latin, "that we seem now to have reached that
point in our knowledge of the language, at which other languages of the
same family must be more largely studied, before we can make a fresh step
in advance." But this study, as regards the comparison of Celtic and Latin,
is, in England at least, in a very infant state. Professor Newman, in his
_Regal Rome_, has attention to the subject; but his induction does not
appear sufficiently extensive to warrant any decisive conclusion respecting
the position the Celtic holds as an element of the Latin. Pritchard's work
upon the subject is satisfactory as far as it goes, but both these authors
have chiefly confined themselves to a tabular view of Celtic and Latin
words; but it is not _merely_ this we want. What is required is a critical
examination into the comparative structure and formal development of the
two languages, and this is a work still to be accomplished. The later
numbers of Bopp's _Comparative Grammar_ are, I believe, devoted to this
subject, but as they have not been translated, they must be confined to a
limited circle of English readers, and I have not yet seen any reproduction
of the views therein contained in the philological literature of England.

As the first step to considerations of this kind must be made from a large
induction of words, I think, with your correspondent, that the pages of "N.
& Q." might be made useful in supplying "links of connexion" to supply a
groundwork for future comparison. I shall conclude by suggesting one or two
"links" that I do not remember to have seen elsewhere.

1. Is the root of _felix_ to be found in the Irish _fail_, _fate_; the
contraction of the dipththong _ai_ or _e_ being analogous to that of
_amaimus_ into _amemus_?

2. Is it not probable that _Avernus_, if not corrupted from [Greek:
aornos], is related to _iffrin_, the Irish _inferi_? This derivation is at
any rate more probable than that of Grotefend, who connects the word with
[Greek: Acheron].

3. Were the _Galli_, priests of Cybele, so called as being connected with
fire-worship? and is the name at all connected with the Celtic _gal_, a
flame? The word _Gallus_, a Gaul, is of course the same as the Irish _gal_,
a stranger.

GEOMETRICAL CURIOSITY.

(Vol. viii., p. 468.)

MR. INGLEBY'S question might easily be the foundation of a geometrical
paper; but as this would not be a desirable contribution, I will endeavour
to keep clear of technicalities, in pointing out how the process described
may give something near to a circle, or may not.

When a paper figure, bent over a straight line in it, has the two parts
perfectly fitting on each other, the figure is _symmetrical_ about that
straight line, which may be called an _axis of symmetry_. Thus every
diameter of a circle is an axis of symmetry: every regular oval has two
axes of symmetry at right angles to each other: every regular polygon of an
_odd_ number of sides has an axis joining each corner to the middle of the
opposite sides: every regular polygon of an _even_ number of sides has axes
joining opposite corners, and axes joining the middles of opposite sides.

When a piece of paper, of any form whatsoever, rectilinear or curvilinear,
is doubled over any line in it, and when all the parts of either side which
are not covered by the other are cut away, the unfolded figure will of
course have the creased line for an axis of symmetry. If another line be
now creased, and a fold made over it, and the process repeated, the second
line becomes an axis of symmetry, and the first perhaps ceases to be one.
If the process be then repeated on the first line, this last becomes an
axis, and the other (probably) ceases to be an axis. If this process can be
indefinitely continued, the cuttings must become smaller and smaller, for
the following reason. Suppose, at the outset, the boundary point nearest to
the intersection of the axes is distant from that intersection by, say four
inches; it is clear that we cannot, after any number of cuttings, have a
part of the boundary at less than four inches from the intersection. For
there never is, after any cutting, any approach to the intersection except
what there already was on the other side of the axis employed, before that
cutting was made. If then the cuttings should go on for ever, or
practically until the pieces to be cut off are too small, and _if this take
place all round_, the figure last obtained will be a good representation of
a circle of four inches radius. On the suppositions, we must be always
cutting down, at all parts of the boundary; but it has been shown that we
can never come nearer than by four inches to the intersection of the axes.

But it does not follow that the process _will_ go on for ever. We may come
at last to a state in which both the creases are axes of symmetry at once;
and then the process stops. If the paper had at first a curvilinear
boundary, properly chosen, and if the axes were placed at the proper angle,
it would happen that we should arrive at a {15} _regular_ curved polygon,
having the two axes for axes of symmetry. The process would then stop.

I will, however, suppose that the original boundary is everywhere
rectilinear. It is clear then that, after every cutting, the boundary is
still rectilinear. If the creases be at right angles to one another, the
ultimate figure may be an irregular polygon, having its four quarters
alike, such as may be inscribed in an oval; or it may have its sides so
many and so small, that the ultimate appearance shall be that of an oval.
But if the creases be not at right angles, the ultimate figure is a
perfectly regular polygon, such as can be inscribed in a circle; or its
sides may be so many and so small that the ultimate appearance shall be
that of a circle.

Suppose, as in MR. INGLEBY'S question, that the creases are not at right
angles to each other; supposing the eye and the scissors _perfect_, the
results will be as follows:

First, suppose the angle made by the creases to be what the mathematicians
call _incommensurable_ with the whole revolution; that is, suppose that no
repetition of the angle will produce an _exact_ number of revolutions. Then
the cutting will go on for ever, and the result will perpetually approach a
circle. It is easily shown that no figure whatsoever, except a circle, has
two axes of symmetry which make an angle incommensurable with the whole
revolution.

Secondly, suppose the angle of the creases commensurable with the
revolution. Find out the smallest number of times which the angle must be
repeated to give an exact number of revolutions. If that number be even, it
is the number of sides of the ultimate polygon: if that number be odd, it
is the half of the number of sides of the ultimate polygon.

Thus, the paper on which I write, the whole sheet being taken, and the
creases made by joining opposite corners, happens to give the angle of the
creases very close to three-fourteenths of a revolution; so that fourteen
repetitions of the angle is the lowest number which give an exact number of
revolutions; and a very few cuttings lead to a regular polygon of fourteen
sides. But if four-seventeenths of a revolution had been taken for the
angle of the creases, the ultimate polygon would have had thirty-four
sides. In an angle taken at hazard the chances are that the number of
ultimate sides will be large enough to present a circular appearance.

Any reader who chooses may amuse himself by trying results from three or
more axes, whether all passing through one point or not.

THE BLACK-GUARD.

(Vol. viii., p. 414.)

Some of your correspondents, SIR JAMES E. TENNENT especially, have been
very learned on this subject, and all have thrown new light on what I
consider a very curious inquiry. The following document I discovered some
years ago in the Lord Steward's Offices. Your readers will see its value at
once; but it may not be amiss to observe, that the name in its present
application had its origin in the number of masterless boys hanging about
the verge of the Court and other public places, palaces, coal-cellars, and
palace stables; ready with links to light coaches and chairs, and conduct,
and rob people on foot, through the dark streets of London; nay, to follow
the Court in its progresses to Windsor and Newmarket. Pope's "link-boys
vile" are the black-guard boys of the following Proclamation.

PETER CUNNINGHAM.

At the Board of Green Cloth,
in Windsor Castle,
this 7th day of May, 1683.

Whereas of late a sort of vicious, idle, and masterless boyes and rogues,
commonly called the Black-guard, with divers other lewd and loose fellowes,
vagabonds, vagrants, and wandering men and women, do usually haunt and
follow the Court, to the great dishonour of the same, and as Wee are
informed have been the occasion of the late dismall fires that happened in
the towns of Windsor and Newmarket, and have, and frequently do commit
divers other misdemeanours and disorders in such places where they resort,
to the prejudice of His Majesty's subjects, for the prevention of which
evills and misdemeanours hereafter, Wee do hereby strictly charge and
command all those so called the Black-guard as aforesaid, with all other
loose, idle, masterless men, boyes, rogues, and wanderers, who have
intruded themselves into His Majesty's Court or stables, that within the
space of twenty-four houres next after the publishing of this order, they
depart, upon pain of imprisonment, and such other punishments as by law are
to be inflicted on them.

THE CALVES' HEAD CLUB.

(Vol. viii., pp. 315. 480.)

The Calves' Head Club existed much earlier than the time when their doings
were commemorated in the _Weekly Oracle_ (Vol. viii., p. 315.) of February
1, 1735, or depicted in the print of 1734 (Vol. viii., p. 480.). There is a
pamphlet, {16} the second edition of which was published in small 4to., in
1703, entitled:

    "The Secret History of the Calves' Head Club, or, the Republican
    Unmasqu'd, wherein is fully shewn the Religion of the Calves-Head
    Heroes in their Anniversary Thanksgiving Songs on the Thirtieth of
    January, by their Anthems," &c. &c.

We are told in the latter part of the long title-page that the work was
published "to demonstrate the restless, inplacable spirit of a certain
party still among us," and certainly the statements therein, and more than
all the anthems at the end, do show the bitterest hatred--so bitter, so
intense and malignant, that we feel on reading it that there must be some
exaggeration.

The author professes to have at first been of opinion "that the story was
purely contrived on purpose to render the republicans more odious than they
deserv'd." Whether he was convinced to the contrary by ocular demonstration
he does not tell us, but gives us information he received from a
gentleman--

    "Who, about eight years ago, went out of meer curiosity to see their
    Club, and has since furnish'd me with the following papers. I was
    inform'd that it was kept in no fix'd house, but that they remov'd as
    they saw convenient; that the place they met in when he was with 'em
    was in a blind ally, about Morefields; that the company wholly
    consisted of Independents and Anabaptists (I am glad for the honour of
    the Presbyterians to set down this remark); that the famous Jerry
    White, formerly Chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, who no doubt on't came to
    sanctify with his pious exhortations the Ribbaldry of the Day, said
    Grace; that after the table-cloth was removed, the anniversary anthem,
    as they impiously called it, was sung, and a calve's skull fill'd with
    wine, or other liquor, and then a brimmer went about to the pious
    memory of those worthy patriots that kill'd the tyrant, and deliver'd
    their country from arbitrary sway; and lastly, a collection made for
    the mercenary scribler, to which every man contributed according to his
    zeal for the cause, or the ability of his purse.

    "I have taken care to set down what the gentleman told me as faithfully
    as my memory wou'd give me leave; and I am persuaded that some persons
    that frequent the Black Boy in Newgate Street, as they knew the author
    of the following lines so they knew this account of the Calves' Head
    Club to be true."

The anthems for the years 1693, 1694, 1695, 1696, and 1697, are given; but
they are too long and too stupidly blasphemous and indecent to quote here.
They seem rather the satires of malignant cavaliers than the serious
productions of any Puritan, however politically or theologically heretical.

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_The Calotype Process._--I have made any first essay in the calotype
process, following DR. DIAMOND'S directions given in "N. & Q.," and using
Turner's paper, as recommended by him. My success has been quite as great
as I could expect as a novice, and satisfies me that any defects are due to
my own want of skill, and not to any fault in the directions given. I wish,
however, to ask a question as to iodizing the paper. DR. DIAMOND says, lay
the paper on the solution; then _immediately_ remove it, and lay on the dry
side on blotting-paper, &c. Now I find, if I remove immediately, the whole
sheet of paper curls up into a roll, and is quite unmanageable. I want to
know, therefore, whether there is any objection to allowing the paper to
remain on the iodizing solution until it lies flat on it, so that on
removal it will not curl, and may be easily and conveniently laid on the
dry side to pass the glass rod over it. As soon as the paper is floated on
the solution (I speak of Turner's) it has a great tendency to curl, and
takes some time before the expansion of both surfaces becoming equal allows
it to lie quite flat on the liquid. May this operation be performed by the
glass rod, without floating at all?

Photographers, like myself, at a distance from practical instruction, are
so much obliged for plain and simple directions such as those given by DR.
DIAMOND, which are the result of experience, that I am sure he will not
mind being troubled with a few inquiries relative to them.

_Hockin's Short Sketch._--Mr. Hockin is so well known as a thoroughly
practical chemist, that it may suffice to call attention to the fact of his
having published a little brochure entitled _How to obtain Positive and
Negative Pictures on Collodionized Glass, and copy the latter upon Paper. A
Short Sketch adapted for the Tyro in Photography._ As the question of the
_alkalinity_ of the nitrate bath is one which has lately been discussed, we
will give, as a specimen of Mr. Hockin's book, a quotation, showing his
opinion upon that question:

    "_The sensitizing agent_, nitrate of silver in crystals, not the
    ordinary fused in sticks, is nearly always confessedly adulterated; it
    is thus employed:

    "_The silver or nitrate bath._--Nitrate of silver five drachms,
    distilled water ten ounces; dissolve and add iodized collodion two
    drachms.

    "Shake these well together, allow them to macerate twelve hours, and
    filter through paper. Before adding the nitric acid, test the liquid
    with a piece of blue litmus paper; if it remain blue after being
    immersed one minute, add one drop of dilute nitric acid[3], and test
    again for a minute; and so on, until a claret red is indicated on the
    paper. It is necessary to test the bath in a similar manner, frequently
    adding half a drop to a drop of dilute acid when required. This
    precaution will prevent the fogging due to alkalinity of the bath, so
    formidable an obstacle to young hands."

[Footnote 3: "Dilute nitric acid.--Water fifty parts, nitric acid one
part."]

_Photographic Society's Exhibition._--The Photographic Society opened their
first Exhibition of {17} Photographs and Daguerreotypes at the Gallery of
the Society of British Artists, in Suffolk Street, with a _soiree_ on
Tuesday evening last. Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, the
rooms were crowded not only by members of the Society, but by many of the
most distinguished literary and scientific men of the metropolis. The Queen
and Prince Albert had, in the course of the morning, spent three hours in
an examination of the collection; and the opinion they expressed, that the
exhibition was one of great interest and promise, from the evidence it
afforded of the extraordinary advance made by the art during the past year,
and the encouragement it held out to the belief that far greater excellence
might therefore still be looked for in it, was a very just one, and
embodied that given afterwards by the most competent authorities. We have
not room this week to enter into any details, but can confidently recommend
our readers to pay an early visit to Suffolk Street.

Replies to Minor Queries.

_"Firm was their faith," &c._ (Vol. viii., p. 564.).--These lines are to be
found in a poem called "Morwennae Statio, hodie Morwenstow," published by
Masters in 1846, with the title of _Echoes from Old Cornwall_, and written
by the Vicar of Morwenstow. I agree with D. M. in the judgment he has
announced as to their merits; but hitherto they have been but little
appreciated by the public. A time will come however, when these and other
compositions of the author will be better known and more duly valued by the
English mind.

SAXA.

These lines were written on "the Minster of Morwenna," May, 1840, and
appeared in the _British Magazine_ under the anonymous name _Procul_. Of
the eight stanzas of which the poem consists, P. M. has quoted the second.
The second line should be read "wise _of_ heart," and the third "_firm_ and
trusting hands." With your correspondent, I hope the author's name may be
discovered.

_Vellum-cleaning_ (Vol. viii., p.340.).--In the Polytechnic Institution

_Wooden Tombs_ (Vol. viii., p. 255.).--In the church at Brading, Isle of

    "There are some old tombs in the communion place, and in Sir William
    Oglander's chapel, or family burial-place, which is separated from the
    rest of the church by an oak screen. The most ancient legible date of
    these monuments is 1567. Two of them have full-length figures in armour
    of solid elm wood, originally painted in their proper colours, and
    gilt, but now disfigured by coats of dirty white."--Barber's

_Solar Eclipse in the Year 1263_ (Vol. viii., p. 441.).--In the
_Transactions of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland_, vol. ii. p. 350.,
there are "Observations on the Norwegian Expedition against Scotland in the
year 1263," by John Dillon, Esq.; and at pp. 363-4, when speaking of the
annular eclipse, he says:

    "The eclipse above mentioned is described to have occurred between
    these two dates [29th July and 9th August]. This being pointed out to
    Dr. Brewster, he had the curiosity to calculate the eclipse, when he
    found that there was an eclipse of the sun on 5th August, 1263, and
    which was annular at Ronaldsvo, in Orkney, and the middle of it was
    twenty-four minutes past one."

These "Observations" contain much curious information; but are deformed by
the author attempting to wrest the text of the Norwegian writer (at p. 358.
and in note I.) to suit an absurd crotchet of his own. Having seen that
essay in MS., I pointed out those errors; but instead of attending to my
observations, he would not read them, and got into a passion against the
friend who showed the MS. to me.

_Lines on Woman_ (Vol. viii., pp. 292. 350. &c.).--The lines on Woman are,
I presume, an altered version of those of Barret (Mrs. Barrett Browning?);
they are the finale of a short poem on Woman; the correct version is the
following:

 "Peruse the sacred volume, Him who died
  Her kiss betray'd not, nor her tongue denied;
  While even the Apostle left Him to His doom,
  She linger'd round His cross and watch'd His tomb."

I would copy the whole poem, but fear you would think it too long for
insertion.

    [Our correspondent furnishes an addition to our list of parallel
    passages. The lines quoted by W. V. and those now given by our present

    Besides, it has been already shown that the lines asked for are from
    the poem entitled _Woman_, by Eaton Stannard Barrett (see ante, pp.
    350. 423.).]

_Satin_ (Vol. vii., p. 551.).--In a note just received by me from Canton,
an American friend of mine remarks as follows:

    "When you write again to 'N. & Q.' you can say that the word _satin_
    (Vol. vii., p. 551.), like the article itself, is of Chinese origin,
    and that other foreign languages, in endeavouring like the English to
    imitate the Chinese _sz-tuen_, have {18} approximated closely to it,
    and to each other. Of this the answers to the Query given in the place
    referred to are a sufficient proof; Fr. _satin_, W. _sidan_, &c. &c."

I suspect that he is right, and that Ogilvie and Webster, whom you quote,
have not got to the bottom of the word. I may add that the notion of my
Canton friend receives approval from a Chinese scholar to whom I have shown
the above extract.

    ready wit and great facetiousness. He wrote two plays of considerable
    merit, _Les Reputations_ and _Le Seducteur_. He died at Spa, 1789, aged
    42. He is author of the distich on courtezans:

     'Quid facies, facies Veneris cum veneris ante?
      Ne sedeas! sed eas, ne pereas per eas.'"

_Sotades_ (Vol. viii., p. 520.).--Your correspondent CHARLES REED says that
Sotades was a Roman poet 250 B.C.; and that to him we owe the line, "Roma
tibi subito," &c. Sotades was a native of Maroneia in Thrace, or, according
to others, of Crete; and flourished at Alexandria B.C. 280 (Smith's
_Dictionary of Biography_, Clinton, F. H., vol. iii. p. 888.). We have a
few fragments of his poems, but none of them are palindromical. The
authority for his having written so, is, I suppose, Martial, Epig. II. 86.

_The Third Part of "Christabel"_ (Vol. viii., pp. 11. 111.).--Has the
_Irish Quarterly Review_ any other reason for ascribing this poem to Maginn
than the common belief which makes him the sole and original Morgan
Odoherty? If not, its evidence is of little value, as, exclusive of some
pieces under that name which have been avowed by other writers, many of the
Odoherty papers contain palpable internal evidence of having been written
by a Scotchman, or at least one very familiar with Scotland, which at that
time he was not; even the letter accompanying the third part of
_Christabel_ is dated from Glasgow, and though this would in itself prove
nothing, the circumstances above mentioned, as well as Dr. Moir's evidence
as to the time when Maginn's contributions to _Blackwood_ commenced, seems
strongly presumptive against his claim. Some of the earliest and most
distinguished writers in _Blackwood_ are still alive, and could, no doubt,
clear up this point at once, if so inclined.

_Attainment of Majority_ (Vol. viii., pp. 198. 250.).--In my last
communication upon this subject I produced undeniable authority to prove
that the law did not regard the fraction of a day; this, I think, A. E. B.
will admit. The question is, now, does the day on which a man attains his
majority commence at six o'clock A.M., or at midnight? We must remember
that we are dealing with a question of _English_ law; and therefore the
evidence of an English decision will, I submit, be stronger proof of the
latter mode of reckoning than the only positive proof with which A. E. B.
has defended Ben Jonson's use of the former, viz. _Roman_.

In a case tried in Michaelmas Term, 1704, Chief Justice Holt said:

    "It has been adjudged that if one be born the 1st of February at eleven
    at night, and the last of January in the twenty-first year of his age
    at one o'clock in the morning, he makes his will of lands and dies, it
    is a good will, for he was then of age."--_Salkeld_, 44.; _Raymond_,
    480, 1096; 1 _Siderfin_, 162.

In this case, therefore, the testator was accounted of age forty-six hours
before the completion of his twenty-first year. Now, the law not regarding
the fraction of a day, the above case, I submit, clearly proves that the
day, as regards the attainment of majority, began at midnight.

_Lord Halifax and Mrs. C. Barton_ (Vol. viii., pp. 429. 543.).--In answer
to J. W. J.'s Query, I beg to state that I have in my possession a codicil
of Mrs. Conduit's will in her own hand, dated 26th of January, 1737. This
document refers to some theological tracts by Sir Isaac Newton, in his
handwriting, which I have. On referring to the pedigree of the Barton
family, I find that Colonel Robert Barton married Catherine Greenwood,
whose father lived at Rotterdam, and was ancestor of Messrs. Greenwood,
army agents. His issue were Major Newton Barton, who married Elizabeth
Ekins, Mrs. Burr, and Catherine Robert Barton. I find no mention of Colonel
Noel Barton. The family of Ekins had been previously connected with that of
Barton, Alexander Ekins, Rector of Barton Segrave, having married Jane
Barton of Brigstock. The writer of this note will be obliged if J. W. J.,
or any correspondent of "N. & Q.," will inform him if anything is known
respecting an ivory bust of Sir Isaac Newton, executed by Marchand or
Marchant, which is said to have been an excellent likeness.

    British Museum.]

_The fifth Lord Byron_ (Vol. viii., p. 2.).--I cannot but think that MR.
HASLEDEN'S memory has deceived him as to the "wicked lord" having {19}
settled his estates upon the marriage of his son; how is this to be
reconciled with the often published statement, that the marriage of his son
with his cousin Juliana, daughter of the admiral, and aunt of the late and
present lords, was made not only without the consent, but in spite of the
opposition, of the old lord, and that he never forgave his son in
consequence?

_Burton Family_ (Vol. iv., pp. 22. 124.).--In connexion with a Query which
was kindly noticed by MR. ALGOR of Sheffield, who did not however
communicate anything new to me, I would ask who was Samuel Burton, Esq.,
formerly Sheriff of Derbyshire; whose death at Sevenoaks, in October, 1750,
I find recorded in the Obituary of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for that
year? I am also desirous to ascertain who was Sir Francis Cavendish Burton
of St. Helens, whose daughter and heiress, Martha, married Richard Sikes,
Esq., ancestor of the Sikes's of the Chauntry House near Newark. She died
since 1696. Both Samuel Burton and Mrs. Sikes were related to the Burtons
of Kilburn, in the parish of Horsley, near Derby, to whom my former Query
referred.

_Provost Hodgson's Translation of the Atys of Catullus_ (Vol. viii., p.
563.).--In answer to MR. GANTILLON'S inquiry for the above translation, I
beg to state that it will be found appended to an octavo edition of
Hodgson's poem of _Lady Jane Grey_.

In the same volume will be found, I believe (for I have not the work before
me), some of the modern Latin poetry respecting which BALLIOLENSIS
inquiries. The justly admired translation of _Edwin and Angelina_, to which
the latter refers, was by Hodgson's too early lost friend Lloyd. The
splendid pentameter is slightly misquoted by BALLIOLENSIS. It is not--

 "Poscimus in _terris_ pauca, nec illa diu."

but--

 "Poscimus in _vita_," &c.

_Wylcotes' Brass_ (Vol. viii., p. 494.).--I should hardly have supposed
that any difficulty could exist in explaining the inscription:

 "In . on . is . all."

To me it appears self-evident that it must be--

 "In one (God) is my all."

_Hoby, Family of; their Portraits, &c_. (Vol. viii., p. 244.).--I would
refer J. B. WHITBORNE to _The Antiquities of Berkshire_ (so miscalled), by
Elias Ashmole; where, in treating of Bisham, that learned antiquary has
given the inscriptions to the Hoby family as existing _and legible in his
time_. It does not appear that Sir Philip Hoby, or Hobbie, Knight, was ever
of the Privy Council; but, in 1539, one of the Gentlemen of the Privy
Chamber to King Henry VIII. (which monarch granted to him in 1546-7 the
manor of Willoughby in Edmonton, co. Middlesex), Sir Thomas Hoby, the
brother, and successor in the estates of Sir Philip, was, in 1566,
ambassador to France; and died at Paris July 13 in the same year (not
1596), aged thirty-six. The coat of the Hobys of Bisham, as correctly
given, is "Argent, within a border engrailed sable, three spindles,
threaded in fesse, gules." A grant or confirmation of this coat was made by
Sir Edward Bysshe, Clarenceux, to Peregrine Hoby of Bisham, Berks, natural
son of Sir Edward Hoby, Nov. 17, 1664. The Bisham family bore no crest nor
motto.

_The Keate Family_ (Vol. viii., pp. 293. 525.)--Should the Query of
G. B. B. not be sufficiently answered by the extract from Mr. Burke's
_Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies of England_ relating to the Keate family,
as I have a full pedigree of that surname, I may perhaps be able, on
application, to satisfy him with some genealogical particulars which are
not noticed in Mr. Burke's works.

_Huc's Travels_ (Vol. viii., p. 516.).--Not having seen the _Gardener's
Chronicle_, in which C. W. B. says the travels of Messrs. Huc and Gabet in
Thibet, Tartary, &c. are said to be a pure fabrication, concocted by some
Parisian _litterateur_, I cannot know what degree of credit, if any, is to
be given to such a statement. All I wish to communicate at present for the
information of your Querist C. W. B. is this, that I have read an account
and abstract of Messrs. Huc and Gabet's _Travels_ in one of the ablest and
best conducted French reviews, _La Revue des Deux Mondes_; in which not the
least suspicion of fabrication is hinted, or the slightest doubt expressed
as to the genuineness of these _Travels_. Mr. Princep, also, in his work on
Thibet, Tartary, &c. quotes largely from Huc's Travel's, and avails himself
extensively of the information contained in them with reference to
Buddhism, &c.

Should the writer in the _Gardener's Chronicle_ have it in his power to
_prove_ the _Travels_ to be a fabrication, he will confer a benefit on the
world of letters by unmasking the fabricator.

_Pictures at Hampton Court Palace_ (Vol. viii., p. 538.).--In reply to
[Phi].'s question when the review of the 10th Light Dragoons by King {20}
George III., after the Prince of Wales assumed the command of that
regiment, I beg to state that the Prince entered the army as
brevet-colonel, Nov. 19, 1782; that the regiment received the title of "The
Prince of Wales's own Regiment of Light Dragoons" on Michaelmas Day, 1783:
that the regiment was stationed in the south of England and in the vicinity
of London for many years, from 1790 to 1803 inclusive; and that King George
III. repeatedly reviewed it, accompanied by the queen and the royal family.
That the Prince of Wales was appointed Colonel-commandant of the corps in
1793, and succeeded Sir W. A. Pitt as colonel of it in July 18, 1796. That
the regiment was reviewed on Hounslow Heath by the King in August, 1799;
and the Prince of Wales (who commanded it in person) received his Majesty's
orders to convey his Majesty's approbation of its excellent appearance and
performance. Perhaps the picture by Sir William Beechey was painted in
1799, and not 1798. I did not find the catalogue at Hampton Court free from
errors, when I last visited the palace in October, 1852.

_John Waugh_ (Vol. viii., pp. 271. 400. 525.).--Does KARLEOLENSIS know
whether John Waugh, son of Waugh, Bishop of Carlisle, was married, and to
whom?

Farther information of the above family would be most acceptable, and
thankfully acknowledged, by George Waugh, of the family of the Waughs of
Oulton and Lofthouse, Yorkshire.

_Daughters taking their Mothers' Names_ (Vol. viii., p. 586.).--When
BURIENSIS asks for instances of this, and mentions "Alicia, daughter of
Ada," as an example, is he not mistaking, or following some one else who
has mistaken, the _gender_ of the parent's name? _Alicia fil. Adae_ would
be rendered "Alice Fitz-Adam," unless there be anything in the context to
determine the gender otherwise.

J. SANSOM.

"_Service is no Inheritance_" (Vol. viii., p. 586.).--This proverbial
saying has evidently arisen from the old manorial right, under which the
lord of the manor claimed suit and service and fealty before admitting the
heir to his inheritance, or the purchaser to his purchase. On which
occasion, the party admitted to the estate, whether purchaser or heir,
"fecit fidelitatem suam et solvit relevium;" the relief being generally a
year's rent or service.

_Sir Christopher Wren and the young Carver_ (Vol. viii., p. 340.).--If your
correspondent A. H. has not already appropriated the anecdote here alluded
to, I think I can confidently refer him to any biographical notice of
Grindling Gibbons--to whom the story of the "Sow and Pigs" relates. Gibbons
was recommended to Sir Christopher by Evelyn, I think; but not having "made
a note of it," I am not sure that it is to be found in his _Diary_.[4] If
there be any monograph Life of Gibbons, it can scarcely fail to be found
there.

_Queen Anne's Motto_ (Vol. viii., p. 174.).--The Historical Society of
Pennsylvania is in possession of an English coat of arms, painted on wood

_Semper eadem_ on the scroll below. It probably was in one of the
Philadelphia court-rooms, and was taken down at the Revolution.

_Lawyers' Bags_ (Vol. vii. _passim_).--The communication of MR. KERSLEY, in
p. 557., although it does not support the inference which COL. LANDMAN
draws, that the colour of lawyers' bags was changed in consequence of the
unpopularity which it acquired at the trial of Queen Caroline, seems to
show that _green_ was at one time the colour of those professional pouches.
The question still remains, when and on what occasion it was discontinued;
and when the purple, and when the crimson, were introduced?

When I entered the profession (about fifty years ago), no junior barrister
presumed to carry a bag in the Court of Chancery, unless one had been
presented to him by a king's counsel; who, when a junior was advancing in
practice, took an opportunity of complimenting him on his increase of
business, and giving him his own bag to carry home his papers. It was then
a distinction to carry a bag, and a proof that a junior was rising {21} in
his profession. I do not know whether the same custom prevailed in the
other courts.

CAUSIDICUS.

In this city (Philadelphia) lawyers formerly carried green bags. The custom
has declined of late years among the members of the legal profession, and
it has been taken up by journeymen boot and shoe makers, who thus carry
their work to and from the workshop. A green bag is now the badge of a
cordwainer in this city.

_Bust of Luther_ (Vol. viii., p. 335.).--MR. J. G. FITCH asks for
information respecting a bust of Luther, with an inscription, on the wall
of a house, in the Dom Platz at Frankfort on the Maine. I have learned,
through a German acquaintance, who has resided the greater part of his life
in that city, that the effigy was erected to commemorate the event of
Luther's having, during a short stay in Frankfort, preached near that spot;
and that the words surrounding the bust were his text on the occasion. He
adds that Luther at no period of his life "lived for some years" at
Frankfort, as stated by MR. FITCH.

_Grammar in relation to Logic_ (Vol. viii., pp. 514. 629.).--H. C. K.'s
remarks are of course indisputable. But it is a mistake to suppose that
they answer my Query. In fact, had your correspondent taken the trouble to
consider the meaning of my Query, he could not have failed to perceive that
the explanation I there gave of the function of the conjunction _in logic_,
is the same as his. My Query had sole reference _to grammar_. I would also
respectfully suggest that anonymous correspondents should not impute
"superficial views," or any other disagreeable thing, to those who stand
_confessed_, without abandoning the pseudonym.

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

Mr. Timbs announces for publication by subscription, _Curiosities of
London: exhibiting the most rare and remarkable Objects of Interest in the
Metropolis_. Mr. Timbs states, the authorities for his work have been
four-and-twenty years in collection; and that the utmost pains has been
taken to verify names, dates, and circumstances, so as to insure accuracy.
In this labour the author has been aided by the communications of many
obliging friends, as well as by his own recollection of nearly fifty years'
changes in the aspects of "opulent, enlarged, and still increasing London."

It is proposed to publish by subscription _The Visitation of the County of
Northumberland_, taken by Richard St. George, Esq., Norroy King of Arms,
and Henry St. George, Esq., Blue Mantle Pursuivant of Arms, A.D. 1615. To
be printed in tables on folio, with the arms engraved on wood, price One
Guinea; or large paper, royal folio, Two Guineas; or large paper with the
arms emblazoned (of which only the number subscribed for will be done),
Five Guineas. Subscribers' names will be received by Mr. John Gray Bell,
No. 17. Bedford Street, Covent Garden.

The first number of the _Antiquities of Shropshire_, by the Rev. R. W.
Eyton, has just been issued for the sake of determining the author's doubts
as to whether there is any general wish for such a publication. Should the
answer be in the negative, the author will neither forget his obligation to
present subscribers, nor the explanation which he will farther owe them if
the work be discontinued. The work will extend at least to five volumes, or
twenty parts, and, according to the present plan, will be completed in not
less than five years. Any subscriber will be at liberty to withdraw his
name, by giving notice to that effect within one month after the
publication of any fourth part, or completed volume. Three hundred copies
of Part I. have been printed, but the number of the future parts will be
limited to those subscribed for within the next three months.

_The Surrey Archaeological Society_ propose holding the Inaugural General
Meeting of the Society in Southwark early in the month of February, and to
exhibit upon the occasion a collection of such objects of antiquarian
interest relating to Surrey as may be contributed for that purpose. Parties
are invited to favour the Society with the loan of such objects.

BOOKS RECEIVED.--_A Peep at the Pixies, or Legends of the West_, by Mrs.

for its natural, simple, yet elevated tone.--_Essay on Human Happiness_, by
C. B. Adderley, M.P.; the first of a series of _Great Truths for Thoughtful
Hours_. A set of little books similar in object and design to Pickering's
well-known series of _Small Books on Great Subjects_.--_Beauties of Byron,
Verse and Prose._ This selection, made for Murray's _Railway Reading_, will
be acceptable to many who would object to place the collected edition of
the noble bard's writings in the hands of the younger members of their
family.--_Speeches on Parliamentary Reform_, by the Right Hon. T. B.
Macaulay. This new number of Longman's _Traveller's Library_ is well-timed,
and very acceptable.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
