PREFACE.


Some eighteen months ago I took this brilliant bunch of brain burrs to
my esteemed Publisher and with much enthusiasm invited him to spend a
lot of money thereon.

The Main Stem in the Works informed me that he had his fingers on the
public pulse and just as soon as that pulse began to jump and yell for
something from my fiery pen he would throw the _Silly Syclopedia_
at it.

Then he placed my MS. in the forward turret of his steel-armored safe,
gave me a fairly good cigar and began to look hard in the direction of
the elevator.

Last week, while searching for some missing government bonds, my
Publisher found my sadly neglected MS. He at once reached over and
grabbed the public pulse. To his astonishment it was jumping and making
signs in my direction.

In a frenzied effort to make up for lost time my publisher then yelled
feverishly for a printer.

Enclosed please find the result.

In the meantime, however, I figure that I have lost $41,894.03 in
royalties, $74 worth of glory and about 14 cents worth of fame--tough,
isn't it?

I think my Publisher should be censured for going out golfing and taking
his fingers off the public pulse.

Don't you?

A BAS. A French word meaning "S'cat!"

[Illustration]

A SHARP. A musical term which cannot be explained here, because the
Musical Union might get sore.

A FLAT. A people coop. Seven rooms and a landlord, with hot and cold gas
and running servants. A _flat_ is the poor relation of an apartment.

ABROAD. A place where people go to be cured of visiting foreign lands.

ABSCOND. To duck with the dough. From The Latin word _absconditto_,
meaning to grab the long-green and hike for the Bad Lands.

ABSINTHE. The national headache of the French. A jag-builder which is
mostly wormwood and bad dreams. A liquid substance which when applied to
a "holdover" revivifies it and enables its owner to sit up and notice
the bar-tender.

ABSTAIN. The stepladder which leads up to the water wagon.

ABSTEMIOUS. Having an aisle seat on the water wagon.

ACROBAT. A fellow of infinite chest.

ACCUMULATE. To collect or bring together. For example: "He borrowed two
dollars from his wife, whereupon he went out and _accumulated_ a
bunch of boozerine." (Carlyle's Heroes and Hero Worship.)

[Illustration]

A THING OF BEAUTY. A joy forever until we get used to it.

ALCOHOL. The forefather of a hold-over. Boozerine, in the raw state.
From the Latin words _alco_ and _haul_, meaning "he is soused
to the booby hatches, _haul_ him to the _alcove_." (See Lord
Macaulay's Jags of Ancient Rome.)

doing our duty.

AUTOMOBILE. A horseless idea which makes people go fast and the money go
faster. A tide in the affairs of man which, taken between the shoulder
blades and the curbstone, leads on to the hospital.

AXE-GRINDING. The art practiced by those who give you a cookie so they
can touch you for a barrel of flour. The axe-grinding industry had its
origin in the Garden of Eden. The Serpent was extremely partial to
Autumn, so he gave Eve a nice red apple, and in exchange she gave the
Serpent an early Fall. (See Lord Macaulay, page 34.)

[Illustration]

AIRSHIP. A machine invented for the purpose of flying through the
newspapers.

       *       *       *       *       *

See M. Santos Dumont. In case he isn't in when you call a part of his
autobiography is printed herewith: "My first yearning," writes M.
Santos--see page 97--"was for an opportunity to rise in the world.

"When but a little boy my dearest wish was to get up to the top of the
ladder and then have someone remove the ladder. If I stayed up I knew I
was successful. If I came down I didn't know anything for a week or
two."

The reader will notice a peculiarity about this gentleman's name. It
starts off with "M" and then there is eight bars rest until it comes to
Santos. This is a French custom. Every man in France begins his first
name with "M" and then refuses to tell the rest of it. It seems such a
stingy habit.

Let us quote more from M. Dumont's own story:

"My first desire to get off the earth happened while I was extremely
young.

"One day while out in the Brazilian diamond fields picking the luscious
white stones from the trees it suddenly occurred to me what a frivolous
life I was leading.

"Diamonds, diamonds everywhere and not a place to pawn.

"I became restless.

"My father owned the diamond plantation so I went to him and explained
what a tired feeling I had, and how I longed to rise in the world.

"Father at once turned about fifteen volts into his right shoe and I
rose for a distance of four feet.

"I returned almost immediately, but this short flying trip made a deep
impression upon my mind, and otherwise.

"Ten years later I left home just to convince my father that I could
rise in the world without his kindly collaboration.

"One day while in New York I went up to the fifty-ninth floor of a
sky-remover building.

"The elevator was extremely nervous that day.

"While coming down I was pained and surprised to observe that my stomach
did not travel with me.

"I spoke to the _charge d'affaires_ of the elevator about it.

"I complained bitterly to him about such an inhuman invention which
rushed through space with a man's exterior and left his interior to bump
its way downstairs.

"The _charge d'affaires_ of the elevator told me if I did not like
it to get out and fly.

"That was the inspiration which drove me to build the flying machine.

"Two weeks later I went to Paris, because that is the flyest city in the
world."

growler.

BUNDLE. A load of preserves. From the Norwegian _bun_, meaning high
tide. "Yesterday he annexed a _bundle_ and this morning he sits on

       *       *       *       *       *

The following letter written by the Czar to Tolstoi probably illustrates
better than any other document the pleasant and health-giving conditions
under which the Czar lives and reigns:--


                                                  In The Cellar, To-day.

Dear Tolsey:--My hands tremble a little in the armor-plated gloves, so
you must excuse bad spelling.

They have just handed me a small bunch of asbestos writing paper, and
the fountain pen has been sterilized to remove the poison, so I will
write you.

Great Scottovitch! you can never enjoy the feeling of anxiety which
gallops over me when I wake in the morning and wonder will the
hard-boiled eggs explode before I eat my breakfast.

At six o'clock this morning I was awakened by a scratching noise on the
iron quilt which covers my repose. A cold perspiration broke out on my
forehead. I buried my head in the hardwood pillows and waited the end.
Just then M. Stepupski, the Minister of the Department of Bum Shells,
walked in through the secret tunnel in the wall.

I threw the aluminum blanket off my face and cried: "What is it? What is
it?"

"Pardonoviski, Your Majesty," said M. Stepupski, "it is the cat! Whether
it is a trained cat carrying a deadly bombshell in the forward turret, I
don't know, but we will investigationiski at once."

My minister coaxed the cat away and five minutes later a loud explosion
confirmed M. Stepupski's theory that the cat's bosom contained something
more than nine lives.

It also confirmed M. Stepupski, because he has been strangely absent
ever since together with a stained-glass window and a lot of new
furniture.

Take my advice, Tolstoi, and don't be a royalty.

I say this as one friend to another and not because I have to wear
copper-fastened pajamas.

I don't mind the copper-fastened pajamas so much, but to wear asphalt
neckties and barb-wire suspenders is something which aggravates the
spirit.

At 8 A.M. this morning M. Cornmealski, the Minister of the Department of
Armored Breakfasts, reported that he had discovered something suspicious
in the dish of peeled prunes.

We examined the prunes carefully and found them stuffed with free
tickets to ride on the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad. We burned the tickets
hastily and saved our lives again.

M. Cornmealski reports that up to date 219 different breakfast foods
have been received at the palace kitchen. He says they range all the way
from consolidated shavings to perforated sawdust, with here and there
some compressed knot-holes.

In a mad moment yesterday I took the Yale lock off my appetite and
ordered up one of those breakfast food samples, but just as I had the
spoonful at my lips I remembered the prayer of my youth: "Woodman, spare
that tree!" and once more my life was saved.

Ten minutes ago M. Blackandblueski, the Minister of the Department of
Witch Hazel, rushed into my bulkhead compartment.

"Oxcooski, Your Majesty," said the Minister, "but this morning the
cookski was burning a few links of sausage for breakfast. Well, Your
Majesty, about two minutes afterwards the cookski and the stove and one
side of the palace left in a hurry and went away in a northwesterly
direction. We don't expect them back, because the sausage was stuffed
with rapid transit material, Your Majesty!"

Thus it goes all day. Don't you think it is pretty hard lines when I
have to make them wash the water on both sides before putting it in the
teapot?

Now I must stop because I hear the humming of the harpoons on the
outside. My officers are talking about me again. Farewellski!

CUSTOMS INSPECTOR. An individual who gets a salary for believing that
everybody on the steamboat is a smuggler.

       *       *       *       *       *

In order to study briefly the Custom House system as applied to
returning travellers let us witness the arrival from abroad of the
Secretary of the Treasury.

Some years before the Secretary went into politics deep enough to stay
there and make expenses he took a slight trip to Europe.

Two weeks later he was on his way home to his beloved land on the good
ship "Kaiser Wilhelm, the Grocer."

The Stars and Stripes seemed to wave a welcome to him as he approached
the hospitable shores of Fire Island.

"It is good, so good to breathe once more the air of Liberty!" said the
Secretary, and ten minutes later the "Kaiser Wilhelm, the Grocer" was at
her dock.

"Ah! how happy I am to be once more where Freedom reigns!" said the
Secretary as he walked proudly down the gangway plank.

"Wait!"

The speaker was a short-set man with a thick face and a wide voice.

The Secretary paled his cheeks.

"Who are you?"

"I am an American citizen; leave me pass!" exclaimed the Secretary.

"So am I," said the man with a thick face; "and nothing passes me. You
have been to Europe, have you not?"

"Do you think I used the 'Kaiser Wilhelm the Grocer' to come from Staten
Island?" asked the Secretary.

The man laughed, loosely.

"Swear!" he said.

"At you?" inquired the Secretary.

"Swear you are not a smuggler," said the roan.

"I ought to kick you for such an insult," said the Secretary.

"Business before pleasure," said the man; "swear that you are not a
robber."

"I swear," said the Secretary; "inwardly, outwardly, earnestly and
pictorially, I swear!"

"By the memory of George Washington you swear that you are not a
smugglesome man?"

"I do," said the Secretary.

"Hold up both hands and swear!"

The Secretary did so.

"With both hands behind your back and your eyes fixed on the Declaration
of Independence sign this sworn statement," said the man.

The Secretary did so.

"Now that you have sworn I will go through your trunks to see if you are
a liar!" said the man.

"Surely, you should receive one of my best kicks," said the Secretary.

"Formality first, fun later," said the man, upsetting the largest trunk.

"Aha! what is this?"

"It is a pair of open-work socks," said the Secretary.

"Opened in Europe--yes? Bad business! bad business! I begin to suspect
you. What is this?"

"That is a pipe which I bought in Baden-Baden," said the Secretary. "I
am taking it to my cousin in Springfield, Mass., for a souvenir."

"I will help your cousin to stop smoking," said the man, putting the
pipe in his pocket. "Aha! what is this?"

The Secretary blushed his face.

"What is this?"

"That is my pair of pajamas!" said the Secretary.

"Pajamas?"

"Put them back, please?" said the Secretary. "A man's pajamas are not
for the vulgar gaze of the world!"

"Pajamas!" said the man.

"My pajamas!" said the Secretary.

"They look like a Chinaman's Sunday trousers--yes?"

The Secretary looked into the pitiless faces of the multitude which was
gazing into his trunk, but they handed him nothing save small bunches of
laughter.

"Come!" said the man, "where is the Chink that goes with this wearing
apparel? Did you hear over the wireless system about the labor strikes
and try to smuggle in some cheap labor?"

"I assure you that I wear those pajamas myself!" said the Secretary,
interrupting a sob in his throat.

"You wear these pajamas? When? Why? Where?"

"In the secrecy of my boudoir," said the Secretary.

"Aha!" said the man, "so you have some boudoir, too! Bad business! bad
business! I have never heard of a Boudoir Trust, therefore, we do not
make such a thing in this country. My suspicions are getting louder.
What is in this bottle?"

"That is my cough medicine," said the Secretary, giving a sample of the
cough.

"It may be wine or cream de mint because your voice sounds nervous."

"I am nervous because the world is still giggling at my pajamas," said
the Secretary.

"Back to the pajamas! Bad business! bad business! I will have to dig a
tunnel through your neckties to see if you have a _cafe au lait_ or
a _cafe chanteuse_ in the trunk. When a man gets nervous it is
always wise to watch him. Open your mouth!"

The Secretary did so.

"What have you been drinking?"

"A vermouth cocktail," said the Secretary.

"Domestic or imported?"

"Neither; the Captain treated," said the Secretary.

"It looks to me much like foreign spirits," said the man.

"Do you wish to open me further and see?" inquired the Secretary.

Then the man waded into the Secretary's other trunks, two-stepped over
his negligee shirts, waltzed through his waist-coats and did a polka
amidst the ruins of his dress suit.

"What is the verdict?" said the Secretary after the battle was over.

"Not guilty, but you might be," said the man, smiling briefly.

As the Secretary walked out the Stars and Stripes seemed to bow politely
at him and whisper with a voice slightly sarcastic: "You for the seat
away back!"

"Some day," said the Secretary, "I will jump into politics so far that
my trunk will always be a dark secret to the Custom Housers!"

And he did it.

From the life of the Secretary we learn the lesson that there is much
Liberty in this country, but, incidentally, there are a couple of bald
spots where it is missing.

If you don't believe me come home from Europe some day by way of the
Custom House.

Do you know that a wise man can sometimes be a fool and get away with it?

Don't go among doers if you don't want to be did.

Duty calls and finds most men holding nothing but a four-flush.

Don't try to be a stinger if you don't want to get stung.

GRAND OPERA. A disease which breaks out in society every winter and can

       *       *       *       *       *

Bjingle Bjangle, the celebrated Norwegian _raconteur_, thus
describes in his book of travels a visit to the grand opera in New York,
as follows:--

I went to the opera last night and enjoyed it unspeakably.

I noticed that most of the ladies in the boxes enjoyed it also, but not
unspeakably.

The ladies, Heaven bless them! seemed to be suffering from that operatic
disease which is called nervous conversation.

This is a disease which attacks the vocal chords just as soon as the
curtain rises and causes the voice to fall out.

I also enjoyed the names of the singers.

Some of the names on the programme looked like a round robin sent out by
a Turnverein bowling club, but I suppose if they were baked in the oven
until translated they would mean something soft and soothing like a
custard pudding.

Why is it that foreign singers and singerettes always have a name which
listens like a cuckoo clock with a sore throat.

Perhaps if we knew how to unlock them these names would mean just plain
Schmidt or Jones.

There was one singer on the programme that had the most extravagant name
I ever witnessed.

If you read it off quick it sounded like the finish of the six-day
bicycle race at the Madison Square Garden.

Then if you looked at it sideways it seemed to be the report of a
skirmish between the Russians and the Japs.

I think that fellow just waded into the alphabet with a dip net and all
the letters he caught he kept.

I liked the plot of the Opera.

[Illustration]

She was a blonde lady with one of those _embonpoint_ faces which
must cost a good deal to keep in repair.

The hero was a young gentleman with a sweet expression and a forehead
which had moved into his hair when it was very young.

I don't know which was the villain, but I have my suspicions that it was
the usher who gave me a seat.

I was interpolated in between a fat man who spoke with an onion accent
and a narrow-headed man who whistled softly to himself all the evening
without taking 32 bars rest.

My enjoyment under these circumstances was delicious.

The story of the Opera was simple.

A lot of young ladies all ready to go in bathing changed their minds and
came out on the stage.

Then a tall gentleman came out and warbled at them and the young ladies
went away.

Perhaps he belonged to the crusaders on vice.

Then the lady that drew the largest salary came out and made goo-goo
eyes at the tall gentleman.

He was so embarrassed that he walked right down to the footlights and
took a couple of high notes.

She took the same.

Then four people came out on the stage and yelled together with so much
earnestness that the women in the boxes had an attack of nervous
exclamation, and the way they talked about whoever was not present was
pitiful.

When you would least expect it the hero jumped on the stage and made
some quick motions with his face and arms which resulted in a solo.

The story he told was simplicity itself.

Plainer than words could make it his beautifully imported voice kept
saying "Aha! aha-eo! I-am-getting-one-thousand-dollars-a-night--tra-la-la-
la!-aha!-aha-eo! For-doing-this,--for-doing-this-with-the-pipes-I-get-one-
thousand-plunks-oh-plunks-per-night-aha!-aha-eo!"

Then the soprano responded with much emotion from the orchestra, "Ditto,
ditto, ditto! me too, me too! oo-oo-me too!"

It was delicious.

But just then came the bitter moment when all my deliciousness was
crushed because the narrow-headed man on my left switched softly into
"Hiawatha" with a few personal additions to the coda.

So I stood up and went home.

INDIAN COMMISSIONER. The gentleman who invented the idea of opening up

not.

       *       *       *       *       *

The idea of Marconi's wireless telegraph system pales into
insignificance before the idea of coaxing a wild Indian away from the
reservation and running the remorseless horse-clippers over the wild
foliage to which his head has been acclimated these many years.

This is a noble suggestion, and no doubt the Indians will take kindly to
the barbers and pay them much attention even if their tommyhawks and
scalping knives are a little dull at first.

In the dramatic language of the plains Biff Hawkins, of Spotted Dog,
Idaho, thus describes the opening of the first barber shop in the
vicinity of an Indian reservation:

"Hist!"

The speaker was the bootblack in one of those handsome hand-painted
barber shops which a loving government at Washington has placed at
intervals along the border of the Indian Reservation.

"What is it, Mike?" said Sniffles, the barber.

"Hist!"

Again that ominous word, and Mike pointed feverishly at the distant
horizon.

On it an Indian was walking, steadfastly, onward, onward, onward!

Remorseless as a gas bill the Indian came onward to the barber shop.

Sniffles, the barber, jumped quickly into his armor-plated working
clothes, and Mike, with a sad smile of farewell, crawled into the
cyclone cellar and closed the steel doors.

The Indian entered the barber shop.

"You are next!" said Sniffles, politely.

"I know it," said the Indian; "but I was put next only an hour
ago--hence the delay. The bay rum, please!"

"You want it for the hair?" inquired the barber.

"No, I want it for a souse," said the Indian.

"Get in the chair, please!" said the barber.

"Man-Behind-The-Snip-Snap speaks foolish," said the Indian. "I am not
for a hair cut; I am for that bay rum idea. Heap thirst! Don't keep me
waiting!"

The barber turned pale as the awful truth flashed across him.

"What is your name?" he said painfully.

"Man-Afraid-Of-A-Shampoo," said the Indian, sullenly.

"Nice Indian! pretty Indian! good Indian! You are not compelled to get
your hair cut, you know!" said the barber, wishing to avoid bloodshed.

"Paleface give me heap pain," said Man-Afraid-Of-A-Shampoo, fiercely.

Sniffles, the barber, trembled and believed him.

"Ugh!" said the Indian.

"Ugh!" has the same meaning in Indian as the word "Oof!" has in English.

"When I came in paleface said I was next," said Man-Afraid-Of-A-Shampoo.
"Well, I am next to this business. You have bay rum and I have a
thirst--let us get together!"

"But the bay rum is used only on the outside of the head," said the
barber.

"I have original ideas about bay rum," said the Indian, "therefore I
have decided to use it on the inside of my neck!"

"But bay rum is five cents extra with a hair cut," whispered the barber.

It was his last whisper in that shop.

Shouting the battle cry of the Cherokees, the Indian, grabbed the bay
rum bottle and poured it carefully over his thirst.

[Illustration]

This was followed by a bottle of hair tonic, which seemed to go to his
head.

Then the Indian swallowed a bottle of whisker dye and all seemed to grow
black before him.

The barber groaned in agony.

It was thrilling.

When last seen the Indian was drinking a bottle of dry shampoo and
foaming at the mouth, while he blessed the White Father at Washington
for inventing the barber shop.

That afternoon Sniffles, the barber, and Mike, his under secretary,
walked back to Washington and handed in their resignation to the
Interior Department.

SARDINE-CAR. A term of endearment given to crowded street cars.

       *       *       *       *       *

Marcus Aurelius thus describes the sardine-car in his "Meditations"--see
page 946--as follows:

The sardine-cars consist of fifty people trying to squeeze into a space
that was built only for a Pajama hat and two newspapers.

The seats in the sardine-cars run sideways; the passengers run edgeways,
and the life insurance agents run any old way when they see these cars
coming.

[Illustration]

The sardine-car is the best genteel imitation of a rough-house that has
ever been invented.

The are called "Sardine Cars" because the conductor has to let the
passengers out with a can-opener.

Brave and strong men climb into a street car and they are full of health
and life and vigor, but a few blocks up the road they fall out backwards
and inquire feebly for a sanitarium.

To ride on the street cars in a big city of an evening brings out all
that is in a man, including a lot of loud words he didn't know he had.

The last census shows us that the street cars in the city of New York
have more ways of producing nervous prostration and palpitation of the
brain to the square inch than the combined population of Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, Tinkersdam and Gotterdammerung.

To get in some of the street cars about six o'clock is a problem, and to
get out again is an assassination.

One evening I rode from Forty-second Street to Fifty-ninth without once
touching the floor with my feet.

Part of the time I used the outposts of a stout gentleman to come
between me and the ground, and during the rest of the occasion I hung on
to a strap and swung out wild and free, like the Japanese flag on a
windy day.

Some of our street cars lead a double life, because they are used all
winter to act the part of a refrigerator.

It is a cold day when we cannot find it colder in the street cars.

In Germany we find Germans in the cars, but in America we find germs.

That is because this country is young and impulsive.

The germs in the street cars are extremely sociable and will often
follow a stranger all the way home.

Often while riding in the street cars I have felt a germ rubbing against
my ankle like a kitten, but being a gentleman, I did not reach down and
kick it away because the law says we must not be disrespectful to the
dumb brutes of the field.

Many of our street cars are made out of the same idea as a can of
condensed milk.

The only difference is that the street cars have a sour taste like a
lemon squeezer.

When you get out you cannot get in and when you get in you cannot get
out because you hate to disturb the strange gentleman that is using your
knee to lean over.

[Illustration]

Between the seats there is a space of two feet, but in that space you
will always find four feet and their owners, unless one of them happens
to have a wooden leg. Under ordinary circumstances four into two won't
go, but the sardine-cars defy the laws of gravitation.

A sardine-car conductor can put twenty-six into nine and still have four
to carry.

The idea of expansion which is now used by our Congress was suggested by
one of these sardine-cars.

The ladies of America have started a rebellion against the sardine-cars,
but every time they start it the conductor pulls the bell and leaves the
rebellious standing on the corner.

We are a very nervous and careless people in America. To prove how
careless we are I will cite the fact that Manhattan Island is called
after a cocktail.

This nervousness is our undoing because we are always in such a hurry to
get somewhere that we would rather take the first car and get squeezed
into breathlessness than wait for the next which would likely squeeze us
into insensibility.

Breathlessness can be cured, but insensibility is dangerous without an
alarm clock.

For a man with a small dining-room the sardine-car has its advantages,
but when a stout man rides in them he finds himself supporting a lot of
strangers he never met before.

One morning I jumped on one of those sardine-cars feeling just like a
two-year-old, full of health and happiness.

During the first seven blocks three men fresh from a distillery grew up
in front of me and removed the scenery.

One of them had to get out in a hurry so he kicked me on the shins to
show how sorry he was to leave me.

One of the other two must have been in the distillery a long time
because pretty soon he neglected to use his memory and sat down in my
lap.

When I remonstrated with him he replied that this is a free country and
if he wished to sit down I had no business to stop him.

Then his friend pulled us apart and I resumed the use of my lap.

During the next twenty blocks I had one of the worst daylight nightmares
I ever rode behind.

The party which had been studying the exhibits in the distillery got the
idea in his head that my foot was the loud pedal on a piano and he
started to play the overture from _William Tell_ until I yelled
"W'at'ell!"

That man was such a hard drinker that he gave me the gout just from
standing on my feet.

Then I jumped off and swore off and swore at and walked home.

If the man who invented the idea of standing up between the seats in a
sardine-car is alive he should have a monument.

My idea would be to catch him alive and place the monument on him and
have the conductor come around every ten minutes for his fare.

Then the punishment would have a fit like the crime.

AUTOMOBILES.

A Few Rules of the Road Which, It Is Hoped, Will Speedily Be Adopted By
All Automobile Societies.


The automobile is the rich man's liquor and the poor man's chaser.

It keeps our streets full of red, white and blue streaks all the
livelong day, and if the weary pedestrian is not supplied with a
ball-bearing neck his chance of getting home is null and void.

Probably the safest part about the machinery of an automobile is the
_Chauffeur_, because he knows which way to jump out.

_Chauffeur_ is the name of the man who points the machine at you
and dares you to get out of the way.

We have no word in the English language brave enough to ride on a
horseless wagon when it goes real fast.

That is why we had to reach over to Paris and pull a word out of the
French.

_Chauffeur_ was the first word we grabbed, and I think we should
give it back at the first opportunity.

The first Careless Cart we had in this country was called the "Coroner's
Delight," because it lived up to its name.

Consequently it became necessary that a set of road rules should be
composed which would help the general public to die easier when
automobo-annihilated.

Here are the rules:


1.--One sharp toot from the horn on a Happy Hansom means that business
men, messenger boys and other persons in a hurry must postpone
indefinitely their contemplated journey across the street. Crossing the
street in front of a chauffeur who has given the above signal is very
bad form, and is generally productive of spinal meningitis and doctor's
bills.

2.--Two sharp toots from the horn on a Vaseline Brougham is a signal to
the truck drivers ahead that they must dismount at once, bow politely,
and say "Gesundheit!" to the chauffeur as he passes. Truck drivers who
refuse to obey this signal should be run into and injured severely.

3.--Three sharp toots from the horn on a Benzine Buggy is a signal to
the policeman on the corner, who must immediately come to parade rest,
doff his helmet and comment enthusiastically on the grace and general
elegance of the chauffeur until the latter has disappeared in the
distance. Policemen who fail to follow this rule should be arrested,
tried, convicted and sent to Siberia.

4.--Four sharp toots from the horn on a Gasolene Barouche is a signal
for the Fire Department to assemble immediately and remove all trees,
statues and things of that sort, so that the chauffeur may take a short
cut through any of the parks. Failure on the part of the firemen to
obey this rule will justify the chauffeur in delaying an engine on its
way to a fire by stopping in front of it long enough to get run over.

5.--Five sharp toots from the horn of a Whiz Wagon is a signal to
all drivers of brewery wagons, ice wagons and mowing machines in the
vicinage that they must descend at once from their various pedestals
and lead their juggernautian caravans into the dry goods stores out of
harm's way. If there are no dry good stores handy, a candy shop will
do. No driver of a brewery wagon, ice wagon or mowing machine will be
excused for breaking this rule simply because he doesn't know the
meaning of vicinage.

6.--Six sharp toots from the horn of a Gas Carryall is a signal to
conductors and motormen that they must, without any unnecessary delay,
lift their cars from the rails and place them on the sidewalk. If the
passengers in the cars so signalled offer any objections, the policemen
on that beat will take the offenders to the nearest automobile garage
and compel them to drink gasoline.

7.--One long and one short toot means that everybody in the neighborhood
not in a Bubble must start promptly for the woods. Failure to observe
this rule will justify any chauffeur in chasing the offender seventy-six
consecutive miles in a southwesterly direction.

8.--Long and continued applause from the horn on any Rowdy Runabout
means that the chauffeur has lost the combination on his brain cells,
and is suffering severely from stage fright, superinduced by the sudden
appearance of a coal cart directly in his pathway. In a predicament of
this kind strict guiding rules cannot be laid down, but no blame can
attach to the automobilist if he climbs over the tailboard of the
vehicle and adds a new series of phrenological bumps to the suburban
part of the head of the offending coal cart director.

9.--If the foregoing rules are carefully observed there is no occasion
for further instructions, and automobubbling will become a thing of
pleasure and a joy forever.

INSOMNIA.

How to Effect a Permanent and Lasting Cure.


1.--Lie perfectly still and count 287,643 in a slow, methodical manner.
By the time you have finished counting it will be daylight, and you will
be surprised to notice how quickly the night has passed.

2.--Always partake of a bountiful repast before retiring, giving special
attention to a lobster salad, welsh rarebit and hard-boiled eggs. This
will, no doubt, give you delirium tremens, night-mare, St. Vitus' dance
and indigestion, but the pleasing thought will remain that you have kept
the rest of the household awake as well as yourself.

3.--Always undress in the dark. When you have broken three chairs, upset
the centre table and stepped on six assorted tacks, you will realize
what a stupid habit sleeping is anyway, and your senses will have become
so acute that you will want to sit up and read the Family Story Paper
during that portion of the night which has not been devoted to swearing.

4.--Always lie with your head lower than any other point of your body
and throw the pillows away. The monotony of a sleepless night will then
be relieved by the novelty of having apoplexy or heart failure, either
of which diseases is much more exciting and dangerous than insomnia.

5.--Always concentrate your thoughts and endeavor to breathe
pronouncedly and with exaggeration, like a freight engine climbing a
grade. This is calculated to frighten the rest of the family into
convulsions and stampede all the cattle in the neighborhood, but you
will be enabled to while the remaining hours of the night away by
listening to the terse remarks hurled at you from time to time by the
other members of the household.

6.--Always sponge your face with boiling water several times before
retiring. If you keep this up long enough it will be breakfast time, and
you may then go about your daily labor with the happy consciousness that
you have saved the bed clothes a great deal of wear and tear.

7.--Always take a brisk, long walk before retiring, taking particular
care to come home late and allow the watch dog to mistake you for a
tramp and chase you hurriedly into the next country side. It is also
calculated to withdraw the blood from the brain and put wings on your
feet. A brisk run of sixteen miles across country as the crow flies with
an angry bulldog pushing you pretty hard for first place, is a pleasant
diversion in a sleepless night.

8.--Be phlegmatic and indifferent in a marked degree. If you hear
thieves in the chicken coop during the night, don't move a muscle; if
you smell smoke and know the house is on fire, lie perfectly still and
count imaginary sheep jumping over an imaginary fence; if you feel the
folding bed closing up let it close and go on with your counting; if you
know that burglars are in the room pay no attention to them and let them
burgle--you have business of your own to attend to. A man with a
thoroughly developed case of insomnia has no time for such trifling
details.




WISDOM IS AS WISDOM DOES.


All is not cold that shivers.

Success never shakes hands with a lazy man.

divorce court.

The most successful politician is the one who knows how to finance his
brains.

Before marriage a woman is an angel; after marriage she is still an
angel, but her husband is now from Missouri, and she has to show him.

If it were impossible to speak anything but truth in this world how many
times a day would we be insulted.




WHIST.

Being a Few Hints How to Play the Game.


Whist is a well known game with cards. It requires close attention and
silence. Some people learn to play whist in fifteen minutes, but their
partners generally wear a worried look. There are other people who never
learn to play the game, but, unfortunately for humanity, they never
fully realize this fact. Their partners soon discover it, however, but
politeness forbids them making the discovery known to the wide, wide
world.

The following series of "Don'ts" may help you to understand some of the
intricacies of the delightful game of whist. If they do not help you the
only thing to do is to try pinochle:--

Don't get up and dance a serpentine dance every time you take a trick.
It is in very bad taste, unless you are a good dancer, and even then
your opponents may feel deeply chagrined.

Don't smile sweetly your partner and inform him in a few well-chosen
words that you have seven trumps in your hand. Your opponents may hear
you, and scowl darkly at you.

Don't fail to call the attention of your opponent to the fact that he or
she hasn't followed suit, being very careful to select a loud and
resonant tone of voice for the occasion. This compels your opponent to
look carefully through his or her cards and fervently wish that you had
sense enough to mind your own business.

Don't ask what's trumps more than eighteen times during one hand. The
limit used to be twenty-six times, but the best authorities on whist now
say eighteen.

Don't have a conniption fit every time you lose a trick. Conniption fits
are very bad form, and they delay the game.

Don't get excited and climb up on the table when the game is close. It
shows a want of refinement and breeding to climb up on the table,
especially if you are in a strange house.

Don't whistle softly while waiting for somebody to play. Whistling is
not in good taste. Go and perform on the piano. It has a much better
effect, particularly if your selection is something lively, like "El
Capitan" or "The Maiden's Prayer."

Don't talk politics while playing whist. Either whist or politics will
suffer if you do. Statisticians claim that 34,647,932 times out of
34,647,933 it is whist that suffers.

Don't, when drawing a trick towards you, pause in the act to smile
disdainfully upon your opponents. They may not admire a spectacular
arrangement of your features, and if they happen to be in a bad humor
your facial expression may be ruined for life.

Don't labor under the erroneous impression that your opponents have no
right to trump your ace if they can. Neither is it considered elegant or
refined to hit them carelessly across the forehead with the bric-a-brac
for so doing.

Don't make an earnest endeavor to split the table asunder when playing a
winning card. People may think you are eccentric if you try to make
kindling wood of the table every time you lay down an honor.

Don't lead the three of clubs in mistake for the ace of trumps, and then
get mad and jump seventeen feet in the air because you are not permitted
to pull it back. It isn't good form to jump seventeen feet in the air.
Besides, you might fall and hurt yourself and the neighborhood.

Don't hesitate to inquire what was led when there is but one card on the
table. It shows that you are taking a deep interest in the game, and it
makes the other players admire your elocutionary powers.

Don't fail to dispute the count after every hand has been played. It
draws attention to the fact that you are anxious to win. It also draws
uncomplimentary remarks from your opponents and sometimes occasions the
use of a club.

Don't fall off the chair in horrified dismay when your opponent puts
your ace to sleep with a little trump. Trumps were invented for that
purpose, and horrified dismay is not becoming to every style of beauty.




A FEW HARMLESS GERMS.


How the rest of the world does hate the people who have a good time.

A Miss is as good as a mile of Misses--if you love the girl.

The horseshoe is always lucky--when the horse wins.

A hard worker will never be arrested for killing time.

One half the world doesn't know why the other half doesn't get off the
earth.

Be good and you'll be happy, but you won't get your name in the papers
so often.




BASEBALL.

Being a Guide for the Grouchy Grandstandee.


These "do nots" have been arranged, compiled and hammered together with
a view to rendering assistance to the spectator whose thinking machinery
climbs out over his collar, and who shows symptoms of being dazed and
disorderly during the progress of a game.

Don't have any regard for the feelings of your neighbors. Get up on the
slightest provocation and yell. To make matters more exciting you had
better get up on the back of the seat also.

Don't stop to make a careful selection of the English language before
addressing the universe at large when the play is not to your liking.
Say the first thing that comes into your mind. Doubtless, it will be
glad to get out.

Don't pay any attention to the fact that ladies are in the immediate
neighborhood. Your money is just as good as theirs. Besides, it's a
man's privilege to swear and make a howling idiot of himself.

Don't fail to keep up a running comment on the general inefficiency of
the visiting club. The majority of those who sit near you came out to
the game especially to hear your views on this subject.

Don't neglect to call him a fat-headed renegade every time one of the
home players makes an error. The home players need to be reproved at
times, and nothing is quite so reproving as the term fat-headed renegade
hurled at them by a bibulous gentleman with a subterbeerean voice.

Don't hesitate to tell all who are listening--and, if your voice is
as convalescent as usual, everybody in your section of the Western
Hemisphere will have to listen--that you know more about the game than
Pop Anson and Pop Anson's younger brother, Methuselah. Under certain
circumstances modesty is a crime; therefore, you should not commit a
crime by withholding this information.

Don't forget the umpire. Don't forget him for one little moment. He will
notice it if you do, and become miserably unhappy. Tell him what you
think of him unceasingly. There is nothing so pleasing to an umpire's
ears as the sweet strains of a whiskey-trimmed voice ringing softly on
the evening air: "Hey, red-light, youse is a robber an' a thief!"
Umpires love to be criticised in this manner. With every criticism they
brace up wonderfully, and their straying sense of justice returns.
You've noticed this fact, of course.

Don't hesitate to insult a player on the field. Remember, it is very
hard for him to pick you out of the crowd. Besides, if he does, and
jumps over the rail for the purpose of putting his imprint on your
slats, you can scream for help. The police will probably wake up and
come to your assistance.

Don't forget to use the most blood-curdling and decorative style of
language now on the market when you engage in the pleasing duty of
hurting a player's feelings. This will attract attention to you from all
quarters, and will stamp you as a gentleman of the aber-nit style of
architecture.

Don't pay any attention to the uneasiness displayed by those about you
who came out for the selfish purpose of enjoying the game. If they
cannot enjoy you and your lung-power exhibit, they should stay at home.
Keep right on utilizing your vocal chords. Chatter on incessantly. Be a
consistent ass until the last man is out and the umpire crawls into his
cyclone cellar. Then go home and bathe what's left of your voice in
witch hazel, and get ready for the morrow.




BURSTS OF CONFIDENCE.


A trouble-hunter always makes a success of his job.

The girl who hesitates is left at the hitching post.

The world has a poor memory for many who believe themselves famous.

The wise man saves up for a rainy day, and always stays in the house
when it storms.

It keeps many a good man down to keep up appearances.

Some men are like a phonograph--they talk when you start them, but they
have no originality.




THE POOR MAN'S COOK BOOK.

(Presented by the President of the Food Trust.)


This Cook Book was invented by the President of the Food Trust with the
hope that the poor man will find therein much to comfort him since meat
and other luxuries have gone out of his life, because the Trust needs
the money.

The beauty about the dishes mentioned here is their cheapness. Let us
begin with the soup:


MOCK CHICKEN SOUP.--Take a piece of white paper and a lead pencil and
draw from memory the outlines of a hen. Then carefully remove the
feathers. Pour one gallon of boiling water into a saucepan and sprinkle
a pinch of salt on the hen's tail. Now let it simper. If the soup has a
blonde appearance stir it with a lead pencil which will make it more of
a brunette. Let it boil two hours. Then coax the hen away from the
saucepan and serve the soup hot, with a glass of ice-water on the side.

BEEF TEA.--Take the white of an egg and beat it without mercy. When it
is insensible put it in the teapot and add enough boiling water to drown
it. Let it drown about twenty minutes. Then lead the yolk of the egg
over to the teapot and push it in. Season with a small pinch of tobasco
and let it simper. Serve hot and always be sure to put a piece of lemon
in the finger bowl.

MOCK BEEFSTEAK.--Carefully remove the laces from one shoe and put them
away, because they can be used for shoe-string potatoes just as soon
as the Potato Trust gets started. Beat the shoe with a hammer for ten
minutes until its tongue stops wagging and it gets black and blue in the
face. Then put it in the frying pan and stir gently. When it begins to
sizzle add the yolk of an egg and season with parsley. Imitation parsley
can be made from green wall paper with the scissors. If there is no
green wall paper in the house speak to the landlord about it. Let it
simper. In two hours try it with a fork. If it breaks the fork it is not
done. Let it simper. Should you wish to smother it with onions, now is
your chance, because after cooking so long it is almost helpless. Serve
hot with a hatchet on the side. If there are more than four people in
the family use both shoes.

IRISH STEW.--Remove the jacket and waistcoat from a potato and put it in
a saucepan. Add three quarts of boiling water. Get a map of Ireland and
hang it on the wall directly in front of the saucepan. This will furnish
the local color for the stew. Let it boil two hours. When the potato
begins to moult it is a sign the stew is getting done. Walk easy so as
not to frighten it. Add a pinch of rhubarb and serve hot with lettuce
dressing. This is one of the best stews without meat that the Food Trust
has ever invented for the poor man.

MOCK PORK PIE.--Peel the bark carefully away from the hindquarters of a
spruce tree and remove the tenderloin. One of last year's Christmas
trees is excellent for the purpose. Chop it up fine and place in a
saucepan. Add boiling water and let it simper two hours. Season with a
pinch of salt, and if this is not satisfactory, you might also pinch a
little pepper. Put the bark in the coffee grinder and turn the handle
rapidly to the left. Add boiling water and serve with milk and sugar.
This will be a splendid joke on the Coffee Trust. The mock pork pie is
now done. Serve with lionaise dressing and tomato catsup. After dinner
eat four pepsin tablets and send for the doctor.

IMITATION APPLE FRITTERS.--First catch your fritter. Be sure that it is
a young fritter. The way to tell the age of a fritter is to count its
teeth. Remove the shell and add a pitcher of apple sauce. Place this in
a saucepan and tease it with a pinch of baking soda. Let it simper two
hours. Serve hot and smile rapidly while eating. Laughter always aids
digestion.

OX-TAIL CHOW CHOW.--To make ox-tail chow chow without an ox is one of
the best jokes in the world on the appetite. Remove the pin-feathers
from a young onion and chop it up fine, add water, stir gently and
add more water. Let it sizzle. Add more water. Always boil the water
before adding. Let it sizzle. Now remove the skum and serve hot with
watercresses on the side. This is a nice dish for a small family and at
the same time it shows what a generous nature the Food Trust has to
suggest it.

MOCK GIBLETS.--Take two rubber-neck clams and after stuffing them with
chestnuts fry them over a slow fire. The Coal Trust will see to it that
you have no trouble in getting a slow but expensive fire. Let them
sizzle. Now remove the necks from the clams and add baking soda. Let
them sizzle. Take the juice of a lemon and scatter it at the clams.
Serve hot, with pink finger bowls with your initials on them. Some
people prefer to have their initials on the clams, but such an idea is
only for the wealthy.

IMITATION PRUNE PIE.--Take a dozen knot-holes and peel them carefully.
Remove the shells and add a cup of sugar. Stir quickly and put in a hot
oven. Bake gently for six hours and then add a little Jamaica ginger.
Serve cold with tea wafers and talk fast while eating them.

BREAKFAST BACON.--Take a hat full of pine shavings and remove the
interior. Add a little sherry wine and sweeten to taste. Let them
sizzle. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and other cosmetics and let them
sizzle. Now turn them over with a spoon and serve them hot off the
griddle.

SARATOGA CHIPS.--The same as the breakfast bacon only you don't remove
the interior from the pine shavings. Just take them as Nature made them
and add a little salad oil. Serve cold with shredded onions on the side.

MOCK BAKED BEANS.--Take as many buttons as the family can afford and
remove the thread. Add pure spring water, put in a saucepan and stir
gently until you burst your buttons. Add a little flour to calm them and
let them sizzle. Serve with tomato catsup or molasses, according to the
location you find yourself living on the map.

OATMEAL PUDDING.--Take the sawdust carefully from a freshly caught board
and remove the husks. Add water and let it sizzle. Stir gently two
hours, then rest a while. Pour the contents into a saucepan and saturate
it with sugar and salt and other spices. Serve without splashing it, and
add a little cold water painted white to look like milk. This last idea
is a splendid joke on the Milk Trust.

HAMBURGER STEAK.--Always be sure to get a fresh Hamburger. There is
nothing that will reconcile a man to a vegetarian diet so quickly as an
over-ripe Hamburger. They should always be picked at the full of the
moon. To tell the age of a Hamburger look at its teeth. One row of teeth
for every year, and the limit is seven rows. Now remove the wishbone and
slice carefully. Add Wooster sauce and let it sizzle. Add a pinch of
potato salad and stir gently. Serve hot and eat fast with the eyes
closed tight.

APPLE DUMPLINGS.--Take a large sheet of blotting paper and remove the
ink. Ink is a non-conductor and discolors the palate. Borrow an apple
from the grocer and tie it up in the blotting paper. The blotting paper
will absorb the flavor from the apple in about three minutes. Now take
the apple back to the grocer and say, "Much obliged, thank you!" Cut the
blotting paper into thin slices and add water. Stir gently until it
boils over then unhook it. Serve hot and if your husband kicks say to
him bitterly: "You should have married an heiress with a Papa in the
Food Trust then you could afford to have real apples!"

IMITATION ROAST TURKEY.--Find a copy of a Thanksgiving Day newspaper and
select therefrom the fattest turkey on page 3. Now with a few kind words
coax the turkey away from the newspaper in the direction of the kitchen.
Care should be taken that the turkey does not escape in the butler's
pantry or fly up the dumb waiter, because the turkey is a very nervous
animal. Once you get the turkey in the kitchen lock the door and prepare
the stuffing. The best stuffing for a turkey is chestnuts, which you can
obtain by tearing a few pages from "The Life and Anecdotes of an After
Dinner Speaker." Now remove the wishbone carelessly and make a wish.
Then coax the turkey over to the gas stove and push it in. Let it sizzle
for four hours and serve hot by a Russian waiter and with Japanese
napkins.

MOCK CELERY.--Take an old whiskbroom and remove the handle. If the
handle is made of wood keep it, because it can be turned into breakfast
food the first time you see a sawmill. Now remove the wire from the
whiskbroom and sprinkle with baking soda. Serve cold with a pinch of
salt on the northwestern end.

MOCK CLAMS.--Take a rubber shoe and slice carefully. Add a dash of
tobasco and stir gently. When the shoe occupies the same shape as a
dozen rubber-neck clams serve with vanilla wafers and horseradish.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
