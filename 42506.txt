 THE CHRONICLES of HOLINSHED having become exceedingly scarce, and,
 from their Rarity and Value, having always brought a high Price
 whenever they have appeared for Sale, the Publishers have thought they
 should perform an acceptable Service to the Public by reprinting them
 in a uniform, handsome, and modern Form.

 It cannot now be necessary to state the Importance and interesting
 Nature of this Work. The high Price for which it has always sold, is a
 sufficient Testimony of the Esteem in which it has been held.
 Holinshed's Description of Britain is allowed to contain the most
 curious and authentic Account of the Manners and Customs of our Island
 in the Reign of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, in which it was written.
 His History of the Transactions of the British Isles, during these
 Periods, possesses all the Force and Value of contemporary Evidence,
 collected by a most skilful Observer; and the peculiar Style and
 Orthography in which the Work is written, furnish a very interesting
 Document to illustrate the History of the English Language.

 The original Edition of the Chronicles of Holinshed, it is well known,
 was published by their Author in a mutilated State. A Number of Pages,
 which had obviously been printed with the rest of the Work, were found
 to be omitted, except in a few Copies obtained by some favoured
 Persons. In the present Edition, these Castrations are faithfully
 restored; and in order that the Purchaser may depend upon finding an
 exact as well as a perfect Copy, it has been a Law with the
 Publishers, not to alter a single Letter, but to print the Work with
 the utmost Fidelity from the best preceding Edition, with the Author's
 own Orthography, and with his marginal Notes. The only Liberty taken,
 has been to use the Types of the present Day, instead of the old
 English Letter of the Time of Elizabeth.

 The Publishers submit to the Public this Edition of a curious and
 valuable Chronicle of our History, with a confident Hope, that it will
 gratify both the Historical Student and the General Reader. If it meet
 with the Reception which they anticipate, they will be encouraged to
 select some others of the rarest and most important of our ancient
 Chronicles, and reprint them, in like Manner, for the Convenience and
 Gratification of the Public.




 TO THE

 RIGHT HONORABLE, AND HIS SINGULAR GOOD LORD AND MAISTER,

 _S. WILLIAM BROOKE KNIGHT_,

     LORD WARDEN OF THE CINQUE PORTS, AND BARON OF COBHAM, ALL
     INCREASE OF THE FEARE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD, FIRME OBEDIENCE
     TOWARD HIS PRINCE, INFALLIBLE LOUE TO THE COMMON WEALTH, AND
     COMMENDABLE RENOWME HERE IN THIS WORLD, AND IN THE WORLD TO COME
     LIFE EUERLASTING.


 Hauing had iust occasion, Right Honorable, to remaine in London,
 during the time of Trinitie terme last passed, and being earnestlie
 required of diuers my freends, to set downe some breefe discourse of
 parcell of those things, which I had obserued in the reading of such
 manifold antiquities as I had perused toward the furniture of a
 Chronologie, which I haue yet in hand; I was at the first verie loth
 to yeeld to their desires: first, for that I thought my selfe vnable
 for want of skill and iudgment, so suddenlie & with so hastie speed to
 take such a charge vpon me: secondlie, bicause the dealing therein
 might prooue an hinderance and impechment vnto mine owne Treatise: and
 finallie, for that I had giuen ouer all earnest studie of histories,
 as iudging the time spent about the same, to be an hinderance vnto my
 more necessarie dealings in that vocation & function wherevnto I am
 called in the ministerie. But when they were so importunate with me,
 that no reasonable excuse could serue to put by this trauell, I
 condescended at the length vnto their yrkesome sute, promising that I
 would spend such void time as I had to spare, whilest I should be
 inforced to tarie in the citie, vpon some thing or other that should
 satisfie their request; and stand in lieu of a description of my
 Countrie. For their parts also they assured me of such helps as they
 could purchase: and thus with hope of good, although no gaie successe,
 I went in hand withall, then almost as one leaning altogither vnto
 memorie, sith my books and I were parted by fourtie miles in sunder.
 In this order also I spent a part of Michaelmas and Hilarie termes
 insuing, being inforced thereto I say by other businesses which
 compelled me to keepe in the citie, and absent my selfe from my
 charge, though in the meane season I had some repaire vnto my poore
 librarie, but not so great as the dignitie of the matter required, and
 yet far greater than the Printers hast would suffer. One helpe, and
 none of the smallest that I obtained herein, was by such commentaries
 as _Leland_ had somtime collected of the state of Britaine, books
 vtterlie mangled, defaced with wet and weather, and finallie vnperfect
 through want of sundrie volumes: secondlie, I gat some knowledge of
 things by letters and pamphlets, from sundrie places & shires of
 England, but so discordant now and then amongst themselues,
 especiallie in the names and courses of riuers and situation of
 townes, that I had oft greater trouble to reconcile them one with an
 other, than orderlie to pen the whole discourse of such points as they
 contained: the third aid did grow by conference with diuers, either at
 the table or secretlie alone, wherein I marked in what things the
 talkers did agree, and wherin they impugned ech other, choosing in the
 end the former, and reiecting the later, as one desirous to set foorth
 the truth absolutelie, or such things in deed as were most likelie to
 be true. The last comfort arose by mine owne reading of such writers
 as haue heretofore made mention of the condition of our countrie, in
 speaking wherof, if I should make account of the successe, &
 extraordinarie c[=o]ming by sundrie treatises not supposed to be
 extant, I should but seeme to pronounce more than may well be said
 with modestie, & say farder of my selfe than this Treatise can beare
 witnes of. Howbeit, I refer not this successe wholie vnto my purpose
 about this Description, but rather giue notice thereof to come to
 passe in the penning of my Chronologie, whose crums as it were fell
 out verie well in the framing of this Pamphlet. In the processe
 therefore of this Booke, if your Honor regard the substance of that
 which is here declared, I must needs confesse that it is none of mine
 owne: but if your Lordship haue consideration of the barbarous
 composition shewed herein, that I may boldlie claime and challenge for
 mine owne, sith there is no man of any so slender skill, that will
 defraud me of that reproch, which is due vnto me for the meere
 negligence, disorder, and euill disposition of matter comprehended in
 the same. Certes I protest before God and your Honour, that I neuer
 made any choise of stile, or words, neither regarded to handle this
 Treatise in such precise order and method as manie other would haue
 done, thinking it sufficient, truelie and plainelie to set foorth such
 things as I minded to intreat of, rather than with vaine affectation
 of eloquence to paint out a rotten sepulchre; a thing neither
 commendable in a writer, nor profitable to the reader. How other
 affaires troubled me in the writing hereof manie know, and
 peraduenture the slacknesse shewed herein can better testifie: but
 howsoeuer it be done, & whatsoeuer I haue done, I haue had an
 especiall eye vnto the truth of things, and for the rest, I hope that
 this foule frizeled Treatise of mine will prooue a spur to others
 better learned, more skilfull in Chorographie, and of greater
 iudgement in choise of matter to handle the selfe same argument, if in
 my life time I doo not peruse it againe. It is possible also that your
 Honour will mislike hereof, for that I haue not by mine owne trauell
 and eysight viewed such things as I doo here intreat of. In deed I
 must needs confesse, that vntill now of late, except it were from the
 parish where I dwell, vnto your Honour in Kent; or out of London where
 I was borne, vnto Oxford & Cambridge where I haue bene brought vp, I
 neuer trauelled 40. miles foorthright and at one iourney in all my
 life; neuerthelesse in my report of these things, I vse their
 authorities, who either haue performed in their persons, or left in
 writing vpon sufficient ground (as I said before) whatsoeuer is
 wanting in mine. It may be in like sort that your Honour will take
 offense at my rash and retchlesse behauiour vsed in the composition of
 this volume, and much more that being scambled vp after this maner, I
 dare presume to make tendour of the protection therof vnto your
 Lordships hands. But when I consider the singular affection that your
 Honour dooth beare to those that in any wise will trauell to set
 foorth such profitable things as lie hidden, and therevnto doo weigh
 on mine owne behalfe my bounden dutie and gratefull mind to such a one
 as hath so manie and sundrie waies benefited me that otherwise can
 make no recompense, I can not but cut off all such occasion of doubt,
 and therevpon exhibit it, such as it is, and so penned as it is, vnto
 your Lordships tuition, vnto whome if it may seeme in anie wise
 acceptable, I haue my whole desire. And as I am the first that
 (notwithstanding the great repugnancie to be seene among our writers)
 hath taken vpon him so particularlie to describe this Ile of Britaine;
 so I hope the learned and godlie will beare withall, & reforme with
 charitie where I doo tread amisse. As for the curious, and such as can
 rather euill fauouredlie espie than skilfullie correct an error, and
 sooner carpe at another mans dooings than publish any thing of their
 owne, (keeping themselues close with an obscure admiration of learning
 & knowledge among the common sort) I force not what they saie hereof:
 for whether it doo please or displease them, all is one to me, sith I
 referre my whole trauell in the gratification of your Honour, and such
 as are of experience to consider of my trauell, and the large scope of
 things purposed in this Treatise, of whome my seruice in this behalfe
 may be taken in good part, that I will repute for my full recompense,
 and large guerdon of my labours. The Almightie God preserue your
 Lordship in continuall health, wealth, and prosperitie, with my good
 Ladie your wife, your Honours children, (whom God hath indued with a
 singular towardnesse vnto all vertue and learning) and the rest of
 your reformed familie, vnto whom I wish farder increase of his holie
 spirit, vnderstanding of his word, augmentation of honor, and
 continuance of zeale to follow his commandements.

   _Your Lordships humble seruant
   and houshold Chaplein._

 OF THE DIUISION OF THE WHOLE EARTH.

 CHAPTER I.


 [Sidenote: Noah first diuided the earth among his sonnes.]
 We read that the earth hath beene diuided into three parts, euen
 sithens the generall floud. And the common opinion is, that Noah
 limited and bestowed it vpon his three sons, Japhet, Cham, and Sem,
 preserued with him in the Arke, giuing vnto each of them such portions
 thereof as to him seemed good, and neuerthelesse reteining the
 souereigntie of the whole still vnto himselfe: albeit as yet it be
 left vncertaine how those seuerall parts were bounded, and from whome
 they tooke such names as in our times are attributed to each of them.
 Certes the words, Asia, Europa, and Africa, are denominations giuen
 but of late (to speake of) vnto them, and it is to be doubted, whether
 sithens the time of Noah, the sea hath in sundrie places wonne or
 lost, added or diminished to and from each of them; or whether Europa,
 and Lybia were but one portion; and the same westerlie regions of late
 discouered (and now called America,) was the third part (counting Asia
 for the second) or the selfe region of the Atlantides, which Plato and
 others, for want of traffike thither in their times, supposed to be
 dissolued and sunke into the sea: as by their writings appeereth.

 [Sidenote: The diuision of the earth not yet certeinlie knowne.]
 Not long before my time, we reckoned Asia, Europa, and Africa, for a
 full and perfect diuision of the whole earth, which are parcels onelie
 of that huge Iland that lieth east of the Atlantike sea, and whereof
 the first is diuided from the second by Tanais (which riseth in the
 rocks of Caucasus, and hideth it selfe in the Meotine moores) and the
 Ocean sea; and the last from them both by the Mediterrane and red sea,
 otherwise called Mare Erythraeum. But now all men, especially the
 learned, begin to doubt of the soundnes of that partition; bicause a
 no lesse part than the greatest of the three ioined with those Ilands
 and maine which lie vnder the north and Southpoles, if not double in
 quantitie vnto the same, are found out and discouered by the diligence
 of our trauellers. Hereby it appeereth, that either the earth was not
 exactlie diuided in time past by antiquitie; or els, that the true
 diuision thereof came not to the hands and notice of their posteritie,
 so that our ancestors haue hitherto as it were laboured in the
 Cimmerian darkenesse, and were vtterlie ignorant of the truth of that
 whereabout they indeuoured to shew their trauels and knowledge in
 their writings. Some peece of this confusion also is to be found
 amongst the ancient and Romane writers, who (notwithstanding their
 large conquests) did sticke in the same mire with their successors,
 not being able (as appeereth by their treatises) to deliuer and set
 [Sidenote: Variance among the writers
 about the diuision of the earth.]
 downe the veritie. For Salust in his booke De bello Iugurthino cannot
 tell whether Africa be parcell of Asia or not. And with the same
 scruple Varro in his booke De lingua Lat. is not a litle incumbred,
 who in the end concludeth, that the whole earth is diuided into Asia
 and Europa: so that Africa is excluded and driuen out of his place.
 Silius also writeth of Africa, (as one not yet resolued wherevnto to
 leane,) that it is;

   Aut ingens Asiae latus, aut pars tertia rerum.

 Wherein Lucane lib. 9. sheweth himselfe to be far of another
 iudgement, in that he ascribeth it to Europa, saieng after this maner:

   Tertia pars rerum Lybia: si credere famae
   Cuncta velis, si ventos c[oe]lumque sequaris,
   Pars erit Europae, nec enim plus littora Nili
   Quam Scythicus Tanais primis a gradibus absunt.

 Whereby (I saie) we may well vnderstand, that in the time of Augustus
 Tiberius, Claudius & Nero, the Romanes were not yet resolued of the
 diuision of the earth. For my part, as I indeuour not to remooue the
 credit of that which antiquitie hath deliuered (and yet loth to
 continue and maintaine any corruption that may be redressed) so I
 [Sidenote: The earth diuided into fiue parts, whereas _Belforest_
 hath but foure, in _Prefat. lib. 4._]
 thinke good to giue foorth a new diuision more probable, & better
 agreeing with a truth. And therefore I diuide the whole into fiue
 seuerall parcels, reteining the common diuision in the first three, as
 before; and vnto the fourth allowing not onelie all that portion that
 lieth by north of the Magellan streicts, and those Hyperborean Ilands
 which lie west of the line of longitude, of late discouered by
 Frobisher, and called by hir Maiestie Meta incognita: but likewise so
 manie Ilands as are within 180. degrees Westwards from our beginning
 or common line of longitude, whereby they are parted from those, which
 by this diuision are allotted vnto Asia, and the portion it selfe made
 equipollent with the same for greatnes, and far exceeding either
 Europa or Africa, if it be not fullie so much in quantitie as they
 both vnited and laid togither. The fift & last part is the Antartike
 portion with hir Ilands annexed, that region (I meane) which lieth
 vnder the South pole, cut off from America, or the fourth part by the
 Magellan streicts; & from Africa by the sea which passeth by the Cape
 [Sidenote: Cape di bona Speranza.]
 of good hope; a countrie no lesse large for limits and bounds than
 Africa or America, and therefore right worthie to be called the fift:
 howsoeuer it shall please the curious to mislike of this diuision.
 This also I will adde, that albeit the continent hereof doo not extend
 [Sidenote: The forme of the fift part.]
 it selfe vnto the verie Antartike point, but lieth as it were a long
 table betweene two seas, of which the later is vnder the South poole,
 and as I may call it a maine sea vnder the aforesaid pricke, yet is it
 not without sundrie Ilands also adjoining vnto it, and the inner most
 sea not destitute of manie, as by experience hath beene of late
 confirmed. Furthermore, whereas our describers of the earth haue made
 it such in their descriptions, as hath reached litle or nothing into
 the peaceable sea without the Antartike circle: it is now found by
 Theuet and others, that it extendeth it selfe northwards into that
 trace, by no small number of leagues, euen in maner to the Equator, in
 so much that the westerlie part thereof from America, is supposed to
 reach northward so far from the Antartike article, as Africa dooth
 southwards from the tropike of Cancer, which is no small portion of
 ground; & I maruell why not obserued by such as heretofore haue
 written of the same. But they excuse themselues by the ingratitude of
 the Portingals and Spaniards, who haue of purpose concealed manie
 things found out in their trauell, least they should seeme to open a
 gap by dooing otherwise, for strangers to enter into their conquests.
 As for those Ilands also which lie in the peaceable sea, scattered
 here and there, as Iaua the greater, the lesser Sumatra, Iapan,
 Burneo, &c: with a number of other, I refer them still unto Asia, as
 before, so as they be without the compasse of 90. degrees eastward
 from the line of longitude, & not aboue 180. as I doo the Ile of S.
 Laurence, and a number of other vnto Africa within the said
 proportion, wishing so little alteration as I may: and yet not
 yeelding vnto any confusion, whereby the truth of the diuision should
 hereafter be impeached.

 And whereas by Virgil (speaking of our Iland) saith;

   Et penitus toto diuisos orbe Britannos,

 [Sidenote: Unto what portion Britaine is referred.]
 And some other authors not vnworthie to be read and perused, it is not
 certeine vnto which portion of the earth our Ilands, and Thule, with
 sundrie the like scattered in the north seas should be ascribed,
 bicause they excluded them (as you see) from the rest of the whole
 earth: I have thought good, for facilitie sake of diuision, to refer
 them all which lie within the first minute of longitude, set downe by
 Ptolome, to Europa, and that as reason requireth: so that the
 aforesaid line shall henceforth be their Meta & partition from such as
 are to be ascribed to America; albeit they come verie neere vnto the
 aforesaid portion, & may otherwise (without prejudice) be numbred with
 the same. It may be that some will thinke this my dealing either to be
 superfluous, or to proceed from (I wot not what) foolish curiositie:
 for the world is now growne to be very apt and readie to iudge the
 hardest of euerie attempt. But forsomuch as my purpose is to leaue a
 plaine report of such matter as I doo write of, and deliuer such
 things as I intreat of in distinct and vpright order; though method
 now and then doo faile, I will go forward with my indeuour, referring
 the examination of my dooings to the indifferent and learned eare,
 without regard what the other doo conceiue and imagine of me. In the
 meane season therefore it shall suffice to say at this time, that
 Albion as the mother, and the rest of the Ilands as hir daughters,
 lieng east of the line of longitude, be still ascribed vnto Europa:
 wherevnto some good authours heretofore in their writings, & their
 owne proper or naturall situations also haue not amisse referred them.




 OF THE POSITION, CIRCUIT, FORME, AND QUANTITIE OF THE ILE OF BRITAINE.

 CAP. II.


 [Sidenote: How Britaine lieth from the maine.]
 Britannia or Britain, as we now terme it in our English toong, or
 Brutania as some pronounce it (by reason of the letter y in the first
 syllable of the word, as antiquitie did sometime deliuer it) is an Ile
 lieng in the Ocean sea, directlie ouer against that part of France
 which conteineth Picardie, Normandie, and thereto the greatest part of
 little Britaine, which later region was called in time past Armorica,
 of the situation thereof vpon the sea coast, vntill such time as a
 companie of Britons (either led ouer by some of the Romane Emperours,
 or flieng thither from the tyrannie of such as oppressed them here in
 this Iland) did setle themselues there, and called it Britaine, after
 the name of their owne countrie, from whence they aduentured thither.
 It hath Ireland vpon the west side, on the north the maine sea, euen
 to Thule and the Hyperboreans; and on the east side also the Germane
 Ocean, by which we passe dailie through the trade of merchandize, not
 onlie into the low countries of Belgie, now miserablie afflicted
 betweene the Spanish power and popish inquisition (as spice betweene
 the morter and the pestell) but also into Germanie, Friezeland,
 Denmarke, and Norwaie, carrieng from hence thither, and bringing from
 thence hither, all such necessarie commodities as the seuerall
 countries doo yeeld: through which meanes, and besides common amitie
 conserued, traffike is mainteined, and the necessitie of each partie
 abundantlie releeued.

 [Sidenote: The longitude and latitude of this Ile.]
 It conteineth in longitude taken by the middest of the region 19.
 degrees exactlie: and in latitude 53. degrees, and thirtie min. after
 the opinions of those that haue diligentlie obserued the same in our
 daies, and the faithfull report of such writers as haue left notice
 thereof vnto vs, in their learned treatises to be perpetuallie
 remembred. Howbeit, whereas some in setting downe of these two lines,
 haue seemed to varie about the placing of the same, each of them
 diuerslie remembring the names of sundrie cities and townes, whereby
 they affirme them to haue their seuerall courses: for my part I haue
 thought good to proceed somewhat after another sort; that is, by
 diuiding the latest and best chards each way into two equall parts (so
 neere as I can possiblie bring the same to passe) wherby for the
 [Sidenote: Longest day.]
 middle of latitude, I product Caerlile and Newcastell vpon Tine,
 (whose longest day consisteth of sixteene houres, 48. minuts) and for
 the longitude, Newberie, Warwike, Sheffield, Skipton, &c: which
 dealing, in mine opinion, is most easie and indifferent, and likeliest
 meane to come by the certeine standing and situation of our Iland.

 [Sidenote: The compasse of Britaine.]
 Touching the length and bredth of the same, I find some variance
 amongst writers: for after some, there are from the Piere or point of
 Douer, vnto the farthest part of Cornewall westwards 320. miles: from
 thence againe to the point of Cathnesse by the Irish sea 800. Wherby
 Polydore and other doo gather, that the circuit of the whole Iland of
 Britaine is 1720. miles, which is full 280. lesse than Caesar dooth set
 downe, except there be some difference betweene the Romane and British
 miles, as there is indeed; wherof hereafter I may make some farther
 conference.

 Martianus writing of the bredth of Britaine, hath onlie 300. miles,
 but Orosius hath 1200. in the whole compasse. Ethicus also agreeing
 with Plinie, Martianus, and Solinus, hath 800. miles of length, but in
 the breadth he commeth short of their account by 120. miles. In like
 maner Dion in Seuero maketh the one of 891. miles: but the other; to
 wit, where it is broadest, of 289. and where it is narrowest, of 37.
 Finally, Diodorus Siculus affirmeth the south coast to conteine 7000.
 furlongs, the second; to wit, a Carione ad Promontorium 15000. the
 third 20000. and the whole circuit to consist of 42000. But in our
 time we reckon the breadth from Douer to Cornewall, not to be aboue
 300. miles, and the length from Douer to Cathnesse, no more than 500.
 which neuerthelesse must be measured by a right line, for otherwise I
 see not how the said diuision can hold.

 [Sidenote: The forme.]
 The forme and fashion of this Ile is three-cornered, as some have
 deuised, like vnto a triangle, bastard sword, wedge, or partesant,
 being broadest in the south part, and gathering still narrower and
 narrower, till it come to the farthest point of Cathnesse northward,
 where it is narrowest of all, & there endeth in maner of a promontorie
 called Caledonium & Orchas in British Morwerydh, which is not aboue
 30. miles ouer, as dailie experience by actuall trauell dooth
 confirme.

 [Sidenote: Promontories of Britaine.]
 The old writers giue vnto the three principall corners, crags, points,
 and promontories of this Iland, three seuerall names. As vnto that of
 Kent, Cantium, that of Cornewall, Hellenes, and of Scotland,
 Caledonium, and Orchas; and these are called principall, in respect of
 the other, which are Taruisium, Nonantum, Epidium, Gangacum,
 Octapites, Herculeum, Antiuesteum, Ocrinum, Berubium, Taizalum,
 Acantium, &c: of which I thought good also to leaue this notice, to
 the end that such as shall come after, may thereby take occasion to
 seeke out their true places, wherof as yet I am in maner ignorant, I
 meane for the most part; bicause I haue no sound author that dooth
 leade mee to their knowledge.

 [Sidenote: The distance from the maine.]
 Furthermore, the shortest and most vsuall cut that we haue out of our
 Iland to the maine, is from Douer (the farthest part of Kent eastward)
 unto Calice a towne in Picardie 1300. miles from Rome, in old time
 called Petressa and Scalas, though some like better of blacknesse
 where the breadth of the sea is not aboue thirtie miles. Which course,
 as it is now frequented and vsed for the most common and safe passage
 of such as come into our countrie out of France and diuers other
 realms, so it hath not beene vnknowne of old time vnto the Romans, who
 for the most part vsed these two hauens for their passage and
 repassage to and fro; although we finde, that now and then diuerse of
 them came also from Bullen, and landed at Sandwich, or some other
 places of the coast more toward the west, or betweene Hide and Lid; to
 wit, Romneie marsh, (which in old time was called Romania or Romanorum
 insula) as to auoid the force of the wind & weather, that often
 molesteth seafaringmen in these narrowe seas, best liked them for
 their safegards. Betweene the part of Holland also, which lieth neere
 the mouth of the Rhene and this our Iland, are 900. furlongs, as
 Sosimus saith; and besides him, diuers other writers, which being
 conuerted into English miles, doo yeeld 112. and foure od furlongs,
 whereby the iust distance of the neerest part of Britaine, from that
 part of the maine also, dooth certeinlie appeere to be much lesse than
 the common maps of our countrie haue hitherto set downe.




 OF THE ANCIENT NAMES OR DENOMINATIONS OF THIS ILAND.

 CAP. III.


 [Sidenote: Dis, Samothes.]
 In the diligent perusall of their treatises, who haue written of the
 state of this our Iland, I find that at the first it seemed to be a
 parcell of the Celtike kingdome, whereof Dis otherwise called
 Samothes, one of the sonnes of Japhet was the Saturne or originall
 beginner, and of him thencefoorth for a long while called Samothea.
 Afterward in processe of time, when desire of rule began to take hold
 in the minds of men, and ech prince endeuoured to enlarge his owne
 [Sidenote: Neptunus Marioticus.]
 dominions: Albion the sonne of Neptune, Amphitrite surnamed Marioticus
 (bicause his dominions laie among the ilands of the Mediterran sea, as
 those of Plutus did on the lower grounds neere vnto shore, as
 contrariwise his father Jupiter dwelled on the high hils neerer to
 heauen) hearing of the commodities of the countrie, and plentifulnesse
 [Sidenote: The first conquest of Britaine.]
 of soile here, made a voiage ouer, and finding the thing not onelie
 correspondent vnto, but also farre surmounting the report that went of
 this Iland, it was not long after yer he inuaded the same by force of
 armes, brought it to his subiection in the 29. yeare after his
 grandfathers decease, and finallie changed the name thereof into
 Albion, whereby the former denomination after Samothes did grow out of
 mind, and fall into vtter forgetfulnesse. And thus was this Iland
 bereft at on time both of hir ancient name, and also of hir lawfull
 succession of princes descended of the line of Japhet, vnder whom it
 [Sidenote: Britaine under the Celts 341. yeares.]
 had continued by the space of 341. yeres and nine princes, as by the
 Chronologie following shall easilie appeere.

 Goropius our neighbor being verie nice in the denomination of our
 Iland, as in most other points of his huge volume of the originall of
 Antwarpe lib. 6. (whom Buchanan also followeth in part) is brought
 into great doubt, whether Britaine was called Albion of the word Alb,
 white; or Alp an hill; as Bodinus is no lesse troubled with fetching
 the same ab Oibijs, or as he wresteth it, ab Albijs gallis. But here
 his inconstancie appeareth, in that in his Gotthadamca liber. 7. he
 taketh no lesse paines to bring the Britaines out of Denmarke, whereby
 the name of the Iland should be called Vridania, Freedania, Brithania,
 or Bridania, tanquam libera Dania, as another also dooth to fetch the
 originall out of Spaine, where Breta signifieth soile or earth. But as
 such as walke in darkenesse doo often straie, bicause they wot not
 whither they go: euen so doo these men, whilest they seeke to
 extenuate the certeintie of our histories, and bring vs altogither to
 uncerteinties & their coniectures. They in like maner, which will haue
 the Welshmen come from the French with this one question, vnde Walli
 nisi a Gallis, or from some Spanish colonie, doo greatlie bewraie
 their oversights; but most of all they erre that endeuour to fetch it
 from Albine the imagined daughter of a forged Dioclesian, wherewith
 our ignorant writers haue of late not a little stained our historie,
 and brought the sound part thereof into some discredit and mistrust:
 but more of this hereafter.

 [Sidenote: Neptune God of the sea.]
 Now to speake somewhat also of Neptune as by the waie (sith I haue
 made mention of him in this place) it shall not be altogither
 impertinent. Wherfore you shall vnderstand, that for his excellent
 knowledge in the art of nauigation (as nauigation then went) he was
 reputed the most skilfull prince that liued in his time. And therfore,
 and likewise for his courage & boldnesse in aduenturing to and fro, he
 was after his decease honoured as a god, and the protection of such as
 [Sidenote: The maner of dressing of ships in old time.]
 trauelled by sea committed to his charge. So rude also was the making
 of ships wherewith to saile in his time (which were for the most part
 flat bottomed and broad) that for lacke of better experience to calke
 and trim the same after they were builded, they vsed to naile them
 ouer with rawe hides of bulles, buffles, and such like, and with such
 a kind of nauie (as they say) first Samothes, & then Albion arriued in
 this Iland, which vnto me doth not seeme a thing impossible. The
 northerlie or artike regions, doo not naile their ships with iron,
 which they vtterly want, but with wooden pins, or els they bind the
 planks togither verie artificiallie with bast ropes, osiers, rinds of
 trees, or twigs of popler, the substance of those vessels being either
 of fir or pine, sith oke is verie deintie & hard to be had amongst
 them. Of their wooden anchors I speake not (which neuerthelesse are
 common to them, and to the Gothlanders) more than of ships wrought of
 wickers, sometime vsed in our Britaine, and couered with leather euen
 in the time of Plinie, lib. 7. cap. 56. as also botes made of rushes
 and reeds, &c. Neither haue I iust occasion to speake of ships made of
 canes, of which sort Staurobates, king of India fighting against
 Semiramis, brought 4000. with him and fought with hir the first
 battell on the water that euer I read of, and vpon the riuer Indus,
 but to his losse, for he was ouercome by hir power, & his nauie either
 drowned or burned by the furie of hir souldiers.

 But to proceed, when the said Albion had gouerned here in this
 countrie by the space of seauen yeares, it came to passe that both he
 and his brother Bergion were killed by Hercules at the mouth of
 Rhodanus, as the said Hercules passed out of Spaine by the Celtes to
 go ouer into Italie, and vpon this occasion (as I gather among the
 writers) not vnworthie to be remembred. It happened in time of Lucus
 [Sidenote: Lestrigo.]
 king of the Celts, that Lestrigo and his issue (whom Osyris his
 [Sidenote: Janigenes were the posteritie of Noah in Italie.]
 grandfather had placed ouer the Janigenes) did exercise great
 tyrannie, not onelie ouer his owne kingdome, but also in molestation
 of such princes as inhabited round about him in most intollerable
 maner. Moreouer he was not a little incouraged in these his dooings by
 [Sidenote: Neptune had xxxiii. sonnes.]
 Neptune his father, who thirsted greatly to leaue his xxxiii. sonnes
 settled in the mightiest kingdoms of the world, as men of whom he had
 alreadie conceiued this opinion, that if they had once gotten foot
 into any region whatsoeuer, it would not be long yer they did by some
 meanes or other, not onelie establish their seats, but also increase
 their limits to the better maintenance of themselues and their
 posteritie for euermore. To be short therefore, after the giants, and
 great princes, or mightie men of the world had conspired and slaine
 the aforsaid Osyris, onlie for that he was an obstacle vnto them in
 their tyrannous dealing; Hercules his sonne, surnamed Laabin, Lubim,
 or Libius, in the reuenge of his fathers death, proclaimed open warres
 against them all, and going from place to place, he ceased not to
 spoile their kingdomes, and therewithall to kill them with great
 courage that fell into his hands. Finallie, hauing among sundrie other
 [Sidenote: Lomnimi. Geriones.]
 ouercome the Lomnimi or Geriones in Spaine, and vnderstanding that
 Lestrigo and his sonnes did yet remaine in Italie, he directed his
 viage into those parts, and taking the kingdome of the Celts in his
 waie, he remained for a season with Lucus the king of that countrie,
 [Sidenote: Galathea. Galates, or Kelts.]
 where he also maried his daughter Galathea, and begat a sonne by hir,
 calling him after his mothers name Galates, of whom in my said
 Chronologie I haue spoken more at large.

 In the meane time Albion vnderstanding how Hercules intended to make
 warres against his brother Lestrigo, he thought good if it were
 possible to stop him that tide, and therefore sending for his brother
 [Sidenote: Bergion.]
 Bergion out of the Orchades (where he also reigned as supreame lord
 and gouernour) they ioined their powers, and sailed ouer into France.
 [Sidenote: _Pomponius Mela cap. de Gallia._]
 Being arriued there, it was not long yer they met with Hercules and
 his armie, neare vnto the mouth of the riuer called Roen (or the
 Rhodanus) where happened a cruell conflict betweene them, in which
 Hercules and his men were like to haue lost the day, for that they
 were in maner wearied with long warres, and their munition sore wasted
 in the last viage that he had made for Spaine. Herevpon Hercules
 perceiuing the courages of his souldiours somewhat to abate, and
 seeing the want of artillerie like to be the cause of his fatall daie
 and present ouerthrowe at hand, it came suddenlie into his mind to
 will each of them to defend himselfe by throwing stones at his enimie,
 whereof there laie great store then scattered in the place. The
 [Sidenote: _Strabo, lib. 4._]
 policie was no sooner published than hearkened vnto and put in
 execution, whereby they so preuailed in the end, that Hercules wan the
 field, their enimies were put to flight, and Albion and his brother
 both slaine, and buried in that plot. Thus was Britaine rid of a
 tyrant, Lucus king of the Celts deliuered from an vsurper (that dailie
 incroched vpon him, building sundrie cities and holds, of which some
 were placed among the Alps & called after his owne name, and other
 also euen in his owne kingdome on that side) and Lestrigo greatlie
 weakened by the slaughter of his brethren. Of this inuention of
 Hercules in like sort it commeth, that Jupiter father vnto Hercules
 (who indeed was none other but Osyris) is feigned to throw downe
 stones from heauen vpon Albion and Bergion, in the defense of his
 sonne: which came so thicke vpon them, as if great drops of raine or
 haile should haue descended from aboue, no man well knowing which waie
 to turne him from their force, they came so fast and with so great a
 violence.

 But to go forward, albeit that Albion and his power were thus
 discomfited and slaine, yet the name that he gaue unto this Iland died
 not, but still remained vnto the time of Brute, who arriuing heere in
 the 1116. before Christ, and 2850. after the creation of the world,
 not onelie changed it into Britaine (after it had beene called Albion,
 by the space of about 600. yeares) but to declare his souereigntie
 ouer the rest of the Ilands also that lie scattered round about it, he
 called them all after the same maner, so that Albion was said in time
 to be Britanniarum insula maxima, that is, The greatest of those Iles
 that beare the name of Britaine, which Plinie also confirmeth, and
 Strabo in his first and second bookes denieth not. There are some,
 which vtterlie denieng that this Iland tooke hir name of Brute, doo
 affirme it rather to be so called of the rich mettals sometime carried
 from the mines there into all the world as growing in the same. Vibius
 Sequester also saith that Calabria was sometime called Britannia, Ob
 immensam affluentiam totius delitiae atque vbertatis, that was to be
 found heerein. Other contend that it should be written with P
 (Pritannia.) All which opinions as I absolutelie denie not, so I
 willinglie leane vnto none of them in peremptorie maner, sith the
 antiquitie of our historie carrieth me withall vnto the former
 iudgements. And for the same cause I reiect them also, which deriue
 the aforesaid denomination from Britona the nymph, in following Textor
 (or Prutus or Prytus the sonne of Araxa) which Britona was borne in
 Creta daughter to Mars, and fled by sea from thence onelie to escape
 the villanie of Minos, who attempted to rauish and make hir one of his
 paramours: but if I should forsake the authoritie of Galfride, I would
 rather leane to the report of Parthenius, whereof elsewhere I haue
 made a more large rehersall.

 It is altogither impertinent, to discusse whether Hercules came into
 this Iland after the death of Albion, or not, although that by an
 ancient monument seene of late, as I heare, and the cape of Hartland
 or Harcland in the West countrie (called Promontorium Herculis in old
 time) diuers of our British antiquaries doo gather great likelihood
 that he should also be here. But sith his presence or absence maketh
 nothing with the alteration of the name of this our region and
 countrie, and to search out whether the said monument was but some
 token erected in his honour of later times (as some haue beene
 elsewhere, among the Celts framed, & those like an old criple with a
 bow bent in one hand & a club in the other, a rough skin on his backe,
 the haire of his head all to be matted like that of the Irishmens, and
 drawing manie men captiue after him in chaines) is but smallie
 auailable, and therefore I passe it ouer as not incident to my
 purpose. Neither will I spend any time in the determination, whether
 Britaine had beene sometime a parcell of the maine, although it should
 well seeme so to haue beene, bicause that before the generall floud of
 Noah, we doo not read of Ilands, more than of hils and vallies.
 Wherfore as Wilden Arguis also noteth in his philosophie and
 tractation of meteors, it is verie likelie that they were onelie
 caused by the violent motion and working of the sea, in the time of
 the floud, which if S. Augustine had well considered, he would neuer
 haue asked how such creatures as liued in Ilands far distant from the
 maine could come into the arke, De ciuit. lib. 16. cap. 7. howbeit in
 the end he concludeth with another matter more profitable than his
 demand.

 As for the speedie and timelie inhabitation thereof, this is mine
 opinion, to wit, that it was inhabited shortlie after the diuision of
 the earth. For I read that when each capteine and his companie had
 their portions assigned vnto them by Noah in the partition that he
 made of the whole among his posteritie, they neuer ceased to trauell
 and search out the vttermost parts of the same, vntill they found out
 their bounds allotted, and had seene and vewed their limits, euen vnto
 the verie poles. It shall suffice therefore onelie to haue touched
 these things in this manner a farre off, and in returning to our
 purpose, to proceed with the rest concerning the denomination of our
 [Sidenote: Yet _Timeus_, _Ephorus_, and some of the Grecians,
 know the name Britannia, as appeareth also by _Diodorus_, &c.
 before the comming of Cesar.]
 Iland, which was knowne vnto most of the Greekes for a long time, by
 none other name than Albion, and to saie the truth, euen vnto
 Alexanders daies, as appeareth by the words of Aristotle in his De
 mundo, and to the time of Ptolomie: notwithstanding that Brute, as I
 haue said, had changed the same into Britaine, manie hundred yeares
 before.

 After Brutus I doo not find that anie men attempted to change it
 againe, vntill the time that Theodosius, in the daies of Valentinianus
 and Valens endeuoured, in the remembrance of the two aforesaid
 Emperours, to call it Valentia, as Marcellinus saith. But as this
 deuise tooke no hold among the common sort, so it retained still the
 name of Britaine, vntill the reigne of Ecbert, who about the 800.
 yeare of Grace, and first of his reigne, gaue foorth an especiall
 edict, dated at Winchester, that it should be called Angles land, or
 Angel-landt, for which in our time we doo pronounce it England. And
 this is all (right honorable) that I haue to say, touching the
 seuerall names of this Iland, vtterlie misliking in the meane season
 their deuises, which make Hengist the onlie parent of the later
 denomination, whereas Ecbert, bicause his ancestours descended from
 the Angles one of the sixe nations that came with the Saxons into
 Britaine (for they were not all of one, but of diuers countries, as
 Angles, Saxons, Germans, Switzers, Norwegiens, Jutes otherwise called
 Jutons, Vites, Gothes or Getes, and Vandals, and all comprehended
 vnder the name of Saxons, bicause of Hengist the Saxon and his
 companie that first arriued here before anie of the other) and therto
 hauing now the monarchie and preheminence in maner of this whole
 [Sidenote: Of this opinion is _Belforest, lib. 3. cap. 44_.]
 Iland, called the same after the name of the countrie from whence he
 derived his originall, neither Hengist, neither anie Queene named
 Angla, neither whatsoeuer deriuation ab Angulo, as from a corner of
 the world bearing swaie, or hauing ought to doo at all in that
 behalfe.




 WHAT SUNDRIE NATIONS HAUE DWELLED IN ALBION.

 CAP. IV.


 As few or no nations can iustlie boast themselues to haue continued
 sithence their countrie was first replenished, without any mixture,
 more or lesse, of forreine inhabitants; no more can this our Iland,
 whose manifold commodities haue oft allured sundrie princes and famous
 capteines of the world to conquer and subdue the same vnto their owne
 subiection. Manie sorts of people therfore haue come in hither and
 settled themselues here in this Ile, and first of all other, a parcell
 [Sidenote: Samotheans.]
 of the linage and posteritie of Japhet, brought in by Samothes in the
 1910. after the creation of Adam. Howbeit in processe of time, and
 after they had indifferentlie replenished and furnished this Iland
 with people (which was doone in the space of 335. yeares) Albion the
 giant afore mentioned, repaired hither with a companie of his owne
 race proceeding from Cham, and not onelie annexed the same to his owne
 dominion, but brought all such in like sort as he found here of the
 line of Japhet, into miserable seruitude and most extreame thraldome.
 After him also, and within lesse than sixe hundred and two yeares,
 [Sidenote: Britains.]
 [Sidenote: Chemminits.]
 came Brute the sonne of Syluius with a great traine of the posteritie
 of the dispersed Troians in 324. ships: who rendering the like
 courtesie vnto the Chemminits as they had doone before unto the seed
 of Japhet, brought them also wholie vnder his rule and gouernance, and
 dispossessing the peeres & inferior owners of their lands and
 possessions, he diuided the countrie among such princes and capteines
 as he in his arriuall here had led out of Grecia with him.

 [Sidenote: Romans.]
 From hencefoorth I doo not find any sound report of other nation
 whatsoeuer, that should aduenture hither to dwell, and alter the state
 of the land, vntill the Romane emperours subdued it to their dominion,
 sauing of a few Galles, (and those peraduenture of Belgie) who first
 comming ouer to rob and pilfer vpon the coasts, did afterward plant
 themselues for altogither neere vnto the shore, and there builded
 sundrie cities and townes which they named after those of the maine,
 from whence they came vnto vs. And this is not onelie to be gathered
 out of Cesar where he writeth of Britaine of set purpose, but also
 elsewhere, as in his second booke a little after the beginning: for
 speaking of Deuiaticus king of the Swessions liuing in his time, he
 affirmeth him not onelie to be the mightiest prince of all the Galles,
 but also to hold vnder his subiection the Ile of Britaine, of which
 his sonne Galba was afterward dispossessed. But after the comming of
 the Romans, it is hard to say with how manie sorts of people we were
 dailie pestered, almost in euery steed. For as they planted their
 forworne legions in the most fertile places of the realme, and where
 they might best lie for the safegard of their conquests: so their
 armies did commonlie consist of manie sorts of people, and were (as I
 may call them) a confused mixture of all other countries and nations
 then liuing in the world. Howbeit, I thinke it best, bicause they did
 all beare the title of Romans, to reteine onelie that name for them
 all, albeit they were wofull ghests to this our Iland: sith that with
 them came all maner of vice and vicious liuing, all riot and excesse
 of behauiour into our countrie, which their legions brought hither
 from each corner of their dominions; for there was no prouince vnder
 them from whence they had not seruitours.

 [Sidenote: Scots.]
 [Sidenote: Picts.]
 How and when the Scots, a people mixed of the Scithian and Spanish
 blood, should arriue here out of Ireland, & when the Picts should come
 vnto vs out of Sarmatia, or from further toward the north & the
 Scithian Hyperboreans, as yet it is vncerteine. For though the Scotish
 histories doo carrie great countenance of their antiquitie in this
 Iland: yet (to saie freelie what I thinke) I iudge them rather to haue
 stolne in hither within the space of 100. yeares before Christ, than
 to haue continued here so long as they themselues pretend, if my
 coniecture be any thing. Yet I denie not, but that as the Picts were
 long planted in this Iland before the Scots aduentured to settle
 themselues also in Britaine; so the Scots did often aduenture hither
 to rob and steale out of Ireland, and were finallie called in by the
 Meats or Picts (as the Romans named them, because they painted their
 bodies) to helpe them against the Britains, after the which they so
 planted themselues in these parts, that vnto our time that portion of
 the land cannot be cleansed of them. I find also that as these Scots
 were reputed for the most Scithian-like and barbarous nation, and
 longest without letters; so they vsed commonlie to steale ouer into
 Britaine in leather skewes, and began to helpe the Picts about or not
 long before the beginning of Cesars time. For both Diodorus lib. 6.
 and Strabo lib. 4. doo seeme to speake of a parcell of the Irish
 nation that should inhabit Britaine in their time, which were giuen to
 the eating of mans flesh, and therefore called Anthropophagi.
 Mamertinus in like sort dooth note the Redshanks and the Irish (which
 are properlie the Scots) to be the onelie enimies of our nation,
 before the comming of Caesar, as appeareth in his panegyricall oration,
 so that hereby it is found that they are no new ghestes in Britaine.
 Wherefore all the controuersie dooth rest in the time of their first
 attempt to inhabit in this Iland. Certeinlie I maruell much whie they
 trauell not to come in with Cantaber and Partholonus: but I see
 perfectlie that this shift should be too grosse for the maintenance of
 their desired antiquitie. Now, as concerning their name, the Saxons
 translated the word Scotus for Irish: whereby it appeareth that those
 Irish, of whom Strabo and Diodorus doo speake, are none other than
 those Scots, of whom Ierome speaketh Aduersus Iouinianum, lib. 2. who
 vsed to feed on the buttocks of boies and womens paps, as delicate
 dishes. Aethicus writing of the Ile of Man, affirmeth it to be
 inhabited with Scots so well as Ireland euen in his time. Which is
 another proofe that the Scots and Irish are all one people. They were
 also called Scoti by the Romans, bicause their Iland & originall
 inhabitation thereof were vnknowne, and they themselues an obscure
 [Sidenote: Of the Picts.]
 nation in the sight of all the world. Now as concerning the Picts,
 whatsoeuer Ranulphus Hygden imagineth to the contrarie of their latter
 enterance, it is easie to find by Herodian and Mamertinus (of which
 the one calleth them Meates, the other Redshankes and Pictones) that
 they were setled in this Ile long before the time of Seuerus, yea of
 Caesar, and comming of the Scots. Which is proofe sufficient, if no
 further authoritie remained extant for the same. So that the
 controuersie lieth not in their comming also, but in the true time of
 their repaire and aduenture into this Iland out of the Orchades (out
 of which they gat ouer into the North parts of our countrie, as the
 writers doo report) and from whence they came at the first into the
 aforsaid Ilands. For my part I suppose with other, that they came
 hither out of Sarmatia or Scythia: for that nation hauing had alwaies
 an eie vnto the commodities of our countrie, hath sent out manie
 companies to inuade and spoile the same. It may be that some will
 gather, those to be the Picts, of whom Caesar saith that they stained
 their faces with wad and madder, to the end they might appeare
 terrible and feareful to their enimies; and so inferre that the Picts
 were naturall Britans. But it is one thing to staine the face onelie
 as the Britans did, of whom Propertius saith,

   Nunc etiam infectos demum mutare Britannos,

 And to paint the images and portraitures of beasts, fish and foules
 ouer the whole bodie, as the Picts did, of whom Martial saith,

   Barbara depictis veni Bascauda Britannis.

 Certes the times of Samothes and Albion, haue some likelie limitation;
 and so we may gather of the comming in of Brute, of Caesar, the Saxons,
 the Danes, the Normans, and finallie of the Flemmings, (who had the
 Rosse in Wales assigned vnto them 1066. after the drowning of their
 countrie.) But when first the Picts, & then the Scots should come ouer
 into our Iland, as they were obscure people, so the time of their
 arriuall is as far to me vnknowne. Wherefore the resolution of this
 point must still remaine In tenebris. This neuerthelesse is certeine,
 that Maximus first Legate of Britaine, and afterward emperour, draue
 the Scots out of Britaine, and compelled them to get habitation in
 Ireland, the out Iles, and the North part of the maine, and finallie
 diuided their region betweene the Britaines and the Picts. He
 denounced warre also against the Irishmen, for receiuing them into
 their land: but they crauing the peace, yeelded to subscribe, that
 from thence-foorth they would not receiue any Scot into their
 dominions; and so much the more, for that they were pronounced enimies
 to the Romans, and disturbers of the common peace and quietnesse of
 their prouinces here in England.

 The Saxons became first acquainted with this Ile, by meanes of the
 piracie which they dailie practised vpon our coastes (after they had
 once begun to aduenture themselues also vpon the seas, thereby to
 seeke out more wealth than was now to be gotten in the West parts of
 the maine, which they and their neighbours had alreadie spoiled in
 most lamentable and barbarous maner) howbeit they neuer durst presume
 [Sidenote: The hurt by forren aid.]
 to inhabit in this Iland, vntill they were sent for by Vortiger to
 serue him in his warres against the Picts and Scots, after that the
 Romans had giuen vs ouer, and left vs wholie to our owne defense and
 regiment. Being therefore come vnder Hengist in three bottoms or
 keeles, and in short time espieng the idle and negligent behauiour of
 the Britaines, and fertilitie of our soile, they were not a little
 inflamed to make a full conquest of such as at the first they came to
 aid and succour. Herevpon also they fell by little and little to the
 winding in of greater numbers of their countrimen and neighbours, with
 their wiues and children into this region, so that within a while
 these new comlings began to molest the homelings, and ceased not from
 time to time to continue their purpose, vntill they had gotten
 possession of the whole, or at the leastwise the greatest part of our
 countrie; the Britons in the meane season being driuen either into
 Wales and Cornewall, or altogither out of the Iland to seeke new
 habitations.

 [Sidenote: Danes.]
 In like maner the Danes (the next nation that succeeded) came at the
 first onelie to pilfer and robbe vpon the frontiers of our Iland, till
 that in the end, being let in by the Welshmen or Britons through an
 earnest desire to be reuenged vpon the Saxons, they no lesse plagued
 the one than the other, their freends than their aduersaries, seeking
 by all meanes possible to establish themselues also in the sure
 possession of Britaine. But such was their successe, that they
 prospered not long in their deuise: for so great was their
 lordlinesse, crueltie, and insatiable desire of riches, beside their
 detestable abusing of chast matrons, and yoong virgins (whose husbands
 and parents were dailie inforced to become their drudges and slaues,
 whilest they sat at home and fed like drone bees of the sweet of their
 trauell and labours) that God I say would not suffer them to continue
 any while ouer vs, but when he saw his time he remooued their yoke,
 and gaue vs liberty as it were to breath vs, thereby to see whether
 this his sharpe scourge could haue mooued vs to repentance and
 amendment of our lewd and sinfull liues, or not. But when no signe
 thereof appeared in our hearts, he called in an other nation to vex
 [Sidenote: The Normans.]
 vs, I meane the Normans, a people mixed with Danes, and of whom it is
 worthilie doubted, whether they were more hard and cruell to our
 countrimen than the Danes, or more heauie and intollerable to our
 Iland than the Saxons or the Romans. This nation came out of Newstria,
 the people thereof were called Normans by the French, bicause the
 Danes which subdued that region, came out of the North parts of the
 world: neuerthelesse, I suppose that the ancient word Newstria, is
 corrupted from West-rijc, bicause that if you marke the situation, it
 lieth opposite from Austria or Ost-rijc, which is called the East
 region, as Newstria is the Weast: for Rijc in the old Scithian toong
 dooth signifie a region or kingdome, as in Franc-rijc, or Franc-reich,
 Westsaxon-reich, Ost saxon-reich, Su-rijc, Angel-rijc, &c, is else to
 be seene. But howsoeuer this falleth out, these Normans or Danish
 French, were dedlie aduersaries to the English Saxons, first by meane
 of a quarell that grew betweene them in the daies of Edward the
 Confessour, at such time as the Earle of Bullen, and William Duke of
 Normandie, arriued in this land to visit him, & their freends; such
 Normans (I meane) as came ouer with him and Emma his mother before
 him, in the time of Canutus and Ethelred. For the first footing that
 euer the French did set in this Iland, sithence the time of Ethelbert
 & Sigebert, was with Emma, which Ladie brought ouer a traine of French
 Gentlemen and Ladies with hir into England.

 [Sidenote: The cause of the conquest by the Normans.]
 After hir also no small numbers of attendants came in with Edward the
 Confessour, whome he preferred to the greatest offices in the realme,
 in so much that one Robert a Norman, became Archbishop of Canturburie,
 whose preferment so much enhanced the minds of the French, on the one
 side, as their lordlie and outragious demeanour kindled the stomachs
 of the English nobilitie against them on the other: insomuch that not
 long before the death of Emma the kings mother, and vpon occasion of
 the brall hapning at Douer (whereof I haue made sufficient mention in
 my Chronologie, not regarding the report of the French authors in this
 behalfe, who write altogither in the fauour of their Archbishop
 Robert, but following the authoritie of an English preest then liuing
 in the court) the English Peeres began to shew their disliking in
 manifest maner. Neuerthelesse, the Normans so bewitched the king with
 their lieng and bosting, Robert the Archbishop being the cheefe
 instrument of their practise, that he beleeued them, and therevpon
 vexed sundrie of the nobilitie, amongst whom Earle Goodwijn of Kent
 was the cheefe, a noble Gentleman and father in law to king Edward by
 the mariage of his daughter. The matter also came to such issue
 against him, that he was exiled, and fiue of his sonnes with him,
 wherevpon he goeth ouer the sea, and soone after returning with his
 said sonnes, they inuaded the land in sundrie places, the father
 himselfe comming to London, where when the kings power was readie to
 ioine with him in battell, it vtterlie refused so to doo: affirming
 plainelie, that it should be meere follie for one Englishman to fight
 against another, in the reuenge of Frenchmens quarels: which answer
 entred so deeplie into the kings mind, that he was contented to haue
 the matter heard, and appointing commissioners for that purpose; they
 concluded at the vpshot, that all the French should depart out of
 England by a day, few excepted, whom the king should appoint and
 [Sidenote: Archbishop of Can. exiled, and the rest of the French.]
 nominate. By this means therfore Robert the Archbishop, & of secret
 counsell with the king, was first exiled as principall abuser &
 seducer of the king, who goeth to Rome, & there complaineth to the
 Pope of his iniurie receiued by the English. Howbeit as he returned
 home againe with no small hope of the readeption of his See, he died
 in Normandie, whereby he saued a killing. Certes he was the first that
 euer tendered complaint out of England vnto Rome, & with him went
 William Bishop of London (afterward reuoked) and Vlfo of Lincolne, who
 hardlie escaped the furie of the English nobilitie. Some also went
 into Scotland, and there held themselues, expecting a better time. And
 this is the true historie of the originall cause of the conquest of
 England by the French: for after they were well beaten at Douer,
 bicause of their insolent demeanour there shewed, their harts neuer
 ceased to boile with a desire of reuenge that brake out into a flame,
 so soone as their Robert possessed the primacie, which being once
 obteined, and to set his mischeefe intended abroch withall, a
 contention was quicklie procured about certeine Kentish lands, and
 controuersie kindled, whether he or the Earle should haue most right
 vnto them. The king held with the priest as with the church, the
 [Sidenote: Erle Goodwine slandered by the French writers.]
 nobilitie with the Earle. In processe also of this businesse, the
 Archbishop accused the Earle of high treason, burdening him with the
 slaughter of Alfred the kings brother, which was altogither false: as
 appeareth by a treatise yet extant of that matter, written by a
 chaplaine to king Edward the Confessour, in the hands of Iohn Stow my
 verie freend, wherein he saith thus, "Alfredus incaute agens in
 aduentu suo in Angliam a Danis circumuentus occiditur." He addeth
 moreouer, that giuing out as he came through the countrie accompanied
 with his few proud Normans, how his meaning was to recouer his right
 vnto the kingdome, and supposing that all men would haue yeelded vnto
 him, he fell into their hands, whome Harald then king did send to
 apprehend him, vpon the fame onelie of this report brought vnto his
 eares. So that (to be short) after the king had made his pacification
 with the Earle, the French (I say) were exiled, the Queene restored to
 his fauour (whom he at the beginning of this broile had imprisoned at
 Wilton, allowing hir but one onlie maid to wait upon hir) and the land
 reduced to hir former quietnesse, which continued vntill the death of
 the king. After which the Normans not forgetting their old grudge,
 remembred still their quarell, that in the end turned to their
 conquest of this Iland. After which obteined, they were so cruellie
 [Sidenote: The miserie of the English vnder the French.]
 bent to our vtter subuersion and ouerthrow, that in the beginning it
 was lesse reproch to be accounted a slaue than an Englishman, or a
 drudge in anie filthie businesse than a Britaine: insomuch that euerie
 French page was superiour to the greatest Peere; and the losse of an
 Englishmans life but a pastime to such of them as contended in their
 brauerie, who should giue the greatest strokes or wounds vnto their
 bodies, when their toiling and drudgerie could not please them, or
 satisfie their greedie humors. Yet such was our lot in those daies by
 the diuine appointed order, that we must needs obey such as the Lord
 did set ouer vs, and so much the rather, for that all power to resist
 was vtterlie taken from vs, and our armes made so weake and feeble
 that they were not now able to remooue the importable load of the
 [Sidenote: The cause of our miserie.]
 enimie from our surburdened shoulders. And this onelie I saie againe,
 bicause we refused grace offered in time, and would not heare when God
 by his Preachers did call vs so fauourablie vnto him. Oh how miserable
 was the estate of our countrie vnder the French and Normans, wherein
 the Brittish and English that remained, could not be called to any
 function in the commonwealth, no not so much as to be constables and
 headburowes in small villages, except they could bring 2. or 3.
 Normans for suerties to the Lords of the soile for their good
 behauiour in their offices! Oh what numbers of all degrees of English
 and Brittish were made slaues and bondmen, and bought and sold as oxen
 in open market! In so much that at the first comming, the French bond
 were set free; and those that afterward became bond, were of our owne
 countrie and nation, so that few or rather none of vs remained free
 without some note of bondage and seruitude to the French. Hereby then
 we perceiue, how from time to time this Iland hath not onelie beene a
 prey, but as it were a common receptacle for strangers, the naturall
 homelings or Britons being still cut shorter and shorter, as I said
 [Sidenote: In this voiage the said Harald builded Portaschith,
 which Caradoch ap Griffin afterward ouerthrew, and killed the
 garrison that Harald left therein.]
 before, till in the end they came not onelie to be driuen into a
 corner of this region, but in time also verie like vtterlie to haue
 beene extinguished. For had not king Edward, surnamed the saint, in
 his time, after greeuous wars made vpon them 1063. (wherein Harald
 latelie made Earle of Oxenford, sonne to Goodwin Earle of Kent, and
 after king of England, was his generall) permitted the remnant of
 their women to ioine in mariage with the Englishmen (when the most
 part of their husbands and male children were slaine with the sword)
 it could not haue beene otherwise chosen, but their whole race must
 needs haue susteined the vttermost confusion, and thereby the memorie
 of the Britons vtterlie haue perished among vs.

 Thus we see how England hath six times beene subiect to the reproch of
 conquest. And wheras the Scots seeme to challenge manie famous
 victories also ouer us, beside greeuous impositions, tributs, &
 dishonorable compositions: it shall suffice for answer, that they
 deale in this as in the most part of their historie, which is to seeke
 great honor by lieng, & great renowme by prating and craking. Indeed
 they haue doone great mischeefe in this Iland, & with extreme
 crueltie; but as for any conquest the first is yet to heare of. Diuers
 other conquests also haue beene pretended by sundrie princes sithence
 the conquest, onelie to the end that all pristinate lawes and tenures
 of possession might cease, and they make a new disposition of all
 things at their owne pleasure. As one by king Edw. the 3. but it tooke
 none effect. Another by Henrie the 4. who neuerthelesse was at the
 last though hardlie drawne from the challenge by William Thorington,
 then cheefe Justice of England. The third by Henrie the 7. who had
 some better shew of right, but yet without effect. And the last of all
 by Q. Marie, as some of the papists gaue out, and also would haue had
 hir to haue obteined, but God also staied their malices, and hir
 challenge. But beside the six afore mentioned, Huntingdon the old
 historiographer speaketh of a seuenth, likelie (as he saith) to come
 one daie out of the North, which is a wind that bloweth no man to
 good, sith nothing is to be had in those parts, but hunger & much
 cold. See more hereof in the historie of S. Albons, and aforsaid
 author which lieth on the left side of the librarie belonging now to
 Paules: for I regard no prophesies as one that doubteth from what
 spirit they doo proceed, or who should be the author of them.




 WHETHER IT BE LIKELIE THAT ANY GIANTS WERE, AND WHETHER THEY INHABITED
 IN THIS ILE OR NOT.

 CAP. V.


 Besides these aforesaid nations, which haue crept (as you haue heard)
 into our Iland, we read of sundrie giants that should inhabit here.
 Which report as it is not altogither incredible, sith the posterities
 of diuers princes were called by the name: so vnto some mens eares it
 seemeth so strange a rehersall, that for the same onelie cause they
 suspect the credit of our whole historie, & reiect it as a fable,
 vnworthie to be read. They also condemne the like in all other
 histories, especiallie of the North, where men are naturallie of
 greatest stature, imagining all to be but fables that is written of
 Starcater, Hartben, Angrine, Aruerode, &c: of whom Saxo, Johannes
 Magnus and Olaus doo make mention, & whose bones doo yet remaine to be
 seene as rare miracles in nature. Of these also some in their life
 time were able to lift vp (as they write) a vessell of liquor of 1000.
 weight, or an horsse, or an oxe, & cast it on their shoulders (wherein
 their verie women haue beene likewise knowne to come neere vnto them)
 and of the race of those men, some were seene of no lesse strength in
 the 1500. of Grace, wherein Olaus liued, and wrote the same of his
 owne experience and knowledge. Of the giant of Spaine that died of
 late yeares by a fall vpon the Alpes, as he either went or came fro
 Rome, about the purchase of a dispensation to marrie with his
 kinswoman (a woman also of much more than common stature) there be men
 yet liuing, and may liue long for age, that can saie verie much euen
 by their owne knowledge. Wherfore it appeareth by present experience,
 that all is not absolutelie vntrue which is remembred of men of such
 giants. For this cause therfore I haue now taken vpon me to make this
 breefe discourse insuing, as indeuouring therby to prooue, that the
 opinion of giants is not altogither grounded vpon vaine and fabulous
 narrations, inuented onelie to delight the eares of the hearers with
 the report of maruellous things: but that there haue beene such men in
 [Sidenote: * _Esay. 30. vers. 25._]
 deed, as for their hugenesse of person haue resembled rather[*] high
 towers than mortall men, although their posterities are now consumed,
 and their monstruous races vtterlie worne out of knowledge.

 I doo not meane herein to dispute, whether this name Gigas or Nephilim
 was giuen vnto them, rather for their tyrannie and oppression of the
 people, than for their greatnesse of bodie, or large steps, as
 Goropius would haue it (for he denieth that euer men were greater than
 at this present) or bicause their parents were not knowne, for such in
 old time were called Terrae filij; or whether the word Gigas dooth
 onlie signifie Indigenas, or homelings, borne in the land or not;
 neither whether all men were of like quantitie in stature, and farre
 more greater in old time, than now they be: and yet absolutelie I
 denie neither of these, sith verie probable reasons may be brought for
 ech of them, but especiallie the last rehearsed, whose confirmation
 dependeth vpon the authorities of sundrie ancient writers, who make
 diuers of noble race, equall to the giants in strength and manhood,
 and yet doo not giue the same name vnto them, bicause their quarels
 were iust, and commonlie taken in hand for defense of the oppressed.
 [Sidenote: Antheus. _Lucane lib. 4 in fine._]
 Examples hereof we may take of Hercules and Antheus, whose wrestling
 declareth that they were equall in stature & stomach. Such also was
 the courage of Antheus, that being often ouercome, and as it were
 vtterlie vanquished by the said Hercules, yet if he did eftsoones
 returne againe into his kingdome, he forthwith recouered his force,
 returned and held Hercules tacke, till he gat at the last betweene him
 and home, so cutting off the farther hope of the restitution of his
 armie, and killing finallie his aduersarie in the field, of which
 victorie Politian writeth thus:

   Incaluere animis dura certare palaestra,
     Neptuni quondam filius atque Iouis:
   Non certamen erant operoso ex aere lebetes,
     Sed qui vel vitam vel ferat interitum:
   Occidit Antaeus Ioue natum viuere fas est,
     Estq; magistra Pales Graecia, non Lybia.

 [Sidenote: Corineus. Gomagot.]
 The like doo our histories report of Corineus and Gomagot,
 peraduenture king of this Ile, who fought a combat hand to hand, till
 one of them was slaine, and yet for all this no man reputeth Hercules
 or Corineus for giants, albeit that Hanuile in his Architrenion make
 the later to be 12. cubits in height, which is full 18. foot, if
 poeticall licence doo not take place in his report and assertion. But
 sith (I say againe) it is not my purpose to stand vpon these points, I
 passe ouer to speake any more of them. And whereas also I might haue
 proceeded in such order, that I should first set downe by manie
 circumstances, whether any giants were, then whether they were of such
 huge and incredible stature as the authours doo remember, and finallie
 whether any of them haue beene in this our Iland or not, I protest
 plainlie, that my mind is not here bent to deale in any such maner,
 but rather generallie to confirme and by sufficient authoritie, that
 there haue beene such mightie men of stature, and some of them also in
 Britaine, which I will set downe onelie by sundrie examples, whereby
 it shall fall out, that neither our Iland, nor any part of the maine,
 haue at one time or other been altogither without them. First of all
 therfore, & to begin with the scriptures, the most sure & certeine
 ground of all knowledge: you shall haue out of them such notable
 examples set downe, as I haue obserued in reading the same, which vnto
 the godlie may suffice for sufficient proofe of my position.
 Neuerthelesse, after the scriptures I will resort to the writings of
 our learned Diuines, and finallie of the infidell and pagane authors,
 whereby nothing shall seeme to want that may confute Goropius, and all
 his cauillations.

 [Sidenote: _Cap. 6. vers. 5._]
 Moses the prophet of the Lord, writing of the estate of things before
 the floud, hath these words in his booke of generations. In these
 [Sidenote: _Anti. li. 1._]
 daies saith he, there were giants vpon the earth. Berosus also the
 Chalde writeth, that neere vnto Libanus there was a citie called Oenon
 (which I take to be Hanoch, builded sometime by Cham) wherein giants
 did inhabit, who trusting to the strength and hugenesse of their
 bodies, did verie great oppression and mischeefe in the world. The
 Hebrues called them generallie Enach, of Hanach the Chebronite, father
 to Achimam, Scheschai and Talma, although their first originall was
 deriued from Henoch the sonne of Caine, of whome that pestilent race
 descended, as I read. The Moabits named them Emims, and the Ammonites
 Zamsummims, and it should seeme by the second of Deut. cap. 19, 20.
 that Ammon and Moab were greatlie replenished with such men, when
 Moses wrote that treatise. For of these monsters some families
 remained of greater stature than other vnto his daies, in comparison
 [Sidenote: _Nu. cap. 13. verse 33, & 34._]
 of whome the children of Israell confessed themselues to be but
 grashoppers. Which is one noble testimonie that the word Gigas or
 Enach is so well taken for a man of huge stature, as for an homeborne
 child, wicked tyrant, or oppressour of the people.

 [Sidenote: _Deut. 3. vers. 11._ Og of Basan.]
 Furthermore, there is mention made also in the scriptures of Og,
 sometime king of Basan, who was the last of the race of the giants,
 that was left in the land of promise to be ouercome by the Israelits,
 & whose iron bed was afterward shewed for a woonder at Rabbath (a
 citie of the Ammonites) conteining 9. cubits in length, and 4. in
 bredth, which cubits I take not to be geometricall, (that is, each one
 so great as six of the smaller, as those were wherof the Arke was
 made, as our Diuines affirme, especiallie Augustine: whereas Origen,
 hom. 2. in Gen. out of whom he seemeth to borrow it, appeareth to haue
 no such meaning directlie) but rather of the arme of a meane man,
 which oftentimes dooth varie & differ from the standard. Oh how
 Goropius dalieth about the historie of this Og, of the breaking of his
 pate against the beds head, & of hurting his ribs against the sides,
 and all to prooue, that Og was not bigger than other men, and so he
 leaueth the matter as sufficientlie answered with a French countenance
 of truth. But see August. de ciuit. lib. 15. cap. 25. & ad Faustum
 Manich. lib. 12. Ambros. &c. and Johannes Buteo that excellent
 geometrician, who hath written of purpose of the capacitie of the
 Arke.

 [Sidenote: _Cap. 17. ver. 4, 5, 6._]
 [Sidenote: Goliah.]
 In the first of Samuel you shall read of Goliah a Philistine, the
 weight of whose brigandine or shirt of maile was of 5000. sicles, or
 1250. ounces of brasse, which amounteth to 104. pound of Troie weight
 after 4. common sicles to the ounce. The head of his speare came vnto
 ten pound English or 600. sicles of that metall. His height also was
 measured at six cubits and an hand bredth. All which doo import that
 he was a notable giant, and a man of great stature & strength to weare
 such an armour, and beweld so heauie a lance. But Goropius thinking
 himselfe still to haue Og in hand, and indeuouring to extenuate the
 fulnesse of the letter to his vttermost power, dooth neuerthelesse
 earnestlie affirme, that he was not aboue three foot more than the
 common sort of men, or two foot higher than Saule: and so he leaueth
 it as determined.

 [Sidenote: _Cap. 21. ver. 16, 17, &c._]
 In the second of Samuel, I find report of foure giants borne in Geth;
 of which Ishbenob the first, that would haue killed Dauid, had a
 speare, whose head weighed the iust halfe of that of Goliath: the
 second called Siphai, Sippai or Saph, 1. Par. 20. was nothing
 inferiour to the first: the third hight also Goliah, the staffe of
 whose speare was like vnto the beame of a weauers loome, neuerthelesse
 he was slaine in the second battell in Gob by Elhanan, as the first
 was by Abisai Ioabs brother, and the second by Elhanan. The fourth
 brother (for they were all brethren) was slaine at Gath by Ionathan
 nephew to Dauid, and he was not onlie huge of personage, but also of
 disfigured forme, for he had 24. fingers and toes. Wherby it is
 euident, that the generation of giants was not extinguished in
 Palestine, vntill the time of Dauid, which was 2890. after the floud,
 nor vtterlie consumed in Og, as some of our expositors would haue it.

 Now to come vnto our christian writers. For though the authorities
 alreadie alleged out of the word, are sufficient to confirme my
 purpose at the full; yet will I not let to set downe such other notes
 as experience hath reuealed, onelie to the end that the reader shall
 not thinke the name of giants, with their quantities, and other
 circumstances, mentioned in the scriptures, rather to haue some
 mysticall interpretation depending vpon them, than that the sense of
 the text in this behalfe is to be taken simplie as it speaketh. And
 first of all to omit that which Tertullian Lib. 2. de resurrect.
 [Sidenote: _De ciuitate Dei lib. 15. cap. 9._]
 saith; S. Augustine noteth, how he with other saw the tooth of a man,
 wherof he tooke good aduisement, and pronounced in the end that it
 would haue made 100. of his owne, or anie other mans that liued in his
 [Sidenote: _Iohannes Boccacius._]
 time. The like hereof also dooth Iohn Boccace set downe, in the 68.
 chapter of his 4. booke, saieng that in the caue of a mountaine, not
 far from Drepanum (a towne of Sicilia called Eryx as he gesseth) the
 bodie of an exceeding high giant was discouered, three of whose teeth
 did weigh 100. ounces, which being conuerted into English poise, doth
 yeeld eight pound and foure ounces, after twelue ounces to the pound,
 that is 33. ounces euerie tooth.

 He addeth farther, that the forepart of his scull was able to conteine
 manie bushels of wheat, and by the proportion of the bone of his
 [Sidenote: A carcase discouered of 200. cubits.]
 thigh, the Symmetricians iudged his bodie to be aboue 200. cubits.
 Those teeth, scull, and bones, were (and as I thinke yet are, for
 ought I know to the contrarie) to be seene in the church of Drepanum
 in perpetuall memorie of his greatnesse, whose bodie was found vpon
 this occasion. As some digged in the earth to laie the foundation of
 an house, the miners happened vpon a great vault, not farre from
 Drepanum: whereinto when they were entred, they saw the huge bodie of
 a man sitting in the caue, of whose greatnesse they were so afraid,
 that they ranne awaie, and made an outcrie in the citie, how there sat
 a man in such a place, so great as an hill: the people hearing the
 newes, ran out with clubs and weapons, as if they should haue gone
 vnto a foughten field, and 300. of them entring into the caue, they
 foorthwith saw that he was dead, and yet sat as if he had been aliue,
 hauing a staffe in his hand, compared by mine author vnto the mast of
 a tall ship, which being touched fell by and by to dust, sauing the
 nether end betweene his hand and the ground, whose hollownesse was
 filled with 1500. pound weight of lead, to beare vp his arme that it
 should not fall in peeces: neuerthelesse, his bodie also being touched
 fell likewise into dust, sauing three of his aforesaid teeth, the
 forepart of his scull, and one of his thigh bones, which are reserued
 to be seene of such as will hardlie beleeue these reports.

 In the histories of Brabant I read of a giant found, whose bones were
 17. or 18. cubits in length, but Goropius, as his maner is, denieth
 them to be the bones of a man, affirming rather that they were the
 bones of an elephant, because they somwhat resembled those of two such
 beasts which were found at the making of the famous ditch betweene
 Bruxels and Machlin. As though there were anie precise resemblance
 betweene the bones of a man and of an elephant, or that there had euer
 beene any elephant of 27. foot in length. But see his demeanour. In
 the end he granteth that another bodie was found vpon the shore of
 Rhodanus, of thirtie foot in length. Which somewhat staieth his
 iudgement, but not altogither remooueth his error.

 [Sidenote: _Mat. Westmon._]
 The bodie of Pallas was found in Italie, in the yeare of Grace 1038.
 and being measured it conteined twentie foot in length, this Pallas
 was companion with AEneas.

 [Sidenote: _Iohannes Leland._]
 There was a carcase also laid bare 1170. in England vpon the shore
 (where the beating of the sea had washed awaie the earth from the
 stone wherein it laie) and when it was taken vp it conteined 50. foot
 [Sidenote: _Mafieus, lib. 14. Triuet._]
 in measure, as our histories doo report. The like was seene before in
 [Sidenote: _Mat. West._]
 Wales, in the yeare 1087. of another of 14. foot.

 In Perth moreouer a village in Scotland another was taken vp, which to
 this daie they shew in a church, vnder the name of little John (per
 Antiphrasin) being also 14. foot in length, as diuerse doo affirme
 [Sidenote: _Hector Boet._]
 which haue beholden the same, and whereof Hector Boetius dooth saie,
 that he did put his whole arme into one of the hanch bones: which is
 worthie to be remembred.

 In the yeare of Grace 1475. the bodie of Tulliola the daughter of
 Cicero was taken vp, & found higher by not a few foot than the common
 sort of women liuing in those daies.

 [Sidenote: _Geruasius Tilberiensis._]
 Geruasius Tilberiensis, head Marshall to the king of Arles writeth in
 his Chronicle dedicated to Otho 4. how that at Isoretum, in the
 suburbes of Paris, he saw the bodie of a man that was twentie foot
 long, beside the head and the necke, which was missing & not found,
 the owner hauing peraduenture beene beheaded for some notable
 trespasse committed in times past, or (as he saith) killed by S.
 William.

 The Greeke writers make mention of Andronicus their emperour, who
 liued 1183. of Grace, and was ten foot in height, that is, three foot
 higher than the Dutch man that shewed himselfe in manie places of
 England, 1582. this man maried Anna daughter to Lewis of France
 (before assured to Alexius, whome he strangled, dismembred and drowned
 in the sea) the ladie not being aboue eleuen yeares of age, whereas he
 was an old dotard, and beside hir he kept Marpaca a fine harlot, who
 ruled him as she listed.

 Zonaras speaketh of a woman that liued in the daies of Justine, who
 being borne in Cilicia, and of verie comelie personage, was

 In Gillesland in Come Whitton paroche not far from the chappell of the

 like sort Leland speaketh of another found in the Ile called Alderney,
 whereof you shall read more in the chapiter of our Ilands.

 [Sidenote: _Richard Grafton._]
 Richard Grafton in his Manuell telleth of one whose shinbone conteined
 six foot, and thereto his scull so great that it was able to receiue
 fiue pecks of wheat. Wherefore by coniecturall symmetrie of these
 parts, his bodie must needs be of 24. foot, or rather more, if it were
 [Sidenote: The Symmetrie or proportion of the bodie of a comelie man.]
 diligentlie measured. For the proportion of a comelie and well
 featured bodie, answereth 9. times to the length of the face, taken at
 large from the pitch of the crowne to the chin, as the whole length is
 from the same place vnto the sole of the foot, measured by an imagined
 line, and seuered into so manie parts by like ouerthwart draughts, as
 Drurerus in his lineall description of mans bodie doth deliuer.
 Neuertheles, this symmetrie is not taken by other than the well
 proportioned face, for Recta, orbiculata (or fornicata) prona,
 resupinata, and lacunata (or repanda) doo so far degenerate from the
 true proportion as from the forme and beautie of the comelie. Hereby
 also they make the face taken in strict maner, to be the tenth part of
 the whole bodie, that is, fr[=o] the highest part of the forehead to
 the pitch of the chin, so that in the vse of the word face there is a
 difference, wherby the 9. part is taken (I say) from the crowne
 (called Vertex, because the haire there turneth into a circle) so that
 if the space by a rule were truelie taken, I meane from the crowne or
 highest part of the head to the pitch of the nether chap, and
 multiplied by nine, the length of the whole bodie would easilie
 appeare, & shew it selfe at the full. In like maner I find, that from
 the elbow to the top of the midle finger is the 4. part of the whole
 length, called a cubit: from the wrist to the top of the same finger,
 a tenth part: the length of the shinbone to the ancle a fourth part
 (and all one with the cubit:) from the top of the finger to the third
 ioint, two third parts of the face from the top of the forehead. Which
 obseruations I willinglie remember in this place, to the end that if
 anie such carcases happen to be found hereafter, it shall not be hard
 by some of these bones here mentioned, to come by the stature of the
 whole bodie, in certeine & exact maner. As for the rest of the bones,
 ioints, parts, &c: you may resort to Drurerus, Cardan, and other
 writers, sith the farther deliuerie of them concerneth not my purpose.
 [Sidenote: _Sylvester Gyraldus._]
 To proceed therefore with other examples, I read that the bodie of
 king Arthur being found in the yeare 1189. was two foot higher than
 anie man that came to behold the same. Finallie the carcase of William
 Conqueror was seene not manie yeares since (to wit, 1542.) in the
 [Sidenote: _Constans fama Gallorum._]
 citie of Cane, twelue inches longer, by the iudgment of such as saw
 it, than anie man which dwelled in the countrie. All which testimonies
 I note togither, bicause they proceed from christian writers, from
 whome nothing should be farther or more distant, than of set purpose
 to lie, and feed the world with fables.

 In our times also, and whilest Francis the first reigned ouer France,
 there was a man seene in Aquiteine, whome the king being in those
 parties made of his gard, whose height was such, that a man of common
 heigth might easilie go vnder his twist without stooping, a stature
 [Sidenote: Briat.]
 incredible. Moreouer Casanion, a writer of our time, telleth of the
 bones of Briat a giant found of late in Delphinois, of 15. cubits, the
 diameter of whose scull was two cubits, and the breadth of his
 shoulders foure, as he himselfe beheld in the late second wars of
 France, & wherevnto the report of Ioan Marius made in his bookes De
 Galliarum illustrationibus, where he writeth of the carcase of the
 same giant found not farre from the Rhodanus, which was 22. foot long,
 from the scull to the sole of the feet, dooth yeeld sufficient
 testimonie. Also Calameus in his commentaries De Biturigibus,
 confirmeth no lesse, adding that he was found 1556. & so dooth
 Baptista Fulgosus, lib. 1. cap. 6. saieng farther, that his graue was
 seene not farre from Valentia, and discouered by the violence and
 current of the Rhodanus. The said Casanion in like sort speaketh of
 the bones of a man which he beheld, one of whose teeth was a foot
 long, and eight pound in weight. Also of the sepulchre of another
 neere vnto Charmes castell, which was nine paces in length, things
 incredible to vs, if eiesight did not confirme it in our owne times,
 and these carcases were not reserued by the verie prouidence of God,
 to the end we might behold his works, and by these relikes vnderstand,
 that such men were in old time in deed, of whose statures we now begin
 to doubt. Now to say somwhat also of mine owne knowledge, there is the
 thighbone of a man to be seene in the church of S. Laurence neere
 Guildhall in London, which in time past was 26. inches in length, but
 now it beginneth to decaie, so that it is shorter by foure inches than
 it was in the time of king Edward. Another also is to be seene in
 Aldermarie burie, of some called Aldermanburie, of 32. inches and
 rather more, whereof the symmetrie hath beene taken by some skilfull
 in that practise, and an image made according to that proportion,
 which is fixt in the east end of the cloister of the same church, not
 farre from the said bone, and sheweth the person of a man full ten or
 eleuen foot high, which as some say was found in the cloister of
 Poules, that was neere to the librarie, at such time as the Duke of
 Somerset did pull it downe to the verie foundation, and carried the
 stones thereof to the Strand, where he did build his house. These two
 bones haue I seene, beside other, whereof at the beholding I tooke no
 great heed, bicause I minded not as then to haue had any such vse of
 their proportions, and therefore I will speake no more of them: this
 is sufficient for my purpose that is deliuered out of the christian
 authors.

 Now it resteth furthermore that I set downe, what I haue read therof
 in Pagane writers, who had alwaies great regard of their credit, and
 so ought all men that dedicate any thing vnto posteritie, least in
 going about otherwise to reape renowme and praise, they doo procure
 vnto themselues in the end nothing else but meere contempt and
 infamie. For my part I will touch rare things, and such as to my selfe
 doo seeme almost incredible: howbeit as I find them, so I note them,
 requiring your Honour in reading hereof, to let euerie Author beare
 his owne burden, and euerie oxe his bundle.

 [Sidenote: _In vita Sertorij de Antheo._]
 Plutarch telleth how Sertorius being in Lybia, neere to the streicts
 of Maroco, to wit, at Tingi (or Tanger in Mauritania, as it is now
 called) caused the sepulchre of Antheus, afore remembred to be opened:
 for hearing by common report that the said giant laie buried there,
 whose corps was fiftie cubits long at the least, he was so far off
 from crediting the same, that he would not beleeue it, vntill he saw
 the coffin open wherein the bones of the aforesaid prince did rest. To
 be short therefore, he caused his souldiers to cast downe the hill
 made sometime ouer the tombe, and finding the bodie in the bottome
 coffined in stone, after the measure therof taken, he saw it
 manifestlie to be 60. cubits in length, which were ten more than the
 people made accompt of, which Strabo also confirmeth.

 Pausanias reporteth out of one Miso, that when the bodie of Aiax was
 found, the whirlebone of his knee was adiudged so broad as a pretie
 dish: also that the bodie of Asterius somtime king of Creta was ten
 cubits long, and that of Hyllus or Gerion no lesse maruelous than the
 rest, all which Goropius still condemneth to be the bones of monsters
 of the sea (notwithstanding the manifest formes of their bones,
 epitaphes, and inscriptions found ingrauen in brasse and lead with
 them in their sepulchres) so far is he from being persuaded and led
 from his opinion.

 [Sidenote: _Philostrate._]
 Philostrate in Heroicis saith, how he saw the bodie of a giant thirtie
 cubits in length, also the carcase of another of two and twentie, and
 the third of twelue.

 Liuie in the seauenth of his first decade, speaketh of an huge person
 which made a challenge as he stood at the end of the Anien bridge,
 against any Romane that would come out and fight with him, whose
 stature was not much inferiour to that of Golias, of Artaches (of
 whome Herodot speaketh in the historie of Xerxes) who was sixe common
 cubits of stature, which make but fiue of the kings standard, bicause
 this is longer by three fingers than the other. Of Pusio, Secundilla,
 & Cabaras, of which the first two liuing vnder Augustus were aboue ten
 foot, and the later vnder Claudius of full nine, and all remembred by
 Plinie; of Eleazar a Jew, of whome Iosephus saith, that he was sent to
 Tiberius, and a person of heigth fiue cubits; of another of whom
 Nicephorus maketh mention lib. 12. cap. 13. Hist. eccles. of fiue
 cubits and an handfull, I say nothing, bicause Casanion of Mutterell
 hath alredie sufficientlie discoursed vpon these examples in his De
 gigantibus, which as I gesse he hath written of set purpose against
 Goropius, who in his Gigantomachia, supposeth himselfe to haue killed
 all the giants in the world, and like a new Iupiter Alterum carcasse
 Herculem, as the said Casanion dooth merilie charge and vpbraid him.

 [Sidenote: _Lib. 7._]
 Plinie telleth of an earthquake at Creta, which discouered the body of
 a giant, that was 46. cubits in length after the Romane standard, and
 by diuerse supposed to be the bodie of Orion or AEtion. Neuerthelesse I
 read, that Lucius Flaccus and Metellus did sweare Per sua capita, that
 it was either the carcase of some monster of the sea, or a forged
 deuise to bleare the peoples eies withall, wherein it is wonderfull to
 see, how they please Goropius as one that first deriued his
 fantasticall imagination from their asseueration & oth. The said
 Plinie also addeth that the bodie of Orestes was seuen cubits in
 length, one Gabbara of Arabia nine foot nine inches, and two reserued
 In conditorio Sallustianorum halfe a foot longer than Gabbara was, for
 which I neuer read that anie man was driuen to sweare.

 [Sidenote: _Trallianus._]
 Trallianus writeth how the Athenienses digging on a time in the
 ground, to laie the foundation of a new wall to be made in a certeine
 Iland in the daies of an emperour, did find the bones of Macrosyris in
 a coffin of hard stone, of 100. cubits in length after the accompt of
 the Romane cubit, which was then either a foot and a halfe, or not
 much in difference from halfe a yard of our measure now in England.
 These verses also, as they are now translated out of Greeke were found
 withall,

   Sepultus ego Macrosyris in longa insula
   Vitae peractis annis mille quinquies:

 which amounteth to 81. yeares foure moneths, after the Aegyptian
 reckoning.

 In the time of Hadrian the emperour, the bodie of the giant Ida was
 taken vp at Messana, conteining 20. foot in length, and hauing a
 double row of teeth, yet standing whole in his chaps. Eumachus also in
 Perigesi, telleth that when the Carthaginenses went about to dich in
 their prouince, they found two bodies in seuerall coffins of stone,
 the one was 23. the other 24. cubits in length, such another was found
 in Bosphoro Cymmerio after an earthquake, but the inhabitants did cast
 those bones into the Meotidan marris. In Dalmatia, manie graues were
 shaken open with an earthquake, in diuers of which certeine carcases
 were found, whose ribs conteined 16. els, after the Romane measure,
 whereby the whole bodies were iudged to be 64. sith the longest rib is
 commonlie about the fourth part of a man, as some rouing symmetricians
 affirme.

 Arrhianus saith, that in the time of Alexander the bodies of the
 Asianes were generallie of huge stature, and commonlie of fiue cubits,
 and such was the heigth of Porus of Inde, whom the said Alexander
 vanquished and ouerthrew in battell.

 Suidas speaketh of Ganges, killed also by the said prince, who farre
 exceeded Porus; for he was ten cubits long. What should I speake of
 Artaceas a capitaine in the host of Xerxes, afore remembred, whose
 heigth was within 4. fingers bredth of fiue cubits, & the tallest man
 in the armie except the king himselfe. Herod. lib. 7. Of Athanatus
 whom Plinie remembreth I saie nothing. But of all these, this one
 example shall passe, which I doo read of in Trallianus, and he setteth
 downe in forme and manner following.

 In the daies of Tiberius th'emperor saith he, a corps was left bare or
 laid open after an earthquake, of which ech tooth (taken one with
 another) conteined 12. inches ouer at the least. Now forsomuch as in
 [Sidenote: A mouth of sixteene foot wide.]
 such as be full mouthed, ech chap hath commonlie 16. teeth at the
 least, which amount vnto 32. in the whole, needs must the widenesse of
 this mans chaps be welneere of 16. foot, and the opening of his lips
 fiue at the least. A large mouth in mine opinion, and not to eat
 peason with Ladies of my time, besides that if occasion serued, it was
 able to receiue the whole bodies of mo than one of the greatest men, I
 meane of such as we be in our daies. When this carcase was thus found,
 euerie man maruelled at it, & good cause why. A messenger was sent to
 [Sidenote: A counterfect made of a monstrous carcase
 by one tooth taken out of the head.]
 Tiberius the emperour also to know his pleasure, whether he would haue
 the same brought ouer vnto Rome or not, but he forbad them, willing
 his Legate not to remooue the dead out of his resting place, but
 rather somewhat to satisfie his phantasie to send him a tooth out of
 his head, which being done, he gaue it to a cunning workeman,
 commanding him to shape a carcase of light matter, after the
 proportion of the tooth, that at the least by such means he might
 satisfie his curious mind, and the fantasies of such as are delited
 [Sidenote: This man was more fauorable to this monster
 than our papists were to the bodies of the dead who
 tare them in peeces to make money of them.]
 with nouelties. To be short, when the image was once made and set vp
 on end, it appeered rather an huge colossie than the true carcase of a
 man, and when it had stood in Rome vntill the people were wearie &
 throughlie satisfied with the sight thereof, he caused it to be broken
 all to peeces, and the tooth sent againe to the carcase fr[=o] whence
 it came, willing them moreouer to couer it diligentlie, and in anie
 wise not to dismember the corps, nor from thencefoorth to be so hardie
 as to open the sepulchre anie more. Pausan. lib. 8. telleth in like
 maner of Hiplodanus & his fellowes, who liued when Rhea was with child
 of Osyris by Cham, and were called to hir aid at such time as she
 feared to be molested by Hammon hir first husband, whilest she
 [Sidenote: Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris.]
 remained vpon the Thoumasian hill, "In ipso loco," saith he,
 "spectantur ossa maiora multo quam vt humana existimari possunt, &c."
 Of Protophanes who had but one great and broad bone in steed of all
 his ribs on ech side I saie nothing, sith it concerneth not his
 stature.

 I could rehearse manie mo examples of the bodies of such men, out of
 Solinus, Sabellicus, D. Cooper, and others. As of Oetas and Ephialtes,
 who were said to be nine orgies or paces in heigth, and foure in
 bredth, which are taken for so many cubits, bicause there is small
 difference betweene a mans ordinarie pace and his cubit, and finallie
 of our Richard the first, who is noted to beare an axe in the wars,
 the iron of whose head onelie weighed twentie pound after our greatest
 weight, and whereof an old writer that I haue seene, saith thus:

   This king Richard I vnderstand,
   Yer he went out of England,
   Let make an axe for the nones,
   Therewith to cleaue the Saracens bones,
   The head in sooth was wrought full weele,
   Thereon were twentie pound of steele,
   And when he came in Cyprus land,
   That ilkon axe he tooke in hand, &c.

 I could speake also of Gerards staffe or lance, yet to be seene in
 Gerards hall at London in Basing lane, which is so great and long that
 no man can beweld it, neither go to the top thereof without a ladder,
 which of set purpose and for greater countenance of the wonder is
 fixed by the same. I haue seene a man my selfe of seuen foot in
 heigth, but lame of his legs. The chronicles also of Cogshall speake
 of one in Wales, who was halfe a foot higher, but through infirmitie
 and wounds not able to beweld himselfe. I might (if I thought good)
 speake also of another of no lesse heigth than either of these and
 liuing of late yeares, but these here remembred shall suffice to
 prooue my purpose withall. I might tell you in like sort of the marke
 stone which Turnus threw at AEneas, and was such as that twelue chosen
 and picked men (saith Virgil),

 [Sidenote: Vis vnita fortior est eadem dispersa.]

   (Qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus)

 were not able to stur and remooue out of the place: but I passe it
 ouer, and diuerse of the like, concluding that these huge blocks were
 ordeined and created by God: first for a testimonie vnto vs of his
 power and might; and secondlie for a confirmation, that hugenes of
 bodie is not to be accompted of as a part of our felicitie, sith they
 which possessed the same, were not onelie tyrants, doltish, & euill
 men, but also oftentimes ouercome euen by the weake & feeble. Finallie
 they were such indeed as in whom the Lord delited not, according to
 [Sidenote: _Cap. 3, 36._]
 the saieng of the prophet Baruch; "Ibi fuerunt gigantes nominati, illi
 qui ab initio fuerunt statura magna, scientes bellum, hos non elegit
 Dominus, neque illis viam disciplinae dedit, propterea perierunt, et
 quoniam non habuerunt sapientiam, interierunt propter suam
 insipientiam, &c." that is, "There were the giants famous from the
 beginning, that were of great stature and expert in warre, those did
 not the Lord choose, neither gaue he the waie of knowledge vnto them,
 but they were destroied, because they had no wisedome, and perished
 through their owne foolishnesse." That the bodies of men also doo
 [Sidenote: _4. Esd. cap. 5._]
 dailie decaie in stature, beside Plinie lib. 7. Esdras likewise
 confesseth lib. 4. cap. 5. whose authoritie is so good herein as that
 of Homer or Plinie, who doo affirme so much, whereas Goropius still
 continuing his woonted pertinacitie also in this behalfe, maketh his
 proportion first by the old Romane foot, and then by his owne, &
 therevpon concludeth that men in these daies be fullie so great as
 euer they were, whereby as in the former dealing he thinketh it
 nothing to conclude against the scriptures, chosen writers and
 testimonies of the oldest pagans. But see how he would salue all at
 last in the end of his Gigantomachia, where he saith, I denie not but
 that od huge personages haue bene seene, as a woman of ten, and a man
 of nine foot long, which I my selfe also haue beholden, but as now so
 in old time the common sort did so much woonder at the like as we doo
 at these, because they were seldome seene, and not commonlie to be
 heard of.




 OF THE LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THIS ILAND.

 CAP. VI.


 [Sidenote: British.]
 What language came first with Samothes and afterward with Albion, and
 the giants of his companie, it is hard for me to determine, sith
 nothing of sound credit remaineth in writing, which may resolue vs in
 [Sidenote: Small difference betweene the British
 and Celtike languages.]
 the truth hereof. Yet of so much are we certeine, that the speach of
 the ancient Britons, and of the Celts, had great affinitie one with
 another, so that they were either all one, or at leastwise such as
 either nation with small helpe of interpretors might vnderstand other,
 and readilie discerne what the speaker meant. Some are of the opinion
 that the Celts spake Greeke, and how the British toong resembled the
 same, which was spoken in Grecia before Homer did reforme it: but I
 see that these men doo speake without authoritie and therefore I
 reiect them, for if the Celts which were properlie called Galles did
 speake Greeke, why did Cesar in his letters sent to Rome vse that
 language, because that if they should be intercepted they might not
 vnderstand them, or why did he not vnderstand the Galles, he being so
 skilfull in the language without an interpretor? Yet I denie not but
 that the Celtish and British speaches might haue great affinitie one
 with another, and the British aboue all other with the Greeke, for
 both doo appeere by certeine words, as first in tri for three, march
 for an horsse, & trimarchia, whereof Pausanias speaketh, for both.
 Atheneus also writeth of Bathanasius a capitaine of the Galles, whose
 name is meere British, compounded of Bath & Ynad, & signifieth a noble
 or comelie iudge. And wheras he saith that the reliques of the Galles
 tooke vp their first dwelling about Isther, and afterward diuided
 themselues in such wise, that they which went and dwelled in Hungarie
 were called Sordsai, and the other that inhabited within the dominion
 of Tyroll) Brenni, whose seate was on the mount Brenhere parcell of
 the Alpes, what else signifieth the word Iscaredich in British, from
 whence the word Scordisci commeth, but to be diuided? Hereby then, and
 sundrie other the like testimonies, I gather that the British and the
 Celtish speaches had great affinitie one with another, as I said,
 which Cesar (speaking of the similitude or likenesse of religion in
 both nations) doth also auerre, & Tacitus in vita Agricolae, in like
 sort plainlie affirmeth, or else it must needs be that the Galles
 which inuaded Italie and Greece were meere Britons, of whose likenes
 of speech with the Greeke toong I need not make anie triall, sith no
 man (I hope) will readilie denie it. Appianus talking of the Brenni
 calleth them Cymbres, and by this I gather also that the Celts and the
 Britons were indifferentlie called Cymbri in their own language, or
 else that the Britons were the right Cymbri, who vnto this daie doo
 not refuse to be called by that name. Bodinus writing of the means by
 which the originall of euerie kingdome and nation is to be had and
 discerned, setteth downe three waies whereby the knowledge thereof is
 to be found, one is (saith he) the infallible testimonie of the sound
 writers, the other the description and site of the region, the third
 the relikes of the ancient speech remaining in the same. Which later
 if it be of any force, then I must conclude, that the speech of the
 Britons and Celts was sometime either all one or verie like one to
 another, or else it must follow that the Britons ouerflowed the
 continent vnder the name of Cymbres, being peraduenture associat in
 this voiage, or mixed by inuasion with the Danes, and Norwegiens, who
 are called Cymbri and Cymmerij, as most writers doo remember. This
 also is euident (as Plutarch likewise confesseth In vita Marij) that
 no man knew from whence the Cymbres came in his daies, and therfore I
 beleeue that they came out of Britaine, for all the maine was well
 knowne vnto them, I meane euen to the vttermost part of the north, as
 may appeare furthermore by the slaues which were dailie brought from
 thence vnto them, whom of their countries they called Daui for Daci,
 Getae for Gothes, &c: for of their conquests I need not make
 rehearsall, sith they are commonlie knowne and remembred by the
 writers, both of the Greekes and Latines.

 [Sidenote: British corrupted by the Latine and Saxon speeches.]
 The British toong called Camberaec dooth yet remaine in that part of
 the Iland, which is now called Wales, whither the Britons were driuen
 after the Saxons had made a full conquest of the other, which we now
 call England, although the pristinate integritie thereof be not a
 little diminished by mixture of the Latine and Saxon speaches withall.
 Howbeit, manie poesies and writings (in making whereof that nation
 hath euermore delited) are yet extant in my time, wherby some
 difference betweene the ancient and present language may easilie be
 discerned, notwithstanding that among all these there is nothing to be
 found, which can set downe anie sound and full testimonie of their
 owne originall, in remembrance whereof, their Bards and cunning men
 haue beene most slacke and negligent. Giraldus in praising the Britons
 affirmeth that there is not one word in all their language, that is
 not either Greeke or Latine. Which being rightly vnderstanded and
 conferred with the likenesse that was in old time betweene the Celts &
 the British toongs, will not a little helpe those that thinke the old
 Celtish to haue some sauour of the Greeke. But how soeuer that matter
 standeth, after the British speach came once ouer into this Iland,
 sure it is, that it could neuer be extinguished for all the attempts
 that the Romans, Saxons, Normans, and Englishmen could make against
 that nation, in anie maner of wise.

 [Sidenote: The Britons diligent in petigrees.]
 Petigrees and genealogies also the Welsh Britons haue plentie in their
 owne toong, insomuch that manie of them can readilie deriue the same,
 either from Brute or some of his band, euen vnto AEneas and other of
 the Troians, and so foorth vnto Noah without anie maner of stop. But
 as I know not what credit is to be giuen vnto them in this behalfe,
 although I must needs confesse that their ancient Bards were verie
 diligent in there collection, and had also publike allowance or
 salarie for the same; so I dare not absolutelie impugne their
 assertions, sith that in times past all nations (learning it no doubt
 of the Hebrues) did verie solemnelie preserue the catalogs of their
 descents, thereby either to shew themselues of ancient and noble race,
 or else to be descended from some one of the gods. But

   Stemmata quid faciunt? quid prodest Pontice longo
   Sanguine censeri? aut quid auorum ducere turmas? &c.

 [Sidenote: Latine.]
 Next vnto the British speach, the Latine toong was brought in by the
 Romans, and in maner generallie planted through the whole region, as
 the French was after by the Normans. Of this toong I will not say
 much, bicause there are few which be not skilfull in the same.
 Howbeit, as the speach it selfe is easie and delectable, so hath it
 peruerted the names of the ancient riuers, regions, & cities of
 Britaine in such wise, that in these our daies their old British
 denominations are quite growne out of memorie, and yet those of the
 new Latine left as most vncertaine. This remaineth also vnto my time,
 borowed from the Romans, that all our deeds, euidences, charters, &
 writings of record, are set downe in the Latine toong, though now
 verie barbarous, and therevnto the copies and court-rolles, and
 processes of courts and leets registred in the same.

 [Sidenote: The Saxon toong.]
 The third language apparantlie knowne is the Scithian or high Dutch,
 induced at the first by the Saxons (which the Britons call Saysonaec,
 as they doo the speakers Sayson) an hard and rough kind of speach, God
 wot, when our nation was brought first into acquaintance withall, but
 now changed with vs into a farre more fine and easie kind of
 vtterance, and so polished and helped with new and milder words, that
 it is to be aduouched how there is no one speach vnder the sunne
 spoken in our time, that hath or can haue more varietie of words,
 copie of phrases, or figures and floures of eloquence, than hath our
 English toong, although some haue affirmed vs rather to barke as dogs,
 than talke like men, bicause the most of our words (as they doo
 indeed) incline vnto one syllable. This also is to be noted as a
 testimonie remaining still of our language, deriued from the Saxons,
 that the generall name for the most part of euerie skilfull artificer
 in his trade endeth in Here with vs, albeit the H be left out, and er
 onlie inserted, as Scriuenhere, writehere, shiphere, &c: for
 scriuener, writer, and shipper, &c: beside manie other relikes of that
 speech, neuer to be abolished.

 [Sidenote: The French toong.]
 After the Saxon toong, came the Norman or French language ouer into
 our countrie, and therein were our lawes written for a long time. Our
 children also were by an especiall decree taught first to speake the
 same, and therevnto inforced to learne their constructions in the
 French, whensoeuer they were set to the Grammar schoole. In like sort
 few bishops, abbats, or other clergie men, were admitted vnto anie
 ecclesiasticall function here among vs, but such as came out of
 religious houses from beyond the seas, to the end they should not vse
 the English toong in their sermons to the people. In the court also it
 grew into such contempt, that most men thought it no small dishonor to
 speake any English there. Which brauerie tooke his hold at the last
 likewise in the countrie with euerie plowman, that euen the verie
 carters began to wax wearie of there mother toong, & laboured to
 speake French, which as then was counted no small token of gentilitie.
 And no maruell, for euerie French rascall, when he came once hither,
 was taken for a gentleman, onelie bicause he was proud, and could vse
 his owne language, and all this (I say) to exile the English and
 British speaches quite out of the countrie. But in vaine, for in the
 time of king Edward the first, to wit, toward the latter end of his
 reigne, the French it selfe ceased to be spoken generallie, but most
 of all and by law in the midst of Edward the third, and then began the
 English to recouer and grow in more estimation than before;
 notwithstanding that among our artificers, the most part of their
 implements, tooles and words of art reteine still their French
 denominations euen to these our daies, as the language it selfe is
 vsed likewise in sundrie courts, bookes of record, and matters of law;
 whereof here is no place to make any particular rehearsall. Afterward
 [Sidenote: The helpers of our English toong.]
 also, by diligent trauell of Geffray Chaucer, and Iohn Gowre, in the
 time of Richard the second, and after them of Iohn Scogan, and Iohn
 Lydgate monke of Berrie, our said toong was brought to an excellent
 passe, notwithstanding that it neuer came vnto the type of perfection,
 vntill the time of Queene Elizabeth, wherein Iohn Iewell B. of Sarum,
 Iohn Fox, and sundrie learned & excellent writers haue fullie
 accomplished the ornature of the same, to their great praise and
 immortall commendation; although not a few other doo greatlie seeke to
 staine the same, by fond affectation of forren and strange words,
 presuming that to be the best English, which is most corrupted with
 externall termes of eloquence, and sound of manie syllables. But as
 this excellencie of the English toong is found in one, and the south
 part of this Iland; so in Wales the greatest number (as I said)
 retaine still their owne ancient language, that of the north part of
 the said countrie being lesse corrupted than the other, and therefore
 reputed for the better in their owne estimation and iudgement. This
 [Sidenote: Englishmen apt to learne any forren toong.]
 also is proper to vs Englishmen, that sith ours is a meane language,
 and neither too rough nor too smooth in vtterance, we may with much
 facilitie learne any other language, beside Hebrue, Greeke & Latine,
 and speake it naturallie, as if we were home-borne in those countries;
 & yet on the other side it falleth out, I wot not by what other
 meanes, that few forren nations can rightlie pronounce ours, without
 some and that great note of imperfection, especiallie the French men,
 who also seldome write any thing that sauoreth of English trulie. It
 is a pastime to read how Natalis Comes in like maner, speaking of our
 affaires, dooth clip the names of our English lords. But this of all
 the rest dooth breed most admiration with me, that if any stranger doo
 hit vpon some likelie pronuntiation of our toong, yet in age he
 swarueth so much from the same, that he is woorse therein than euer he
 was, and thereto peraduenture halteth not a litle also in his owne, as
 I haue seene by experience in Reginald Wolfe, and other, whereof I
 haue iustlie maruelled.

 [Sidenote: The Cornish toong.]
 The Cornish and Deuonshire men, whose countrie the Britons call
 Cerniw, haue a speach in like sort of their owne, and such as hath in
 deed more affinitie with the Armoricane toong than I can well discusse
 of. Yet in mine opinion, they are both but a corrupted kind of
 Brittish, albeit so far degenerating in these daies from the old, that
 if either of them doo meete with a Welshman, they are not able at the
 first to vnderstand one an other, except here and there in some od
 words, without the helpe of interpretors. And no maruell in mine
 opinion that the British of Cornewall is thus corrupted, sith the
 Welsh toong that is spoken in the north & south part of Wales, doth
 differ so much in it selfe, as the English vsed in Scotland dooth from
 that which is spoken among vs here in this side of the Iland, as I
 haue said alreadie.

 [Sidenote: Scottish english.]
 The Scottish english hath beene much broader and lesse pleasant in
 vtterance than ours, because that nation hath not till of late
 indeuored to bring the same to any perfect order, and yet it was such
 in maner, as Englishmen themselues did speake for the most part beyond
 the Trent, whither any great amendement of our language had not as
 then extended it selfe. Howbeit in our time the Scottish language
 endeuoreth to come neere, if not altogither to match our toong in
 finenesse of phrase, and copie of words, and this may in part appeare
 by an historie of the Apocripha translated into Scottish verse by
 Hudson, dedicated to the king of that countrie, and conteining sixe
 books, except my memorie doo faile me.

 Thus we see how that vnder the dominion of the king of England, and in
 the south parts of the realme, we haue three seuerall toongs, that is
 to saie, English, British, and Cornish, and euen so manie are in
 Scotland, if you accompt the English speach for one: notwithstanding
 that for bredth and quantitie of the region, I meane onelie of the
 soile of the maine Iland, it be somewhat lesse to see to than the
 [Sidenote: The wild Scots.]
 [Sidenote: Redshanks.]
 [Sidenote: Rough footed Scots.]
 [Sidenote: Irish Scots.]
 [Sidenote: Irish speech.]
 other. For in the north part of the region, where the wild Scots,
 otherwise called the Redshanks, or rough footed Scots (because they go
 bare footed and clad in mantels ouer their saffron shirts after the
 Irish maner) doo inhabit, they speake good Irish which they call
 Gachtlet, as they saie of one Gathelus, whereby they shew their
 originall to haue in times past beene fetched out of Ireland: as I
 noted also in the chapiter precedent, and wherevnto Vincentius cap. de
 insulis Oceani dooth yeeld his assent, saieng that Ireland was in time
 past called Scotia; "Scotia eadem (saith he) & Hibernia, proxima
 Britanniae insula, spatio terrarum angustior, sed situ f[oe]cundior;
 Scotia autem a Scotorum gentibus traditur appellata, &c." Out of the
 14. booke of Isidorus intituled Originum, where he also addeth that it
 is called Hybernia, because it bendeth toward Iberia. But I find
 elsewhere that it is so called by certeine Spaniards which came to
 seeke and plant their inhabitation in the same, wherof in my
 Chronologie I haue spoken more at large.

 In the Iles of the Orchades, or Orkeney, as we now call them, & such
 coasts of Britaine as doo abbut vpon the same, the Gottish or Danish
 speach is altogither in vse, and also in Shetland, by reason (as I
 take it) that the princes of Norwaie held those Ilands so long vnder
 their subiection, albeit they were otherwise reputed as rather to
 belong to Ireland, bicause that the verie soile of them is enimie to
 poison, as some write, although for my part I had neuer any sound
 experience of the truth hereof. And thus much haue I thought good to
 speake of our old speaches, and those fiue languages now vsuallie
 spoken within the limits of our Iland.




 INTO HOW MANIE KINGDOMS THIS ILAND HATH BEENE DIUIDED.

 CAP. VII.


 [Sidenote: Britaine at the first one entire kingdome.]
 It is not to be doubted, but that at the first, the whole Iland was
 ruled by one onelie prince, and so continued from time to time, vntill
 ciuill discord, grounded vp[=o] ambitious desire to reigne, caused the
 same to be gouerned by diuerse. And this I meane so well of the time
 before the comming of Brute, as after the extinction of his whole race
 & posteritie. Howbeit, as it is vncerteine into how manie regions it
 was seuered, after the first partition; so it is most sure that this
 latter disturbed estate of regiment, continued in the same, not onelie
 vntill the time of Caesar, but also in maner vnto the daies of Lucius,
 with whome the whole race of the Britons had an end, and the Romans
 full possession of this Iland, who gouerned it by Legats after the
 maner of a prouince. It should seeme also that within a while after
 the time of Dunwallon (who rather brought those foure princes that
 vsurped in his time to obedience, than extinguished their titles, &
 such partition as they had made of the Iland among themselues) each
 great citie had hir freedome and seuerall kind of regiment, proper
 vnto hir selfe, beside a large circuit of the countrie appertinent
 vnto the same, wherein were sundrie other cities also of lesse name,
 which owght homage and all subiection vnto the greater sort. And to
 saie truth, hereof it came to passe, that each of these regions,
 whereinto this Iland was then diuided, tooke his name of some one of
 these cities; although Ciuitas after Caesar doth sometime signifie an
 whole continent or kingdome, whereby there were in old time Tot
 ciuitates quot regna, and contrariwise as may appeare by that of the
 Trinobantes, which was so called of Trinobantum the chiefe citie of
 that portion, whose territories conteined all Essex, Middlesex, and
 part of Hertfordshire, euen as the iurisdiction of the bishop of
 London is now extended, for the ouersight of such things as belong
 vnto the church. Ech of the gouernors also of these regions, called
 themselues kings, and therevnto either of them dailie made warre vpon
 other, for the inlarging of their limits. But for somuch as I am not
 able to saie how manie did challenge this authoritie at once, and how
 long they reigned ouer their seuerall portions, I will passe ouer
 these ancient times, and come neerer vnto our owne, I meane the 600.
 yeere of Christ, whereof we haue more certeine notice, & at which
 season there is euident proofe, that there were twelue or thirteene
 kings reigning in this Iland.

 [Sidenote: Wales diuided into three kingdomes.]
 We find therefore for the first, how that Wales had hir three seuerall
 kingdomes, which being accompted togither conteined (as Giraldus
 saith) 49. cantreds or cantons (whereof three were in his time
 possessed by the French and English) although that whole portion of
 the Iland extended in those daies no farder than about 200. miles in
 length, and one hundred in bredth, and was cut from Lhoegres by the
 riuers Sauerne and Dee, of which two streames this dooth fall into the
 Irish sea at Westchester, the other into the maine Ocean, betwixt
 Somersetshire and Southwales, as their seuerall courses shall witnesse
 more at large.

 [Sidenote: Gwinhed.]
 In the begining it was diuided into two kingdoms onelie, that is to
 saie, Venedotia or Gwynhedh (otherwise called Dehenbarth) and Demetia,
 for which we now vse most c[=o]monlie the names of South & Northwales.
 But in a short processe of time a third sprung vp in the verie middest
 betweene them both, which from thence-foorth was called Powisy, as
 shalbe shewed hereafter. For Roderijc the great, who flourished 850.
 of Christ, and was king of all Wales (which then conteined onlie six
 regions) leauing three sons behind him, by his last will & testament
 diuided the countrie into three portions, according to the number of
 his children, of which he assigned one vnto either of them, wherby
 Morwing or Morwinner had Gwynhedh or Northwales, Cadelh Demetia or
 Southwales, and Anaralt Powisy, as Giraldus and other doo remember.
 Howbeit it came to passe that after this diuision, Cadelh suruiued all
 his brethren, and thereby became lord of both their portions, and his
 successors after him vntill the time of Teuther or Theodor (all is
 one) after which they were contented to keepe themselues within the
 compasse of Demetia, which (as I said) conteined 29. of those 49.
 cantreds before mentioned, as Powisy did six, and Gwinhedh fourteene,
 except my memorie doo faile me.

 [Sidenote: Venedotia.]
 The first of these three, being called (as I said) Northwales or
 Venedotia (or as Paulus Iouius saith Malfabrene, for he diuideth Wales
 also into three regions, of which he calleth the first Dumbera, the
 second Berfrona, and the third Malfabrene) lieth directlie ouer
 [Sidenote: Anglesei.]
 against the Ile of Anglesei, the chiefe citie whereof stood in the Ile
 of Anglesei and was called Aberfraw. It conteineth 4. regions, of
 which the said Iland is the first, and whereof in the chapter insuing
 [Sidenote: Arfon.]
 I wille intreat more at large. The second is called Arfon, and situate
 [Sidenote: Merioneth.]
 betweene two riuers, the Segwy and the Conwy. The third is Merioneth,
 and as it is seuered from Arfon by the Conwy, so is it separated from
 [Sidenote: Stradcluyd or Tegenia.]
 Tegenia (otherwise called Stradcluyd and Igenia the fourth region) by
 the riuer Cluda. Finallie, the limits of this latter are extended also
 euen vnto the Dee it selfe, and of these foure regions consisteth the
 kingdome of Venedotia, whereof in times past the region of the Canges
 was not the smallest portion.

 [Sidenote: Powisy.]
 The kingdome of Powisy, last of all erected, as I said, hath on the
 north side Gwinhedh, on the east (from Chester to Hereford, or rather
 to Deane forest) England, on the south and west the riuer Wy and verie
 high hilles, whereby it is notablie seuered from Southwales, the
 chiefe citie thereof being at the first Salopsburg, in old time
 Pengwerne, and Ynwithig, but now Shrowesburie, a citie or towne raised
 out of the ruines of Vricouium, which (standing 4. miles from thence,
 and by the Saxons called Wrekencester and Wrokecester, before they
 ouerthrew it) is now inhabited with meere English, and where in old
 time the kings of Powisy did dwell and hold their palaces, till
 Englishmen draue them from thence to Matrauall in the same prouince,
 where they from thencefoorth aboad. Vpon the limits of this kingdome,
 and not far from Holt castell, vpon ech side of the riuer, as the
 [Sidenote: Bangor.]
 chanell now runneth, stood sometime the famous monasterie of Bangor,
 whilest the abated glorie of the Britons yet remained vnextinguished,
 and herein were 2100. monkes, of which, the learned sort did preach
 the Gospell, and the vnlearned labored with their hands, thereby to
 mainteine themselues, and to sustaine their preachers. This region was
 in like sort diuided afterward in twaine, of which, the one was called
 [Sidenote: Mailrosse.]
 Mailor or Mailrosse, the other reteined still hir old denomination,
 and of these the first laie by south, & the latter by north of the
 Sauerne.

 [Sidenote: Fowkes de Warren.]
 As touching Mailrosse, I read moreouer in the gests of Fowkes de
 Warren, how that one William sonne to a certeine ladie sister to Paine
 Peuerell, the first lord of Whittington, after the conquest did win a
 part of the same, and the hundred of Ellesmore from the Welshmen, in
 which enterprise he was so desperatlie wounded, that no man hight him
 life; yet at the last by eating of the shield of a wild bore, he got
 an appetite and recouered his health. This William had issue two
 [Sidenote: Helene.]
 [Sidenote: Mellent.]
 daughters, to wit, Helene maried to the heir of the Alans, and Mellent
 which refused mariage with anie man, except he were first tried to be
 a knight of prowesse. Herevpon hir father made proclamation, that
 against such a daie & at such a place, whatsoeuer Gentleman could shew
 himselfe most valiant in the field, should marrie Mellent his
 daughter, & haue with hir his castell of Whittington with sufficient
 liueliehood to mainteine their estates for euer. This report being
 spred, Fowkes de Warren came thither all in red, with a shield of
 siluer and pecocke for his crest, whereof he was called the red
 knight, and there ouercomming the kings sonne of Scotland, and a Baron
 of Burgundie, he maried the maid, and by hir had issue as in the
 treatise appeareth. There is yet great mention of the red knight in
 the countrie there about; and much like vnto this Mellent was the
 daughter sometime of one of the lord Rosses, called Kudall, who bare
 [Sidenote: The originall of Fitz Henries.]
 such good will to Fitz-Henrie clarke of hir fathers kitchen, that she
 made him carie hir awaie on horssebacke behind him, onlie for his
 manhood sake, which presentlie was tried. For being pursued & ouer
 taken, she made him light, & held his cloke whilest he killed and
 draue hir fathers men to flight: and then awaie they go, till hir
 father conceiuing a good opinion of Fitz-Henrie for this act, receiued
 him to his fauour, whereby that familie came vp. And thus much (by the
 waie) of Mailrosse, whereof this may suffice, sith mine intent is not
 as now to make anie precise description of the particulars of Wales;
 but onelie to shew how those regions laie, which sometime were knowne
 [Sidenote: Demetia.]
 to be gouerned in that countrie. The third kingdome is Demetia, or
 Southwales, sometime knowne for the region of the Syllures, wherevnto
 I also am persuaded, that the Ordolukes laie in the east part thereof,
 and extended their region euen vnto the Sauerne: but howsoeuer that
 matter falleth out, Demetia hath the Sauerne on hir south, the Irish
 sea on hir west parts, on the east the Sauerne onelie, and by north
 the land of Powisy, whereof I spake of late.

 [Sidenote: Cair Maridunum.]
 Of this region also Caermarden, which the old writers call Maridunum,
 was the cheefe citie and palace belonging to the kings of Southwales,
 vntill at the last through forren and ciuill inuasions of enimies, the
 princes thereof were constrained to remooue their courts to Dinefar
 (which is in Cantermawr, and situate neuerthelesse vpon the same riuer
 Tewy, wheron Caermarden standeth) in which place it is far better
 defended with high hils, thicke woods, craggie rocks, and deepe
 marises. In this region also lieth Pembroke alias Penmoroc shire,
 whose fawcons haue beene in old time very much regarded, and therein
 likewise is Milford hauen, whereof the Welsh wisards doo yet dreame
 strange toies, which they beleeue shall one daie come to passe. For
 they are a nation much giuen to fortelling of things to come, but more
 to beleeue such blind prophesies as haue beene made of old time, and
 no man is accompted for learned in Wales that is not supposed to haue
 the spirit of prophesie.

 [Sidenote: Pictland.]
 [Sidenote: Scotland.]
 [Sidenote: Picts.]
 [Sidenote: Scots.]
 That Scotland had in those daies two kingdoms, (besides that of the
 Orchades) whereof the one consisted of the Picts, and was called
 Pightland or Pictland, the other of the Irish race, and named
 Scotland: I hope no wise man will readilie denie. The whole region or
 portion of the Ile beyond the Scotish sea also was so diuided, that
 the Picts laie on the east side, and the Scots on the west, ech of
 them being seuered from other, either by huge hils or great lakes and
 riuers, that ran out of the south into the north betweene them. It
 seemeth also that at the first these two kingdoms were diuided from
 the rest of those of the Britons by the riuers Cluda and Forth, till
 both of them desirous to inlarge their dominions, draue the Britons
 ouer the Solue and the Twede, which then became march betweene both
 the nations. Wherefore the case being so plaine, I will saie no more
 of these two, but proceed in order with the rehersall of the rest of
 the particular kingdoms of this our south part of the Ile, limiting
 out the same by shires as they now lie, so neere as I can, for
 otherwise it shall be vnpossible for me to leaue certaine notice of
 the likeliest quantities of these their seuerall portions.

 [Sidenote: Kent Henghist.]
 The first of these kingdoms therefore was begunne in Kent by Henghist
 in the 456. of Christ, and thereof called the kingdome of Kent or
 Cantwarland, and as the limits thereof extended it selfe no farther
 than the said countie (the cheefe citie whereof was Dorobernia or
 Cantwarbyry now Canturburie) so it indured well neere by the space of
 400. yeares, before it was made an earledome or Heretochie, and vnited
 by Inas vnto that of the West Saxons, Athelstane his sonne, being the
 first Earle or Heretoch of the same. Maister Lambert in his historie
 of Kent dooth gather, by verie probable coniectures, that this part of
 the Iland was first inhabited by Samothes, and afterward by Albion.
 But howsoeuer that case standeth, sure it is that it hath been the
 onelie doore, whereby the Romans and Saxons made their entrie vnto the
 conquest of the region, but first of all Caesar, who entred into this
 Iland vpon the eighteenth Cal. or 14. of September, which was foure
 daies before the full of the moone, as he himselfe confesseth, and
 then fell out about the 17. or 18. of that moneth, twelue daies before
 the equinoctiall (apparant) so that he did not tarrie at that time
 aboue eight or ten daies in Britaine. And as this platforme cannot be
 denied for his entrance, so the said region and east part of Kent, was
 the onelie place by which the knowledge of Christ was first brought
 ouer vnto vs, whereby we became partakers of saluation, and from the
 darkenesse of mistie errour, true conuerts vnto the light and bright
 beames of the shining truth, to our eternall benefit and euerlasting
 comforts.

 [Sidenote: Southsax.]
 [Sidenote: Ella.]
 The second kingdome conteined onelie Sussex, and a part of (or as some
 saie all) Surrie, which Ella the Saxon first held: who also erected
 his cheefe palace at Chichester, when he had destroied Andredswald in
 the 492. of Christ. And after it had continued by the space of 232.
 years, it ceased, being the verie least kingdome of all the rest,
 which were founded in this Ile after the comming of the Saxons (for to
 saie truth, it conteined little aboue 7000. families) & within a while
 after the erection of the kingdome of the Gewisses or Westsaxons,
 notwithstanding that before the kings of Sussex pretended and made
 claime to all that which laie west of Kent, and south of the Thames,
 vnto the point of Corinwall, as I haue often read.

 [Sidenote: Eastsax.]
 [Sidenote: Erkenwiin.]
 The third regiment was of the East Saxons, or Tribonantes. This
 kingdome began vnder Erkenwijn, whose cheefe seat was in London (or
 rather Colchester) and conteined whole Essex, Middlesex, and part of
 Herfordshire. It indured also much about the pricke of 303. yeares,
 and was diuided from that of the East Angles onlie by the riuer
 Stoure, as Houeden and others doo report, & so it continueth separated
 from Suffolke euen vnto our times, although the said riuer be now
 growne verie small, and not of such greatnesse as it hath beene in
 times past, by reason that our countriemen make small accompt of
 riuers, thinking carriage made by horsse and cart to be the lesse
 chargeable waie. But herin how far they are deceiued, I will
 else-where make manifest declaration.

 [Sidenote: Westsax.]
 The fourth kingdome was of the West Saxons, and so called, bicause it
 laie in the west part of the realme, as that of Essex did in the east,
 [Sidenote: Cerdiic.]
 and of Sussex in the south. It began in the yeare of Grace 519. vnder
 Cerdijc, and indured vntill the comming of the Normans, including at
 the last all Wiltshire, Barkeshire, Dorset, Southampton,
 Somersetshire, Glocestershire, some part of Deuonshire (which the
 Britons occupied not) Cornewall, and the rest of Surrie, as the best
 authors doo set downe. At the first it conteined onelie Wiltshire,
 Dorcetshire, and Barkeshire, but yer long the princes thereof
 conquered whatsoeuer the kings of Sussex and the Britons held vnto the
 point of Cornewall, and then became first Dorchester (vntill the time
 of Kinigils) then Winchester the cheefe citie of that kingdome. For
 when Birinus the moonke came into England, the said Kinigils gaue him
 Dorchester, and all the land within seauen miles about, toward the
 maintenance of his cathedrall sea, by meanes whereof he himselfe
 remooued his palace to Winchester.

 [Sidenote: Brennicia, alias Northumberland.]
 The fift kingdome began vnder Ida, in the 548. of Christ, and was
 called Northumberland, bicause it laie by north of the riuer Humber.
 [Sidenote: Ida.]
 And from the comming of Henghist to this Ida, it was onlie gouerned by
 earls or Heretoches as an Heretochy, till the said Ida conuerted it
 into a kingdome. It conteined all that region which (as it should
 seeme) was in time past either wholie apperteining to the Brigants, or
 whereof the said Brigants did possesse the greater part. The cheefe
 citie of the same in like maner was Yorke, as Beda, Capgraue, Leyland,
 and others doo set downe, who ad thereto that it extended from the
 Humber vnto the Scotish sea, vntill the slaughter of Egfride of the
 Northumbers, after which time the Picts gat hold of all, betweene the
 Forth and the Twede, which afterward descending to the Scots by meanes
 of the vtter destruction of the Picts, hath not beene sithens vnited
 to the crowne of England, nor in possession of the meere English, as
 before time it had beene. Such was the crueltie of these Picts also in
 their recouerie of the same, that at a certeine houre they made a
 Sicilien euensong, and slew euerie English man, woman and child, that
 they could laie hold vpon within the aforesaid region, but some
 escaped narrowlie, and saued themselues by flight.

 [Sidenote: Deira.]
 Afterward in the yeare of Grace 560. it was parted in twaine, vnder
 Adda, that yeelded vp all his portion, which lay betweene Humber and
 [Sidenote: Ella.]
 the Tine vnto his brother Ella (according to their fathers
 appointment) who called it Deira, or Southumberland, but reteining the
 rest still vnto his owne vse, he diminished not his title, but wrote
 himselfe as before king of all Northumberland. Howbeit after 91.
 yeares, it was revnited againe, and so continued vntill Alfred annexed
 the whole to his kingdome, in the 331. after Ida, or 878. of the birth
 of Jesus Christ our Sauiour.

 [Sidenote: Eastangles Offa, a quo Offlingae.]
 The seauenth kingdome, called of the East-Angles, began at Norwich in
 the 561. after Christ, vnder Offa, of whom the people of that region
 were long time called Offlings. This included all Norfolke, Suffolke,
 Cambridgeshire, and Elie, and continuing 228. yeares, it flourished
 onelie 35. yeares in perfect estate of liberte, the rest being
 consumed vnder the tribut and vassallage of the Mercians, who had the
 souereigntie thereof, and held it with great honour, till the Danes
 gat hold of it, who spoiled it verie sore, so that it became more
 miserable than any of the other, and so remained till the kings of the
 West-saxons vnited it to their crownes. Some saie that Grantcester,
 but now Cambridge (a towne erected out of hir ruines) was the cheefe
 citie of this kingdome, and not Norwich. Wherein I may well shew the
 discord of writers, but I cannot resolue the scruple. Some take this
 region also to be all one with that of the Icenes, but as yet for my
 part I cannot yeeld to their assertions, I meane it of Leland
 himselfe, whose helpe I vse cheefelie in these collections, albeit in
 this behalfe I am not resolued that he doth iudge aright.

 The 8. & last was that of Mertia, which indured 291. yeares, and for
 greatnesse exceeded all the rest. It tooke the name either of Mearc
 the Saxon word, bicause it was march to the rest (and trulie, the
 limits of most of the other kingdomes abutted vpon the same) or else
 [Sidenote: Mertia.]
 for that the lawes of Martia the Queene were first vsed in that part
 of the Iland. But as this later is but a meere coniecture of some, so
 [Sidenote: Creodda.]
 the said kingdome began vnder Creodda, in the 585. of Christ, &
 indured well neere 300. yeares before it was vnited to that of the
 West-saxons by Alfred, then reigning in this Ile. Before him the Danes
 had gotten hold thereof, and placed one Ceolulph an idiot in the same;
 but as he was soone reiected for his follie, so it was not long after
 yer the said Alfred (I saie) annexed it to his kingdome by his
 [Sidenote: Limits of Mertia.]
 manhood. The limits of the Mertian dominions included Lincolne,
 Northampton, Chester, Darbie, Nottingham, Stafford, Huntington,
 Rutland, Oxford, Buckingham, Worcester, Bedford shires, and the
 greatest part of Shropshire (which the Welsh occupied not) Lancaster,
 Glocester, Hereford (alias Hurchford) Warwijc and Hertford shires: the
 rest of whose territories were holden by such princes of other
 kingdomes through force as bordered vpon the same. Moreouer, this
 kingdome was at one time diuided into south and north Mertia, whereof
 this laie beyond and the other on this side of the Trent, which later
 also Oswald of Northumberland did giue to Weada the sonne of Penda for
 kindred sake, though he not long inioied it. This also is worthie to
 be noted, that in these eight kingdomes of the Saxons, there were
 twelue princes reputed in the popish Catalog for saints or martyrs, of
 which Alcimund, Edwine, Oswald, Oswijn and Aldwold reigned in
 Northumberland; Sigebert, Ethelbert, Edmond, and another Sigebert
 among the Estangels; Kenelme and Wistan in Mertia; and Saint Edward
 the confessor, ouer all; but how worthilie, I referre me to the
 iudgement of the learned. Thus much haue I thought good to leaue in
 memorie of the aforesaid kingdomes: and now will I speake somewhat of
 the diuision of this Iland also into prouinces, as the Romanes seuered
 it whiles they remained in these parts. Which being done, I hope that
 I haue discharged whatsoeuer is promised in the title of this chapter.

 The Romans therefore hauing obteined the possession of this Iland,
 diuided the same at the last into fiue prouinces, as Vibius Sequester
 [Sidenote: Britannia prima.]
 saith. The first whereof was named Britannia prima, and conteined the
 east part of England (as some doo gather) from the Trent vnto the
 [Sidenote: Valentia.]
 Twede. The second was called Valentia or Valentiana, and included the
 west side, as they note it, from Lirpoole vnto Cokermouth. The third
 [Sidenote: Britannia secunda.]
 hight Britannia secunda, and was that portion of the Ile which laie
 [Sidenote: Flauia Caesariensis.]
 southwards, betweene the Trent and the Thames. The fourth was surnamed
 Flauia Caesariensis, and conteined all the countrie which remained
 betweene Douer and the Sauerne, I meane by south of the Thames, and
 wherevnto (in like sort) Cornewall and Wales were orderlie assigned.
 [Sidenote: Maxima Caesariensis.]
 The fift and last part was then named Maxima Caesariensis, now
 Scotland, the most barren of all the rest, and yet not vnsought out of
 the greedie Romanes, bicause of the great plentie of fish and foule,
 fine alabaster and hard marble that are ingendred and to be had in the
 same, for furniture of houshold and curious building, wherein they
 much delited. More hereof in Sextus Rufus, who liued in the daies of
 Valentine, and wrate Notitiam prouinciarum now extant to be read.

 OF THE ANCIENT RELIGION VSED IN ALBION.

 CAP. IX.


 It is not to be doubted, but at the first, and so long as the
 posteritie of Iaphet onelie reigned in this Iland, that the true
 [Sidenote: Samothes.]
 knowledge and forme of religion brought in by Samothes, and published
 with his lawes in the second of his arriuall, was exercised among the
 Britans. And although peraduenture in proces of time, either through
 curiositie, or negligence (the onelie corruptors of true pietie and
 godlinesse) it might a little decaie, yet when it was at the woorst,
 it farre exceeded the best of that which afterward came in with Albion
 and his Chemminites, as may be gathered by view of the superstitious
 rites, which Cham and his successours did plant in other countries,
 yet to be found in authors.

 What other learning Magus the sonne of Samothes taught after his
 fathers death, when he also came to the kingdome, beside this which
 concerned the true honoring of God, I cannot easilie say, but that it
 should be naturall philosophie, and astrologie (whereby his disciples
 gathered a kind of foreknowledge of things to come) the verie vse of
 the word Magus (or Magusaeus) among the Persians dooth yeeld no
 vncerteine testimonie.

 [Sidenote: Sarron.]
 In like maner, it should seeme that Sarron sonne vnto the said Magus,
 diligentlie followed the steps of his father, and thereto beside his
 owne practise of teaching, opened schooles of learning in sundrie
 places, both among the Celts and Britans, whereby such as were his
 auditors, grew to be called Sarronides, notwithstanding, that as well
 the Sarronides as the Magi, and Druiydes, were generallie called
 [Sidenote: Samothei.]
 [Sidenote: Semnothei.]
 Samothei, or Semnothei, of Samothes still among the Grecians, as
 Aristotle in his De magia dooth confesse; and furthermore calling them
 Galles, he addeth therevnto, that they first brought the knowledge of
 letters and good learning vnto the Greekes.

 [Sidenote: Druiyus.]
 Druiyus the son of Sarron (as a scholer of his fathers owne teaching)
 seemed to be exquisit in all things, that perteined vnto the diuine
 and humane knowledge: and therefore I may safelie pronounce, that he
 excelled not onlie in the skill of philosophie and the quadriuials,
 but also in the true Theologie, whereby the right seruice of God was
 kept and preserued in puritie. He wrote moreouer sundrie precepts and
 rules of religious doctrine, which among the Celts were reserued verie
 religiouslie, and had in great estimation of such as sought vnto them.

 [Sidenote: Corruptors of religion.]
 How and in what order this prince left the state of religion, I meane
 touching publike orders in administration of particular rites and
 ceremonies, as yet I doo not read: howbeit this is most certeine, that
 after he died, the puritie of his doctrine began somewhat to decaie.
 For such is mans nature, that it will not suffer any good thing long
 to remaine as it is left, but (either by addition or subtraction of
 this or that, to or from the same) so to chop and change withall from
 time to time, that in the end there is nothing of more difficultie,
 for such as doo come after them, than to find out the puritie of the
 originall, and restore the same againe vnto the former perfection.

 [Sidenote: _Caesar._]
 In the beginning this Druiyus did preach vnto his hearers, that the
 soule of man is immortall, that God is omnipotent, mercifull as a
 father in shewing fauor vnto the godlie, and iust as an vpright iudge
 in punishing the wicked; that the secrets of mans hart are not
 vnknowne, and onelie knowne to him; and that as the world and all that
 is therein had their beginning by him, at his owne will, so shall all
 things likewise haue an end, when he shall see his time. He taught
 [Sidenote: _Strabo. li. 4._]
 [Sidenote: _Socion. lib. success._]
 them also with more facilitie, how to obserue the courses of the
 heauens and motions of the planets by arithmeticall industrie, to find
 [Sidenote: _Cicero diuinat._ I.]
 out the true quantities of the celestiall bodies by geometricall
 demonstration, and thereto the compasse of the earth, and hidden
 natures of things contained in the same by philosophicall
 contemplation. But alas, this integritie continued not long among his
 successors, for vnto the immortalitie of the soule, they added, that
 after death it went into another bodie, (of which translation Ouid
 saith;

   Morte carent animae, semperque priore relicta
   Sede, nouis domibus viuunt habitantque receptae.)

 The second or succedent, being alwaies either more noble, or more vile
 than the former, as the partie deserued by his merits, whilest he
 liued here vpon earth. And therefore it is said by Plato and other,
 that Orpheus after his death had his soule thrust into the bodie of a
 swanne, that of Agamemnon conueied into an egle, of Aiax into a lion,
 of Atlas into a certeine wrestler, of Thersites into an ape, of
 Deiphobus into Pythagoras, and Empedocles dieng a child, after sundrie
 changes into a man, whereof he himselfe saith;

   Ipse ego namq; fui puer olim, deinde puella,
   Arbustum & volucris, mutus quoq; in aequore piscis.

 [Sidenote: _Plinius, lib. 16. cap. ultimo._]
 For said they (of whom Pythagoras also had, and taught this errour) if
 the soule apperteined at the first to a king, and he in this estate
 did not leade his life worthie his calling, it should after his
 [Sidenote: Metempsuchosis.]
 decease be shut vp in the bodie of a slaue, begger, cocke, owle, dog,
 ape, horsse, asse, worme, or monster, there to remaine as in a place
 of purgation and punishment, for a certeine period of time. Beside
 this, it should peraduenture susteine often translation from one bodie
 vnto another, according to the quantitie and qualitie of his dooings
 here on earth, till it should finallie be purified, and restored
 againe to an other humane bodie, wherein if it behaued it selfe more
 orderlie than at the first: after the next death, it should be
 preferred, either to the bodie of a king againe, or other great
 estate. And thus they made a perpetuall circulation or reuolution of
 our soules, much like vnto the continuall motion of the heauens, which
 neuer stand still, nor long yeeld one representation and figure. For
 this cause also, as Diodorus saith, they vsed to cast certeine letters
 into the fire, wherein the dead were burned, to be deliuered vnto
 their deceased freends, whereby they might vnderstand of the estate of
 such as trauelled here on earth in their purgations (as the Moscouits
 doo write vnto S. Nicholas to be a speach-man for him that is buried,
 in whose hand they bind a letter, and send him with a new paire of
 shooes on his feet into the graue) and to the end that after their
 next death they should deale with them accordinglie, and as their
 merits required. They brought in also the worshipping of manie gods,
 and their seuerall euen to this daie sacrifices: they honoured
 [Sidenote: Oke honored whereon mistle did grow,
 and so doo our sorcerers thinking some spirits
 to deale about ye same, for hidden treasure.]
 likewise the oke, whereon the mistle groweth, and dailie deuised
 infinit other toies (for errour is neuer assured of hir owne dooings)
 whereof neither Samothes, nor Sarron, Magus, nor Druiyus did leaue
 them anie prescription.

 These things are partlie touched by Cicero, Strabo, Plinie, Sotion,
 Laertius, Theophrast, Aristotle, and partlie also by Caesar, Mela, Val.
 Max. lib. 2. and other authors of later time, who for the most part
 doo confesse, that the cheefe schoole of the Druiydes was holden here
 in Britaine, where that religion (saith Plinie) was so hotlie
 professed and followed, "Vt dedisse Persis videri possit," lib. 30.
 cap. 1. and whither the Druiydes also themselues, that dwelt among the
 Galles, would often resort to come by the more skill, and sure
 vnderstanding of the mysteries of that doctrine. And as the Galles
 receiued their religion from the Britons, so we likewise had from them
 [Sidenote: Logike and Rhetorike out of Gallia.]
 some vse of Logike & Rhetorike, such as it was which our lawiers
 practised in their plees and common causes. For although the Greeks
 were not vnknowne vnto vs, nor we to them, euen from the verie comming
 of Brute, yet by reason of distance betweene our countries, we had no
 great familiaritie and common accesse one vnto another, till the time
 of Gurguntius, after whose entrance manie of that nation trauelled
 hither in more securitie, as diuers of our countriemen did vnto them
 without all danger, to be offered vp in sacrifice to their gods. That
 we had the maner of our plees also out of France, Iuuenal is a
 witnesse, who saith;

   Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Britannos.

 Howbeit as they taught vs Logike and Rhetorike, so we had also some
 Sophistrie from them; but in the worst sense: for from France is all
 kind of forgerie, corruption of maners, and craftie behauiour not so
 soone as often transported into England. And albeit the Druiydes were
 thus honored and of so great authoritie in Britaine, yet were there
 great numbers of them also in the Iles of Wight, Anglesey, and the
 Orchades, in which they held open schooles of their profession, aloofe
 as it were from the resort of people, wherein they studied and learned
 their songs by heart. Howbeit the cheefe college of all I say,
 remained still in Albion, whither the Druiydes of other nations also
 (beside the Galles) would of custome repaire, when soeuer anie
 controuersie among them in matters of religion did happen to be
 mooued. At such times also the rest were called out of the former
 Ilands, whereby it appeareth that in such cases they had their synods
 and publike meetings, and therevnto it grew finallie into custome, and
 after that a prouerbe, euen in variances falling out among the
 princes, great men, and common sorts of people liuing in these weast
 parts of Europe, to yeeld to be tried by Britaine and hir three
 Ilands, bicause they honoured hir preests (the Druiydes) as the
 Athenians did their Areopagites.

 [Sidenote: Estimation of the Druiydes or Druiysh preests.]
 Furthermore, in Britaine, and among the Galles, and to say the truth,
 generallie in all places where the Druiysh religion was frequented,
 such was the estimation of the preests of this profession, that there
 was little or nothing doone without their skilfull aduise, no not in
 ciuil causes, perteining to the regiment of the common-wealth and
 countrie. They had the charge also of all sacrifices, publike and
 priuate, they interpreted oracles, preached of religion, and were
 neuer without great numbers of yoong men that heard them with
 diligence, as they taught from time to time.

 [Sidenote: Immunitie of the cleargie greater vnder idolatrie
 than vnder the gospell.]
 Touching their persons also they were exempt from all temporall
 seruices, impositions, tributes, and exercises of the wars: which
 immunitie caused the greater companies of scholers to flocke vnto them
 from all places, & to learne their trades. Of these likewise, some
 remained with them seuen, eight, ten, or twelue years, still learning
 the secrets of those unwritten mysteries by heart, which were to be
 had amongst them, and commonlie pronounced in verse. And this policie,
 as I take it, they vsed onelie to preserue their religion from
 contempt, whereinto it might easilie haue fallen, if any books thereof
 had happened into the hands of the common sort. It helped also not a
 little in the exercise of their memories, wherevnto bookes are vtter
 enimies, insomuch as he that was skilfull in the Druiysh religion,
 would not let readilie to rehearse manie hundreds of verses togither,
 and not to faile in one tittle, in the whole processe of this his
 laborious repetition. But as they dealt in this order for matters of
 their religion, so in ciuill affairs, historicall treatises, and
 setting downe of lawes, they vsed like order and letters almost with
 the Grecians. Whereby it is easie to be seene, that they reteined this
 kind of writing from Druiyus (the originall founder of their religion)
 and that this Iland hath not beene void of letters and learned men,
 euen sith it was first inhabited. I would ad some thing in particular
 also of their apparell, but sith the dealing withall is nothing
 profitable to the reader, I passe it ouer, signifieng neuerthelesse,
 that it was distinguished by sundrie deuises from that of the common
 sort, and of such estimation among the people, that whosoeuer ware the
 Druiysh weed, might walke where he would without any harme or
 annoiance. This honour was giuen also vnto the preests in Rome,
 insomuch that when Volusius was exiled by the Triumuirate, and saw
 himselfe in such danger, as that he could not escape the hardest, he
 gat the weed of a preest upon his backe, and begged his almes therein,
 euen in the high waies as he trauelled, and so escaped the danger and
 the furie of his aduersaries: but to proceed with other things.

 [Sidenote: Bardus.]
 After the death of Druiyus, Bardus his sonne, and fift king of the
 Celts, succeeded not onelie ouer the said kingdome, but also in his
 fathers vertues, whereby it is verie likelie, that the winding and
 wrapping vp of the said religion, after the afore remembred sort into
 verse, was first deuised by him, for he was an excellent poet, and no
 lesse indued with a singular skill in the practise and speculation of
 musicke, of which two many suppose him to be the verie author and
 [Sidenote: _Gen. 4. 21._]
 beginner, although vniustlie, sith both poetrie and song were in vse
 before the flood, as was also the harpe and pipe, which Iubal
 inuented, and could neuer be performed without great skill in musicke.
 But to proceed, as the cheefe estimation of the Druiydes remained in
 the end among the Britons onelie, for their knowledge in religion, so
 did the fame of the Bardes (which were so called of this Bardus for
 their excellent skill in musicke, poetrie, and the heroicall kind of
 song, which at the first conteined onelie the high mysteries and
 secret points of their religion. There was little difference also
 [Sidenote: The Bards degenerate.]
 betweene them and the Druiydes, till they so farre degenerated from
 their first institution, that they became to be minstrels at feasts,
 droonken meetings, and abhominable sacrifices of the idols: where they
 sang most commonlie no diuinitie as before, but the puissant acts of
 valiant princes, and fabulous narrations of the adulteries of the
 gods. Certes in my time this fond vsage, and thereto the verie name of
 the Bardes, are not yet extinguished among the Britons of Wales, where
 they call their poets and musicians Barthes, as they doo also in
 Ireland: which Sulpitius also writing to Lucane remembreth, where he
 saith that the word Bardus is meere Celtike, and signifieth a singer.
 Howbeit the Romans iudging all nations beside themselues to be but
 rude and barbarous, and thereto misliking vtterlie the rough musicke
 of the Bardes, entred so farre into the contemptuous mockage of their
 melodie, that they ascribed the word Bardus vnto their fooles and
 idiots, whereas contrariwise the Scythians and such as dwell within
 the northweast part of Europe, did vse the same word in verie
 honourable maner, calling their best poets and heroicall singers,
 Singebardos; their couragious singers and capiteins that delited in
 musicke, Albardos, Dagobardos, Rodtbardos, & one lame musician Lambard
 aboue all other, of whose skilfull ditties Germanie is not
 vnfurnished, as I heare vnto this daie. In Quizqueia or new Spaine, an
 Iland of the Indies, they call such men Boitios, their rimes Arcitos,
 and in steed of harps they sing vnto timbrels made of shels such
 sonnets and ditties as either perteine vnto religion, prophane loue,
 commendation of ancestrie, and inflammation of the mind vnto Mars,
 whereby there appeareth to be small difference betweene their Boitios
 and our Bardes. Finallie of our sort, Lucane in his first booke
 writeth thus, among other like saiengs well toward the latter end;

 [Sidenote: _Lucani. li._ 1.]

   Vos quoq; qui fortes animas, belloq; peremptas
   Laudibus in longum vates dimittitis aeuum,
   Plurima securi fudistis carmina Bardi.
   Et vos barbaricos ritus, moremque sinistrum
   Sacrorum Druiydae, positis recepistis ab armis.
   Solis nosse Deos, & c[oe]li numina vobis,
   Aut solis nescire datum: nemora alta remotis
   Incolitis lucis. Vobis authoribus, vmbrae
   Non tacitas Erebi sedes, Ditisque profundi
   Pallida regna petunt, regit idem spiritus artus
   Orbe alio. Longae canitis si cognita, vitae
   Mors media est, certe populi, quos despicit arctos,
   F[oe]lices errore suo, quos ille timorum
   Maximus haud vrget leti metus: inde ruendi
   In ferrum mens prona viris, animaeque capaces
   Mortis: & ignauum est rediturae parcere vitae.

 Thus we see as in a glasse the state of religion, for a time, after
 the first inhabitation of this Iland: but how long it continued in
 such soundnesse, as the originall authors left it, in good sooth I
 cannot say, yet this is most certeine, that after a time, when Albion
 arriued here, the religion earst imbraced fell into great decaie. For
 whereas Iaphet & Samothes with their children taught nothing else than
 such doctrine as they had learned of Noah: Cham the great grandfather
 of this our Albion, and his disciples vtterlie renouncing to follow
 their steps, gaue their minds wholie to seduce and lead their hearers
 headlong vnto all error. Whereby his posteritie not onelie corrupted
 this our Iland, with most filthie trades and practises; but also all
 mankind, generallie where they became, with vicious life, and most
 [Sidenote: What doctrine Cham and his disciples taught.]
 vngodlie conuersation. For from Cham and his successours proceeded at
 the first all sorcerie, witchcraft, and the execution of vnlawful
 lust, without respect of sex, age, consanguinitie, or kind: as
 branches from an odious and abhominable root, or streames deriued from
 a most filthie and horrible stinking puddle. Howbeit, &
 notwithstanding all these his manifold lewdnesses, such was the follie
 of his AEgyptians (where he first reigned and taught) that whilest he
 liued they alone had him in great estimation (whereas other nations
 contemned and abhorred him for his wickednesse, calling him
 [Sidenote: Chemesenua.]
 Chemesenua, that is, the impudent, infamous and wicked Cham) and not
 [Sidenote: Chem Min.]
 [Sidenote: Cham made a god.]
 onelie builded a citie vnto him which they called Chem Min, but also
 after his death reputed him for a god, calling the highest of the
 seuen planets after his name, as they did the next beneath it after
 Osyris his sonne, whom they likewise honored vnder the name of
 Iupiter.

 [Sidenote: Translation of mortall men into heauen how it began.]
Certes it was a custome begonne in AEgypt of old time, and generallie in
vse almost in euerie place in processe of time (when any of their
famous worthie princes died) to ascribe some forme or other of the
stars vnto his person, to the end his name might neuer weare out of
memorie. And this they called their translation in heauen, so that he
which had any starres or forme of starres dedicated vnto him, was
properlie said to haue a seat among the gods. A toie much like to the
catalog of Romish saints, (although the one was written in the
celestiall or immateriall orbes, the other in sheeps skins, and verie
brickle paper) but yet so esteemed, that euerie prince would oft hazard
and attempt the vttermost aduentures, thereby to win such fame in his
life, that after his death he might by merit haue such place in heauen,
among the shining starres. Howbeit, euerie of those that were called
gods, could not obteine that benefit, for then should there not haue
beene stars enow in heauen to haue serued all their turnes, wherfore
another place was in time imagined, where they reigned that were of a
 second calling, as the Semones who were gods by grace and fauour of
 [Sidenote: _Cyril, aduersus Iul. lib. 6. sect. 8._]
 the people. "Semones dici voluerunt (saith Fulgentius In vocibus
 antiquis) quos c[oe]lo nec dignos ascriberent, ob meriti paupertatem;
 sicut Priapus Hyppo. Vortumnus, &c. nec terrenos eos deputare vellent
 per gratiae venerationem," as also a third place that is to say an
 earth, where those gods dwelled which were noble men, officers, good
 gouernours and lawgiuers to the people, and yet not thought worthie to
 be of the second or first companie, which was a iollie diuision.

 Thus we see in generall maner, how idolatrie, honoring of the starres,
 and brood of inferiour gods were hatched at the first, which follies
 in processe of time came also into Britaine, as did the names of
 Saturne & Iupiter, &c: as shall appeare hereafter. And here sith I
 haue alreadie somewhat digressed from my matter, I will go yet a
 little farder, and shew foorth the originall vse of the word Saturne,
 Iupiter, Hercules, &c: whereby your Honor shall see a little more into
 the errours of the Gentils, and not onelie that, but one point also
 [Sidenote: Which were Saturni, Ioues, Iunones, and Hercules.]
 properlie called of the root of all the confusion that is to be found
 among the ancient histories. Certes it was vsed for a few yeeres after
 the partition of the earth (which was made by Noah, in the 133. yeere
 after the floud) that the beginners of such kingdoms as were then
 erected should be called Saturni, whereby it came to passe that
 Nimbrote was the Saturne of Babylon: Cham of AEgypt: and so foorth
 other of sundrie other countries. Their eldest sonnes also that
 succeeded them, were called Ioues; and their nephewes or sonnes
 sonnes, which reigned in the third place Hercules, by which meanes it
 followed that euerie kingdome had a Saturne, Iupiter and Hercules of
 hir owne, and not from anie other.

 In like sort they had such another order among their daughters, whom
 they married as yet commonlie vnto their brethren (God himselfe
 permitting the same vnto them for a time) as before the floud, to the
 end the earth might be thoroughlie replenished, and the sooner
 furnished with inhabitants in euerie part therof. The sister therefore
 [Sidenote: Isis, Io and Iuno all one.]
 and wife of euerie Saturne was called Rhea, but of Iupiter, Iuno,
 Isis, or Io. Beyond these also there was no latter Harold that would
 indeuour to deriue the petigree of any prince, or potentate, but
 supposed his dutie to be sufficientlie performed, when he had brought
 it orderlie vnto some Saturne or other, wherat he might cease, and
 shut vp all his trauell. They had likewise this opinion grounded
 amongst them, that heauen & earth were onlie parents vnto Saturne and
 [Sidenote: C[oe]lum or C[oe]lus.]
 [Sidenote: Ogyges.]
 [Sidenote: Sol.]
 [Sidenote: Pater deorum.]
 Rhea, not knowing out of doubt, what they themselues did meane, sith
 these denominations, Heauen, Ogyges, the Sunne, Pater Deorum, and such
 [Sidenote: * Tydea.]
 [Sidenote: Vesta.]
 [Sidenote: Terra.]
 [Sidenote: Luna.]
 [Sidenote: Aretia.]
 [Sidenote: Deorum mater.]
 like, were onelie ascribed vnto Noah: as [*]Terra, (the Earth) Vesta,
 Aretia, the Moone, Mater deorum, and other the like were vnto Tydea
 his wife. So that hereby we see, how Saturne is reputed in euerie
 nation for their oldest god, or first prince, Iupiter for the next,
 and Hercules for the third. And therefore sith these names were
 dispersed in the beginning ouer all, it is no maruell that there is
 such confusion in ancient histories, and the dooings of one of them so
 mixed with those of another, that it is now impossible to distinguish
 them in sunder. This haue I spoken, to the end that all men may see
 what gods the Pagans honored, & thereby what religion the posteritie
 of Cham did bring ouer into Britaine. For vntill their comming, it is
 not likelie that anie grosse idolatrie or superstition did enter in
 among vs, as deifieng of mortall men, honoring of the starres, and
 erection of huge images, beside sorcerie, witchcraft, and such like,
 whereof the Chemminites are worthilie called the autors. Neither were
 [Sidenote: Fr[=o] whence Brute did learne his religion.]
 these errors anie thing amended, by the comming in of Brute, who no
 doubt added such deuises vnto the same, as he and his companie had
 learned before in Graecia, from whence also he brought Helenus the
 sonne of Priamus, (a man of exceeding age) & made him his preest and
 bishop thorough out the new conquest, that he had atchieued in
 Britaine.

 After Brute, idolatrie and superstition still increased more and more
 among vs, insomuch that beside the Druiysh and Bardike ceremonies, and
 those also that came in with Albion and Brute himselfe: our
 countriemen either brought hither from abroad, or dailie inuented at
 home new religion and rites, whereby it came to passe that in the
 [Sidenote: Dis or Samothes made a god.]
 stead of the onelie and immortall God (of whom Samothes and his
 posteritie did preach in times past) now they honored the said
 Samothes himselfe vnder the name of Dis and Saturne: also Iupiter,
 Mars, Minerua, Mercurie, Apollo, Diana; and finallie Hercules, vnto
 whome they dedicated the gates and porches of their temples, entrances
 into their regions, cities, townes and houses, with their limits and
 bounds (as the papists did the gates of their cities and ports vnto
 Botulph & Giles) bicause fortitude and wisedome are the cheefe
 vpholders and bearers vp of common-wealths and kingdoms, both which
 they ascribed to Hercules (forgetting God) and diuers other idols
 [Sidenote: _Mela. Diodorus, Strab. 4. Plin. Caesar. 5._]
 whose names I now remember not. In lieu moreouer of sheepe and oxen,
 they offred mankind also vnto some of them, killing their offendors,
 prisoners, and oft such strangers as came from farre vnto them, by
 shutting vp great numbers of them togither in huge images made of
 wicker, reed, haie, or other light matter: and then setting all on
 fire togither, they not onelie consumed the miserable creatures to
 ashes (sometimes adding other beasts vnto them) but also reputed it to
 be the most acceptable sacrifice that could be made vnto their idols.
 From whence they had this horrible custome, trulie I cannot tell, but
 that it was common to most nations, not onlie to consume their
 strangers, captiues, &c; but also their owne children with fire, in
 such maner of sacrifice: beside the text of the Bible, the prophane
 histories doo generallie leaue it euident, as a thing either of
 custome or of particular necessitie, of which later Virgil saith;

   Sanguine placastis ventos & virgine caesa, &c.

 As Silius dooth of the first, where he telleth of the vsuall maner of
 the Carthaginenses, saieng after this maner;

   Vrna reducebat miserandos annua casus, &c.

 But to proceed with our owne gods and idols, more pertinent to my
 purpose than the rehersall of forreine demeanours: I find that huge
 temples in like sort were builded vnto them, so that in the time of
 Lucius, when the light of saluation began stronglie to shine in
 [Sidenote: _Ptol. Lucensis._]
 Britaine, thorough the preaching of the gospell, the christians
 discouered 25. Flamines or idol-churches beside three Archflamines,
 whose preests were then as our Archbishops are now, in that they had
 superior charge of all the rest, the other being reputed as
 inferiours, and subiect to their iurisdiction in cases of religion,
 and superstitious ceremonies.

 [Sidenote: Monstrous proportions of idols.]
 Of the quantities of their idols I speake not, sith it is inough to
 saie, that they were monstrous, and that each nation contended which
 should honour the greater blocks, and yet all pretending to haue the
 iust heigth of the god or goddesse whom they did represent. Apollo
 Capitolinus that stood at Rome, was thirtie cubits high at the least;
 Tarentinus Iupiter of 40.; the idoll of the sonne in the Rhodes, of 70
 (whose toe few men could fadam;) Tuscanus Apollo that stood in the
 librarie of the temple of Augustus, of 50. foot; another made vnder
 Nero of 110. foot; but one in France passed all, which Zenoduris made
 vnto Mercurie at Aruernum in ten years space, of 400. foot. Wherby it
 appeareth, that as they were void of moderation in number of gods, so
 without measure were they also in their proportions, and happie was he
 which might haue the greatest idoll, and lay most cost thereon.

 Hitherto yee haue heard of the time, wherein idolatrie reigned and
 blinded the harts of such as dwelled in this Iland. Now let vs see the
 successe of the gospell, after the death and passion of Iesus Christ
 our sauiour. And euen here would I begin with an allegation of
 [Sidenote: _Theodoret._]
 Theodoret, wherevpon some repose great assurance (conceiuing yet more
 [Sidenote: _Sophronius._]
 hope therein by the words of Sophronius) that Paule the Apostle should
 preach the word of saluation here, after his deliuerie out of
 captiuitie, which fell as I doo read in the 57. of Christ. But sith I
 cannot verifie the same by the words of Theodoret, to be spoken more
 of Paule than Peter, or the rest, I will passe ouer this coniecture
 (so far as it is grounded vpon Theodoret) and deale with other
 authorities, whereof we haue more certeintie. First of all therfore
 let vs see what Fortunatus hath written of Pauls comming into
 Britaine, and afterward what is to be found of other by-writers in
 other points of more assurance. Certes for the presence of Paule I
 read thus much:

   Quid sacer ille simul Paulus tuba gentibus ampla,
   Per mare per terras Christi praeconia fundens,
   Europam & Asiam, Lybiam, sale dogmata complens,
   Arctos, meridies, hic plenus vesper & ortus,
   Transit & Oceanum, vel qua facit insula portum,
   Quasq; Britannus habet terras atque vltima Thule, &c.

 [Sidenote: Iosephus.]
 That one Iosephus preached here in England, in the time of the
 Apostles, his sepulchre yet in Aualon, now called Glessenburg or
 Glastenburie, an epitaph affixed therevnto is proofe sufficient.
 Howbeit, sith these things are not of competent force to persuade all
 men, I will ad in few, what I haue read elsewhere of his arriuall
 here. First of all therefore you shall note that he came ouer into
 Britaine, about the 64. after Christ, when the persecution began vnder
 Nero, at which time Philip and diuers of the godlie being in France
 (whether he came with other christians, after they had sowed the word
 of God in Scythia, by the space of 9. yeares) seuered themselues in
 sunder, to make the better shift for their owne safegard, and yet not
 otherwise than by their flight, the gospell might haue due
 [Sidenote: _Philip. Freculphus. To. 2., lib. 2. cap. 4._]
 [Sidenote: _Nennius. Nicephorus lib. 2. cap. 40._]
 [Sidenote: _Isidorus lib. de vita & obit. dict. patrum._]
 [Sidenote: _W. Malmes. de antiq. Glasconici monast._]
 furtherance. Hereby then it came to passe, that the said Philip vpon
 good deliberation did send Iosephus ouer, and with him Simon Zelotes
 to preach vnto the Britons, and minister the sacraments there
 according to the rites of the churches of Asia and Greece, from whence
 they came not long before vnto the countrie of the Galles. Which was
 saith Malmesburie 103. before Faganus and Dinaw did set foorth the
 gospell amongst them. Of the c[=o]ming of Zelotes you may read more in
 the second booke of Niceph. Cal. where he writeth thereof in this
 maner: "Operaepretium etiam fuerit Simonem Cana Galileae ortum, qui
 propter flagrantem in magistrum suum ardorem, summamq; euangelicae rei
 per omnia curam Zelotes cognominatus est hic referre, accepit enim is
 c[oe]litus adueniente spiritu sancto, Aegyptium Cyrenem & Africam,
 deinde Mauritaniam & Lybiam omnem euangelium depraedicans percurrit,
 eandemque doctrinam etiam ad occidentalem Oceanum insulasque
 Britannicas perfert." And this is the effect in a little roome, of
 that which I haue read at large in sundrie writers, beside these two
 here alledged, although it may well be gathered that diuers Britains
 were conuerted to the faith, before this sixtie foure of Christ.
 Howbeit, whereas some write that they liued, and dwelled in Britaine,
 it cannot as yet take any absolute hold in my iudgement, but rather
 that they were baptised and remained, either in Rome, or else-where.
 [Sidenote: Claudia Rufina a British ladie.]
 And of this sort I suppose Claudia Rufina the wife of Pudens to be
 one, who was a British ladie indeed, and not onelie excellentlie seene
 in the Greeke and Latine toongs, but also with hir husband highlie
 [Sidenote: _1. Tim. 4._]
 commended by S. Paule, as one hauing had conuersation and conference
 with them at Rome, from whence he did write his second epistle vnto
 Timothie, as I read. Of this ladie moreouer Martial speaketh, in
 reioising that his poesies were read also in Britaine, and onelie by
 hir meanes, who vsed to cull out the finest & honestest of his
 epigrams and send them to hir freends for tokens, saieng after this
 maner, as himselfe dooth set it downe:

   Dicitur & nostros cantare Britannia versus.

 Furthermore making mention of hir and hir issue, he addeth these
 words:

 [Sidenote: _Li. 11. Epig. 54._]

   Claudia c[oe]ruleis cum sit Rufina Britannis
     Edita, cur Latiae pectora plebis habet?
   Quale decus formae? Romanam credere matres
     Italides possunt, Atthides esse suam.
   Dij bene, quod sancto peperit faecunda marito,
     Quot sperat, generos, quotque puella nurus.
   Sic placeat superis, vt coniuge gaudeat vno,
     Et semper natis gaudeat illa tribus.

 The names of hir three children were Prudentiana, Praxedes, both
 virgins, and Nouatus, who after the death of Pudens their father
 (which befell him in Cappadocia) dwelled with their mother in Vmbria,
 where they ceased not from time to time to minister vnto the saints.
 But to leaue this impertinent discourse, and proceed with my purpose.

 I find in the Chronicles of Burton (vnder the yeare of Grace 141. and
 time of Hadrian the emperour) that nine scholers or clerkes of Grantha
 or Granta (now Cambridge) were baptised in Britaine, and became
 preachers of the gospell there, but whether Taurinus bishop or elder
 ouer the congregation at Yorke (who as Vincentius saith, was executed
 [Sidenote: _Lib. 10. cap. 17._]
 [Sidenote: Taurinus.]
 about this time for his faith) were one of them or not, as yet I do
 not certeinlie find; but rather the contrarie, which is that he was no
 Britaine at all, but Episcopus Ebroicensis, for which such as perceiue
 not the easie corruption of the word, may soone write Eboracensis as
 certeinlie mine author out of whom I alledge this authoritie hath done
 before me. For Vincentius saith flat otherwise, and therefore the
 Chronologie if it speake of anie Taurinus bishop of Yorke is to be
 reformed in that behalfe. Diuers other also imbraced the religion of
 Christ verie zealouslie before these men. Howbeit, all this
 notwithstanding, the glad tidings of the gospell had neuer free and
 open passage here, vntill the time of Lucius, in which the verie
 enimies of the word became the apparent meanes (contrarie to their
 owne minds) to haue it set foorth amongst vs. For when Antoninus the
 emperour had giuen out a decree, that the Druiysh religion should
 euerie where be abolished, Lucius the king (whose surname is now
 perished) tooke aduise of his councell what was best to be doone, &
 wrote in this behalfe. And this did Lucius, bicause he knew it
 [*]impossible for man to liue long without any religion at all:
 [Sidenote: * This is contrarie to the common talke of our
 Atheists who say, Let vs liue here in wealth, credit and
 authoritie vpon earth, and let God take heauen and his
 religion to himselfe to doo withall what he listeth.]
 finallie finding his Nobilitie & subiects vtter enemies to the Romane
 deuoti[=o] (for that they made so many gods as they listed, & some to
 haue the regiment euen of their dirt & dung) and thervnto being
 pricked forwards by such christians as were conuersant about him, to
 choose the seruice of the true God that liueth for euer, rather than
 the slauish seruitude of any pagan idoll: he fullie resolued with
 himselfe in the end, to receiue and imbrace the gospell of Christ.
 [Sidenote: Lucius openeth his ears to good counsell,
 as one desirous to serue God & not prefer the world.]
 He sent also two of his best learned and greatest philosophers to
 Rome, vnto Eleutherus then bishop there in the 177. of Christ, not to
 promise any subiection to his sea, which then was not required, but to
 say with such as were pricked in mind, Acts. 2. verse. 37. "Quid
 faciemus viri fratres?" I meane that they were sent to be perfectlie
 instructed, and with farther commission, to make earnest request vnto
 him and the congregation there, that a competent number of preachers
 might be sent ouer from thence, by whose diligent aduise and trauell,
 the foundation of the gospell might surelie be laid ouer all the
 portion of the Ile, which conteined his kingdome, according to his
 mind.

 [Sidenote: The purpose of Lucius opened vnto the
 congregation at Rome by Eleutherus.]
 When Eleutherus vnderstood these things, he reioiced not a little for
 the great goodnesse, which the Lord had shewed vpon this our Ile and
 countrie. Afterwards calling the brethren togither, they agreed to
 ordeine, euen those two for bishops, whom Lucius as you haue heard,
 had directed ouer vnto them. Finallie after they had thoroughlie
 catechized them, making generall praier vnto God and earnest
 supplication for the good successe of these men, they sent them home
 againe with no small charge, that they should be diligent in their
 function, and carefull ouer the flocke committed to their custodie.

 The first of these was called Eluanus Aualonius, a man borne in the
 Ile of Aualon, and brought up there vnder those godlie pastours and
 their disciples, whom Philip sent ouer at the first for the conuersion
 of the Britons. The other hight Medguinus, and was thereto surnamed
 Belga, bicause he was of the towne of Welles, which then was called
 Belga. This man was trained vp also in one schoole with Eluanus, both
 of them being ornaments to their horie ages, and men of such grauitie
 and godlinesse, that Eleutherus supposed none more worthie to support
 this charge, than they: after whose comming home also, it was not long
 [Sidenote: A zealous prince maketh feruent subiects.]
 yer Lucius and all his houshold with diuers of the Nobilitie were
 baptised, beside infinit numbers of the common people, which dailie
 resorted vnto them, and voluntarilie renounced all their idolatrie and
 paganisme.

 In the meane time, Eleutherus vnderstanding the successe of these
 learned doctours, and supposing with himselfe, that they two onlie
 could not suffice to support so great a charge as should concerne the
 conuersion of the whole Iland; he directed ouer vnto them in the yeare
 [Sidenote: Faganus.]
 [Sidenote: Dinauus.]
 [Sidenote: Aaron.]
 insuing Faganus, Dinaw (or Dinauus) Aaron, and diuerse other godlie
 preachers, as fellow-labourers to trauell with them in the vineyard of
 [Sidenote: _Radulphus de la noir alias Niger._]
 the Lord. These men therefore after their comming hither, consulted
 with the other, and foorthwith wholie consented to make a diuision of
 [Sidenote: 3. Cheefe Bishops in Britaine.]
 this Iland amongst themselues, appointing what parcell each preacher
 should take, that with the more profit and ease of the people, and
 somewhat lesse trauell also for themselues, the doctrine of the
 Gospell might be preached and receiued. In this distribution, they
 ordeined that there should be one congregation at London, where they
 [Sidenote: Theonus.]
 [Sidenote: Theodosius.]
 [Sidenote: London.]
 [Sidenote: Yorke.]
 [Sidenote: Caerlheon.]
 placed Theonus as cheefe elder and bishop, for that present time,
 worthilie called Theonus. 1. for there was another of that name who
 fled into Wales with Thadiocus of Yorke, at the first comming of the
 Saxons; and also Guthelmus, who went (as I read) into Armorica, there
 to craue aid against the Scots and Vandals that plagued this Ile, from
 the Twede vnto the Humber. After this Theonus also Eluanus succeeded,
 who conuerted manie of the Druiydes, and builded the first librarie
 neere vnto the bishops palace. The said Lucius also placed another at
 Yorke, whither they appointed Theodosius: and the third at Caerlheon
 vpon the riuer Vske, builded sometimes by Belinus, and called
 Glamorgantia, but now Chester (in which three cities there had before
 time beene three Archflamines erected vnto Apollo, Mars, and Minerua,
 but now raced to the ground, and three other churches builded in their
 steeds by Lucius) to the end that the countries round about might haue
 indifferent accesse vnto those places, and therewithall vnderstand for
 certeintie, whither to resort for resolution, if after their
 conuersion they should happen to doubt of any thing. In like sort also
 the rest of the idoll-temples standing in other places were either
 ouerthrowne, or conuerted into churches for christian congregations to
 assemble in, as our writers doo remember. In the report whereof giue
 me leaue gentle reader, of London my natiue citie to speake a little:
 for although it may and dooth seeme impertinent to my purpose, yet it
 shall not be much, and therefore I will soone make an end. There is a
 controuersie moued among our historiographers, whether the church that
 Lucius builded at London stood at Westminster, or in Cornehill. For
 there is some cause, why the metropolitane church should be thought to
 stand where S. Peters now doth, by the space of 400. & od yeeres
 before it was remoued to Canturburie by Austine the monke, if a man
 should leane to one side without anie conference of the asseuerations
 of the other. But herin (as I take it) there lurketh some scruple, for
 beside that S. Peters church stood in the east end of the citie, and
 that of Apollo in the west, the word Cornehill (a denomination giuen
 of late to speake of to one street) may easilie be mistaken for
 Thorney. For as the word Thorney proceedeth from the Saxons, who
 called the west end of the citie by that name, where Westminster now
 standeth, bicause of the wildnesse and bushinesse of the soile; so I
 doo not read of anie streete in London called Cornehill before the
 conquest of the Normans. Wherfore I hold with them, which make
 Westminster to be the place where Lucius builded his church vpon the
 ruines of that Flamine 264. yeeres, as Malmesburie saith, before the
 comming of the Saxons, and 411. before the arriuall of Augustine. Read
 also his appendix in lib. 4. Pontif. where he noteth the time of the
 Saxons, in the 449. of Grace, and of Augustine in the 596. of Christ;
 which is a manifest accompt, though some copies haue 499. for the one,
 but not without manifest corruption and error.

 [Sidenote: Britaine the first prouince that receiued
 the Gospell generallie.]
 Thus became Britaine the first prouince that generallie receiued the
 faith, and where the gospell was freelie preached without inhibition
 of hir prince. Howbeit, although that Lucius and his princes and great
 numbers of his people imbraced the word with greedinesse, yet was not
 the successe thereof either so vniuersall, that all men beleeued at
 the first; the securitie so great, as that no persecution was to be
 feared from the Romane empire after his decease; or the proceeding of
 the king so seuere, as that he inforced any man by publike authoritie
 to forsake and relinquish his paganisme: but onelie this freedome was
 enioied, that who so would become a christian in his time, might
 without feare of his lawes professe the Gospell, in whose testimonie,
 if need had beene, I doubt not to affirme, but that he would haue shed
 [Sidenote: Emerita neece vnto Lucius.]
 also his bloud, as did his neece Emerita, who being constant aboue the
 common sort of women, refused not after his decease by fire, to yeeld
 hir selfe to death, as a sweet smelling sacrifice in the nostrels of
 the Lord, beyond the sea in France.

 [Sidenote: Lucius sendeth againe to Rome.]
 The faith of Christ being thus planted in this Iland in the 177. after
 Christ, and Faganus and Dinaw with the rest sent ouer from Rome, in
 the 178. as you haue heard: it came to passe in the third yeare of the
 Gospell receiued, that Lucius did send againe to Eleutherus the
 bishop, requiring that he might haue some breefe epitome of the order
 of discipline then vsed in the church. For he well considered, that as
 it auaileth litle to plant a costlie vineyard, except it afterward be
 cherished, kept in good order, and such things as annoie, dailie
 remooued from the same: so after baptisme and entrance into religion,
 it profiteth little to beare the name of christians, except we doo
 [Sidenote: _Ro. 3. ver. 1._]
 walke in the spirit, and haue such things as offend apparentlie,
 corrected by seuere discipline. For otherwise it will come to passe,
 that the weedes of vice, and vicious liuing, will so quicklie abound
 in vs, that they will in the end choke vp the good seed sowne in our
 minds, and either inforce vs to returne vnto our former wickednesse
 with deeper securitie than before, or else to become meere Atheists,
 which is a great deale woorse.

 For this cause therefore did Lucius send to Rome, the second time, for
 a copie of such politike orders as were then vsed there, in their
 [Sidenote: The wisedome of Eleutherus.]
 regiment of the church. But Eleutherus considering with himselfe, how
 that all nations are not of like condition, and therefore those
 constitutions that are beneficiall to one, may now and then be
 preiudiciall to another: and seeing also that beside the word no rites
 and orders can long continue, or be so perfect in all points, but that
 as time serueth, they will require alteration: he thought it best not
 to laie any more vpon the necks of the new conuerts of Britaine as
 yet, than Christ and his apostles had alreadie set downe vnto all men.
 In returning therefore his messengers, he sent letters by them vnto
 Lucius and his Nobilitie, dated in the consulships of Commodus and
 Vespronius, wherein he told them that Christ had left sufficient order
 in the Scriptures for the gouernment of his church alreadie in his
 word, and not for that onlie, but also for the regiment of his whole
 [Sidenote: * Though most princes canot heare on that side.]
 [*]kingdome, if he would submit himselfe, to yeeld and follow that
 rule. The epistle it selfe is partlie extant, and partlie perished,
 yet such as it is, and as I haue faithfullie translated it out of
 sundrie verie ancient copies, I doo deliuer it here, to the end I will
 not defraud the reader of anie thing that may turne to the glorie of
 God, and his commoditie, in the historie of our nation.

 [Sidenote: Epistle of Eleutherus vnto Lucius.]
 "You require of vs the Romane ordinances, and thereto the statutes of
 the emperours to be sent ouer vnto you, and which you desire to
 practise and put in vre within your realme and kingdome. The Romane
 lawes and those of emperours we may eftsoones reprooue, but those of
 God can neuer be found fault withall. You haue receiued of late
 through Gods mercie in the realme of Britaine the law and faith of
 Christ, you haue with you both volumes of the scriptures: out of them
 therefore by Gods grace, and the councell of your realme take you a
 law, and by that law through Gods sufferance rule your kingdome, for
 [Sidenote: _Psal. 24._]
 you are Gods vicar in your owne realme, as the roiall prophet saith;
 The earth is the Lords and all that is therein, the compasse of the
 [Sidenote: _Psal. 45._]
 world, and they that dwell therein. Againe, Thou hast loued truth and
 hated iniquitie, wherefore God, euen thy God hath annointed thee with
 oile of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes. And againe, according to the
 [Sidenote: _Psal. 71._]
 saieng of the same prophet; Oh God giue thy iudgement vnto the king, &
 thy iustice vnto the kings sonne. The kings sons are the christian
 people & flocke of the realme, which are vnder your gouernance, and
 [Sidenote: * Here wanteth.]
 liue & continue in peace within your kingdome. [*] The gospell saith;
 As the hen gathereth hir chickens vnder hir wings, so dooth the king
 his people. Such as dwell in the kingdome of Britaine are yours, whom
 if they be diuided, you ought to gather into concord and vnitie, to
 call them to the faith and law of Christ, and to his sacred church: to
 chearish and mainteine, to rule also and gouerne them, defending each
 of them from such as would doo them wrong, and keeping them from the
 malice of such as be their enimies. [*]Wo vnto the nation whose king
 is a child, and whose princes rise vp earlie to banket and feed, which
 is spoken not of a prince that is within age, but of a prince that is
 become a child, through follie, sinne & vnstedfastnesse, of whom the
 [Sidenote: _Psal. 55._]
 prophet saith; The bloudthirstie and deceitfull men shall not liue
 foorth halfe their daies. [*]By feeding I vnderstand gluttonie; by
 gluttonie, lust; & by lust all wickednesse & sinne, according to the
 saieng of Salomon the king; Wisedome entreth not into a wicked mind,
 nor dwelleth with a man that is subiect vnto sinne. A king hath his
 name of ruling, and not of the possession of his realme. You shalbe a
 king whilest you rule well, but if you doo otherwise, the name of a
 king shall not remaine with you, but you shall vtterlie forgo it,
 which God forbid. The almightie God grant you so to rule the kingdome
 of Britaine, that you may reigne with him for euer, whose vicar (or
 vicegerent) you are within your aforesaid kingdome. Who with the Sonne
 and the Holie-ghost, &c."

 Hitherto out of the epistle that Eleutherus sent vnto Lucius, wherein
 manie pretie obseruations are to be collected, if time and place would
 serue to stand vpon them. After these daies also the number of such as
 were ordeined to saluation, increased dailie more and more, whereby
 (as in other places of the world) the word of God had good successe in
 Britaine, in time of peace; and in heat of persecution, there were no
 [Sidenote: Albane.]
 [Sidenote: Amphibalus.]
 [Sidenote: Iulius.]
 [Sidenote: Aaron.]
 small number of martyrs that suffered for the same, of which Albane,
 Amphibalus, Iulius, and Aaron, are reputed to be the chiefe, bicause
 of their noble parentage, which is a great matter in the sight of
 worldlie men.

 There are which affirme our Lucius to renounce his kingdome, and
 afterward to become first a bishop, then a preacher of the gospell,
 and afterward a pope: but to the end such as hold this opinion may
 once vnderstand the botome of their errors, I will set downe the
 matter at large, whereby they shall see (if they list to looke) how
 far they haue beene deceiued.

 [Sidenote: Chlorus had three sons, & a daughter by Helena.]
 I find that Chlorus had issue by his second wife, two sonnes,
 Dalmatius (who had a sonne called also Dalmatius and slaine by the
 souldiors.) Constantius father to Gallus, and Iulian the apostata;
 besides foure other whose names as yet I find not. But being at the
 first matched with Helena, and before she was put from him by the
 roiall power of Dioclesian, he had by hir three sonnes (beside one
 daughter named Emerita) of which the name of the first is perished,
 the second was called Lucius, & the third Constantine, that afterward
 was emperour of Rome, by election of the armies in Britaine. Now it
 happened that Lucius, whome the French call Lucion, by means of a
 quarell growne betweene him and his elder brother, did kill his said
 brother, either by a fraie or by some other meanes, wherevpon his
 father exiled him out of Britaine, and appointed him from thenceforth
 to remaine in Aquitane in France. This Lucion brought thus into
 worldlie sorow, had now good leasure to meditate vpon heauen, who
 before in his prosperitie had peraduenture neuer regard of hell.
 [Sidenote: Lucion becommeth a christian.]
 [Sidenote: Lucion a bishop.]
 Finallie he fell so far into the consideration of his estate, that at
 the last he renounced his paganisme, and first became a christian,
 then an elder, and last of all a bishop in the church of Christ. He
 erected also a place of praier wherein to serue the liuing God, which
 after sundrie alterations came in processe of time to be an Abbaie,
 and is still called euen to our time after Lucion or Lucius: the first
 founder therof, and the originall beginner of anie such house in those
 parts.

 In this also he and diuers other of his freends continued their times,
 in great contemplation and praier, and from hence were translated as
 occasion serued, vnto sundrie ecclesiasticall promotions in the time
 of Constant. his brother. So that euen by this short narration it is
 now easie to see, that Lucius the king, and Lucius or Lucion the sonne
 [Sidenote: _Hermannus Schedelius. Bruschius cap. 3._]
 of Chlorus, were distinct persons. Herevnto Hermannus Schedelius
 addeth also how he went into Rhetia with Emerita his sister, and neere
 vnto the citie Augusta conuerted the Curienses vnto the faith of
 Christ, and there likewise (being put to death in Castro Martis) lieth
 buried in the same towne, where his feast is holden vpon the third
 daie of December, as may readilie be confirmed, whereas the bones of
 our Lucius were to be seene at Glocester. That Schedelius erreth not
 herein also, the ancient monuments of the said Abbaie, whereof he was
 the originall beginner, as I said, doo yeeld sufficient testimonie,
 beside an hymne made in his commendation, intituled Gaude Lucionum,
 [Sidenote: _Festum Lucionis. Iohn Bouchet._]
 &c. But for more of this you may resort vnto Bouchet in his first
 booke, and fift chapter of the Annales of Aquitane, who neuertheles
 maketh the king of Britaine grandfather to this Lucion. The said
 [Sidenote: Emerita martyred in Rhetia.]
 Schedelius furthermore setteth downe, that his sister was martyred in
 Trinecastell, neere vnto the place where the said Lucion dwelled,
 whereby it appeereth in like sort, that she was not sister to Lucius
 king of Britaine, of which prince Alexander Neccham in his most
 excellent treatise De sapientia diuina, setteth downe this Distichon:

   Prima Britannorum fidei lux Lucius esse
     Fertur, qui rexit m[oe]nia Brute tua.

 Neither could Lucion or Lucius be fellow and of kinred vnto Paule the
 apostle, as Auentine inferreth, except he meane it of some other
 Lucius, as of one whome he nameth Cyrinensis. But then will not the
 historie agree with the conuersion of the Rhetians and Vindelicians,
 whereof Schedelius and other doo make mention. But as each riuer the
 farder it runneth from the head, the more it is increased by small
 riuelets, and corrupted with filthie puddels, and stinking gutters,
 [Sidenote: Heresie and monastical life brought into
 Britaine at one time by _Pelagius_.]
 that descend into the same: so the puritie of the gospell, preached
 here in Britaine, in processe of time became first of all to be
 corrupted with a new order of religion, and most execrable heresie,
 both of them being brought in at once by Pelagius, of Wales, who
 hauing trauelled through France, Italie, Aegypt, Syria, & the
 easterlie regions of the world, was there at the last made an elder or
 bishop, by some of the monkes, vnto whose profession he had not long
 before wholie addicted himselfe. Finallie returning home againe with
 an augmentation of fame and countenance of greater holinesse than he
 bare out of the land with him, he did not onelie erect an house of his
 [Sidenote: Bangor.]
 owne order at Bangor in Wales, vpon the riuer Dee, but also sowed the
 pestiferous seed of his hereticall prauities ouer all this Iland,
 whereby he seduced great numbers of Britons, teaching them to preferre
 their owne merits, before the free mercie of God, in Jesus Christ his
 sonne. By this means therefore he brought assurance of saluation into
 question, and taught all such as had a diligent respect vnto their
 workes to be doubtfull of the same, whereas to such as regard this
 latter, there can be no quietnesse of mind, but alwaies an vnstedfast
 opinion of themselues, whereby they cannot discerne, neither by
 prosperitie nor aduersitie of this life, whether they be worthie loue
 or hatred. Neuertheles it behooueth the godlie to repose their hope in
 that grace which is freelie granted through Jesu Christ, and to flee
 vnto the mercies of God which are offered vnto vs in with and by his
 son, to the end that we may at the last find the testimonie of his
 spirit working with ours, that we are his chosen children, whereby
 commeth peace of conscience to such as doo beleeue.

 Thus we see how new deuises or orders of religion and heresie came in
 together. I could shew also what Comets, and strange signes appeared
 in Britaine, much about the same time, the like of which with diuers
 other haue beene perceiued also from time to time, sithence the death
 of Pelagius, at the entrance of anie new kind of religion into this
 Ile of Britaine. But I passe them ouer, onelie for that I would not
 seeme in my tractation of antiquities, to trouble my reader with the
 rehersall of anie new inconueniences.

 [Sidenote: Anachorites. Heremites. Cyrillines. Benedictines.]
 To proceed therefore with my purpose, after these, there followed in
 like sort sundrie other kinds of monasticall life, as Anachorites,
 Heremits, Cyrilline and Benedictine monkes, albeit that the
 heremeticall profession was onelie allowed of in Britaine, vntill the
 comming of Augustine the monke, who brought in the Benedictine sect,
 framed after the order of the house which Benedict surnamed Nursinus
 did first erect in Monte Cassino, about the 524. of Christ, & was
 finallie so well liked of all men, that we had few or (as I suppose)
 no blacke monkes in England that were not of his order. In processe of
 time how Benedict Biscop also our countrieman restored the said
 Benedictine profession greatlie decaied in England, our histories are
 verie plentifull, which Biscop went off into Italie, and at one time
 for a speciall confirmation of his two monasteries which he had
 [Sidenote: Monkes and Heremites onelie allowed of in Britaine.]
 builded at other mens costs vnto Paule and Peter vpon the bankes of
 the Were, as Beda dooth remember. So fast also did these and other
 like humane deuises prosper after his time, that at their suppression
 in England and Wales onelie, there were found 440. religious houses at
 the least, of which 373. might dispend 200. li. by the yeere at the
 least, as appeareth by the record of their suppression, which also
 noteth the totall summe of their reuenues to amount vnto 32000.
 pounds, their moueables 100000. li. and the number of religious men
 [Sidenote: The number of religious houses in England
 at their dissolution.]
 conteined in the same, to be 10000. which would make a pretie armie,
 wherevnto if you adde those 45. of late standing in Scotland, you
 shall soone see what numbers of these dens of spirituall robbers were
 mainteined here in Britaine. What number of saincts also haue beene
 hatched in them I could easilie remember, and beside those 160. which
 Capgraue setteth downe, & other likewise remembred in the golden
 Legend, and Legendarie of Excester, I might bring a rable out of
 Scotland able to furnish vp a calendar, though the yere were twise as
 long.

 As touching Pelagius the first heretike that euer was bred in this
 realme (notablie knowne) and parent of Monachisme, it is certeine,
 that before his corruption and fall, he was taken for a man of
 singular learning, deepe iudgement, and such a one, as vpon whome for
 his great gifts in teaching and strictnesse of life, no small peece of
 the hope and expectation of the people did depend. But what is
 wisedome of the flesh, without the feare and true knowledge of God?
 and what is learning except it be handmaid to veritie and sound
 iudgement? Wherefore euen of this man, we may see it verified, that
 [Sidenote: Roger Bakon his saieng of the preachers of his
 time who were the best lawyers and the worst Diuines.]
 one Roger Bakon pronounced long after of the corruption of his time,
 when all things were measured by wit and worldlie policie, rather than
 by the scriptures or guidance of the spirit; Better it is saith he, to
 heare a rude and simple idiot preach the truth, without apparance of
 skill and learned eloquence, than a profound clearke to set foorth
 error, with great shew of learning, and boast of filed vtterance.
 Gerson in like sort hath said fullie asmuch. These follies of Pelagius
 were blased abroad about the 400. of Christ, and from thencefoorth how
 his number of monkes increased on the one side, and his doctrine on
 the other, there is almost no reader that is vnskilfull and ignorant.

 This also is certeine, that within the space of 200. yeares and odde,
 [Sidenote: More than 2100 monkes in the College or Abbaie of
 Bangor in whose territories the parish of Ouerton standeth.]
 there were manie more than 2100. monkes gathered togither in his
 house, whose trades notwithstanding the errors or their founder, (who
 taught such an estimation of merits and bodilie exercise (as Paule
 calleth it) that therby he sought not onlie to impugne, but also
 preuent grace, which was in deed the originall occasion of the
 erection of his house) were yet farre better and more godlie than all
 those religious orders, that were inuented of later time, wherein the
 professours liued to themselues, their wombs and the licentious
 fruition of those parts, that are beneath the bellie. For these
 [Sidenote: _Niceph. lib. II. cap. 34._]
 laboured continuallie  for their owne liuings, at vacant times from
 praier (as did Serapions monkes, which were 10000. ouer whome he
 himselfe was Abbat) and likewise for the better maintenance of such
 learned men as were their appointed preachers. Their liues also were
 correspondent to their doctrine, so that herein onelie they seemed
 intollerable, in that they had confidence in their deeds, and no
 warrant out of the word for their succor & defense, but were such a
 plant as the heauenlie father had not planted, and therefore no
 maruell, though afterward they were raised by the roots.

 But as Pelagius and his adherents had a time to infect the church of
 Christ in Britaine, so the liuing God hath had a season also to purge
 and cleanse the same, though not by a full reformation of doctrine,
 [Sidenote: Germanus, Lupus, Palladius, Patricius.]
 sith Germanus, Lupus, Palladius, Patricius, and such like leaning for
 the most part vnto the monasticall trades, did not so much condemne
 the generall errors of Pelagius one waie, as mainteine the same, or as
 euill opinions another. For as Patricke seemed to like well of the
 honoring of the dead, so Germanus being in Britaine repaired an old
 [Sidenote: _Seuerus Sulpitius in vita Patricij._]
 chapell to S. Albane, wherein Lupus also praied, as Palladius vpheld
 the strictnesse of life, in monasticall profession to the vttermost of
 his power. Wherefore God wrought this purgation of his house at the
 first, rather by taking awaie the wicked and pompous schoolemaisters
 of errour out of this life: hoping that by such meanes, his people
 would haue giuen eare to the godlie that remained. But in processe of
 time, when this his mercifull dealing was forgotten and our
 countriemen returned to their former disorders, he brought in the
 Saxons, who left no idoll vnhonored, no not their filthie Priapus,
 vnto whom the women builded temples, and made a beastlie image (Cum
 pene intenso, and as if he had beene circumcised) whome they called
 Ithypallus, Verpus, and as Goropius Atvatic. pag. 26. addeth, Ters:
 calling vpon him in maner at euerie word, yea at the verie fall of a
 knife out of their hands, and not counted anie shame vnto the most
 ancient and sober matrone of them all. Howbeit when this proceeding of
 the Lord could also take no place, and the sheepe of his pasture would
 receiue no wholesome fodder, it pleased his maiestie, to let them run
 on headlong from one iniquitie to another, in somuch that after the
 doctrine of Pelagius, it receiued that of Rome also, brought in by
 [Sidenote: Augustine the monke.]
 Augustine and his monkes, whereby it was to be seene, how they fell
 from the truth into heresie, and from one heresie still into another,
 till at the last they were drowned altogither in the pits of error
 digged vp by Antichrist, wels in deed that hold no water, which
 notwithstanding to their followers seemed to be most sound doctrine,
 and cisterns of liuing water to such as imbraced the same.

 [Sidenote: Augustine.]
 This Augustine, after his arriuall, conuerted the Saxons in deed from
 paganisme, but as the prouerbe saith, bringing them out of Gods
 blessing into the warme sunne, he also imbued them with no lesse
 hurtfull superstition, than they did know before: for beside the
 onelie name of Christ, and externall contempt of their pristinate
 idolatrie, he taught them nothing at all, but rather (I saie) made an
 exchange from grosse to subtill treacherie, from open to secret
 idolatrie, & from the name of pagans, to the bare title of christians,
 thinking this sufficient for their soules health, and the stablishment
 of his monachisme, of which kind of profession, the holie scriptures
 of God can in no wise like or allow. But what cared he? sith he got
 the great fish for which he did cast his hooke, and so great was the
 fish that he caught in deed, that within the space of 1000. yeares,
 and lesse, it deuoured the fourth part & more of the best soile of the
 Iland, which was wholie bestowed vpon his monkes, & other religious
 broodes that were hatched since his time, as may hereafter appeere in
 the booke following, where I intreate of cities, townes, &c. In the
 [Sidenote: Monks of Canturburie plagued.]
 meane season what successe his monkes had at Canturburie, how oft they
 were spoiled by enimies, their houses burned by casualtie, and
 brethren consumed with pestilence, I refer me to Gotcellius, Houeden,
 Geruase, and the rest of their owne historiographers. And so sore did
 the pestilence rage among them in the time of Celnothus (in whose
 daies the preests, clerks and monkes sang their seruice togither in
 the quire, that (of I wote not how manie) there remained onelie fiue
 aliue, which was a notable token of the furie and wrath of God
 conceiued and executed against that malignant generation. It came also
 to passe at the last that men vsed to praie for helpe at the said
 Augustines tumbe (although afterward Thomas Becket a newer saint did
 not a little deface his glorie) among which king Athelstane was one,
 whome Elnothus the abbat staied so long in the place, when he came
 thither to praie, that his soldiours waiting for his comming, and
 supposing the monkes to haue murdered him, began to giue an assault
 and set fire vpon the house.

 [Sidenote: Meates. Pictes. Caledoniens.]
 Whilest these things were thus in hand, in the south part of Albion,
 the Meates, Picts, and Caledoniens, which lie beyond the Scotish sea,
 receiued also the faith, by preaching of such christian elders as
 aduentured thither dailie, who trauelled not without great successe
 and increase of perfect godlines in that part of the Ile. Certes this
 prosperous attempt passed all mens expectation, for that these nations
 were in those daies reputed wild, sauage, and more vnfaithfull and
 craftie than well-minded people (as the wild Irish are in my time) and
 such were they (to saie the truth) in deed, as neither the sugred
 courtesie, nor sharpe swords of the Romans could mollifie or restraine
 from their naturall furie, or bring to anie good order. For this cause
 also in the end, the Romane emperours did vtterlie cast them off as an
 vnprofitable, brutish, & vntameable nation, and by an huge wall
 herafter to be described, separated that rude companie from the more
 mild and ciuill portion.

 [Sidenote: Scotland conuerted to the faith of Christ.]
 This conuersion of the north parts fell out in the sixt yeare before
 the warres that Seuerus had in those quarters, and 170. after the
 death of our sauiour Jesus Christ. From thenceforth also the christian
 religion continued still among them, by the diligent care of their
 pastors and bishops (after the vse of the churches of the south part
 of this Iland) till the Romane sheepheard sought them out, and found
 the meanes to pull them vnto him in like sort with his long staffe as
 he had done our countriemen, whereby in the end he abolished the rites
 of the churches of Asia there also, as Augustine had done alreadie in
 England: and in steed of the same did furnish it vp with those of his
 pontificall see, although there was great contention, and no lesse
 bloodshed made amongst them, before it could be brought to passe, as
 by the histories of both nations yet extant may be seene.

 [Sidenote: Paladius.]
 In the time of C[oe]lestine bishop of Rome, who sate in the 423. of
 Christ, one Paladius a Grecian borne (to whome Cyrill wrote his dialog
 De adoratione in spiritu) and sometime disciple to Iohn 24. bishop of
 [Sidenote: The first attempt of the bishop of Rome
 to bring Scotland vnder his obedience.]
 Ierusalem, came ouer from Rome into Britaine, there to suppresse the
 Pelagian heresie, which not a little molested the orthodoxes of that
 Iland. And hauing doone much good in the extinguishing of the
 aforesaid opinion there, he went at the last also into Scotland,
 supposing no lesse, but after he had trauelled somwhat in confutation
 of the Pelagians in those parts, he should easilie persuade that
 crooked nation to admit and receiue the rites of the church of Rome,
 as he would faine haue doone beforehand in the south. But as
 [Sidenote: Fastidius bishop of London.]
 Fastidius Priscus archbishop of London, and his Suffragans resisted
 him here; so did the Scotish prelates withstand him there also in this
 behalfe: howbeit, bicause of the authoritie of his commission,
 grauitie of personage, and the great gift which he had in the veine of
 pleasant persuasion (whereby he drew the people after him, as Orpheus
 did the stones with his harpe, and Hercules such as heard him by his
 toong) they had him not onelie then in great admiration, but their
 successors also from time to time, and euen now are contented (and the
 rather also for that he came from Rome) to take him for their cheefe
 [Sidenote: Paladius accompted for the apostle of the Scots.]
 apostle, reckoning from his comming as from the faith receiued, which
 was in the 431. yeare of Christ, as the truth of their historie dooth
 verie well confirme.

 Thus we see what religion hath from time to time beene receiued in
 this Iland, & how and when the faith of Christ came first into our
 countrie. Howbeit as in processe of time it was ouershadowed, and
 corrupted with the dreames and fantasticall imaginations of man, so it
 dailie waxed woorse & woorse, till that it pleased God to restore the
 preaching of his gospell in our daies, whereby the man of sinne is now
 openlie reuealed, and the puritie of the word once againe brought to
 light, to the finall ouerthrow of the Romish sathan, and his popish
 adherents that honour him daie and night to the vttermost of their
 power, yeelding vp their harts as temples for him to dwell in, which
 rather ought to be the temples of God and habitations of the
 Holy-ghost. But such is their peruerse ignorance (notwithstanding that
 Paule hath giuen warning of him alreadie 2. Thes. 2. calling him (as I
 said) the man of sinne, and saieng that he sitteth as God in the
 temple of God, shewing himselfe in his chalenge of power, as if he
 were God, vnder pretense of zeale vnto true religion) that they will
 not giue eare vnto the truth, but rather shut their eares and their
 eies from hearing and reading of the scriptures, bicause they will not
 be drawne out of his snares and bondage.




 OF THE MANIFOLD CONUERSIONS AND ALTERATIONS OF THE ESTATE OF THE
 COMMON-WEALTH OF BRITAINE, SITHENS THE TIME OF SAMOTHES.


 There is a certeine period of kingdomes, of 430. yeares, in which
 commonlie they suffer some notable alteration. And as in the aforesaid
 season there is set a time of increase and decaie, so we find that
 before the execution of Gods purpose dooth come to passe, in changing
 the estate of things, sundrie tokens are sent, whereby warning is
 giuen, that without repentance he will come and visit our offenses.
 This is partlie verified by Ioachimus Camerarius, who in his first
 booke De ostentis intreating of the same argument, telleth of a
 strange earthquake felt in Delus, which was neuer touched with any
 such plague before or after the ouerthrow of the Persians, giuen vnto
 them by the Grecians; also of the beard that suddenlie grew out of the
 face of the Pedacien prophetesse, so often as the citie was to be
 touched with any alteration and change. "Nam (saith he) descriptas
 esse diuinitus aetates quibus idem humanarum rerum status duraret,
 quibus finitis, praedici prius quam existeret nouationem in deterius
 euenturam rerum, quaeque indies minus ac minus numini cordi essent.
 Emittuntur igitur cometae diuinitus, & reuocantur dum supra nos
 conspecti quamdiu placuit Deo inferuntur, &c." Plato referreth such
 changes as happen in common-wealths to a certeine diuine force that
 resteth hidden in sundrie od numbers, whereof their periods do
 consist. True it is that God created all things in number, weight &
 measure, & that after an incomprehensible maner vnto our fraile &
 humane capacitie. Neuerthelesse, he appointed not these three to haue
 the rule of his works, wherefore we must not ascribe these changes to
 the force of number with Plato, much lesse then vnto destinie with the
 Peripatetiks, but vnto the diuine prouidence and appointment of God,
 which onelie may be called destinie as S. Augustine saith, for of
 other destinie it is impietie to dreame. Aristotle ascribing all
 euents vnto manifest causes precedent, dooth scoffe at Plato and his
 numbers in his booke of common-wealths, and bringeth in sundrie causes
 of the alteration of the state of things, which we may referre vnto
 principals, as iniurie, oppression, ambition, treason, rebellion,
 contempt of religion and lawes, and therevnto abundance of wealth in
 few, and great necessitie and miserie in manie. But whatsoeuer
 Aristotle gesseth at these things by humane reason as at the first
 causes, yet we acknowledge other beyond them, as sinne, which being
 suffered and come to the full, is cut downe by the iustice of the high
 God, the cheefe cause of all, who foreseeing the wickednesse of such
 as dwell on earth, dooth constitute such a reuolution of things in
 their beginnings, as best standeth with the execution of his purpose,
 and correction of our errors. The causes therefore that Aristotle
 dooth deliuer, are nothing else but the meanes which God vseth to
 bring his purposes to passe; and yet they deserue the name of causes,
 in that they preceed those effects which follow them immediatlie. But
 in truth other than secondarie or third causes no man can iustlie call
 them. Bodinus in his historicall method, cap. 6. making a large
 discourse of the conuersions of commonwealths, dooth seeme at the
 first to denie the force of number, but after a while he maruelleth
 that no Grecian or Latine Academike, hath hitherto made any discourse
 of the excellencie of such numbers as apperteine to the estate of
 empires and kingdomes by exemplification in any one citie or other.
 Hereby he sheweth himselfe vpon the sudden to alter his iudgement, so
 [Sidenote: Fatal numbers.]
 that he setteth downe certeine numbers as fatall; to wit, sixe vnto
 women, and seauen and nine vnto men, which (saith he) haue "Magnam in
 tota rerum natura potestatem," meaning as well in common-wealths and
 kingdomes from their first erections, as in particular ages of bodies,
 for sickenesse, health, change of habitation, wealth, and losse, &c:
 and for the confirmation of the same, he setteth downe sundrie
 examples of apparent likelihood, either by multiplication of one by
 the other, or diuision of greater numbers by either of them, or their
 concurrence one with another, calling the aforesaid three his
 criticall or iudiciall numbers, whereby he bringeth or rather
 restoreth an old kind of arithmancie (fathered on Pythagoras, yet
 neuer inuented by him) againe into the world. But we christians, in
 respecting of causes, haue to looke vnto the originall and great cause
 of all, and therefore we haue not to leane vnto these points in any
 wise as causes: for we know and confesse that all things depend vpon
 his prouidence, who humbleth and exalteth whom it pleaseth him.
 Neuerthelesse, I hope we may without offense examine how these
 assertions hold, so long as we vse them rather as Indices than Causas
 mutationum. And therefore haue I attempted to practise at this present
 the example of Bodinus, first in the alterations of our ciuill estate
 passed; and secondlie, of the like in cases of religion; from the
 flood generallie, and then after the first comming in of Samothes into
 our Ile, thereby somewhat to satisfie my selfe, and recreate the
 readers; but still protesting in the meane season that I vtterlie
 denie them to be any causes, or of themselues to worke any effect at
 all in these things, as Bodinus would seeme to vphold. As for those of
 other countries, I referre you to Aristotles politikes, and the eight
 of the common-wealth which Plato hath left vnto vs, therby to be
 farther resolued, if you be desirous to looke on them. In beginning
 therefore with my purpose; First bicause the flood of Noah was
 generall, and therefore appertinent vnto all, it shall not be amisse
 to begin with that, which was in the yeare 1656. after the creation of
 Adam, so that if you diuide the same by nine, you shall find the
 quotient to fall out exactlie with the 184. reuolution of the same
 number. Secondlie, for so much as the confusion of toongs was the
 originall cause of the dispersion of the people ouer the face of the
 whole earth, it shall not be amisse also to examine the same. Certes
 it fell out in the 133. after the flood: if we diuide therefore the
 said 133. by seauen, you shall find the quotient 19. without any ods
 remaining. From hence also vnto the comming of Samothes into Britaine,
 or rather his lawes giuen vnto the Celts, and with them vnto the
 Britons, in the second of his arriuall in this land, we find by exact
 supputation 126. yeares, which being parted by nine or seauen sheweth
 such a conclusion as maketh much for this purpose. Doubtlesse I am the
 more willing to touch the time of his lawes than his entrance, sith
 alteration of ordinances is the cheefe and principall token of change
 in rule and regiment; although at this present the circumstances hold
 not, sith he dispossessed none, neither incroched vpon any. From
 Samothes vnto the tyrannie of Albion, are 335. yeares complet, so that
 he arriued here in the 335. or 48. septenarie, which also concurreth
 with the 590 after the flood. In like sort the regiment of Albion
 continued but seauen yeares, and then was the souereingtie of this Ile
 restored againe by Hercules vnto the Celts. The next alteration of our
 estate openlie knowne, happened by Brute, betweene whose time and
 death of Albion there passed full 601. yeares (for he spent much time
 after his departure out of Grecia, before he came into Albion) so that
 if you accompt him to come hither in the 602. you shall haue 86.
 septenaries exactlie. From Brute to the extinction of his posteritie
 in Ferrex and Porrex, and pentarchie of Britaine, are 630. yeares, or
 70. nouenaries, than the which where shall a man find a more precise
 period after this method or prescription, for manie and diuers
 considerations. The time of the pentarchie indured likewise 49.
 yeares, or seauen septenaries, which being expired Dunwallo brought
 all the princes vnder his subiection, and ruled ouer them as monarch
 of this Ile. After the pentarchie ended, we find againe, that in the
 98. yeare, Brennus rebelled against Beline his brother, wherevpon
 insued cruell bloodshed betweene them. So that here you haue 14.
 septenaries, as you haue from those warres ended, which indured a full
 yeare & more before Brennus was reconciled to his brother, to the
 comming of Caesar into this Iland (whereat our seruitude and miserable
 thraldome to the Romans may worthilie take his entrance) 48. or 336.
 yeares, than the which concurrences I know not how a man should
 imagine a more exact.

 After the comming of Caesar we haue 54. or sixe nouenaries to Christ,
 whose death and passion redoundeth generallie to all that by firme and
 sure faith take hold of the same, and applie it vnto their comfort.
 From the birth of Christ to our countrie deliuered from the Romane
 yoke, are 446. yeares, at which time the Britains chose them a king,
 and betooke themselues to his obedience. But neither they nor their
 king being then able to hold out the Scots and Picts, which dailie
 made hauocke of their countrie; the said Vortiger in the third yeare
 of his reigne (which was the 63. septenarie after Christ) did send for
 the Saxons, who arriued here in the 449. and 450. yeares of Grace, in
 great companies, for our aid and succour, although that in the end
 their entrances turned to our vtter decaie and ruine, in that they
 made a conquest of the whole Ile, and draue vs out of our liuings.
 Hereby we see therefore how the preparatiue began in the 449. but how
 it was finished in the tenth nouenarie, the sequele is too too plaine.
 In like sort in the 43. nouenarie or 387. after the comming of the
 Saxons, the Danes entred, who miserablie afflicted this Ile by the
 space of 182. yeares or 46. septenaries, which being expired, they
 established themselues in the kingdome by Canutus. But their time
 lasting not long, the Normans followed in the end of the 49. yeare,
 and thus you see how these numbers do hold exactlie vnto the conquest.
 The like also we find of the continuance of the Normans or succession
 of the Conquerour, which indured but 89. yeares, being extinguished in
 Stephen, and that of the Saxons restored in Henrie the second,
 although it lacke one whole yeare of ten nouenaries, which is a small
 thing, sith vpon diuers occasions the time of the execution of any
 accident may be preuented or proroged, as in direction and progression
 astronomicall is oftentimes perceiued. From hence to the infamous
 excommunication of England in king Iohns daies, wherevpon insued the
 resignation of his crownes and dominions to the pope, are eight
 septenaries or 56. yeares. Thence againe to the deposition of Richard.
 2. and vsurpation of Henrie 4. are 77. yeares or 11. septenaries. From
 hence to the conspiracie made against Edward. 2. after which he was
 deposed & murdered are 117. yeares, or 13. nouenaries. From hence to
 the beginning of the quarell betweene the houses of Yorke and
 Lancaster (wherein foure score and od persons of the blood roiall were
 slaine and made awaie first and last, and which warres begunne in the
 1448. and the yeare after the death of the Duke of Glocester, whose
 murther seemed to make free passage to the said broile) are 72. yeares
 or eight nouenaries. From hence to the translation of the crowne from
 the house of Lancaster to that of Yorke, in Edward the 4. are 14.
 yeares or two septenaries, and last of all to the vnion of the said
 houses in Henrie the eight, is an exact quadrat of seuen multiplied in
 it selfe, or 49. yeares, whereof I hope this may in part suffice.

 Now as concerning religion, we haue from Christ to the faith first
 preached in Britaine (by Iosephus ab Aramathia, and Simon Zelotes) as
 some write 70. yeares or 10. septenaries. Thence also to the baptisme
 of Lucius, and his nobilitie in the yeare after their conuersion, 12.
 nouenaries or 108. yeares. After these the Saxons entred and changed
 the state of religion for the most part into paganisme, in the yeare
 449. 39. nouenarie, and 273. yeare after Lucius had beene baptised,
 which is 39. septenaries, if I be not deceiued. In the 147. or 21.
 septenarie, Augustine came, who brought in poperie, which increased
 and continued till Wicklif with more boldnesse than anie other began
 to preach the gospell, which was Anno. 1361. or 765. yeares after the
 comming of Augustine, and yeeld 85. nouenaries exactlie. From hence
 [Sidenote: Henrie 8.]
 againe to the expulsion of the pope 175. yeares, or 25. septenaries,
 [Sidenote: Marie.]
 thence to the receiuing of the pope and popish doctrine 21. yeares or
 3. septenaries, wherevnto I would ad the time of restoring the gospell
 by Queene Elizabeth, were it not that it wanteth one full yeare of 7.
 Whereby we may well gather, that if there be anie hidden mysterie or
 thing conteined in these numbers, yet the same extendeth not vnto the
 diuine disposition of things, touching the gift of grace and free
 mercie vnto the penitent, vnto which neither number weight nor measure
 shall be able to aspire.




 OF SUCH ILANDS AS ARE TO BE SEENE VPON THE COASTS OF BRITAINE.

 CAP. 10.


 There are neere vnto, or not verie farre from the coasts of Britaine
 many faire Ilands, wherof Ireland with hir neighbors (not here handled)
 seeme to be the cheefe. But of the rest, some are much larger or lesse
 than other, diuers in like sort enuironed continuallie with the salt sea
 (whereof I purpose onelie to intreat, although not a few of them be
 Ilands but at the floud) and other finallie be clipped partlie by the
 fresh and partlie by the salt water, or by the fresh alone, whereof I
 may speake afterward.

 Of these salt Ilands (for so I call them that are enuironed with the
 Ocean waues) some are fruitfull in wood, corne, wild foule, and pasture
 ground for cattell, albeit that manie of them be accounted barren,
 bicause they are onelie replenished with conies, and those of sundrie
 colours (cherished of purpose by the owners, for their skins or carcases
 in their prouision of household) without either man or woman otherwise
 inhabiting in them. Furthermore, the greatest number of these Ilands
 haue townes and parish-churches, within their seuerall precincts, some
 mo, some lesse: and beside all this, are so inriched with commodities,
 that they haue pleasant hauens, fresh springs, great store of fish, and
 plentie of cattell, wherby the inhabitants doo reape no small aduantage.
 How manie they are in number I cannot as yet determine, bicause mine
 informations are not so fullie set downe, as the promises of some on the
 one side, & mine expectation on the other did extend vnto. Howbeit,
 first of all that there are certeine which lie neere togither, as it
 were by heapes and clusters, I hope none will readilie denie. Of these
 [Sidenote: Nesiadae.]
 [Sidenote: Insulae Scylurum.]
 [Sidenote: Sileustrae.]
 [Sidenote: Syllanae.]
 [Sidenote: Sorlingae.]
 [Sidenote: Sylley.]
 [Sidenote: Hebrides.]
 [Sidenote: Hebudes.]
 [Sidenote: Meuaniae.]
 [Sidenote: Orchades.]
 also those called the Nesiadae, Insulae Scylurum, Sileustrae, Syllanae, now
 the Sorlings, and Iles of Silley, lieng beyond Cornwall are one, and
 conteineth in number one hundreth fourtie and seauen (each of them
 bearing grasse) besides shelfes and shallowes. In like sort the companie
 of the Hebrides in old time subject vnto Ireland are another, which are
 said to be 43. situat vpon the west side of this Iland, betweene Ireland
 & Scotland, and of which there are some that repute Anglesei, Mona
 Caesaris, and other lieng betweene them to be parcell, in their corrupted
 iudgement. The third cluster or bunch consisteth of those that are
 called the Orchades, and these lie vpon the northwest point of Scotland,
 being 31. alias 28. in number, as for the rest they lie scattered here
 and there, and yet not to be vntouched as their courses shall come
 about. There are also the 18. Shetland Iles, and other yet farther
 distant from them, of which Iohn Frobuser I doubt not touched vpon some
 in his voiage to Meta Incognita: but for somuch as I must speake of the
 Shetlands hereafter, I doo not meane to spend anie time about them as
 yet.

 There haue beene diuers that haue written of purpose, De insulis
 Britanniae, as Caesar doth confesse. The like also may be seene by
 Plutarch, who nameth one Demetrius a Britaine, that should set foorth an
 exact treatise of each of them in order, and among other tell of
 certeine desert Iles beyond Scotland dedicated to sundrie gods and
 goddesses, but of one especiallie, where Briareus should hold Saturne
 and manie other spirits fast bound with the chaines of an heauie sleepe,
 as he heard, of which some die now and then, by meane wherof the aire
 becommeth maruellouslie troubled, &c: as you may see in Plutarch De
 cessatione oraculorum, &c. But sith those bookes are now perished, and
 the most of the said Ilands remaine vtterlie vnknowen, euen to our owne
 selues (for who is able in our time to say where is Glota, Hiucrion,
 Etta, Iduna, Armia, AEsarea, Barsa, Isiandium, Icdelis, Xantisma,
 Indelis, Siata, Ga. Andros or Edros, Siambis, Xanthos, Ricnea, Menapia,
 &c? whose names onelie are left in memorie by ancient writers, but I
 saie their places not so much as heard of in our daies) I meane (God
 willing) to set downe so manie of them with their commodities, as I doo
 either know by Leland, or am otherwise instructed of by such as are of
 credit. Herein also I will touch at large those that are most famous,
 and breeflie passe ouer such as are obscure and vnknowen, making mine
 entrance at the Thames mouth, and directing this imagined course (for I
 neuer sailed it) by the south part of the Iland into the west. From
 thence in like sort I will proceed into the north, & come about againe
 by the east side into the fall of the aforesaid streame, where I will
 strike saile, and safelie be set ashore, that haue often in this voiage
 wanted water, but oftener beene set a ground, especiallie on the Scotish
 side.

 In beginning therefore, with such as lie in the mouth of the aforesaid
 [Sidenote: Hoo.]
 riuer, I must needs passe by the How, which is not an Iland, and
 therefore not within the compasse of my description at this time, but
 almost an Iland, which parcels the Latins call Peninsulas, and I doo
 english a Byland, vsing the word for such as a man may go into
 drie-footed at the full sea, or on horssebacke at the low water without
 anie boat or vessell: and such a one almost is Rochford hundred in Essex
 also, yet not at this time to be spoken of, bicause not the sea onelie
 but the fresh water also doth in maner enuiron it, and is the cheefe
 occasion wherfore it is called an Iland. This How lieth between Cliffe
 (in old time called Clouesho, to wit, Cliffe in How or in the hundred of
 How) & the midwaie that goeth along by Rochester, of which hundred there
 goeth an old prouerbe in rime after this maner:

   He that rideth into the hundred of How,
   Beside pilfering sea-men shall find durt ynow.

 [Sidenote: Greane.]
 Next vnto this we haue the Greane, wherein is a towne of the same
 denomination, an Ile supposed to be foure miles in length, and two in
 [Sidenote: Shepey.]
 bredth. Then come we to Shepey, which Ptolomie calleth Connos,
 conteining seauen miles in length, and three in bredth, wherein is a
 castell called Quinborow, and a parke, beside foure townes, of which one
 is named Minster, another Eastchurch, the third Warden, and the fourth
 Leyden: the whole soile being throughlie fed with sheepe, verie well
 woodded, and (as I heare) belongeth to the Lord Cheyney, as parcell of
 his inheritance. It lieth thirteene miles by water from Rochester, but
 the castell is fifteene, and by south thereof are two small Ilands,
 [Sidenote: Elmesie.]
 [Sidenote: Hertesie.]
 wherof the one is called Elmesie, and the more easterlie Hertesie. In
 this also is a towne called Hertie, or Hartie, and all in the Lath of
 Scraie, notwithstanding that Hartie lieth in the hundred of Feuersham,
 and Shepey reteineth one especiall Bailie of hir owne.

 From hence we passe by the Reculuers (or territorie belonging in time
 past to one Raculphus, who erected an house of religion, or some such
 thing there) vnto a little Iland in the Stoure mouth. Herevpon also
 [Sidenote: Stureev.]
 [Sidenote: Thanet.]
 the Thanet abutteth, which Ptolomie calleth Toliapis, other Athanatos,
 bicause serpents are supposed not to liue in the same, howbeit sith it
 is not enuironed with the sea, it is not to be dealt withall as an Iland
 in this place, albeit I will not let to borow of my determination, and
 describe it as I go, bicause it is so fruitfull. Beda noteth it in times
 past to haue conteined 600. families, which are all one with Hidelands,
 [*]Ploughlands, Carrucates, or Temewares. He addeth also that it is
 [Sidenote: * In Lincolneshire the word Hide or hideland,
 was neuer in vse in old time as in other places, but for
 Hide they vsed the word Carucate or cartware, or Teme,
 and these were of no lesse compasse than an Hideland.
 _Ex Hugone le blanc Monacho Petrolurgensi._]
 diuided from our continent, by the riuer called Wantsume, which is about
 three furlongs broad, and to be passed ouer in two places onelie. But
 whereas Polydore saieth, the Thanet is nine miles in length & not much
 lesse in bredth, it is now reckoned that it hath not much aboue seauen
 miles from Nordtmuth to Sandwich, and foure in bredth, from the Stoure
 to Margate, or from the south to the north, the circuit of the whole
 being 17. or 18. as Leland also noteth. This Iland hath no wood growing
 in it except it be forced, and yet otherwise it is verie fruitfull, and
 beside that it wanteth few other commodities, the finest chalke is said
 to be found there. Herein also did Augustine the moonke first arriue,
 when he came to conuert the Saxons, and afterward in processe of time,
 sundry religious houses were erected there, as in a soile much bettered
 (as the supersticious supposed) by the steps of that holy man, & such as
 came ouer with him. There are at this time 10. parish churches at the
 least in the Ile of Thanet, as S. Nicholas, Birchington, S. Iohns, Wood
 or Woodchurch, S. Peters, S. Laurence, Mownton or Monkeron, Minster, S.
 Gyles and all Saincts, whereof M. Lambert hath written at large in his
 description of Kent, and placed the same in the Lath of sainct Augustine
 and hundred of Kingslow, as may easilie be seene to him that will peruse
 it.

 [Sidenote: Rutupium.]
 Sometime Rutupium or (as Beda calleth it) Reptacester, stood also in
 this Iland, but now thorough alteration of the chanell of the Dour, it
 is shut quite out, and annexed to the maine. It is called in these daies
 Richborow, and as it should seeme builded vpon an indifferent soile or
 high ground. The large brickes also yet to be seene there, in the
 ruinous walles, declare either the Romane or the old British
 workemanship. But as time decaieth all things, so Rutupium named
 Ruptimuth is now become desolate, and out of the dust thereof Sandwich
 producted, which standeth a full mile from the place where Reptacester
 stood. The old writers affirme, how Arthur & Mordred fought one notable
 battell here, wherin Gwallon or Gawan was slaine; at which time the said
 rebell came against his souereigne with 70000. Picts, Scots, Irish,
 Norwegians, &c: and with Ethelbert the first christian king of Kent did
 hold his palace in this towne, and yet none of his coine hath hitherto
 beene found there, as is dailie that of the Romanes, whereof manie
 peeces of siluer and gold, so well as of brasse, copper, and other
 mettall haue often beene shewed vnto me. It should appeere in like sort,
 that of this place, all the whole coast of Kent therabout was called
 Littus Rutupinum, which some doo not a little confirme by these words of
 Lucane, to be read in his sixt booke soone after the beginning:

 [Sidenote: The last verse of one couple and first of an other.]

   Aut vaga cum Tethis, Rutupinaq; littora feruent,
   Vnda Calidonios fallit turbata Britannos.

   Or when the wandering seas
     and Kentish coasts doo worke,
   And Calidons of British bloud,
     the troubled waues beguile.

 Meaning in like sort by the latter, the coast neere Andredeswald, which
 in time past was called Littus Calidonium of that wood or forrest, as
 Leland also confirmeth. But as it is not my mind to deale anie thing
 curiouslie in these by-matters, so in returning againe to my purpose,
 [Sidenote: Seolesey of Seles there taken.]
 and taking my iourney toward the Wight, I must needs passe by Selesey,
 which sometime (as it should seeme) hath beene a noble Iland, but now in
 maner a Byland or Peninsula, wherin the cheefe see of the bishop of
 Chichester was holden by the space of three hundred twentie nine yeares,
 and vnder twentie bishops.

 Next vnto this, we come vnto those that lie betweene the Wight and the
 [Sidenote: Thorne.]
 maine land, of which the most easterlie is called Thorne, and to saie
 truth, the verie least of all that are to be found in that knot. Being
 [Sidenote: Haling.]
 past the Thorne, we touched vpon the Haling, which is bigger than the
 Thorne, and wherein one towne is situat of the same denomination beside
 [Sidenote: Port.]
 another, whose name I remember not. By west also of the Haling lieth the
 Port (the greatest of the three alreadie mentioned) and in this standeth
 Portsmouth and Ringsteed) whereof also our Leland, saieth thus: "Port
 Ile is cut from the shore by an arme of the maine hauen, which breaketh
 out about three miles aboue Portsmouth, and goeth vp two miles or more
 by morish ground to a place called Portbridge, which is two miles from
 Portsmouth." Then breaketh there out another creeke from the maine sea,
 about Auant hauen, which gulleth vp almost to Portbridge, and thence is
 the ground disseuered, so that Portsmouth standeth in a corner of this
 Ile, which Iland is in length six miles, and three miles in bredth,
 verie good for grasse and corne, not without some wood, and here and
 there inclosure. Beside this, there is also another Iland north
 northwest of Port Ile, which is now so worne and washed awaie with the
 working of the sea, that at the spring tides it is wholie couered with
 water, and thereby made vnprofitable. Finallie being past all these, and
 in compassing this gulfe, we come by an other, which lieth north of
 Hirst castell, & southeast of Kaie hauen, whereof I find nothing worthie
 to be noted, sauing that it wanteth wood, as Ptolomie affirmeth in his
 Geographicall tables of all those Ilands which enuiron our Albion.

 [Sidenote: Wight.]
 [Sidenote: Guidh.]
 The Wight is called in Latine Vectis, but in the British speach Guidh,
 that is to saie, Eefe or easie to be seene, or (as D. Caius saith)
 separate, bicause that by a breach of the sea, it was once diuided
 from the maine, as Sicilia was also from Italie, Anglesei from Wales,
 Foulenesse from Essex, & Quinborow from Kent. It lieth distant from the
 south shore of Britaine (where it is fardest off) by fiue miles & a
 halfe, but where it commeth neerest, not passing a thousand paces, and
 this at the cut ouer betweene Hirst castell and a place called Whetwell
 chine, as the inhabitants doo report. It conteineth in length twentie
 miles, and in bredth ten, it hath also the north pole eleuated by 50.
 degrees and 27. minutes, and is onelie 18. degrees in distance, and 50.
 od minuts from the west point, as experience hath confirmed, contrarie
 to the description of Ptolomie, and such as folow his assertions in the
 same. In forme, it representeth almost an eg, and so well is it
 inhabited with meere English at this present, that there are thirtie six
 townes, villages and castels to be found therein, beside 27.
 parish-churches, of which 15. or 16. haue their Parsons, the rest either
 such poore Vicars or Curats, as the liuings left are able to sustaine.

 It belongeth for temporall iurisdiction to the countie of Hamshire, but
 in spirituall cases it yeeldeth obedience to the see of Winchester,
 wherof it is a Deanerie. As for the soile of the whole Iland, it is
 verie fruitfull, for notwithstanding the shore of it selfe be verie full
 of rocks and craggie cliffes, yet there wanteth no plentie of cattell,
 corne, pasture, medow ground, wild foule, fish, fresh riuers, and
 pleasant woods, whereby the inhabitants may liue in ease and welfare. It
 was first ruled by a seuerall king, and afterwards wonne from the
 Britons by Vespasian the legat, at such time as he made a voiage into
 the west countrie. In processe of time also it was gotten from the
 Romans by the kings of Sussex, who held the souereigntie of the same,
 and kept the king thereof vnder tribute, till it was wonne also from
 them, in the time of Athelwold, the eight king of the said south region,
 by Ceadwalla, who killed Aruald that reigned there, and reserued the
 souereigntie of that Ile to himselfe and his successors for euermore. At
 this time also there were 1200. families in that Iland, whereof the said
 Ceadwalla gaue 300 to Wilfride sometime bishop of Yorke, exhorting him
 to erect a church there, and preach the gospell also to the inhabitants
 thereof, which he in like maner performed, but according to the
 prescriptions of the church of Rome, wherevnto he yeelded himselfe
 vassall and feudarie: so that this Ile by Wilfride was first conuerted
 to the faith, though the last of all other that hearkened vnto the word.
 After Ceadwalla, Woolfride the parricide was the first Saxon prince that
 aduentured to flie into the Wight for his safegard, whither he was
 driuen by Kenwalch of the Westsaxons, who made great warres vpon him,
 and in the end compelled him to go into this place for succour, as did
 also king Iohn, in the rebellious stir of his Barons, practised by the
 clergie: the said Iland being as then in possession of the Forts, as
 some doo write that haue handled it of purpose. The first Earle of this
 Iland that I doo read of, was one Baldwijne de Betoun, who married for
 his second wife, the daughter of William le Grosse Earle of Awmarle; but
 he dieng without issue by this ladie, she was maried the second time to
 Earle Maundeuille, and thirdlie to William de Fortes, who finished
 Skipton castell, which his wiues father had begun about the time of king
 Richard the first. Hereby it came to passe also, that the Forts were
 Earls of Awmarle, Wight, and Deuonshire a long time, till the ladie
 Elizabeth Fortes, sole heire to all those possessions came to age, with
 whom king Edward the third so preuailed through monie & faire words,
 that he gat the possession of the Wight wholie into his hands, & held it
 to himselfe & his successors, vntill Henrie the sixt, about the
 twentieth of his reigne, crowned Henrie Beauchamp sonne to the lord
 Richard Earle of Warwike king thereof and of Iardesey and Gardesey with
 his owne hands, and therevnto gaue him a commendation of the Dutchie of
 Warwike with the titles of Comes comitum Angliae, lord Spenser of
 Aburgauenie, and of the castell of Bristow (which castell was sometime
 taken from his ancestors by king Iohn) albeit he did not long enioy
 these great honors, sith he died 1446. without issue, and seuen yeeres
 after his father.

 After we be past the Wight, we go forward and come vnto Poole hauen,
 [Sidenote: Brunt Keysy.]
 wherein is an Ile, called Brunt Keysy, in which was sometime a
 parish-church, and but a chapell at this present, as I heare. There are
 also two other Iles, but as yet I know not their names.

 We haue (after we are passed by these) another Ile, or rather Byland
 [Sidenote: Portland.]
 also vpon the coast named Portland not far from Waymouth or the Gowy, a
 prettie fertile peece though without wood, of ten miles in circuit, now
 well inhabited, but much better heretofore, and yet are there about
 foure score housholds in it. There is but one street of houses therein,
 the rest are dispersed, howbeit they belong all to one parish-church,
 whereas in time past there were two within the compasse of the same.
 There is also a castell of the kings, who is lord of the Ile, although
 the bishop of Winchester be patrone of the church, the parsonage whereof
 is the fairest house in all the peece. The people there are no lesse
 excellent slingers of stones than were the Baleares, who would neuer
 giue their children their dinners till they had gotten the same with
 their slings, and therefore their parents vsed to hang their meate verie
 high vpon some bough, to the end that he which strake it downe might
 onlie haue it, whereas such as missed were sure to go without it, Florus
 lib. 3. cap. 8. Which feat the Portlands vse for the defense of their
 Iland, and yet otherwise are verie couetous. And wheras in time past
 they liued onlie by fishing, now they fall to tillage. Their fire bote
 is brought out of the Wight, and other places, yet doo they burne much
 cow doong dried in the sunne, for there is I saie no wood in the Ile,
 except a few elmes that be about the church. There would some grow
 there, no doubt, if they were willing to plant it, although the soile
 lie verie bleake and open. It is not long since this was vnited to the
 maine, and likelie yer long to be cut off againe.

 Being past this we raise another, also in the mouth of the Gowy,
 betweene Colsford and Lime, of which for the smalnesse thereof I make no
 great account. Wherefore giuing ouer to intreat any farther of it, I
 [Sidenote: Iardsey.]
 [Sidenote: Gardesey.]
 cast about to Iardsey, and Gardesey, which Iles with their appurtenances
 apperteined in times past to the Dukes of Normandie, but now they
 remaine to our Queene, as parcell of Hamshire and iurisdiction of
 Winchester, & belonging to hir crowne, by meanes of a composition made
 betweene K. Iohn of England and the K. of France, when the dominions of
 the said prince began so fast to decrease, as Thomas Sulmo saith.

 [Sidenote: Iardsey.]
 Of these two, Iardsey is the greatest, an Iland hauing thirtie miles in
 compasse, as most men doo coniecture. There are likewise in the same
 twelue parish-churches, with a colledge, which hath a Deane and
 Prebends. It is distant from Gardsey full 21. miles, or thereabouts, and
 made notable, by meanes of a bloudie fact doone there in Queene Maries
 daies, whereby a woman called Perotine Massie wife vnto an honest
 minister or preest, being great with childe by hir husband, was burned
 to ashes: through the exceeding crueltie of the Deane and Chapiter, then
 contending manifestlie against God for the mainteinance of their popish
 and antichristian kingdome. In this hir execution, and at such time as
 the fire caught holde of hir wombe, hir bellie brake, and there issued a
 goodly manchilde from hir, with such force that it fell vpon the cold
 ground quite beyond the heate and furie of the flame, which quicklie was
 [Sidenote: Horrible murther.]
 taken vp and giuen from one tormentor and aduersarie to an other to
 looke vpon, whose eies being after a while satisfied with the beholding
 thereof, they threw it vnto the carcase of the mother which burned in
 the fire, whereby the poore innocent was consumed to ashes, whom that
 [Sidenote: Gardsey.]
 furious element would gladlie haue left vntouched, & wherevnto it
 ministred (as you heare) an hurtlesse passage. In this latter also,
 there haue beene in times past, fine religious houses, and nine castels,
 howbeit in these daies there is but one parish-church left standing in
 the same. There are also certeine other small Ilands, which Henrie
 [Sidenote: S. Hilaries.]
 the second in his donation calleth Insulettas, beside verie manie rocks,
 whereof one called S. Hilaries (wherein sometime was a monasterie) is
 fast vpon Iardsey, another is named the Cornet, which hath a castel not
 [Sidenote: Cornet. Serke.]
 passing an arrow shot from Gardsey. The Serke also is betweene both,
 which is six miles about, and hath another annexed to it by an Isthmus
 or Strictland, wherein was a religious house, & therwithall great store
 of conies.

 [Sidenote: Brehoc.]
 [Sidenote: Gytho.]
 [Sidenote: Herme.]
 There is also the Brehoc, the Gytho, and the Herme, which latter is
 foure miles in compasse, and therein was sometime a Canonrie, that
 afterward was conuerted into a house of Franciscanes. There are two
 other likewise neere vnto that of S. Hilarie, of whose names I haue no
 [Sidenote: Burhoo, alias the Ile of rats.]
 notice. There is also the rockie Ile of Burhoo, but now the Ile of rats,
 so called of the huge plentie of rats that are found there, though
 [Sidenote: Turkie conies.]
 otherwise it be replenished with infinit store of conies, betweene whome
 and the rats, as I coniecture, the same which we call Turkie conies, are
 oftentimes produced among those few houses that are to be seene in this
 Iland. Some are of the opinion that there hath beene more store of
 building in this Ile than is at this present to be seene, & that it
 became abandoned through multitudes of rats, but hereof I find no
 perfect warrantise that I may safelie trust vnto, yet in other places I
 read of the like thing to haue happened, as in Gyara of the Cyclades,
 where the rats increased so fast that they draue away the people. Varro
 speaketh of a towne in Spaine that was ouerthrowne by conies. The
 Abderits were driuen out of Thracia by the increase of mice & frogs; and
 so manie conies were there on a time in the Iles Maiorca and Minorca
 (now perteining to Spaine) that the people began to starue for want of
 bread, and their cattell for lacke of grasse. And bicause the Ilanders
 were not able to ouercome them, Augustus was constreined to send an
 armie of men to destroie that needlesse brood. Plin. lib. 8. cap. 55.
 [Sidenote: Causes of the desolation of sundrie cities and townes.]
 A towne also in France sometime became desolate onelie by frogs and
 todes. Another in Africa by locustes and also by grashoppers, as Amicla
 was by snakes and adders. Theophrast telleth of an whole countrie
 consumed by the palmer-worme, which is like vnto an huge caterpiller.
 Plinie writeth of a prouince vpon the borders of AEthiopia made void of
 people by ants and scorpions, and how the citizens of Megara in Grecia
 were faine to leaue that citie through multitudes of bees, as waspes had
 almost driuen the Ephesians out of Ephesus. But this of all other
 (whereof AElianus intreateth) is most woonderfull, that when the
 Cretenses were chased out of a famous citie of their Iland by infinit
 numbers of bees, the said bees conuerted their houses into hiues, and
 made large combes in them which reached from wall to wall, wherein they
 reserued their honie. Which things being dulie considered, I doo not
 denie the possibilitie of the expulsion of the inhabitants out of the
 Ile of Burhoo by rats, although I say that I doo not warrant the effect,
 bicause I find it not set downe directlie in plaine words.

 [Sidenote: Alderney.]
 Beside this there is moreouer the Ile of Alderney a verie pretie plot,
 about seuen miles in compasse, wherin a preest not long since did find a
 [Sidenote: _Comment. Brit._]
 coffin of stone, in which lay the bodie of an huge giant, whose fore
 teeth were so big as a mans fist, as Leland dooth report. Certes this to
 me is no maruell at all, sith I haue read of greater, and mentioned them
 alreadie in the beginning of this booke. Such a tooth also haue they in
 Spaine wherevnto they go in pilgrimage as vnto S. Christophers tooth,
 but it was one of his eie teeth, if Ludouicus Viues say true, who went
 thither to offer vnto the same. S. August. de ciuit. lib. 15. cap. 9.
 writeth in like sort, of such another found vpon the coast of Vtica, and
 thereby gathereth that all men in time past were not onlie far greater
 than they be now, but also the giants farre exceeding the huge stature
 [Sidenote: _Iliad. 6._]
 and height of the highest of them all. Homer complaineth that men in his
 time were but dwarfes in comparison of such as liued in the wars of Troy.
 [Sidenote: _Iliad. 5. & 7._]
 See his fift Iliad, where he speaketh of Diomedes, and how he threw a
 stone at AEneas, (which 14. men of his time were not able to stirre) and
 [Sidenote: _Vergilius Aen. 12._]
 therewith did hit him on the thigh and ouerthrew him. Virgil also noteth
 no lesse in his owne deuise, but Iuvenal breefelie comprehendeth all
 this in his 15. Satyra, where he saith:

   Saxa inclinatis per humum quaesita lacertis
   Incipiunt torquere, domestica seditione
   Tela, nec hunc lapidem, quali se Turnus, & Aiax,
   Et quo Tytides percussit pondere coxam
   Aeneae: sed quem valeant emittere dextrae
   Illis dissimiles, & nostro tempore nata.
   Nam genus hoc viuo iam decrescebat Homero,
   Terra malos homines nunc educat, atque pusillos,
   Ergo Deus quicunque aspexit, ridet, & odit.

 But to returne againe vnto the Ile of Alderney, from whence I haue
 digressed. Herein also is a prettie towne with a parish-church, great
 plentie of corne, cattell, conies, and wilde foule, whereby the
 inhabitants doo reape much gaine and commoditie: onelie wood is their
 want, which they otherwise supplie. The language also of such as dwell
 in these Iles, is French; but the wearing of their haire long, & the
 attire of those that liued in Gardsey and Iardsey, vntill the time of
 king Henrie the eight, was all after the Irish guise. The Ile of Gardsey
 also was sore spoiled by the French 1371. and left so desolate, that
 onlie one castell remained therein vntouched.

 Beyond this, and neerer unto the coast of England (for these doo lie
 about the verie middest of the British sea) we haue one Iland called
 [Sidenote: Bruchsey.]
 the Bruch or the Bruchsey, lieng about two miles from Poole, whither men
 saile from the Fromouth, and wherein is nought else, but an old chapell,
 without any other housing.

 Next to this also are certeine rocks, which some take for Iles, as
 Illeston rocke neere vnto Peritorie, Horestan Ile a mile from Peritorie
 by south, Blacke rocke Ile southeast from Peritorie toward Teygnemouth,
 and also Chester, otherwise called Plegimundham: but how (to saie truth)
 or where this latter lieth, I cannot make report as yet, neuerthelesse
 sith Leland noteth them togither, I thinke it not my part to make
 separation of them.

 [Sidenote: Mount Iland.]
 From hence the next Ile is called Mount Iland, otherwise Mowtland,
 situate ouer against Lough, about two miles from the shore, and well
 neere three miles in compasse. This Iland hath no inhabitants, but
 onelie the warrenner and his dog, who looketh vnto the conies there:
 notwithstanding that vpon the coast thereof in time of the yeere, great
 store of pilchards is taken, and carried from thence into manie places
 of our countrie. It hath also a fresh well comming out of the rocks,
 which is worthie to be noted in so small a compasse of ground. Moreouer
 in the mouth of the creeke that leadeth vnto Lough, or Loow, as some
 [Sidenote: S. Nicholas Iland.]
 call it, there is another little Iland of about eight acres of ground
 called S. Nicholas Ile, and midwaie betweene Falmouth and Dudman (a
 [Sidenote: Greefe.]
 certeine Promontorie) is such another named the Greefe, wherein is great
 [Sidenote: Inis Prynin.]
 store of gulles & sea foule. As for Inis Prynin, it lieth within the
 Baie, about three miles from Lizards, and containeth not aboue two acres
 of ground, from which Newltjn is not far distant, and wherein is a poore
 fisher-towne and a faire wel-spring, wherof as yet no writer hath made
 mention. After these (omitting Pendinant in the point of Falmouth hauen)
 [Sidenote: S. Michaels mount.]
 we came at last to saint Michaels mount, whereof I find this description
 readie to my hand in Leland.

 The compasse of the root of the mount of saint Michael is not much more
 than halfe a mile, and of this the south part is pasturable and breedeth
 conies, the residue high and rockie soile. In the north side thereof
 also is a garden, with certeine houses and shops for fishermen.
 Furthermore, the waie to the mountaine lieth at the north side, and is
 frequented from halfe eb to halfe floud, the entrance beginning at the
 foot of the hill, and so ascending by steps and greeces westward, first;
 and then eastward to the vtter ward of the church. Within the same ward
 also is a court stronglie walled, wherein on the south side is a chapell
 of S. Michaell, and in the east side another of our ladie. Manie times a
 man may come to the hill on foot. On the north northwest side hereof
 also, is a Piere for botes and ships, and in the Baie betwixt the mount
 and Pensardz are seene at the lowe water marke, diuers roots and stubs
 of trees, beside hewen stone, sometimes of doores & windowes, which are
 perceiued in the inner part of the Baie, and import that there hath not
 onelie beene building, but also firme ground, whereas the salt water
 doth now rule and beare the maisterie. Beyond this is an other little
 [Sidenote: S. Clements Ile.]
 Ile, called S. Clements Ile, of a chapell there dedicated to that saint.
 It hath a little from it also the Ile called Mowshole, which is not
 touched in any Chard. As for Mowshole it selfe, it is a towne of the
 maine, called in Cornish Port Enis, that is, Portus insulae, whereof the
 said Ile taketh denomination, and in tin workes neere vnto the same
 there hath beene found of late, speare heds, battell axes, and swords of
 copper wrapped vp in linnen, and scarselie hurt with rust or other
 hinderance. Certes the sea hath won verie much in this corner of our
 Iland, but cheefelie betweene Mowshole and Pensardz.

 Hauing thus passed ouer verie neere all such Iles, as lie vpon the south
 coast of Britaine, and now being come vnto the west part of our
 countrie, a sudden Pirie catcheth hold of vs (as it did before, when we
 went to Iardsey) and carrieth vs yet more westerlie among the flats of
 [Sidenote: Sylley Iles or Syl.]
 Sylley. Such force dooth the southeast wind often shewe vpon poore
 trauellers in those parts, as the south and southwest dooth vpon
 strangers against the British coast, that are not skilfull of our rodes
 and harborowes. Howbeit such was our successe in this voiage, that we
 feared no rocks, more than did king Athelstane, when he subdued them
 (and soone after builded a colledge of preests at S. Burien, in
 performance of his vow made when he enterprised this voiage for his safe
 returne) nor anie tempest of weather in those parts that could annoie
 our passage. Perusing therefore the perils whereinto we were pitifullie
 plunged, we found the Syllane Ilands (places often robbed by the
 Frenchmen and Spaniards) to lie distant from the point of Cornewall,
 about three or foure hours sailing, or twentie English miles, as some
 men doo account it. There are of these (as I said) to the number of one
 hundreth fortie seauen in sight, whereof each one is greater or lesse
 than other, and most of them sometime inhabited: howbeit, there are
 twentie of them, which for their greatnesse and commodities exceed all
 the rest. Thereto (if you respect their position) they are situat in
 maner of a circle or ring, hauing an huge lake or portion of the sea in
 the middest of them, which is not without perill to such as with small
 aduisement enter into the same. Certes it passeth my cunning, either to
 name or to describe all these one hundreth fourtie seauen, according to
 their estate; neither haue I had anie information of them, more than I
 haue gathered by Leland, or gotten out of a map of their description,
 which I had sometime of Reginald Woolfe: wherfore omitting as it were
 all the rags, and such as are not worthie to haue anie time spent about
 their particular descriptions, I will onelie touch the greatest, and
 those that lie togither (as I said) in maner of a roundle.

 [Sidenote: S. Maries Ile.]
 The first and greatest of these therefore, called S. Maries Ile, is
 about fiue miles ouer, or nine miles in compasse. Therein also is a
 parish-church, and a poore towne belonging thereto, of threescore
 housholds, beside a castell, plentie of corne, conies, wild swans,
 puffens, gulles, cranes, & other kinds of foule in great abundance. This
 fertile Iland being thus viewed, we sailed southwards by the Norman
 [Sidenote: Agnus Ile.]
 rocke, and S. Maries sound vnto Agnus Ile, which is six miles ouer, and
 hath in like sort one towne or parish within the same of fiue or six
 housholds, beside no small store of hogs & conies of sundrie colours,
 verie profitable to their owners. It is not long since this Ile was left
 desolate, for when the inhabitants thereof returned from a feast holden
 in S. Maries Ile, they were all drowned, and not one person left aliue.
 [Sidenote: Annot.]
 There are also two other small Ilands, betweene this and the Annot,
 whereof I find nothing worthie relation: for as both of them ioind
 togither are not comparable to the said Annot for greatnesse and
 circuit, so they want both hogs and conies, wherof Annot hath great
 [Sidenote: Minwisand.]
 [Sidenote: Smithy sound.]
 [Sidenote: Suartigan.]
 [Sidenote: Rousuian.]
 [Sidenote: Rousuiar.]
 [Sidenote: Cregwin.]
 plentie. There is moreouer the Minwisand, from whence we passe by the
 Smithy sound (leauing three little Ilands on the left hand, vnto the
 Suartigan Iland, then to Rousuian, Rousuiar, and the Cregwin, which
 seauen are (for the most part) replenished with conies onelie, and wild
 garlike, but void of wood & other commodities, sauing of a short kind of
 grasse, or here & there some firzes wheron their conies doo feed.

 Leauing therefore these desert peeces, we incline a little toward the
 [Sidenote: Moncarthat.]
 [Sidenote: Inis Welseck.]
 [Sidenote: Suethiall.]
 [Sidenote: Rat Iland.]
 northwest, where we stumble or run vpon Moncarthat, Inis Welseck, &
 Suethiall. We came in like sort vnto Rat Iland, wherein are so manie
 monstrous rats, that if anie horsses, or other beasts, happen to come
 thither, or be left there by negligence but one night, they are sure to
 be deuoured & eaten vp, without all hope of recouerie. There is
 [Sidenote: Anwall. Brier.]
 moreouer the Anwall and the Brier, Ilands in like sort void of all good
 furniture, conies onelie excepted, and the Brier (wherein is a village,
 castell, and parish-church) bringeth foorth no lesse store of hogs, and
 wild foule, than Rat Iland doth of rats, whereof I greatlie maruell.

 [Sidenote: Rusco.]
 [Sidenote: Inis widd[=o].]
 By north of the Brier, lieth the Rusco, which hath a Labell or Byland
 stretching out toward the southwest, called Inis widdon. This Rusco is
 verie neere so great as that of S. Maries. It hath moreouer an hold, and
 a parish within it, beside great store of conies and wild foule, whereof
 they make much gaine in due time of the yeare. Next vnto this we come to
 [Sidenote: Round Iland. S. Lides.]
 the Round Iland, which is about a mile ouer, then to S. Lides Iland,
 (wherein is a parish-church dedicated to that Saint, beside conies,
 wood, and wild foule, of which two later there is some indifferent store)
 [Sidenote: Notho. Auing.]
 the Notho, the Auing, (one of them being situat by south of another, and
 the Auing halfe a mile ouer, which is a iust halfe lesse than the Notho)
 [Sidenote: Tyan.]
 and the Tyan, which later is a great Iland, furnished with a
 parish-church, and no small plentie of conies as I heare. After the Tyan
 [Sidenote: S. Martines.]
 we come to S. Martines Ile, wherein is a faire towne, the Ile it selfe
 being next vnto the Rusco for greatnesse, and verie well furnished with
 conies & fresh springs. Also betwixt this and S. Maries, are ten other,
 smaller, which reach out of the northeast into the southwest, as
 [Sidenote: Knolworth.]

 [Sidenote: Vollis. 2.]
 [Sidenote: Arthurs Ile.]
 [Sidenote: Guiniliuer.]
 [Sidenote: Nenech.]
 [Sidenote: Gothrois.]
 Knolworth, Sniuilliuer, Menwetham, Vollis. 1. Surwihe, Vollis. 2.
 Arthurs Iland, Guiniliuer, Nenech and Gothrois, whose estates are
 diuers: howbeit as no one of these is to be accounted great in
 comparison of the other, so they all yeeld a short grasse meet for
 sheepe and conies, as doo also the rest. In the greater Iles likewise
 (whose names are commonlie such as those of the townes or churches
 standing in the same) there are (as I here) sundry lakes, and those
 neuer without great plentie of wild foule, so that the Iles of Sylley,
 are supposed to be no lesse beneficiall to their lords, than anie other
 whatsoeuer, within the compasse of our Ile, or neere vnto our coasts.
 [Sidenote: Wild swine in Sylley.]
 In some of them also are wild swine. And as these Iles are supposed to
 be a notable safegard to the coast of Cornewall, so in diuerse of them
 great store of tin is likewise to be found. There is in like maner such
 plentie of fish taken among these same, that beside the feeding of their
 swine withall, a man shall haue more there for a penie, than in London
 for ten grotes. Howbeit their cheefe commoditie is made by Keigh, which
 they drie, cut in peeces, and carie ouer into little Britaine, where
 they exchange it there, for salt, canuas, readie monie, or other
 merchandize which they doo stand in need of. A like trade haue some of
 them also, with Buckhorne or dried whiting, as I heare. But sith the
 author of this report did not flatlie auouch it, I passe ouer that fish
 as not in season at this time. Thus haue we viewed the richest and most
 wealthie Iles of Sylley, from whence we must direct our course
 eastwards, vnto the mouth of the Sauerne, and then go backe againe vnto
 the west point of Wales, continuing still our voiage along vpon the west
 coast of Britaine, till we come to the Soluey whereat the kingdomes
 part, & from which foorth on we must touch such Ilands as lie vpon the
 west and north shore, till we be come againe vnto the Scotish sea, and
 to our owne dominions.

 [Sidenote: Helenus. Priamus.]
 From the point of Cornewall therefore, or promontorie of Helenus (so
 called, as some thinke, bicause Helenus the son of Priamus who arriued
 here with Brute lieth buried there, except the sea haue washed awaie his
 sepulchre) vntill we come vnto the mouth of Sauerne, we haue none Ilands
 at all that I doo know or heare of, but one litle Byland, Cape or
 Peninsula, which is not to be counted of in this place. And yet sith I
 [Sidenote: Pendinas.]
 haue spoken of it, you shall vnderstand, that it is called Pendinas, and
 beside that the compasse thereof is not aboue a mile, this is to be
 remembered farder thereof, how there standeth a Pharos or light therein,
 for ships which saile by those coasts in the night. There is also at the
 verie point of the said Pendinas, a chappell of saint Nicholas, beside
 the church of saint Ia, an Irish woman saint. It belonged of late to the
 Lord Brooke, but now (as I gesse) the Lord Mountioy enioieth it. There
 is also a blockhouse, and a peere in the eastside thereof, but the peere
 is sore choked with sand, as is the whole shore furthermore from S. Ies
 vnto S. Carantokes, insomuch that the greatest part of this Byland is
 now couered with sands, which the sea casteth vp, and this calamitie
 hath indured little aboue fiftie yeares, as the inhabitants doo affirme.

 There are also two rocks neere vnto Tredwy, and another not farre from
 Tintagell, all which many of the common sort doo repute and take for
 Iles: wherefore as one desirous to note all, I thinke it not best that
 these should be omitted: but to proceed. When we be come further, I
 meane vnto the Sauerne mouth, we meet the two Holmes, of which one is
 called Stepholme, and the other Flatholme, of their formes beeing in
 deed parcels of ground and low soiles fit for little else than to beare
 grasse for cattell, whereof they take those names. For Holme is an old
 Saxon word, applied to all such places. Of these also Stepholme lieth
 south of the Flatholme, about foure or fiue miles; the first also a mile
 and an halfe, the other two miles or thereabout in length; but neither
 of them a mile and an halfe in breadth, where they doo seeme to be the
 broadest.

 It should seeme by some that they are not worthie to be placed among
 Ilands: yet othersome are of opinion, that they are not altogither so
 base, as to be reputed amongst flats or rocks: but whatsoeuer they be,
 this is sure, that they oft annoie such passengers and merchants as
 passe and repasse vpon that riuer. Neither doo I read of any other Iles
 [Sidenote: Barri.]
 which lie by east of these, saue onelie the Barri, and Dunwen: the first
 [Sidenote: Barri is a flight shot from the shore.]
 of which is so called of one Barroc, a religious man (as Gyraldus saith)
 and is about a flight shot from the shore. Herin also is a rocke
 standing at the verie entrance of the cliffe, which hath a little rift
 or chine vpon the side, wherevnto if a man doo laie his eare, he shall
 heare a noise, as if smithes did worke at the forge, sometimes blowing
 with their bellowes, and sometimes striking and clinking with hammers,
 whereof manie men haue great wonder; and no maruell. It is about a mile
 in compasse, situat ouer against Aberbarry, and hath a chappell in it.

 [Sidenote: Dunwen.]
 Dunwen is so called of a church (dedicated to a Welsh woman saint,
 called Dunwen) that standeth there. It lieth more than two miles from
 Henrosser, right against Neuen, and hath within it two faire mils, &
 great store of conies. Certes if the sand increase so fast hereafter as
 it hath done of late about it, it will be vnited to the maine within a
 short season. Beyond these and toward the coast of southwales lie two
 other Ilands, larger in quantitie than the Holmes, of which the one is
 [Sidenote: Caldee.]
 called Caldee or Inis Pyr. It hath a parish-church with a spire steeple,
 and a pretie towne belonging to the countie of Pembroke, and
 iurisdiction of one Dauid in Wales. Leland supposeth the ruines that are
 found therein to haue beene of an old priorie sometimes called Lille,
 which was a cell belonging to the monasterie of S. Dogmael, but of this
 [Sidenote: Londy.]
 I can saie nothing. The other hight Londy, wherein is also a village or
 towne, and of this Iland the parson of the said towne is not onelie the
 captaine, but hath thereto weife, distresse, and all other commodities
 belonging to the same. It is little aboue sixteene miles from the coast
 of Wales, though it be thirtie from Caldee, and yet it serueth (as I am
 informed) lord and king in Deuonshire. Moreouer in this Iland is great
 plentie of sheepe, but more conies, and therewithall of verie fine and
 short grasse for their better food & pasturage; likewise much Sampere
 vpon the shore, which is carried from thence in barrels. And albeit that
 there be not scarslie fourtie housholds in the whole, yet the
 inhabitants there with huge stones (alredie prouided) may keepe off
 thousands of their enimies, bicause it is not possible for anie
 aduersaries to assaile them, but onelie at one place, and with a most
 dangerous entrance. In this voiage also we met with two other Ilands,
 one of them called Shepes Ile, the other Rat Ile; the first is but a
 little plot lieng at the point of the Baie, before we come at the
 Blockehouse which standeth north of the same, at the verie entrie into
 Milford hauen vpon the eastside. By north also of Shepes Ile, and
 betweene it & Stacke rocke, which lieth in the verie middest of the
 hauen, at another point is Rat Ile yet smaller than the former, but what
 [Sidenote: Schalmey.]
 commodities are to be found in them as yet I cannot tell. Schalmey the
 greater and the lesse lie northwest of Milford hauen a good waie. They
 belong both to the crowne, but are not inhabited, bicause they be so
 [Sidenote: Schoncold.]
 often spoiled with pirates. Schoncold Ile ioineth vnto great Schalmey,
 and is bigger than it, onlie a passage for ships parteth them, whereby
 they are supposed to be one: Leland noteth them to lie in Milford hauen.
 Beside these also we found the Bateholme, Stockeholme, Midland, and
 Gresholme Iles, and then doubling the Wellock point, we came into a
 Baie, where we saw saint Brides Iland, and another in the Sound betweene
 Ramsey and the point, of all which Iles and such rocks as are offensiue
 to mariners that passe by them, it may be my hap to speake more at large
 hereafter.

 [Sidenote: Limen or Ramsey.]
 Limen (as Ptolomie calleth it) is situat ouer against S. Dauids in Wales
 (wherevnto we must needs come, after we be past another little one,
 which some men doo call Gresholme) & lieth directlie west of Schalmey.
 In a late map I find this Limen to be called in English Ramsey: Leland
 also confirmeth the same, and I cannot learne more thereof, than that it
 is much greater than anie of the other last mentioned (sithens I
 described the Holmes) and for temporall iurisdiction a member of
 Penbrookeshire, as it is vnto S. Dauids for matters concerning the
 church. Leland in his commentaries of England lib. 8. saieth that it
 contained three Ilets, whereof the bishop of S. Dauids is owner of the
 greatest, but the chanter of S. Dauids claimeth the second, as the
 archdeacon of Cairmarden dooth the third. And in these is verie
 excellent pasture for sheepe and horses, but not for other horned beasts
 which lacke their vpper teeth by nature (whose substance is conuerted
 into the nourishment of their hornes) and therefore cannot bite so low.
 [Sidenote: Mawr.]
 Next vnto this Ile we came to Mawr, an Iland in the mouth of Mawr, scant
 a bow shoot ouer, and enuironed at the low water with fresh, but at the
 high with salt, and here also is excellent catching of herings.

 After this, proceeding on still with our course, we fetched a compasse,
 going out of the north toward the west, and then turning againe (as the
 coast of the countrie leadeth) vntill we sailed full south, leauing the
 shore still on our right hand, vntill we came vnto a couple of Iles,
 which doo lie vpon the mouth of the Soch, one of them being distant (as
 we gessed) a mile from the other, and neither of them of anie greatnesse
 almost worthie to be remembred. The first that we came vnto is called
 [Sidenote: Tudfall.]
 Tudfall, and therein is a church, but without anie parishioners, except
 they be sheepe and conies. The quantitie thereof also is not much aboue
 [Sidenote: Penthlin.]
 six acres of ground, measured by the pole. The next is Penthlin, Myrach,
 or Mererosse, situat in maner betwixt Tudfall or Tuidall and the shore,
 and herein is verie good pasture for horsses, wherof (as I take it) that
 [Sidenote: Guelyn.]
 name is giuen vnto it. Next vnto them, we come vnto Gwelyn, a little Ile
 which lieth southeast of the fall of Daron or Daren, a thing of small
 quantitie, and yet almost parted in the mids by water, and next of all
 vnto Bardsey an Iland lieng ouer against Periuincle the southwest point
 or promontorie of Northwales (where Merlin Syluestris lieth buried) and
 whither the rest of the monks of Bangor did flie to saue themselues,
 when 2100. of their fellowes were slaine by the Saxon princes in the
 quarell of Augustine the monke, & the citie of Caerleon or Chester raced
 to the ground, and not since reedified againe to anie purpose. Ptolomie
 calleth this Iland Lymnos, the Britons Enlhi, and therein also is a
 parish-church, as the report goeth. From hence we cast about, gathering
 still toward the northest, till we came to Caer Ierienrhod, a notable
 rocke situat ouer against the mouth of the Leuenni, wherein standeth a
 strong hold or fortresse, or else some towne or village. Certes we could
 not well discerne whether of both it was, bicause the wind blew hard at
 southwest, the morning was mistie, and our
 mariners doubting some flats to be couched not far from thence, hasted
 awaie vnto Anglesei, whither we went a pace with a readie wind euen at
 our owne desire.

 This Iland (which Tacitus mistaketh no doubt for Mona Caesaris, and so
 dooth Ptolomie as appeareth by his latitudes) is situat about two miles
 from the shore of Northwales. Paulus Iouius gesseth that it was in time
 [Sidenote: Anglesei cut from Wales by working of the sea.]
 past ioined to the continent, or maine of our Ile, and onelie cut off by
 working of the Ocean, as Sicilia peraduenture was from Italie by the
 violence of the Leuant or practise of some king that reigned there.
 Thereby also (as he saith) the inhabitants were constreind at the first
 to make a bridge ouer into the same, till the breach waxed so great,
 that no such passage could anie longer be mainteined. But as these
 things doo either not touch my purpose at all, or make smallie with the
 [Sidenote: Anglesei.]
 present description of this Ile: so (in comming to my matter) Anglesei is
 found to be full so great as the Wight, and nothing inferiour, but
 rather surmounting it, as that also which Caesar calleth Mona in
 fruitfulnesse of soile by manie an hundred fold. In old time it was
 reputed and taken for the common granarie to Wales, as Sicilia was to
 Rome and Italie for their prouision of corne. In like maner the Welshmen
 themselues called it the mother of their countrie, for giuing their
 minds wholie to pasturage, as the most easie and lesse chargeable trade,
 they vtterlie neglected tillage, as men that leaned onelie to the
 fertilitie of this Iland for their corne, from whence they neuer failed
 to receiue continuall abundance. Gyraldus saith that the Ile of Anglesei
 was no lesse sufficient to minister graine for the sustentation of all
 the men of Wales, than the mountaines called Ereri or Snowdoni in
 Northwales were to yeeld plentie of pasture for all the cattell
 whatsoeuer within the aforesaid compasse, if they were brought togither
 and left vpon the same. It contained moreouer so manie townes welneere,
 as there be daies in a yeare, which some conuerting into Cantreds haue
 accompted but for three, as Gyraldus saith. Howbeit as there haue beene
 I say 363. townes in Anglesei, so now a great part of that reckoning is
 vtterlie shroonke, and so far gone to decaie, that the verie ruines of
 them are vnneath to be seene & discerned: and yet it seemeth to be
 meetlie well inhabited. Leland noting the smalnesse of our hundreds in
 comparison to that they were in time past, addeth (so far as I remember)
 that there are six of them in Anglesei, as Menay, Maltraith, Liuon,
 Talbellion, Torkalin, and Tindaithin: herevnto Lhoid saith also how it
 belonged in old time vnto the kingdome of Guinhed or Northwales, and
 that therein at a towne called Aberfraw, being on the southwestside of
 the Ile, the kings of Gwinhed held euermore their palaces, whereby it
 came to passe, that the kings of Northwales were for a long time called
 kings of Aberfraw, as the Welshmen named the kings of England kings of
 London, till better instruction did bring them farther knowledge.

 There are in Anglesei many townes and villages, whose names as yet I
 cannot orderlie atteine vnto: wherefore I will content my selfe with the
 rehearsall of so many as we viewed in sailing about the coasts, and
 otherwise heard report of by such as I haue talked withall. Beginning
 therefore at the mouth of the Gefni (which riseth at northeast aboue
 Gefni or Geuenni, 20. miles at the least into the land) we passed first
 by Hundwyn, then by Newborow, Port-Hayton, Beaumarrais, Penmon, Elian,
 Almwoch, Burric (whereby runneth a rill into a creeke) Cornew, Holihed
 (standing in the promontorie) Gwifen, Aberfraw, and Cair Cadwalader, of
 all which, the two latter stand as it were in a nuke betweene the
 Geuenni water, and the Fraw, wherevpon Aberfraw is situate. Within the
 Iland we heard onelie of Gefni afore mentioned, of Gristial standing
 vpon the same water, of Tefri, of Lanerchimedh, Lachtenfarwy and
 Bodedrin, but of all these the cheefe is now Beaumarais, which was
 builded sometime by king Edward the first, and therewithall a strong
 castell about the yeare 1295. to keepe that land in quiet. There are
 also as Leland saith 31. parish-churches beside 69. chappels, that is, a
 hundreth in all. But heerof I can saie little, for lacke of iust
 instruction. In time past, the people of this Ile vsed not to seuerall
 their grounds, but now they dig stonie hillocks, and with the stones
 thereof they make rude walles, much like to those of Deuonshire, sith
 they want hedge bote, fire bote, and house bote, or (to saie at one
 word) timber, bushes and trees. As for wine, it is so plentifull and
 good cheape there most commonlie as in London, through the great
 recourse of merchants from France, Spaine, and Italie vnto the aforesaid
 Iland. The flesh likewise of such cattell as is bred there, wherof we
 haue store yearelie brought vnto Cole faire in Essex is most delicate,
 by reason of their excellent pasture, and so much was it esteemed by the
 Romans in time past, that Columella did not onelie commend and preferre
 them before those of Liguria, but the emperours themselues being neere
 hand also caused their prouision to be made for nete out of Anglesei, to
 feed vpon at their owne tables as the most excellent beefe. It taketh
 now the name of Angles and Ei, which is to meane the Ile of Englismen,
 bicause they wan it in the Conquerors time, vnder the leading of Hugh
 earle of Chester, and Hugh of Shrewesburie. Howbeit they recouered it
 againe in the time of William Rufus, when they spoiled the citie of
 Glocester, ransacked Shrewesburie, and returned home with great bootie
 and pillage, in which voiage also they were holpen greatlie by the
 Irishmen, who after three yeares ioined with them againe, and slue the
 earle of Shrewesburie (which then liued) with great crueltie. The
 Welshmen call it Tiremone and Mon, and herein likewise is a promontorie
 [Sidenote: Holie head, or Cair kiby.]
 or Byland, called Holie head (which hath in time past beene named Cair
 kyby, of Kyby a monke that dwelled there) from whence the readiest
 passage is commonlie had out of Northwales to get ouer into Ireland, of
 which Ile I will not speake at this time, least I shuld bereaue another
 of that trauell. Yet Plinie saith, lib. 4. cap. 16. that it lieth not
 farre off from and ouer against the Silures, which then dwelled vpon the
 west coast of our Iland, and euen so farre as Dunbritton, and beyond:
 [Sidenote: Enilsnach, holie Ile.]
 but to our Cair kybi. The Britons named it Enylsnach, or holie Ile, of
 the number of carcases of holie men, which they affirme to haue beene
 buried there. But herein I maruell not a little, wherein women had
 offended, that they might not come thither, or at the least wise returne
 from thence without some notable reproch or shame vnto their bodies. By
 south also of Hilarie point, somewhat inclining toward the east, lieth
 Inis Lygod, a small thing (God wot) and therefore not worthie great
 remembrance: neuertheles not to be omitted, though nothing else inforced
 the memoriall thereof, but onelie the number and certeine tale of such
 Iles as lie about our Iland. I might also speake of the Ile Mail Ronyad,
 which lieth north west of Anglesei by sixe miles; but bicause the true
 name hereof, as of manie riuers and streames are to me vnknowne, I am
 the more willing to passe them ouer in silence, least I should be noted
 to be farther corrupter of such words as I haue no skill to deliuer and
 exhibit in their kind. And now to conclude with the description of the
 whole Iland, this I will ad moreouer vnto hir commodities, that as there
 are the best milstones of white, red, blew, and greene greets,
 (especiallie in Tindaithin) so there is great gaines to be gotten by
 fishing round about this Ile, if the people there could vse the trade:
 but they want both cunning and diligence to take that matter in hand.
 And as for temporall regiment, it apperteineth to the countie of
 Cairnaruon, so in spirituall cases it belongeth to the bishoprike of
 Bangor. This is finallie to be noted of Anglesei, that sundrie earthen
 [Sidenote: Ancient buriall.]
 pots are often found there of dead mens bones conuerted into ashes, set
 with the mouthes downeward contrarie to the vse of other nations, which
 turned the brims vpwards, whereof let this suffice.

 Hauing thus described Anglesei, it resteth to report furthermore, how
 that in our circuit about the same, we met with other little Ilets, of
 which one lieth northwest thereof almost ouer against Butricke mouth, or
 the fall of the water, that passeth by Butricke. The Britons called it
 [Sidenote: Adar.]
 [Sidenote: Moil.]
 [Sidenote: Rhomaid.]
 [Sidenote: Ysterisd.]
 [Sidenote: Adros.]
 [Sidenote: Lygod.]
 Ynis Ader, that is to say, the Ile of birds in old time, but now it
 hight Ynis Moil, or Ynis Rhomaid, that is the Ile of porpasses. It hath
 to name likewise Ysterisd, and Adros. Being past this, we came to the
 second lieng by north east, ouer against the Hilarie point, called Ynis
 Ligod, that is to saie, the Ile of Mise, and of these two this latter is
 the smallest, neither of them both being of any greatnesse to speake of.
 [Sidenote: Seriall.]
 [Sidenote: Prestholme.]
 Ynis Seriall or Prestholme, lieth ouer against Penmon, or the point
 called the head of Mon, where I found a towne (as I told you) of the
 same denomination. Ptolomie nameth not this Iland, whereof I maruell. It
 is parcell of Flintshire, and of the iurisdiction of S. Asaph, and in
 fertilitie of soile, and breed of cattell, nothing inferiour vnto
 Anglesei hir mother: although that for quantitie of ground it come
 infinitelie short thereof, and be nothing comparable vnto it. The last
 Iland vpon the cost of Wales, hauing now left Anglesei, is called
 [Sidenote: Credine.]
 Credine, and although it lie not properlie within the compasse of my
 description, yet I will not let to touch it by the waie, sith the causey
 thither from Denbighland, is commonlie ouerflowne. It is partlie made an
 Iland by the Conwey, and partlie by the sea. But to proceed, when we had
 viewed this place, we passed foorth to S. Antonies Ile, which is about
 two or three miles compasse or more, a sandie soile, but yet verie
 batable for sheepe and cattell, it is well replenished also with fresh
 wels, great plentie of wild foule, conies and quarries of hard ruddie
 stone, which is oft brought thence to Westchester, where they make the
 foundations of their buildings withall. There are also two parish
 churches in the same, dedicated to S. Antonie and S. Iohn, but the
 people are verie poore, bicause they be so oft spoiled by pirats,
 although the lord of the same be verie wealthie thorough the exchange
 made with them of his victuals, for their wares, whereof they make good
 peniworths, as theeues commonlie doo of such preies as they get by like
 escheat, notwithstanding their landing there is verie dangerous, and
 onelie at one place. Howbeit they are constreined to vse it, and there
 to make their marts. From hence we went on, vntill we came to the cape
 [Sidenote: Hilberie.]
 of Ile Bree, or Hilberie, and point of Wyrale, from whence is a common
 passage into Ireland, of 18. or 20. houres sailing, if the wether be not
 tedious. This Iland at the full sea is a quarter of a mile from the
 land, and the streame betweene foure fadams deepe, as ship-boies haue
 oft sounded, but at a lowe water a man may go ouer thither on the sand.
 The Ile of it selfe is verie sandie a mile in compasse, and well stored
 with conies, thither also went a sort of supersticious fooles in times
 past, in pilgrimage, to our ladie of Hilberie, by whose offerings a cell
 of monkes there, which belonged to Chester, was cherished and
 mainteined.

 The next Iland vpon the coast of England is Man or Mona Caesaris, which
 some name Mana or Manim, but after Ptolomie, Monaoida, as some thinke,
 though other ascribe that name to Anglesei, which the Welshmen doo
 commonlie call Mon, as they doo this Manaw. It is supposed to be the
 first, as Hirtha is the last of the Hebrides. Hector Boetius noteth a
 difference betweene them of 300. miles. But Plinie saith that Mona is
 200000. miles from Camaldunum, lib. 2. cap. 75. It lieth also vnder 53.
 degrees of latitude, and 30. minuts, and hath in longitude 16. degrees
 and 40. minuts, abutting on the north side vpon S. Ninians in Scotland,
 Furnesfels on the east, Prestholme and Anglesei on the south, and
 Vlsther in Ireland on the west. It is greater than Anglesei by a third,
 and there are two riuers in the same, whose heads doo ioine so neere,
 that they doo seeme in maner to part the Ile in twaine. Some of the
 [Sidenote: Eubonia.]
 [Sidenote: Meuania.]
 ancient writers, as Ethicus, &c: call it Eubonia, and other following
 Orosius, Meuana or Maeuania, howbeit after Beda and the Scotish
 histories, the Meuaniae are all those Iles aforesaid called the Hebrides,
 Eubonides, or Hebudes (whereof William Malmesburie, lib. 1. de regibus
 (beside this our Mona) will haue Anglesei also to be one. Wherefore it
 seemeth hereby that a number of our late writers ascribing the said name
 vnto Mona onelie, haue not beene a little deceiued. Iornandes lib. de
 Getis speaketh of a second Meuania; "Habet & aliam Meuaniam (saith he)
 necnon & Orchadas." But which should be prima, as yet I do not read,
 except it should be Anglesei; and then saith Malmesburie well. In like
 sort Propertius speaketh of a Meuania, which he called Nebulosa, but he
 meaneth it euidentlie of a little towne in Vmbria where he was borne,
 lib. 4. eleg. De vrbe Rom. Wherfore there needeth no vse of his
 authoritie. This in the meane time is euident out of Orosius, lib. 1.
 capite 2. that Scots dwelled somtime in this Ile, as also in Ireland,
 which Ethicus also affirmeth of his owne time, and finallie confirmeth
 that the Scots and Irish were sometime one people. It hath in length 24.
 miles, and 8. in bredth, and is in maner of like distance from Galloway
 in Scotland, Ireland and Cumberland in England, as Buchanan reporteth.

 In this Iland also were some time 1300. families, of which 960. were in
 the west halfe, and the rest in the other. But now through ioining house
 to house & land to land (a common plague and canker, which will eat vp
 all, if prouision be not made in time to withstand this mischeefe) that
 number is halfe diminished, and yet many of the rich inhabiters want
 roome, and wote not how and where to bestowe themselues, to their quiet
 contentations. Certes this impediment groweth not by reason that men
 were greater in bodie, than they haue beene in time past, but onelie for
 that their insatiable desire of inlarging their priuate possessions
 increaseth still vpon them, and will doo more, except they be
 restrained: but to returne to our purpose. It was once spoiled by the
 Scots in the time of king Athelstane, cheeflie by Anlafus in his flight
 from the bloudie battell, wherein Constantine king of Scotland was
 ouercome: secondlie by the Scots 1388. after it came to the possession
 of the English, for in the beginning the kings of Scotland had this
 Iland vnder their dominion, almost from their first arriuall in this
 Iland, and as Beda saith till Edwine king of the Northumbers wan it from
 them, and vnited it to his kingdome. After the time of Edwine, the Scots
 gat the possession thereof againe, and held it till the Danes & Norwaies
 wan it from them, who also kept it (but with much trouble) almost 370.
 yeares vnder the gouernance of their viceroies, whome the kings of
 Norwaie inuested vnto that honor, till Alexander the third king of that
 name in Scotland recouered it from them, with all the rest of those Iles
 that lie vpon the west coast, called also Sodorenses in the daies of
 Magnus king of Norwaie. And sithens that time the Scotish princes haue
 not ceased to giue lawes to such as dwelled there, but also from time to
 time appointed such bishops as should exercise ecclesiasticall
 iurisdiction in the same, till it was won from them by our princes, and
 [Sidenote: _Chronica Tinemuthi._]
 so vnited vnto the realme of England. Finallie, how after sundrie sales
 bargains and contracts of matrimonie (for I read that William Scroope
 the kings Vicechamberleine, did buy this Ile and crowne thereof of the
 lord William Montacute earle of Sarum) it came vnto the ancestours of
 the earles of Darbie, who haue beene commonlie said to be kings of Man,
 the discourse folowing shall more at large declare. Giraldus noteth a
 contention betweene the kings of England & Ireland for the right of this
 Iland, but in the end, when by a comprimise the triall of the matter was
 referred to the liues or deaths of such venemous wormes as should be
 brought into the same, and it was found that they died not at all, as
 the like doo in Ireland, sentence passed with the king of England, & so
 he reteined the Iland. But howsoeuer this matter standeth, and whether
 anie such thing was done at all or not, sure it is that the people of
 the said Ile were much giuen to witchcraft and sorcerie (which they
 learned of the Scots a nation greatlie bent to that horrible practise)
 in somuch that their women would oftentimes sell wind to the mariners,
 inclosed vnder certeine knots of thred, with this iniunction, that they
 which bought the same, should for a great gale vndoo manie, and for the
 [Sidenote: Tall men in Man.]
 lesse a fewer or smaller number. The stature of the men and also
 fertilitie of this Iland are much commended, and for the latter supposed
 verie neere to be equall with that of Anglesei, in all commodities.

 There are also these townes therein, as they come now to my remembrance,
 Rushen, Dunglasse, Holme towne, S. Brids, Bala cury (the bishops house)
 S. Mich. S. Andrew, kirk Christ, kirk Louel, S. Mathees, kirk S. Anne,
 Pala sala, kirk S. Marie, kirk Concane, kirk Malu, and Home. But of all
 these Rushen with the castell is the strongest. It is also in recompense
 [Sidenote: Riuers.]
 of the common want of wood, indued with sundrie pretie waters, as first
 of al the Burne rising in the northside of Warehill botoms, and
 branching out by southwest of kirk S. An, it seemeth to cut off a great
 part of the eastside thereof, from the residue of that Iland. From those
 hils also (but of the south halfe) commeth the Holme and Holmey, by a
 towne of the same name, in the verie mouth whereof lieth the Pile afore
 mentioned. They haue also the Bala passing by Bala cury, on the
 westside, and the Rame on the north, whose fall is named Ramesei hauen,
 as I doo read in Chronicles.

 [Sidenote: Hilles.]
 There are moreouer sundrie great hils therein, as that wherevpon S.
 Mathees standeth, in the northeast part of the Ile, a parcell whereof
 commeth flat south, betweene kirk Louell, and kirk Marie, yeelding out
 of their botoms the water Bala, whereof I spake before. Beside these and
 well toward the south part of the Ile, I find the Warehils, which are
 extended almost from the west coast ouertwhart vnto the Burne streame.
 [Sidenote: Hauens.]
 It hath also sundrie hauens, as Ramsei hauen, by north Laxam hauen, by
 east Port Iris, by southwest Port Home, and Port Michell, by west. In
 [Sidenote: Calfe of man.]
 [Sidenote: The pile.]
 [Sidenote: S. Michels Ile.]
 like sort there are diuers Ilets annexed to the same, as the Calfe of
 man on the south, the Pile on the west, and finallie S. Michels Ile
 [Sidenote: Sheepe.]
 in the gulfe called Ranoths waie in the east. Moreouer the sheepe of
 this countrie are exceeding huge, well woolled, and their tailes of such
 [Sidenote: Hogs.]
 greatnesse as is almost incredible. In like sort their hogs are in maner
 [Sidenote: Barnacles.]
 monstrous. They haue furthermore great store of barnacles breeding vpon
 their coasts, but yet not so great store as in Ireland, and those (as
 there also) of old ships, ores, masts, peeces of rotten timber as they
 saie, and such putrified pitched stuffe, as by wrecke hath happened to
 corrupt vpon that shore. Howbeit neither the inhabitants of this Ile,
 [Sidenote: Barnacles neither fish nor flesh.]
 nor yet of Ireland can readilie saie whether they be fish or flesh, for
 although the religious there vsed to eat them as fish, yet elsewhere,
 some haue beene troubled, for eating of them in times prohibited for
 heretikes and lollards.

 For my part, I haue beene verie desirous to vnderstand the vttermost of
 the breeding of barnacls, & questioned with diuers persons about the
 same. I haue red also whatsoeuer is written by forren authors touching
 the generation of that foule, & sought out some places where I haue
 beene assured to see great numbers of them: but in vaine. Wherefore I
 vtterlie despaired to obteine my purpose, till this present yeare of
 Grace 1584. and moneth of Maie, wherein going to the court at Greenewich
 from London by bote, I saw sundrie ships lieng in the Thames newlie come
 home, either from Barbarie or the Canarie Iles (for I doo not well
 remember now from which of these places) on whose sides I perceiued an
 infinit sort of shells to hang so thicke as could be one by another.
 Drawing neere also, I tooke off ten or twelue of the greatest of them, &
 afterward hauing opened them, I saw the proportion of a foule in one of
 them more perfectlie than in all the rest, sauing that the head was not
 yet formed, bicause the fresh water had killed them all (as I take it)
 and thereby hindered their perfection. Certeinelie the feathers of the
 taile hoeng out of the shell at least two inches, the wings (almost
 perfect touching forme) were garded with two shels or sheeldes
 proportioned like the selfe wings, and likewise the brestbone had hir
 couerture also of like shellie substance, and altogither resembling the
 figure which Lobell and Pena doo giue foorth in their description of
 this foule: so that I am now fullie persuaded that it is either the
 barnacle that is ingendred after one maner in these shels, or some other
 sea-foule to vs as yet vnknowen. For by the feathers appearing and forme
 so apparant, it cannot be denied, but that some bird or other must
 proceed of this substance, which by falling from the sides of the ships
 in long voiages, may come to some perfection. But now it is time for me
 to returne againe vnto my former purpose.

 [Sidenote: Bishop of Man.]
 There hath sometime beene, and yet is a bishop of this Ile, who at the
 first was called Episcopus Sodorensis, when the iurisdiction of all the
 Hebrides belonged vnto him. Whereas now he that is bishop there, is but
 a bishops shadow, for albeit that he beare the name of bishop of Man,
 yet haue the earles of Darbie, as it is supposed, the cheefe profit of
 his see (sauing that they allow him a little somewhat for a flourish)
 [Sidenote: Patrone of Man.]
 notwithstanding that they be his patrons, and haue his nomination vnto
 that liuing. The first bishop of this Ile was called Wimundus or
 Raymundus, and surnamed Monachus Sauinensis, who by reason of his
 extreame and tyrannicall crueltie toward the Ilanders, had first his
 sight taken from him, & then was sent into exile. After him succeeded
 another moonke in king Stephens daies called Iohn, and after him one
 Marcus, &c: other after other in succession, the see it selfe being now
 also subiect to the archbishop of Yorke for spirituall iurisdiction.
 [Sidenote: King of Man.]
 In time of Henrie the second, this Iland also had a king, whose name was
 Cuthred, vnto whome Vinianus the cardinall came as legate 1177. and
 wherin Houeden erreth not. In the yeare also 1228. one Reginald was
 viceroy or petie king of Man, afterward murthered by his subiects. Then
 Olauus, after him Hosbach the sonne of Osmond Hacon, 1290. who being
 slaine, Olauus and Gotredus parted this kingdome of Sodora, in such
 wise, that this had all the rest of the Iles, the other onelie the Ile
 of Man at the first; but after the slaughter of Gotredus, Olauus held
 all, after whom Olauus his sonne succeeded. Then Harald sonne to Olauus,
 who being entered in Maie, and drowned vpon the coastes of Ireland, his
 brother Reginald reigned twentie and seuen daies, and then was killed
 the first of June, whereby Olauus alias Harald sonne to Gotred ruled in
 the Ile one yeare. Next vnto him succeeded Magnus the second sonne of
 Olauus, and last of all Iuarus, who held it so long as the Norwaies were
 lords thereof. But being once come into the hands of the Scots, one
 Godred Mac Mares was made lieutenant, then Alane, thirdlie Maurice
 Okarefer, and fourthlie one of the kings chapleines, &c. I would gladlie
 haue set downe the whole catalog of all the viceroyes and lieutenants:
 but sith I can neither come by their names nor successions, I surcesse
 to speake any more of them, and also of the Ile it selfe, whereof this
 may suffice.

 After we haue in this wise described the Ile of Man, with hir
 commodities, we returned eastwards backe againe unto the point of
 Ramshed, where we found to the number of six Ilets of one sort and
 other, whereof the first greatest and most southwesterlie, is named
 [Sidenote: Wauay.]
 the Wauay. It runneth out in length, as we gessed, about fiue miles and
 more from the southeast into the northwest, betweene which and the maine
 land lie two little ones, whose names are Oldborrow and Fowlney. The
 [Sidenote: Fouldra.]
 fourth is called the Fouldra, and being situate southeast of the first,
 it hath a prettie pile or blockhouse therin, which the inhabitants name
 [Sidenote: Fola.]
 [Sidenote: Roa.]
 the pile of Fouldra. By east thereof in like sort lie the Fola and the
 Roa, plots of no great compasse, and yet of all these six, the first and
 Fouldra are the fairest and most fruitfull. From hence we went by
 [Sidenote: Rauenglasse.]
 Rauenglasse point, where lieth an Iland of the same denomination, as
 Reginald Wolfe hath noted in his great card, not yet finished, nor
 likelie to be published. He noteth also two other Ilets, betweene the
 same and the maine land; but Leland speaketh nothing of them (to my
 remembrance) neither any other card, as yet set foorth of England: and
 thus much of the Ilands that lie vpon our shore in this part of my
 voiage.

 Hauing so exactlie as to me is possible, set downe the names and
 positions of such Iles, as are to be found vpon the coast of the Queenes
 Maiesties dominions, now it resteth that we proceed orderlie with those
 [Sidenote: Iles in Scotland.]
 that are seene to lie vpon the coast of Scotland, that is to saie, in
 the Irish, the Deucalidonian & the Germans seas, which I will performe
 in such order as I may, sith I cannot do so much therin as I would. Some
 therefore doo comprehend and diuide all the Iles that lie about the
 north coast of this Ile now called Scotland into three parts, sauing
 that they are either occidentals, the west Iles, alias the Orchades &
 Zelandine, or the Shetlands. They place the first betweene Ireland and
 the Orchades, so that they are extended from Man and the point of
 Cantire almost vnto the Orchades in the Deucalidonian sea, and after
 some are called the Hebrides. In this part the old writers indeed placed
 [Sidenote: Hemodes of some called Acmodes,
 see _Plinie, Mela, Martianus, Capella,
 Plutarch. de defect. orac._]
 the Hebrides or Hemodes, which diuers call the Hebudes and the Acmodes;
 albeit the writers varie in their numbers, some speaking of 30 Hebudes
 and seuen Hemodes; some of fiue Ebudes, as Solinus, and such as follow
 his authoritie. Howbeit the late Scottish writers doo product a summe of
 more than 300 of these Ilands in all, which sometime belonged to the
 Scots, sometime to the Norwegians, and sometime to the Danes. The first
 of these is our Manaw, of which I haue before intreated: next vnto this
 is Alisa a desert Ile, yet replenished with conies, soland foule, and a
 fit harbor for fishermen that in time of the yeare lie vpon the coast
 thereof for herings. Next vnto this is the Arran, a verie hillie and
 craggie soile, yet verie plentifull of fish all about the coast, and
 wherein is a verie good hauen: ouer against the mouth whereof lieth the
 Moll, which is also no small defence to such seafaring men as seeke
 harbor in that part. Then came we by the Fladwa or Pladwa, no lesse
 fruitfull and stored with conies than the Bota, Bura, or Botha, of eight
 miles long & foure miles broad, a low ground but yet verie batable, and
 wherein is good store of short and indifferent pasture: it hath also a
 towne there called Rosse, and a castell named the Camps. There is also
 another called the Marnech, an Iland of a mile in length, and halfe a
 mile in breadth, low ground also but yet verie fertile. In the mouth
 likewise of the Glot, lieth the more Cumber and the lesse, not farre in
 sunder one from another, and both fruitfull inough the one for corne,
 and the other for Platyceraton. The Auon another Iland lieth about a
 mile from Cantire, and is verie commodious to ships, wherof it is called
 Auon, that is to saie, Portuosa, or full of harbor: and therefore the
 Danes had in time past great vse of it. Then haue we the Raclind, the
 Kyntar, the Cray, the Gegaw six miles in length and a mile and a halfe
 in breadth; the Dera full of deere, and not otherwise vnfruitfull: and
 therefore some thinke that it was called the Ile of deere in old time.
 [Sidenote: Scarba.]
 Scarba foure miles in length, and one in breadth, verie little
 inhabited, and thereinto the sea betweene that and the Ile of deere is
 so swift and violent, that except it be at certeine times, it is not
 easilie nauigable. Being past these, we come to certeine Ilands of no
 great fame, which lie scattered here and there, as Bellach, Gyrastell,
 Longaie, both the Fiolas, the three Yarues, Culbrenin, Duncomell, Lupar,
 Belnaua, Wikerua, Calfile, Luing, Sele Ile, Sound, of which the last
 three are fruitfull, and belong to the earle of Argile. Then haue we the
 [Sidenote: Slate Ile.]
 Slate, so called of the tiles that are made therin. The Nagsey, Isdalf,
 and the Sken (which later is also called Thian, of a wicked herbe
 growing there greatlie hurtfull, and in colour not much vnlike the
 lillie, sauing that it is of a more wan and feeble colour) Vderga, kings
 Ile, Duffa or blacke Ile, Kirke Ile and Triarach. There is also the Ile
 Ard, Humble Ile, Greene Ile, and Heth Ile, Arbor Ile, Gote Ile, Conies
 Ile alias idle Ile, Abrid Ile or bird Ile, and Lismor, wherein the
 bishop of Argill sometime held his palace, being eight miles in length
 and two miles in breadth, and not without some mines also of good
 mettall. There is also the Ile Ouilia, Siuna, Trect, Shepey, Fladaw,
 Stone Ile, Gresse, great Ile, Ardis, Musadell, & Berner, sometime called
 the holie sanctuarie, Vghe Ile, Molochasgyr, and Drinacha, now
 ouergrowne with bushes, elders, and vtterlie spoiled by the ruines of
 such great houses as haue heretofore beene found therin. There is in
 like sort the Wijc, the Ranse, and the Caruer.

 [Sidenote: Ila.]
 In this tract also, there are yet three to intreat of, as Ila, Mula and
 Iona, of which the first is one of the most, that hath not beene least
 accounted of. It is not much aboue 24 miles in length, and in breadth 16
 reaching from the south into the north, and yet it is an exceeding rich
 plot of ground verie plentious of corne, cattell, deere, and also lead,
 and other mettals, which were easie to be obteined, if either the people
 were industrious, or the soile yeeldable of wood to fine and trie out
 the same. In this Iland also there is a lake of sweet water called the
 Laie, and also a baie wherein are sundrie Ilands; and therevnto another
 lake of fresh water, wherein the Falangam Ile is situate, wherein the
 souereigne of all the Iles sometime dwelled. Neere vnto this is the
 [Sidenote: Round Ile.]
 round Ile, so called of the consultations there had: for there was a
 court sometime holden, wherein 14 of the principall inhabitants did
 minister iustice vnto the rest, and had the whole disposition of things
 committed vnto them, which might rule vnto the benefit of those Ilands.
 There is also the Stoneheape, an other Iland so called of the heape of
 stones that is therein. On the south side also of Ila, we find moreouer
 the Colurne, Mulmor, Osrin, Brigidan, Corkerke, Humble Ile, Imersga,
 Bethy, Texa, Shepeie, Naosig, Rinard, Cane, Tharscher, Aknor, Gret Ile,
 Man Ile, S. Iohns Ile, and Stackbed. On the west side thereof also lieth
 Ouersey, whereby runneth a perilous sea, and not nauigable, but at
 certeine houres, Merchant Ile, Vsabrast, Tanask, Neff, Wauer Ile,
 Oruans, Hog Ile, and Colauanso.

 [Sidenote: Mula.]
 Mula is a right noble Ile, 24 miles in length and so manie in bredth,
 rough of soile, yet fruitfull enough: beside woods, deere, & good
 harbrough for ships, replenished with diuers and sundrie townes and
 castels. Ouer against Columkill also, it hath two riuers, which yeld
 verie great store of salmons, and other riuellets now altogither
 vnfruitfull, beside two lakes, in each of which is an Iland: and
 likewise in euerie of these Ilands a castell. The sea beating vpon this
 Ile, maketh foure notable baies wherein great plentie and verie good
 herrings are taken. It hath also in the northwest side Columbria, or the
 Ile of doues; on the southeast, Era: both verie commodious for fishing,
 cattell, and corne. Moreouer, this is woorth the noting in this Ile
 aboue all the rest, that it hath a plesant spring, arising two miles in
 distance from the shore, wherein are certeine little egs found, much
 like vnto indifferent pearles, both for colour and brightnesse, and
 thereto full of thicke humour, which egs being carried by violence of
 the fresh water vnto the salt, are there within the space of twelue
 houres conuerted into great shels, which I take to be mother pearle;
 except I be deceiued.

 [Sidenote: Iona.]
 Iona was sometime called Columkill, in fame and estimation nothing
 inferiour to anie of the other, although in length it exceed little
 aboue two miles, and in breadth one. Certes it is verie fruitfull of all
 such commodities, as that climat wherein it standeth dooth yeeld, and
 beareth the name of Columbus the abbat, of whome I haue spoken more at
 large in my Chronologie. There were somtimes also two monasteries
 therein, one of moonks builded by Fergus, another of nuns: and a parish
 church, beside many chappels builded by the Scotish kings, and such
 princes as gouerned in the Iles. And when the English had once gotten
 possession of the Ile of Manaw, a bishops see was erected in the old
 monasterie of Columbus, whereby the iurisdiction of those Iles was still
 mainteined and continued. Certes there remaine yet in this Iland the old
 burials apperteining to the most noble families that had dwelled in the
 west Iles; but three aboue other are accompted the most notable, which
 haue little houses builded vpon them. That in the middest hath a stone,
 [Sidenote: Regum tumuli.]
 whereon is written, Tumuli regum Scotiae, The burials of the kings of
 Scotland: for (as they saie) fourtie eight of them were there interred.
 Another is intituled with these words, The burials of the kings of
 Ireland, bicause foure of them lie in that place. The third hath these
 words written thereon, The graues of the kings of Norwaie, for there
 eight of them were buried also, and all through a fond suspicion
 conceiued of the merits of Columbus. Howbeit in processe of time, when
 Malcolme Cammor had erected his abbeie at Donfermeling, he gaue occasion
 to manie of his successors to be interred there.

 About this Iland there lie six other Iles dispersed, small in quantitie,
 but not altogither barren, sometimes giuen by the kings of Scotland and
 lords of the Iles vnto the abbeie of saint Columbus, of which the Soa,
 albeit that it yeeld competent pasturage for sheepe, yet is it more
 commodious, by such egs as the great plentie of wildfoule there breeding
 [Sidenote: The Ile of Shrewes.]
 doo laie within the same. Then is there the Ile of Shrewes or of women;
 as the more sober heads doo call it. Also Rudan, & next vnto that, the
 Rering. There is also the Shen halfe a mile from Mula, whose bankes doo
 swarme with conies: it hath also a parish church, but most of the
 inhabitants doo liue and dwell in Mula. There is also the Eorse or the
 Arse, and all these belong vnto saint Columbus abbeie. Two miles from
 Arse is the Olue, an Iland fiue miles in length, and sufficientlie stored
 with corne and grasse, & not without a good hauen for ships to lie and
 harbor in. There is also the Colfans, an iland fruitfull inough, and full
 of cornell trees. There is not far off also the Gomater, Stafa, the two
 [Sidenote: Mosse Ile.]
 Kerneburgs, and the Mosse Ile, in the old Brittish speech called Monad,
 that is to saie Mosse. The soile of it is verie blacke, bicause of the
 corruption & putrefaction of such woods as haue rotted thereon: wherevpon
 also no small plentie of mosse is bred and ingendered. The people in like
 maner make their fire of the said earth, which is fullie so good as our
 English turffe. There is also the Long, & six miles further toward the
 west, Tirreie, which is eight miles in length and three in breadth, & of
 all other one of the most plentifull for all kinds of commodities: for it
 beareth corne, cattell, fish, and seafowle aboundantlie. It hath also a
 well of fresh water, a castell, and a verie good hauen for great vessels
 to lie at safegard in. Two miles from this also is the Gun, and the Coll
 two miles also from the Gun. Then passed we by the Calfe, a verie wooddie
 Iland, the foure greene Iles, the two glasse or skie Ilands, the Ardan,
 the Ile of woolfes, & then the great Iland which reacheth from the east
 into the west, is sixteene miles in length, and six in breadth, full of
 mounteins and swelling woods: and for asmuch as it is not much inhabited,
 the seafoules laie great plentie of egs there, whereof such as will, may
 gather what number them listeth. Vpon the high cliffes and rocks also the
 Soland geese are taken verie plentifullie. Beyond this, about foure
 miles also is the Ile of horsses: and a little from that the hog Iland,
 which is not altogither vnfruitfull. There is a falcon which of custome
 breedeth there, and therevnto it is not without a conuenient hauen. Not
 farre off also is the Canna, and the Egga, little Iles, but the later
 full of Soland geese. Likewise the Sobratill, more apt to hunt in than
 meet for anie other commoditie that is to be reaped thereby.

 [Sidenote: Skie.]
 After this we came to the Skie, the greatest Ile about all Scotland: for
 it is two and fortie miles long; and somewhere eight, & in some places
 twelue miles broad: it is moreouer verie hillie, which hilles are
 therevnto loaden with great store of wood, as the woods are with
 pasture, the fields with corne and cattell; and (besides all other
 commodities) with no small heards of mares, whereby they raise great
 aduantage and commoditie. It hath fiue riuers verie much abounding with
 salmons, and other fresh streams not altogither void of that prouision.
 It is inuironed also with manie baies, wherein great plentie of herrings
 is taken in time of the yeere. It hath also a noble poole of fresh
 water; fiue castels and sundrie townes; as Aie, S. Iohns, Dunwegen, S.
 Nicholas, &c. The old Scots called it Skianacha, that is, Winged, but
 now named Skie. There lie certeine small Ilands about this also, as
 Rausa a batable soile for corne & gras; Conie Iland full of woods and
 conies; Paba a theeuish Iland, in whose woods theeues do lurke to rob
 such as passe by them. Scalpe Ile, which is full of deere; Crowling,
 wherein is verie good harbour for ships; Rarsa, full of beechen woods
 and stags, being in length seuen miles, and two in breadth. The Ron, a
 woodie Ile and full of heath: yet hath it a good hauen, which hath a
 little Iland called Gerloch on the mouth thereof, and therein lurke
 manie theeues. There is not farre off from this Ron, to wit about six
 miles also, the Flad, the Tiulmen, Oransa, Buie the lesse, and Buie the
 more and fiue other little trifling Iles, of whose names I haue no
 notice.

 After these we come vnto the Ise, a pretie fertile Iland, to the Oue, to
 the Askoome, to the Lindill. And foure score miles from the Skie towards
 the west, to the Ling, the Gigarmen, the Berner, the Magle, the Pable,
 the Flad, the Scarpe, the Sander, the Vateras, which later hath a noble
 hauen for great ships, beside sundrie other commodities: and these nine
 last rehearsed are vnder the dominion of the bishop of the Iles. After
 [Sidenote: Bar.]
 this we come to the Bar, an Iland seauen miles in length, not
 vnfruitfull for grasse and corne, but the chiefe commoditie thereof
 lieth by taking of herrings, which are there to be had abundantlie. In
 one baie of this Iland there lieth an Islet, and therein standeth a
 strong castell. In the north part hereof also is an hill which beareth
 good grasse from the foot to the top, and out of that riseth a spring,
 which running to the sea, doth carrie withall a kind of creature not yet
 perfectlie formed, which some do liken vnto cockels; and vpon the shore
 where the water falleth into the sea, they take vp a kind of shelfish,
 when the water is gone, which they suppose to be ingendred or increased
 after this manner. Betweene the Barre and the Visse lie also these
 Ilands, Orbaus, Oue, Hakerset, Warlang, Flad, the two Baies, Haie,
 Helsaie, Gigaie, Lingaie, Fraie, Fudaie, and Friskaie. The Visse is
 thirtie miles long and six miles broad; and therein are sundrie fresh
 waters, but one especiallie of three miles in length: neuerthelesse, the
 sea hath now of late found a waie into it, so that it cannot be kept off
 with a banke of three score foot, but now and then it will flowe into
 the same, and leaue sea-fish behind it in the lake. There is also a fish
 bred therein almost like vnto a salmon, sauing that it hath a white
 bellie, a blacke backe, and is altogither without scales: it is likewise
 a great harbour for theeues and pirats.

 Eight miles beyond this lieth the Helscher, appertinent to the nuns of
 Iona: then haue we the Hasker, verie plentifullie benefited by seales,
 which are there taken in time of the yeere. Three score miles from this
 also is the Hirth, whose inhabitants are rude in all good science and
 religion; yet is the Iland verie fruitfull in all things, and bringeth
 foorth sheepe farre greater than are else-where to be found, for they
 are as big as our fallow deare, horned like bugles, and haue their
 tailes hanging to the ground. He that is owner of this Ile, sendeth ouer
 his bailiffe into the same at midsummer, to gather in his duties, and
 [Sidenote: Baptisme without preests.]
 with him a preest to saie masse, and to baptise all the children borne
 since that time of the yeere precedent: or if none will go ouer with him
 (bicause the voiage is dangerous) then doth each father take paine to
 baptise his owne at home. Their rents are paid commonlie in dried seales
 and sea foule. All the whole Ile is not aboue a mile euerie waie; and
 except three mounteines that lie vpon one part of the shore, such as
 dwell in the other Iles can see no part thereof.

 Being past the Visse, we came after to Walaie, the Soa, the Strome, to
 Pabaie, to Barner, Ensaie, Killiger, the two Sagas, the Hermodraie,
 Scarfe, Grie, Ling, Gilling, Heie, Hoie, Farlaie, great So, little So,
 Ise, Sein the more, Sein the lesse, Tarant, Slegan, Tuom, Scarpe,
 Hareie, and the seauen holie Ilands, which are desert and breed nothing
 [Sidenote: Wild sheepe.]
 but a kind of wild sheepe, which are often hunted, but seldome or neuer
 eaten. For in steed of flesh they haue nothing but tallow; and if anie
 flesh be, it is so vnsauorie, that few men care to eate of it, except
 great hunger compell them. I suppose, that these be the wild sheepe
 which will not be tamed; and bicause of the horrible grenning thereof,
 [Sidenote: Tigers.]
 is taken for the bastard tiger. Their haire is betweene the wooll of a
 sheepe, and the haire of a goat, resembling both, shacked, and yet
 absolutelie like vnto neither of both: it maie be also the same beast
 which Capitolinus calleth Ouis fera, shewed in the time of Gordian the
 emperour; albeit that some take the same for the Camelopardalis: but
 hereof I make no warrantise.

 There is also not farre off the Garuell, the Lambe, the Flad, the
 Kellas, the two Bernars, the Kirt, the two Buies, the Viraie, the
 [Sidenote: Ile of Pigmeies.]
 Pabaie, the two Sigrams, and the Ile of Pigmeies (which is so called
 vpon some probable coniecture) for manie little sculs and bones are
 dailie there found deepe in the ground, perfectlie resembling the bodies
 of children; & not anie of greater quantities, wherby their coniecture
 (in their opinion) is the more likelie to be true. There is also the
 Fabill Ile, Adams Ile, the Ile of Lambes, Hulmes, Viccoll, Haueraie,
 Car, Era, Columbes Ile, Tor Ile, Iffurd, Scalpe, Flad, and the Swet; on
 whose east side is a certeine vault or caue, arched ouer, a flight shoot
 in length, wherevnto meane ships do vse to runne for harbour with full
 saile when a tempest ouertaketh them, or the raging of the sea, in those
 parts do put them in danger of wrecke. Also we passed by the old castell
 Ile, which is a pretie and verie commodious plat for fish, foule, egges,
 corne, and pasture. There is also the Ile Eust or Eu, which is full of
 wood, and a notable harbour for theeues, as is also the Grinort;
 likewise the preests Ile, which is verie full of sea foule and good
 pasture. The Afull, the two Herbrerts, to wit, the greater and the
 lesse; and the Iles of Horsses, and Mertaika: and these 8 lie ouer
 against the baie which is called the Lake Brian. After this, we go
 toward the north, and come to the Haraie, and the Lewis or the Leug,
 both which make (in truth) but one Iland of three score miles in length,
 and sixteene in breadth, being distinguished by no water, but by huge
 woods, bounds, and limits of the two owners that doo possesse those
 parts. The south part is called Haraie, and the whole situate in the
 [Sidenote: Lewis called Thule by Tacitus, with no
 better authoritie than the Angleseie Mona.]
 Deucalidon sea, ouer against the Rosse, & called Thule by Tacitus,
 wherein are manie lakes, and verie pretie villages, as lake Erwijn,
 lake Vnsalsago: but of townes, S. Clements, Stoie, Nois, S. Columbane,
 Radmach, &c. In like sort, there are two churches, whereof one is
 dedicated to saint Peter, an other to S. Clement, beside a monasterie
 called Roadill. The soile also of this Ile is indifferent fruitfull; but
 they reape more profit vnder the ground than aboue, by digging. There is
 neither woolfe, fox, nor serpent seene in this Iland; yet are there great
 woods therein, which also separate one part from the other. Likewise
 there be plentie of stags, but farre lesse in quantitie than ours: and in
 the north part of the Iland also is a riuer which greatlie aboundeth with
 salmons. That part also called Lewisa, which is the north half of the Ile
 is well inhabited toward the sea coasts, and hath riuers no lesse
 plentifull for salmon than the other halfe. There is also great store of
 herrings taken, whereof the fisher men doo raise great gaine and
 commoditie; and no lesse plentie of sheepe, which they doo not sheere,
 but plucke euerie yeere; yet is the ground of this part verie heathie,
 and full of mosse, and the face thereof verie swart and blacke, for the
 space of a foot in depth, through the corruption of such woods as in time
 past haue rotted on the same. And therefore in time of the yeere they
 conuert it into turffe to burne, as neede shall serue; and in the yeere
 after, hauing well doonged it in the meane time with slawke of the sea,
 they sowe barleie in the selfe places where the turffes grew, and reape
 [Sidenote: Tithe whales.]
 verie good corne, wherewith they liue and feed. Such plentie of whales
 also are taken in this coast, that the verie tithe hath beene knowne, in
 some one yeere, to amount vnto seauen and twentie whales of one
 greatnesse and other. This is notable also in this part of the Ile, that
 there is a great caue two yards deepe of water when the sea is gone, and
 not aboue foure when it is at the highest; ouer which great numbers doo
 sit of both sexes and ages, with hooks and lines, and catch at all times
 an infinite deale of fish, wherewith they liue, and which maketh them
 also the more idle.

 Being past this about sixtie miles, we come vnto the Rona, or Ron, which
 some take for the last of the Hebrides, distant (as I said) about fortie
 miles from the Orchades, and one hundreth and thirtie from the
 promontorie of Dungisbe. The inhabitants of this Ile are verie rude and
 irreligious, the lord also of the soile dooth limit their number of
 housholds, & hauing assigned vnto them what numbers of the greater and
 smaller sorts of cattell they shall spend and inioie for their owne
 prouision, they send the ouerplus yeerlie vnto him to Lewis. Their
 cheefe paiments consist of a great quantitie of meale, which is verie
 plentifull among them, sowed vp in sheepes skins. Also of mutton and sea
 foule dried, that resteth ouer and aboue, which they themselues do
 spend. And if it happen that there be more people in the Iland than the
 lords booke or rate dooth come vnto, then they send also the ouerplus of
 them in like maner vnto him: by which means they liue alwaies in
 plentie. They receiue no vices from strange countries, neither know or
 heare of anie things doone else-where than in their owne Iland. Manie
 whales are taken also vpon their coasts, which are likewise replenished
 with seale, and porpasse, and those which are either so tame, or so
 fierce, that they abash not at the sight of such as looke vpon them,
 neither make they anie hast to flie out of their presence.

 [Sidenote: Suilscraie.]
 Beyond this Ile, about 16 miles westward, there is another called
 Suilscraie, of a mile length, void of grasse, and without so much as
 heath growing vpon hir soile: yet are there manie cliffes and rocks
 therein, which are couered with blacke mosse, whereon innumerable sorts
 of foules do breed and laie their egs. Thither in like sort manie doo
 saile from Lewissa, to take them yoong in time of the yeare, before they
 be able to flie, which they also kill and drie in eight daies space, and
 then returne home againe with them, and great plentie of fethers
 gathered in this voiage. One thing is verie strange and to be noted in
 [Sidenote: Colke foule.]
 this Iland, of the Colke foule, which is little lesse than a goose; and
 this kind commeth thither but once in the yeare, to wit, in the spring,
 to laie hir egs and bring vp hir yoong, till they be able to shift for
 themselues, & then they get them awaie togither to the sea, and come no
 more vntill that time of the yeere which next insueth. At the same
 season also they cast their fethers there, as it were answering tribute
 to nature for the vse of hir mossie soile: wherein it is woonderfull to
 see, that those fethers haue no stalkes, neither anie thing that is hard
 in them, but are seene to couer their bodies as it were wooll or downe,
 till breeding time (I saie) wherein they be left starke naked.

 [Sidenote: Orchades.]
 The Orchades (whose first inhabitants were the Scithians, which came
 from those Iles where the Gothes did inhabit, as some sparks yet
 remaining among them of that language doo declare) lie partlie in the
 Germaine, and partlie in the Calidon seas, ouer against the point of
 Dunghisbie (being in number eight and twentie, or as other saie thirtie
 & one, yet some saie thirtie three, as Orosius, but Plinie saith fortie)
 and now belonging to the crowne of Scotland, as are the rest whereof
 heeretofore I haue made report, since we crossed ouer the mouth of the
 Solueie streame, to come into this countrie. Certes the people of these
 Islands reteine much of their old sparing diets, and therevnto they are
 of goodlie stature, tall, verie comelie, healthfull, of long life, great
 strength, whitish colour, as men that feed most vpon fish; sith the cold
 is so extreame in those parts, that the ground bringeth foorth but small
 store of wheate, and in maner verie little or no fuell at all, wherewith
 to warme them in the winter, and yet it seemeth that (in times past)
 some of these Ilands also haue beene well replenished with wood, but now
 they are without either tree or shrub, in steed whereof they haue
 plentie of heath, which is suffered to grow among them, rather thorough
 their negligence, than that the soile of it selfe will not yeeld to
 bring forth trees & bushes. For what store of such hath beene in times
 past, the roots yet found and digged out of the ground doo yeeld
 sufficient triall. Otes they haue verie plentifullie, but greater store
 of barleie, wherof they make a nappie kind of drinke, and such indeed,
 as will verie readilie cause a stranger to ouershoot himselfe. Howbeit
 this may be vnto vs in lieu of a miracle, that although their drinke be
 neuer so strong, & they themselues so vnmeasurable drinkers (as none are
 [Sidenote: If he speake all in truth.]
 more) yet it shall not easilie be seene (saith Hector) that there is
 anie drunkard among them, either frantike, or mad man, dolt, or naturall
 foole, meet to weare a cockescombe.

 This vnmeasurable drinking of theirs is confessed also by Buchanan, who
 noteth, that whensoeuer anie wine is brought vnto them from other
 soiles, they take their parts thereof aboundantlie. He addeth moreouer,
 how they haue an old bole (which they call S. Magnus bole, who first
 preached Christ vnto them) of farre greater quantitie than common boles
 are, and so great, that it may seeme to be reserued since the Lapithane
 banket, onelie to quaffe and drinke in. And when anie bishop commeth
 vnto them, they offer him this bole full of drinke, which if he be able
 to drinke vp quite at one draught; then they assure themselues of good
 lucke, and plentie after it. Neuerthelesse this excesse is not often
 found in the common sort, whom penurie maketh to be more frugall; but in
 their priests, and such as are of the richer calling. They succour
 pirats also, and verie often exchange their vittels with their
 commodities, rather for feare and want of power to resist (their Ilands
 lieng so scattered) than for anie necessitie of such gains as they doo
 get by those men: for in truth, they thinke themselues to haue little
 need of other furniture than their owne soiles doo yeeld and offer vnto
 them. This is also to be read of the inhabitants of these Ilands, that
 ignorance of excesse is vnto the most part of them in steed of physicke;
 and labour and trauell a medicine for such few diseases as they are
 molested and incombred withall.

 In like sort they want venemous beasts, cheefelie such as doo delight in
 hotter soile, and all kinds of ouglie creatures. Their ewes also are so
 full of increase, that some doo vsuallie bring foorth two, three, or
 foure lambes at once, whereby they account our anelings (which are such
 as bring foorth but one at once) rather barren than to be kept for anie
 gaine. As for wild and tame foules, they haue such plentie of them, that
 the people there account them rather a burthen to their soile, than a
 benefit to their tables: they haue also neat and gotes, whereby they
 abound in white meat, as butter and cheese: wherein, next vnto fish, the
 cheefe part of their sustenance dooth consist. There is also a bishop of
 the Orchades, who hath his see in Pomona the cheefe of all the Ilands,
 wherein also are two strong castels, and such hath beene the
 superstition of the people here, that there is almost no one of them,
 that hath not one church at the least dedicated to the mother of Christ.
 Finallie, there is little vse of physicke in these quarters, lesse store
 of eeles, and least of frogs. As for the horsses that are bred amongst
 them, they are commonlie not much greater than asses, and yet to labour
 and trauell, a man shall find verie few else-where, able to come neere,
 much lesse to match with them, in holding out their iournies. The seas
 about these Ilands are verie tempestuous, not onelie through strong
 winds, and the influences of the heauens and stars; but by the contrarie
 meetings and workings of the west ocean, which rageth so vehementlie in
 the streicts, that no vessell is able to passe in safetie amongst them.
 Some of these Ilands also are so small and low, that all the commoditie
 which is to be reaped by anie of them, is scarselie sufficient to
 susteine one or two men: and some of them so barren and full of rocks,
 that they are nothing else but mosse or bare shingle. Wherefore onelie
 thirteene of them are inhabited and made account of, the rest being left
 vnto their sheepe and cattell. Of all these Ilands also Pomona is the
 greatest, and therfore called the continent, which conteineth thirtie
 miles in length, and is well replenished with people: for it hath twelue
 parish churches, and one towne which the Danes (sometime lords of that
 [Sidenote: Kirkwa.]
 Iland) called Cracouia: but now it hight Kirkwa. There are also two
 pretie holds, one belonging to the king, the other to the bishop: and
 also a beautifull church, and much building betweene the two holds, and
 about this church, which being taken as it were for two townes, the one
 is called the kings and the other the bishops towne. All the whole Iland
 is full of cliffes and promontories, whereby no small number of baies
 and some hauens are producted.

 There is also tin and lead to be found in six of these Iles, so good and
 plentifullie as anie where else in Britaine. It lieth foure & twentie
 miles from Cathnesse, being separated from the same by the Pictish sea:
 wherein also lie certeine Ilands, as Stroma, foure miles from Cathnesse,
 which albeit that it be but foure miles from Cathnesse, is not reputed
 for anie of the Orchades. Going therefore from hence northward, we come
 to the first Ile of the Orchades, called south Rauals, which is sixteene
 miles from Dunghilsbie, alias Dunachisbie, & that in two houres space,
 such is the swiftnesse of the sea in that tract. This Ile is fiue miles
 long, and hath a faire port called saint Margarets hauen. Then passe we
 by two desert Iles, which lie towards the east, wherein nothing is found
 but cattell: some call them the holmes, bicause they lie low, and are
 good for nothing but grasse. On the northside lieth the Bur, and two
 other holmes betweene the same & Pomona. From Bur, toward the west lie
 three Iles, Sun, Flat, and Far: and beyond them Hoie and Vall, which
 some accompt for two, and other but for one; bicause that in March and
 September, the flats that lie betweene them, doo seeme to ioine them
 togither, after the tide is gone. This neuerthelesse is certeine, that
 in this single or double Ile, which is ten miles in length, the highest
 hilles are to be seene that are in all the Orchades. And as they lie
 eight miles from Rauals, so are they two miles from Pomona, & from saint
 Donats in Scotland full twentie miles, and on the north side of it lieth
 the Brainse, in a narrow streict, as Buchanan dooth remember. And these
 are the Iles which lie betweene Pomona and Cathnesse. As for the west
 side of the continent, I find that it lieth open to the sea, without
 either shelues, Ilands, or rocks appeering neere vnto it: but on the
 east side thereof Cobesa dooth in maner ouershadow it. Siapinsa also an
 Ile of six miles long, lieth within two miles of Cracouia, toward the
 east, on the west side of Pomona lieth the Rouse of six miles in length:
 and by east of that, the Eglisa, wherin (as they saie) their patrone S.
 Magnus lieth interred. From hense southward lie the Vera, Gersa, and not
 far off the Vester (which is fourescore miles from Hethland) Papa &
 Stronza, which is also eightie miles from Hethland as is the Vester. In
 the middest also of this tract lieth Far, or Fara, which is to saie,
 faire Ile, in old English, faire eie: and within sight so well of
 Hethland, as the Orchades (by reason of three insuperable rocks which
 are apparant in the same) a verie poore Iland, and yet yearelie robbed
 of such commodities as it hath by such Flemish and English fishermen as
 passe by the coasts thereof in time of the yeare, to catch fish for the
 prouision of their countries.

 Next vnto this is the greatest of all the Hethlands, an Iland called the
 Maine, sixtie miles in length, and sixteene in bredth, full of rocks,
 and whose coasts are onelie inhabited, the innermost parts being left
 vnto the foules of the aire, bicause of the barrennesse and
 vnfruitfulnesse of the soile: yet of late some haue indeuoured to
 impeople it, but with no successe correspondent to their desire.
 Wherefore they returned to their former trades, making their cheefe
 commoditie and yearelie gaine by fish, as aforetime. Ten miles from this
 toward the north, lieth the Zeale, twentie miles in length, eight in
 bredth, and so wild that it will suffer no creature to liue thereof,
 that is not bred therein. Betweene this Iland also and the Maine, are
 other smaller Ilands to be found, as the Ling, Orne, Big, and Sanferre.
 And from hense nine miles northward Vsta, twentie miles long, & six in
 bredth, plaine, pleasant, but inuironed with a swift and terrible sea.
 Betweene this also and the Zeale, are the Vie, the Vre, and the Ling:
 also towards the west, the two Skeues, Chalseie, Nordwade, Brase, and
 Mowse, on the west side lie the west Skeies, Rottia, Papa the lesse,
 Wunned, Papa the more, Valla, Londra, Burra, Haura the more, Haura the
 lesse, & in maner so manie holmes dispersed heere and there, whereof I
 haue no notice. Some call these the Shetland, and some the Shotland
 Iles. Buchanan nameth them in the third member of his diuision
 Zelandine, and toward the end of his first booke seemeth to auouch, that
 they liue in maner as doo the inhabitants of the Orchades: although not
 in so ciuill wise, nor in such large measure and aboundance of diet in
 their houses. He addeth moreouer, that their apparrell is after the
 Germaine cut, comelie, but not so chargeable and costlie, and how they
 raise their gaine by skins of beasts, as marterns, sheepe, oxen, and
 gotes skins, and therevnto a kind of cloth which they weaue, and sell to
 the merchants of Norwaie, togither with their butter, fish, either
 salted or dried, and their traine oile, and exercise their trade of
 fishing also in their vncerteine skewes, which they fetch out of
 Norwaie.

 Their speech is Gothish, and such of them as by their dealing with
 forren merchants doo gather anie wealth, that will they verie often
 bestow vpon the furniture of their houses. Their weights & measures are
 after the Germaine maner, their countrie is verie healthie, and so
 wholesome, that a man was found which had married a wife at one hundred
 yeares of age, and was able to go out a fishing with his bote at one
 hundred and fortie, and of late yeeres died of meere age, without anie
 other disease. Dronkennesse is not heard of among them, and yet they
 meet and make good cheere verie often. Neither doo I read of anie great
 vse of flesh or foule there, although that some of their Ilands haue
 plentie of both. Nor anie mention of corne growing in these parts, and
 therefore in steed of bread they drie a kind of fish, which they beat in
 morters to powder, & bake it in their ouens, vntill it be hard and drie.
 Their fuell also is of such bones as the fish yeeldeth, that is taken on
 their coasts: and yet they liue as themselues suppose in much felicitie,
 thinking it a great peece of their happinesse to be so farre distant
 from the wicked auarice, and cruell dealings of the more rich and ciuill
 part of the world.

 Herein also they are like vnto the Hirthiens, in that at one time of the
 yeare, there commeth a priest vnto them out of the Orchades (vnto which
 iurisdiction they doo belong) who baptiseth all such children, as haue
 beene borne among them, since he last arriued, and hauing afterward
 remained there for a two daies, he taketh his tithes of them (which they
 prouide and paie with great scrupulositie in fish, for of other
 commodities haue they none) and then returneth home againe, not without
 boast of his troublesome voiage, except he watch his time. In these Iles
 [Sidenote: Amber.]
 also is great plentie of fine Amber to be had (as Hector saith) which is
 producted by the working of the sea vpon those coasts: but more of this
 elsewhere. This neuertheles is certeine, that these Ilands, with the
 Orchades, were neuer perfectlie vnited to the crowne of Scotland, till
 the mariage was made betweene king Iames and the ladie Marie daughter to
 Christierne king of Denmarke 1468, which Christierne at the birth of
 their sonne Iames (afterward king of Scotland and called Iames the
 fourth) resigned all his right and title whatsoeuer either he or his
 ancestors either presently or hertofore had, might haue had, or herafter
 may or should haue, vnto the aforesaid peeres, as appeereth by the
 charter.

 From these Shetland Iles, and vntill we come southwards to the Scarre,
 which lieth in Buquhamnesse, I find no mention of anie Ile situat vpon
 that coast, neither greatlie from thence, vntill we come at the Forth,
 that leadeth vp to Sterling, neither thought we it safetie for vs to
 search so farre as Thule, whence the most excellent brimstone commeth, &
 thereto what store of Ilands lie vnder the more northerlie climats,
 whose secret situations though partlie seene in my time, haue not yet
 bin perfectlie reueled or discouered by anie, bicause of the great
 aboundance of huge Ilands of ice that mooueth to and fro vpon their
 shores, and sundrie perilous gulfes and indraughts of water, and for as
 much as their knowlege doth not concerne our purpose, wherfore casting
 about, we came at the last into the Firth or Forth, which some call the
 Scotish sea, wherein we passe by seuen or eight such as they be, of
 which the first called the Maie, the second Baas, and Garwie the third,
 doo seeme to be inhabited. From these also holding on our course toward
 England, we passe by another Ile, wherein Faux castell standeth, and
 this (so far as my skill serueth) is the last Iland of the Scotish side,
 in compassing whereof I am not able to discerne, whether their flats and
 shallowes, number of Ilands without name, confusion of situation, lacke
 of true description, or mine owne ignorance hath troubled me most. No
 meruell therefore that I haue beene so oft on ground among them. But
 most ioifull am I that am come home againe: & although not by the Thames
 mouth into my natiue citie (which taketh his name of Troie) yet into the
 English dominion, where good interteinement is much more franke and
 copious, and better harborough wherein to rest my wearie bones, and
 refresh at ease our wetherbeaten carcasses.

 The first Iland therefore which commeth to our sight, after we passed
 [Sidenote: Lindesfarne or Holie Iland.]
 Berwike, is that which was somtime called Lindesfarne, but now Holie
 Iland, and conteineth eight miles; a place much honored among our
 monasticall writers, bicause diuerse moonks and heremits did spend their
 times therein. There was also the bishops see of Lindesfarne for a long
 season, which afterward was translated to Chester in the street, &
 finallie to Duresme, Dunelme, or Durham. It was first erected by Oswald,
 wherein he placed Aidanus the learned Scotish moonke, who came hither
 out of the Ile called Hij, whereof Beda speaking in the third chapter of
 his third booke, noteth, that although the said Hij belong to the kings
 of Northumberland, by reason of situation & neerenesse to the coast; yet
 the Picts appointed the bishops of the same, and gaue the Ile with the
 see it selfe to such Scotish moonks as they liked, bicause that by their
 preaching they first receiued the faith. But to returne to Lindesfarne.
 After Aidan departed this life, Finanus finished and builded the whole
 church with sawed timber of oke, after the maner of his countrie, which
 when Theodorus the archbishop of Canturburie had dedicated, Edbert the
 bishop did couer ouer with lead.

 [Sidenote: Farne.]
 Next vnto this is the Ile of Farne, and herein is a place of defense so
 far as I remember, and so great store of egs laid there by diuerse kinds
 of wildfoule in time of the yeare, that a man shall hardlie run for a
 wager on the plaine ground without the breach of manie, before his race
 be finished. About Farne also lie certeine Iles greater than Farne it
 selfe, but void of inhabitants; and in these also is great store of
 [Sidenote: Puffins.]
 puffins, graie as duckes, and without coloured fethers, sauing that they
 haue a white ring round about their necks. There is moreouer another
 [Sidenote: Saint Cuthberts foules.]
 bird, which the people call saint Cuthberts foules, a verie tame and
 gentle creature, and easie to be taken. After this we came to the Cocket
 Iland; so called, bicause it lieth ouer against the fall of Cocket
 water. Herein is a veine of meane seacole, which the people dig out of
 the shore at the low water; and in this Iland dwelled one Henrie
 sometime a famous heremite, who (as his life declareth) came of the
 Danish race. And from thence vntill we came vnto the coast of Norffolke
 I saw no more Ilands.

 Being therfore past S. Edmunds point, we found a litle Ile ouer against
 the fall of the water that commeth from Holkham, & likewise another ouer
 against the Claie, before we came at Waburne hope: the third also in
 Yarmouth riuer ouer against Bradwell, a towne in low or little England,
 whereof also I must needs saie somewhat, bicause it is in maner an
 Iland, and as I gesse either hath beene or may be one: for the brodest
 place of the strict land that leadeth to the same, is little aboue a
 quarter of a mile, which against the raging waues of the sea can make
 [Sidenote: Little England.]
 but small resistance. Little England or low England therefore is about
 eight miles in length and foure in bredth, verie well replenished with
 townes, as Fristan, Burgh castell, Olton, Flixton, Lestoft, Gunton,
 Blundston, Corton, Lownd, Ashebie, Hoxton, Belton, Bradwell, and
 Gorleston, and beside this it is verie fruitfull and indued with all
 commodities.

 Going forward from hence, by the Estonnesse (almost an Iland) I saw a
 small parcell cut from the maine in Orford hauen, the Langerstone in
 Orwell mouth, & two peeces or Islets at Cattiwade bridge; and then
 [Sidenote: Merseie.]
 casting about vnto the Colne, we beheld Merseie which is a pretie Iland,
 well furnished with wood. It was sometime a great receptacle for the
 Danes when they inuaded England; howbeit at this present it hath beside
 two decaied blockehouses, two parish churches, of which one is called
 east Merseie, the other west Merseie, and both vnder the archdeacon of
 [Sidenote: Foulnesse.]
 Colchester, as parcell of his iurisdiction. Foulenesse is an Ile void of
 wood, and yet well replenished with verie good grasse for neat and
 sheepe, whereof the inhabitants haue great plentie: there is also a
 parish church, and albeit that it stand somewhat distant from the shore,
 yet at a dead low water a man may (as they saie) ride thereto if he be
 skilfull of the causie; it is vnder the iurisdiction of London. And at
 this present master William Tabor bacheler of diuinitie and archdeacon
 of Essex hath it vnder his iurisdiction & regiment, by the surrender of
 maister Iohn Walker doctor also of diuinitie, who liued at such time as
 I first attempted to commit this booke to the impression.

 In Maldon water are in like sort three Ilands inuironed all with salt
 [Sidenote: Osithe.]
 [Sidenote: Northeie.]
 streames, as saint Osithes, Northeie, and another (after a mersh) that
 beareth no name so far as I remember. On the right hand also as we went
 [Sidenote: Ramseie.]
 [Sidenote: Reie.]
 toward the sea againe, we saw Ramseie Ile, or rather a Peninsula or
 Biland, & likewise the Reie, in which is a chappell of saint Peter. And
 then coasting vpon the mouth of the Bourne, we saw the Wallot Ile and
 his mates, whereof two lie by east Wallot, and the fourth is Foulnesse,
 except I be deceiued, for here my memorie faileth me on the one side,
 and information on the other, I meane concerning the placing of
 Foulenesse. But to proceed. After this, and being entered into the
 Thames mouth, I find no Iland of anie name, except you accompt Rochford
 hundred for one, whereof I haue no mind to intreat, more than of
 Crowland, Mersland, Elie, and the rest, that are framed by the ouze.
 Andredeseie in Trent, so called of a church there dedicated to saint
 Andrew, and Auon (two noble riuers hereafter to be described) sith I
 touch onelie those that are inuironed with the sea or salt water round
 [Sidenote: Canwaie.]
 about, as we may see in the Canwaie Iles, which some call marshes
 onelie, and liken them to an ipocras bag, some to a vice, scrue, or wide
 sleeue, bicause they are verie small at the east end, and large at west.
 The salt rilles also that crosse the same doo so separat the one of them
 from the other, that they resemble the slope course of the cutting part
 of a scrue or gimlet, in verie perfect maner, if a man doo imagine
 himselfe to looke downe from the top of the mast vpon them. Betweene
 these, moreouer and the Leigh towne lieth another litle Ile or Holme,
 whose name is to me vnknowne. Certes I would haue gone to land and
 viewed these parcels as they laie, or at the least haue sailed round
 about them by the whole hauen, which may easilie be doone at an high
 water: but for as much as a perrie of wind (scarse comparable to the
 makerell gale, whereof Iohn Anele of Calis one of the best seamen that
 England euer bred for his skill in the narow seas was woont to talke)
 caught hold of our sailes, & caried vs forth the right waie toward
 London, I could not tarie to see what things were hereabouts. Thus much
 therefore of our Ilands, & so much may well suffice where more cannot be
 had.




 THE DESCRIPTION OF THE THAMES, AND SUCH RIUERS AS FALL INTO THE SAME.

 CAP. XI.


 Hauing (as you haue seene) attempted to set downe a full discourse of
 all the Ilands, that are situat vpon the coast of Britaine, and finding
 the successe not correspondent to mine intent, it hath caused me
 somewhat to restreine my purpose in this description also of our riuers.
 For whereas I intended at the first to haue written at large, of the
 number, situation, names, quantities, townes, villages, castels,
 mounteines, fresh waters, plashes or lakes, salt waters, and other
 commodities of the aforesaid Iles, mine expectation of information from
 all parts of England, was so deceiued in the end, that I was faine at
 last onelie to leane to that which I knew my selfe either by reading, or
 such other helpe as I had alreadie purchased and gotten of the same. And
 euen so it happeneth in this my tractation of waters, of whose heads,
 courses, length, bredth, depth of chanell (for burden) ebs, flowings,
 and falles, I had thought to haue made a perfect description vnder the
 report also of an imagined course taken by them all. But now for want of
 instruction, which hath beene largelie promised, & slacklie perfourmed,
 and other sudden and iniurious deniall of helpe voluntarilie offered,
 without occasion giuen on my part, I must needs content my selfe with
 such obseruations as I haue either obteined by mine owne experience, or
 gathered from time to time out of other mens writings: whereby the full
 discourse of the whole is vtterlie cut off, and in steed of the same a
 mangled rehearsall of the residue set downe and left in memorie.

 Wherefore I beseech your honour to pardon this imperfection and
 rudenesse of my labour, which notwithstanding is not altogither in
 vaine, sith my errors maie prooue a spurre vnto the better skilled,
 either to correct or inlarge where occasion serueth, or at the leastwise
 to take in hand a more absolute peece of worke, as better direction
 shall incourage them thereto. The entrance and beginning of euerie thing
 is the hardest; and he that beginneth well, hath atchiued halfe his
 purpose. The ice (my lord) is broken, and from hencefoorth it will be
 more easie for such as shall come after to wade through with the rest,
 sith "Facile est inuentis addere;" and to continue and finish, is not so
 great a matter in building, as to attempt and laie the foundation or
 platforme of anie noble peece of workmanship, though it be but rudelie
 [Sidenote: Thamesis.]
 handled. But to my purpose. As I began at the Thames in my description
 of Ilands, so will I now doo the like with that of famous riuers; making
 mine entrie at the said riuer it selfe, of whose founteine some men make
 as much adoo, as in time past of the true head of Nilus, which, till of
 late (if it be yet descried) was neuer found: or the Tanais, whose
 originall was neuer knowne, nor shall be: for whilest one placeth it
 here, another there; there are none at all that deale with it exactlie.
 Wherefore leaning to such mens writings as haue of set purpose sought
 out the spring of the Thames; I affirme that this famous streame hath
 his head or beginning out of the side of an hill, standing in the
 plaines of Cotswold, about one mile from Tetburie, neere vnto the Fosse
 (an high waie so called of old) where it was sometime named Isis, or the
 Ouse, although diuerse doo ignorantlie call it the Thames euen there,
 rather of a foolish custome than anie skill, bicause they either neglect
 or vtterlie are ignorant how it was named at the first. From hence it
 runneth directlie toward the east (as all good riuers should) and
 [Sidenote: Corinium.]
 meeteth with the Cirne or Churne, (a brooke called in Latine Corinium)
 whereof Cirncester towne (by which it commeth) doth take the
 denomination.

 From hence it hasteth vnto Creekelade, alias Crekanford, Lechlade,
 Radcotebridge, Newbridge, and Eouesham, receiuing by the waie an infinit
 sort of small streames, brookes, beckes, waters, and rundels: and here
 on this side of the towne diuideth it selfe into two courses, of which
 the one goeth straight to Botleie and Hinkseie, the other by Godstow, a
 village not farre off. This latter spreadeth it selfe also for a while
 into sundrie smaller branches, which run not farre yer they be reunited,
 and then beclipping sundrie pleasant meadowes, it passeth at length by
 Oxford, of some supposed rather to be called Ouseford of this riuer,
 [Sidenote: Charwell.]
 where it meeteth with the Charwell, and a litle from whence the
 originall branches doo ioine and go togither by Abbandune (alias Sensham
 or Abington as we call it) although no part of it at the first came so
 neere the towne as it doth now, till a branch thereof was led thither
 [Sidenote: Some write, that the maine streame was brought thither
 from which ranne before betweene Andredeseie and Culenham.]
 the maine streame, thorough the industrie of the moonks, as (beside the
 testimonie of old records thereof yet extant to be seene) by the decaie
 of Cair Dour, now Dorchester it selfe, sometime the throughfare from
 Wales and the west countrie to London, which insued vpon this fact, is
 easie to be seene. From hence it goeth to Dorchester, and so to Thame,
 where ioining with a riuer of the same denomination, it looseth the name
 of Isis or Ouse (whereof Ouseneie at Oxford is producted) and from
 thenceforth is called Thamesis. From Thame it goeth to Wallingford, and
 so to Reding, which in time past, of the number of bridges there, was
 [Sidenote: Pontium.]
 called Pontium; albeit that the English name doth rather proceed from
 [Sidenote: Saint Marie ouer Rhee.]
 Rhe, or Ree, the Saxon word for a water-course or riuer; which maie be
 seene in Oueree, or Sutheree, for ouer the Ree, or south of the Rhee, as
 to the skilfull doth readilie appeere; yet some hold (and not altogither
 against probabilitie and likelihood) that the word Sutheree is so called
 of Sudrijc, to wit, the south kingdome, wherevnto in part the Thames is
 a bound. But that holdeth not in denomination, either of the said church
 or name of the foresaid countie. Other affirme likewise, that Reding is
 so called of the Greeke word ([Greek: rheo]) which is to ouerflowe.
 Certes, as neither of these coniectures are to be contemned, so the last
 c[=o]meth most neere to mine aid, who affirme, that not onelie the
 course of euerie water it selfe, but also his ouerflowing was in time
 past called Rhe, by such Saxons as inhabited in this Iland: and euen to
 this daie in Essex I haue oft obserued, that when the lower grounds by
 rage of water haue beene ouerflowen, the people beholding the same, haue
 said; All is on a Rhe, as if they should haue said; All is now a riuer,
 albeit the word Riuer be deriued from the French, and borrowed by them
 from the Latins, but not without corruption, as it was brought vnto
 them. I will not here giue notice how farre they are deceiued, which
 call the aforesaid church by the name of S. Marie Auderies, or S. Marie
 ouer Isis, or Ise: but I will proceed with the course of this noble
 streame, which, howsoeuer these matters stand after it hath passed by
 [Sidenote: Kenet.]
 Reding, & there receiued the Kenet, which commeth from the hilles that
 [Sidenote: Thetis.]
 lie west of Marleborough (& then the Thetis, commonlie called the Tide
 that commeth from Thetisford) hieth to Sudlington otherwise called
 Maidenhead, and so to Windleshore (or Windsore) Eaton, and then to
 Chertseie, where Erkenwald bishop of London sometime builded a religious
 house or cell, as I doo read.

 From Chertseie it hasteth directlie vnto Stanes, and receiuing an other
 [Sidenote: Cole.]
 streame by the waie, called the Cole (wherevpon Colbrooke standeth) it
 goeth by Kingstone, Shene, Sion and Brentford or Bregentford, where it
 meeteth the Brane or the Brene (another brooke descending from Edgworth)
 whose name signifieth a frog, in the Brittish speach. Vpon this also sir
 John Thin had sometime a statelie house, with a maruellous prouision to
 inclose and reteine such fish as should come about the same. From
 [Sidenote: Brene.]
 Brentfoord it passeth by Mortlach, Putneie, Fulham, Batterseie,
 Chelseie, Lambeth, and so to London. Finallie going from thence vnto the
 sea, it taketh the Lee with it by the waie vpon the coast of Essex, and
 [Sidenote: Darwent.]
 another that commeth from Abreche not far off, and the Darnt vpon Kent
 side, which riseth neere to Tanrige, and commeth by Shoreham, vnto
 [Sidenote: Craie.]
 Derntford, wherevnto the Craie falleth. And last of all the Medwaie a
 notable riuer (in mine opinion) which watereth all the south and
 southwest part of Kent, and whose description shall insue.

 Hauing in this maner breefelie touched this noble riuer, and such
 brookes as fall into the same; I will now adde a particular description
 of each of these last by themselues, whereby their courses also shall be
 seuerallie described to the satisfaction of the studious. But yer I take
 the same in hand, I will insert a word or two of the commodities of the
 said riuer, which I will performe with so much breuitie as is possible.
 Heereby also finding out his whole tract and course from the head to the
 fall thereof into the sea. It appeareth euidentlie that the length
 thereof is at the least, one hundreth and eightie miles, if it be
 measured by the iourneies of the land. And as it is in course, the
 longest of the three famous riuers of this Ile, so it is nothing
 inferiour vnto them in aboundance of all kind of fish, whereof it is
 hard to saie, which of the three haue either most plentie, or greatest
 varietie, if the circumstances be duelie weighed. What some other write
 of the riuers of their countries it skilleth not, neither will I (as
 diuerse doo) inuent strange things of this noble streame, therewith to
 nobilitate and make it more honorable: but this will I in plaine termes
 affirme, that it neither swalloweth vp bastards of the Celtish brood, or
 casteth vp the right begotten that are throwne in without hurt into
 their mothers lap, as Politian fableth of the Rhene, Epistolarum lib. 8.
 epi. 6. nor yeeldeth clots of gold as the Tagus dooth: but an infinit
 plentie of excellent, sweet and pleasant fish, wherewith such as inhabit
 neere vnto hir bankes are fed and fullie nourished.

 [Sidenote: Salmons.]
 What should I speake of the fat and sweet salmons, dailie taken in this
 streame, and that in such plentie (after the time of the smelt be past)
 as no riuer in Europa is able to exceed it. What store also of barbels,
 trouts, cheuins, pearches, smelts, breames, roches, daces, gudgings,
 flounders, shrimps, &c: are commonlie to be had therein, I refer me to
 them that know by experience better than I, by reason of their dailie
 trade of fishing in the same. And albeit it seemeth from time to time,
 to be as it were defrauded in sundrie wise of these hir large
 commodities, by the insatiable auarice of the fishermen, yet this famous
 riuer complaineth commonlie of no want, but the more it looseth at one
 time, the more it yeeldeth at another. Onelie in carps it seemeth to be
 [Sidenote: Carps a fish late brought into England
 and later into the Thames.]
 scant, sith it is not long since that kind of fish was brought ouer into
 England, and but of late to speake of into this streame, by the violent
 rage of sundrie landflouds, that brake open the heads and dams of diuers
 gentlemens ponds, by which means it became somewhat partaker also of
 this said commoditie, whereof earst it had no portion that I could euer
 heare. Oh that this riuer might be spared but euen one yeare from nets,
 &c! But alas then should manie a poore man be vndoone. In the meane time
 it is lamentable to see, how it is and hath beene choked of late with
 sands and shelues, through the penning and wresting of the course of the
 water for commodities sake. But as this is an inconuenience easilie
 remedied, if good order were taken for the redresse thereof: so now, the
 fine or prise set vpon the ballasse sometime freelie giuen to the
 merchants by patent, euen vnto the lands end (Iusques au poinct) will be
 another cause of harme vnto this noble streame, and all through an
 aduantage taken at the want of an (i) in the word ponct: which grew
 through an error committed by an English notarie vnskilfull in the
 French toong, wherein that patent was granted.

 Furthermore, the said riuer floweth and filleth all his chanels twise in
 the daie and night, that is in euerie twelue houres once; and this
 ebbing & flowing, holdeth on for the space of seauentie miles, within
 the maine land: the streame or tide being alwaies highest at London,
 when the moone dooth exactlie touch the northeast and south or west
 points of the heauens, of which one is visible, the other vnder the
 earth, and not subiect to our sight. These tides also differ in their
 times, each one comming latter than other, by so manie minuts as passe
 yer the reuolution and naturall course of the heauens doo reduce, and
 bring about the said planet vnto those hir former places: whereby the 36
 [Sidenote: The iust dist[=a]ce betweene one tide and another.]
 common difference betweene one tide and another, is found to consist of
 twentie foure minuts, which wanteth but twelue of an whole houre in
 foure and twentie, as experience dooth confirme. In like sort we see by
 dailie triall, that each tide is not of equall heigth and greatnesse:
 for at the full and change of the moone we haue the greatest flouds, and
 such is their ordinarie course, that as they diminish from their changes
 and fuls, vnto the first and last quarters; so afterwards they increase
 againe, vntill they come to the full and change. Sometimes also they
 rise so high (if the wind be at the north or northeast, which bringeth
 in the water with more vehemencie, bicause the tide which filleth the
 chanell, commeth from Scotland ward) that the Thames ouerfloweth hir
 banks neere vnto London: which hapneth especiallie in the fuls and
 changes of Januarie and Februarie, wherein the lower grounds are of
 custome soonest drowned. This order of flowing in like sort is
 perpetuall, so that when the moone is vpon the southwest and north of
 points, then is the water by London at the highest: neither doo the
 tides alter, except some rough winds out of the west or southwest doo
 [Sidenote: The streame oft checked in hir entrance into the land.]
 keepe backe and checke the streame in his entrance, as the east and
 northeast do hasten the comming in thereof, or else some other
 extraordinarie occasion, put by the ordinarie course of the northerne
 seas, which fill the said riuer by their naturall returne and flowing.
 And that both these doo happen eft among, I refer me to such as haue not
 sildome obserued it, as also the sensible chopping in of three or foure
 tides in one naturall daie, wherof the vnskilfull doo descant manie
 things.

 But how so euer these small matters doo fall out, and how often soeuer
 this course of the streame doth happen to be disturbed; yet at two
 seuerall times of the age of the moone, the waters returne to their
 naturall course and limits of time exactlie. Polydore saith, that this
 riuer is seldome increased or rather neuer ouerfloweth hir banks by
 landflouds: but he is herein verie much deceiued, as it shalbe more
 apparentlie seene hereafter. For the more that this riuer is put by of
 hir right course, the more the water must of necessitie swell with the
 white waters which run downe from the land: bicause the passage cannot
 be so swift and readie in the winding as in the streight course. These
 landflouds also doo greatlie straine the finesse of the streame, in so
 much that after a great landfloud, you shall take haddocks with your
 hands beneath the bridge, as they flote aloft vpon the water, whose eies
 are so blinded with the thicknesse of that element, that they cannot see
 where to become, and make shift to saue themselues before death take
 hold of them. Otherwise the water of it selfe is verie cleere, and in
 comparison next vnto that of the sea, which is most subtile and pure of
 all other; as that of great riuers is most excellent, in comparison of
 smaller brookes: although Aristotle will haue the salt water to be most
 grosse, bicause a ship will beare a greater burden on the sea than on
 the fresh water; and an eg sinke in this that swimmeth on the other. But
 he may easilie be answered by the quantitie of roome and aboundance of
 waters in the sea; whereby it becommeth of more force to susteine such
 vessels as are committed to the same, and whervnto the greatest riuers
 (God wot) are nothing comparable. I would here make mention of sundrie
 [Sidenote: London bridge.]
 bridges placed ouer this noble streame, of which that of London is most
 chieflie to be commended, for it is in maner a c[=o]tinuall street, well
 replenished with large and statelie houses on both sides, and situat
 vpon twentie arches, whereof ech one is made of excellent free squared
 stone, euerie of them being threescore foot in height, and full twentie
 in distance one from another, as I haue often viewed.

 In like maner I could intreat of the infinit number of swans dailie to
 [Sidenote: 2000 boates vpon the Thames
 and 3000 poore m[=e] mainteined by
 the same whose gaines come in most
 plentifullie in the tearme time.]
 be seene vpon this riuer, the two thousand wherries and small boats,
 wherby three thousand poore watermen are mainteined, through the
 cariage and recariage of such persons as passe or repasse, from time to
 time vpon the same: beside those huge tideboats, tiltbotes, and barges,
 which either carrie passengers, or bring necessarie prouision from all
 quarters of Oxfordshire, Barkeshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire,
 Herfordshire, Midlesex, Essex, Surrie, and Kent, vnto the citie of
 London. But for somuch as these things are to be repeated againe in the
 particular description of London, annexed to his card; I surceasse at
 this time to speake anie more of them here, as not lingering but hasting
 to performe my promise made euen now, not yet forgotten, and in
 performance whereof I thinke it best to resume the description of this
 noble riuer againe into my hands, and in adding whatsoeuer is before
 omitted, to deliuer a full and perfect demonstration of his course. How
 and where the said streame ariseth, is alreadie & with sufficiencie set
 downe, noting the place to be within a mile of Tetburie, whereof some
 doo vtterlie mislike, bicause that rill in summer drouths is oft so
 drie, that there is little or no water at all seene running aboue ground
 in the same. For this cause therefore manie affirme the verie head of
 [Sidenote: Isis.]
 Isis to come from the poole aboue Kemble. Other confound it with the
 head of the Cirne or Chirne, called in Latine Corinium that riseth aboue
 Coberleie. For my part I follow Leland, as he dooth the moonke of
 Malmesburie, which wrote the historie intituled Eulogium historiarum,
 who searched the same of set purpose, and pronounced with Leland,
 although at this present that course be verie small, and choked vp (as I
 heare) with grauell and sand. Proceeding therefore from the head, it
 [Sidenote: Couus.]
 first of all receiueth the Kemble water called the Coue, which riseth
 aboue Kemble towne, goeth by Kemble it selfe vnto Poole and Somerford,
 and then (accompanieth the Thames) vnto Canes, Ashton, Canes, and
 Howston, holding on in one chanell vntill they meet with the Chirne, the
 next of all to be described.

 [Sidenote: Corinium.]
 The Chirne is a faire water arising out of the ground aboue Coberleie,
 from whence it runneth to Cowleie, Cowlesburne, Randcome, and so into
 the Isis on the left side aboue Crekelade. These three waters being thus
 vnited and brought into one chanell, within a little space of the head
 of Isis, it runneth on by Crekelade, beneath which towne it receiueth
 [Sidenote: Rhe.]
 the Rhe, descending from Elcombe, Escot, Redburne, Widhill, & at the
 fall into Isis, or not far off ioineth with another that runneth west of
 Purton by Braden forrest, &c. Next of all our Isis meeteth with the
 [Sidenote: Amneie.]
 Amneie on the left hand, which comming from aboue Holie roode Amneie,
 runneth by Downe Amneie, and finallie into the Isis a little aboue
 Iseie. In like sort I read of another that meeteth withall on the right
 hand aboue Iseie also, which so far as I can call to remembrance,
 commeth from about Drifield and falleth so into our Isis, that they run
 as one vntill they come at the Colne, although not so nakedlie and
 without helpe, but that in this voiage, the maine streame dooth crosse
 one water that descendeth from Swindon, and going also by Stratton
 toward Seuingham, is it selfe increased with two rils by the waie,
 whereof one commeth from Liddenton by Wambreie, as I haue beene
 informed.

 [Sidenote: Colneius, Colineus, or Colunus.]
 The Colne is a faire riuer rising by north neere to Witchington, & from
 thence goeth to Shiptons, Compton Abdale, Wittenton, Parneworth, Colne
 Deanes, and Colne Rogers, Winston, Biberie, Colne Alens, Quenington,
 Faireford, and west of Lachelade into the riuer Isis, which hereabout on
 the southside also taketh in another, whereof I find this remembrance.
 The Isis being once past Seuingham, crosseth a brooke from southest that
 mounteth about Ashbirie, and receiuing a rill from bywest (that commeth
 from Hinton) beneath Shrineham, it afterward so diuideth it selfe, that
 the armes therof include Inglesham, and by reason that it falleth into
 the Isis at two seuerall places, there is a plesant Iland producted,
 whereof let this suffice.

 [Sidenote: Lecusor Leche.]
 Being past Lechelade a mile, it runneth to saint Johns bridge, &
 thereabout meeteth with the Leche on the left hand. This brooke, whereof
 Lechlade taketh the name (a towne wherevnto one peece of an old
 vniuersitie is ascribed, which it did neuer possesse, more than
 Crekelade did the other) riseth east of Hampnet, fr[=o] whence it goeth
 to north Lech, Estenton, Anlesworth, east Lech, south Thorpe, Farendon,
 & so into the Isis. From hence this famous water goeth by Kenskot toward
 Radcote bridge (taking in the rill that riseth in an od peece of
 Barkeshire, and runneth by Langford) and being past the said bridge (now
 notable through a conspiracie made there sometimes by sundrie barons
 against the estate) it is not long yer it crosse two other waters, both
 of them descending from another od parcell of the said countie, whereof
 I haue this note giuen me for my further information. There are two fals
 of water into Isis beneath Radcote bridge, wherof the one commeth from
 Shilton in Barkeshire by Arescote, blacke Burton and Clarrefield. The
 other also riseth in the same peece, and runneth by Brisenorton vnto
 Bampton, and there receiuing an armelet from the first that breake off
 at blacke Burton, it is not long yer they fall into Isis, and leaue a
 pretie Iland. After these confluences, the maine course of
 [Sidenote: Winrush.]
 the streame hasteth by Shifford to Newbridge, where it ioineth with the
 Winrush. The Winrush riseth aboue Shieburne in Glocestershire, from
 whence it goeth to Winrush, & c[=o]ming by Barrington, Burford,
 Widbrooke, Swinbecke castell, Witneie, Duckington, Cockthorpe, Stanlake,
 it meeteth with the Isis west by south of Northmore. From hence it goeth
 beneath Stanton, Hartingcourt and Ensham, betweene which and Cassinton,
 [Sidenote: Briwerus.]
 it receiueth (as Leland calleth it) the Bruerne water.

 It riseth aboue Limington, and going to Norton in the Marsh, and through
 a patch of Worcestershire vnto Euenlode, betweene it and the foure
 [Sidenote: Comus.]
 shirestones, it taketh in a rill called Come, comming by the long and
 the little Comptons. After this also it goeth by Bradwell, Odington, and
 [Sidenote: Rolrich.]
 so to Bleddenton, aboue which towne it taketh in the Rolrich water that
 issueth at two heads, in the hils that lie by west of little Rolrich,
 and ioine aboue Kenkeham, and Church hill. From thence also it goeth
 vnto Bruerne, Shipton vnderwood, Ascot, Short hamton, Chorleburie,
 Corneburie parke, Stonfield, Longcombe, and southeast of Woodstocke
 [Sidenote: Enis.]
 parke, taketh in the Enis, that riseth aboue Emstone, and goeth to
 Ciddington, Glimton, Wotton (where it is increased with a rill that
 runneth thither from steeple Barton, by the Beechin tree) Woodstocke,
 Blaidon, so that after this confluence, the said Enis runneth to
 Cassinton, and so into the Isis, which goeth from hence to Oxford, and
 there receiueth the Charwell, now presentlie to be described.

 [Sidenote: Charwell.]
 The head of Charwell is in Northamptonshire, where it riseth out of a
 little poole, by Charleton village, seuen miles aboue Banberie
 northeast, and there it issueth so fast at the verie surge, that it
 groweth into a pretie streame, in maner out of hand. Soone after also
 [Sidenote: Bure.]
 it taketh in a rillet called the Bure, which falleth into it, about
 Otmere side: but forasmuch as it riseth by Bincester, the whole course
 therof is not aboue foure miles, and therefore cannot be great. A friend
 of mine prosecuting the rest of this description reporteth thereof as
 followeth. Before the Charwell commeth into Oxfordshire, it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Culen.]
 Culen, which falleth into the same, a little aboue Edgcote, and so
 descending toward Wardington, it meeteth with another comming from by
 north west, betweene Wardington and Cropreadie. At Banberie also it
 [Sidenote: Come.]
 meeteth with the Come (which falleth from fennie Conton by Farneboro,
 and afterwards going by kings Sutton, not far from Aine, it receiueth
 the discharge of diuerse rillets, in one bottome before it come at
 Clifton. The said water therfore ingendred of so manie brookelets,
 [Sidenote: Ocus.]
 consisteth chiefelie of two, whereof the most southerlie called Oke,
 commeth from Oke Norton, by Witchington or Wiggington, and the Berfords;
 and carieng a few blind rils withall, dooth meet with the other that
 falleth from by northwest into the same, within a mile of Charwell.

 That other (as I coniecture) is increased of three waters, wherof each
 [Sidenote: Tudo.]
 one hath his seuerall name. The first of them therefore hight Tudo,
 which comming betweene Epwell and the Lee by Toddington, ioineth about
 [Sidenote: Ornus.]
 Broughton with the second that runneth from Horneton, named Ornus, as I
 gesse. The last falleth into the Tude or Tudelake, beneath Broughton;
 and for that it riseth not far from Sotteswell in Warwikeshire, some are
 [Sidenote: Sotbrooke.]
 of the opinion, that it is to be called Sotbrooke. The next water that
 meeteth without Charwell beneath Clifton commeth from about Croughton,
 [Sidenote: Souarus.]
 [Sidenote: Sowar.]
 and after this is the Sowar or Swere, that riseth north of Michaell Tew,
 [Sidenote: Burus.]
 and runneth by nether Wotton. The last of all is the Reie alias Bure,
 whose head is not far aboue Burcester, alias Bincester, and Burncester:
 and from whence it goeth by Burecester to Merton, Charleton, Fencote,
 Addington, Noke, Islip, and so into Charwell, that holdeth on his course
 after this augmentation of the waters, betweene Wood and Water Eton, to
 Marston, and the east bridge of Oxford by Magdalene college, and so
 beneath the south bridge into our aforesaid Isis.

 [Sidenote: Middest of England whereabouts.]
 In describing this riuer, this one thing (right honorable) is come vnto
 my mind, touching the center and nauill as it were of England. Certes
 there is an hillie plot of ground in Helledon parish, not far from
 Danberie, where a man maie stand and behold the heads of three notable
 riuers, whose waters, and those of such as fall into them, doo
 abundantlie serue the greatest part of England on this side of the
 Humber. The first of these waters is the Charwell, alreadie described.
 The second is the Leme that goeth westward into the fourth Auon. And the
 third is the head of the Nene or fift Auon it selfe, of whose courses
 there is no card but doth make sufficient mention; and therefore your
 honour maie behold in the same how they doo coast the countrie, and also
 measure by compasses how this plot lieth in respect of all the rest,
 contrarie to common iudgement, which maketh Northampton to be the
 middest and center of our countrie.

 But to go forward with my description of the Ouse, which being past
 Oxford goeth to Iflie, Kennington, Sanford, Rodleie, Newnham, and so to
 Abington, som time called Sensham, without increase, where it receiueth
 [Sidenote: Ocus.]
 the Oche, otherwise called the Coche, a little beneath S. Helens, which
 runneth thither of two brooklets, as I take it, whereof one commeth from
 Compton, out of the vale and west of the hill of the White horsse, the
 other from Kings Letcombe, and Wantage in Barkshire, and in one chanell,
 entreth into the same, vpon the right side of his course. From Abington
 [Sidenote: Arun.]
 likewise (taking the Arun withall southwest of Sutton Courtneie) it
 goeth by Appleford, long Wittenham, Clifton, Wittenham the lesse, &
 beneath Dorchester, taketh in the Thame water, from whence the Isis
 loseth the preheminence of the whole denomination of this riuer, and is
 contented to impart the same with the Thame, so that by the coniunction
 of these two waters Thamesis is producted, and that name continued euen
 vnto the sea.

 [Sidenote: Thame.]
 Thame riuer riseth in the easterlie parts of Chilterne hils, towards
 Penleie parke, at a towne called Tring west of the said parke, which is
 seauen miles from the stone bridge, that is betweene Querendon and
 Ailsburie (after the course of the water) as Leland hath set downe.
 Running therefore by long Merston, and Puttenham, Hucket, and Bearton,
 it receiueth soone after a rill that commeth by Querendon from Hardwike,
 and yer long an other on the other side that riseth aboue Windouer in
 the Chilterne, and passing by Halton, Weston, Turrill, Broughton, and
 Ailsburie, it falleth into the Tame west of the said towne (except my
 memorie doo faile me.) From this confluence the Tame goeth by Ethorpe,
 the Winchingtons, Coddington, Chersleie, Notleie abbeie: and comming
 almost to Tame, it receiueth one water from southeast aboue the said
 towne, and another also from the same quarter beneath the towne; so that
 Tame standeth inuironed vpon three sides with three seuerall waters, as
 maie be easilie seene. The first of these commeth from the Chiltern east
 of Below or Bledlow, from whence it goeth to Hinton, Horsenden,
 Kingseie, Towseie, and so into the Tame. The other descendeth also from
 the Chilterne, and going by Chinner, Crowell, Siddenham, and Tame parke,
 it falleth in the end into Tame water, and then they proceed togither as
 one by Shabbington, Ricot parke, Dracot, Waterstoke, Milton, Cuddesdon,
 and Chiselton. Here also it taketh in another water from by-east, whose
 head commeth from Chilterne hils, not farre from Stocking church, in the
 waie from Oxford to London. From whence it runneth to Weston (and
 meeting beneath Cuxham with Watlington rill) it goeth onto Chalgraue,
 Stadham, and so into the Tame. From hence our streame of Thame runneth
 to Newenton, Draton, Dorchester (sometime a bishops see, and a noble
 citie) and so into the Thames, which hasteth in like sort to Bensington,
 [Sidenote: Blauius.]
 Crowmarsh, or Wallingford, where it receiueth the Blaue, descending from
 Blaueburg, now Blewberie, as I learne.

 Thus haue I brought the Thames vnto Wallingford, situate in the vale of
 White horsse, that runneth a long therby. From hence it goeth by
 Newenham, north Stoke, south Stoke, Goring, Bassilden, Pangburne, where
 it meeteth with a water that commeth from about Hamsted Norris, runneth
 by Frizelham, Buckelburie, Stanford, Bradfeld, Tidmarsh and Pangburne.
 After which confluence it goeth on betweene Mapledorham and Purleie, to
 Cauersham, and Cauersham manour, and a little beneath receiueth the
 Kenet that commeth thereinto from Reading.

 [Sidenote: Cenethus.]
 The Kenet riseth aboue Ouerton 5 or 6 miles west of Marleborow, or
 Marlingsborow, as some call it; & then going by Fifeld, Clatfor, Maulon,
 & Preshute, vnto Marleburie: it holdeth on in like order to Ramsburie,
 and northwest of little Cote, taketh in a water by north descending from
 the hilles aboue Alburne chase west of Alburne town. Thence it runneth
 to little Cote, Charnhamstreet, & beneth Charnhamstreet it crosseth the
 [Sidenote: Bedwiine.]
 [Sidenote: Chalkeburne.]
 Bedwin, which (taking the Chalkburne rill withall) commeth from great
 Bedwijne, & at Hungerford also two other in one botom somewhat beneath
 the towne. From hence it goeth to Auington, Kinburie, Hamsted marshall,
 [Sidenote: Lamburne.]
 Euburne, Newberie; and beneath this towne, taketh in the Lamburne water
 that commeth by Isberie, Egerston, the Sheffords, Westford, Boxford,
 Donington castell, and Shaw. From Newberie it goeth to Thatcham,
 [Sidenote: Alburnus.]
 Wolhampton, Aldermaston, a little aboue which village it receiueth the
 Alburne, another brooke increased with sundrie rils: and thus going on
 to Padworth, Oston, and Michaell, it commeth at last to Reading, where
 (as I said) it ioineth with the Thames, and so they go forward as one by
 Sonning to Shiplake, and there on the east side receiue the Loddon that
 commeth downe thither from the south, as by his course appeereth.

 [Sidenote: Lodunus.]
 The Loddon riseth in Hamshire betweene west Shirburne and Wooton toward
 the southwest, afterward directing his course toward the northwest,
 thorough the Vine, it passeth at the last by Bramlie, and thorough a
 peece of Wiltshire, to Stradfield, Swallowfield, Arberfield, Loddon
 bridge, leauing a patch of Wiltshire on the right hand (as I haue beene
 informed.) This Loddon not far from Turges towne receiueth two waters in
 one bottome, whereof the westerlie called Basing water, commeth from
 Basingstoke, and thorough a parke vnto the aforesaid place.

 The other descendeth of two heads from Mapledour well, and goeth by
 Skewes, Newenham, Rotherwijc, and yer it come at Hartlie, ioineth with
 the Basing water, from whence they go togither to Turges, where they
 meet with the Loddon (as I haue said alreadie.) The next streame toward
 [Sidenote: Ditis vadum.]
 the south is called Ditford brooke. It riseth not farre from Vpton, goeth
 [Sidenote: Ikelus.]
 by Gruell, and beneath Wharnborow castell receiueth the Ikell (comming
 from a parke of the same denomination) from whence they go togither by
 Maddingleie vnto Swalowfield, and so into the Loddon. In this voiage
 [Sidenote: Elueius.]
 also the Loddon meeteth with the Elwie or Elueie that commeth from
 Aldershare, not farre by west of Euersleie: and about Eluesham
 [Sidenote: Ducus.]
 likewise with another running from Dogmansfield named the Douke: and
 [Sidenote: Erin.]
 also the third not inferior to the rest comming from Erin, whose head is
 in Surreie, and going by Ash becommeth a limit, first betweene Surreie
 and Hamshire; then betweene Hamshire and Barkeshire, and passing by Ash,
 Erinleie, Blacke water, Perleie, and Finchamsted; it ioineth at last
 with the Ditford, before it come at Swalowfield. To conclude therefore
 with our Loddon, hauing receiued all these waters; and after the last
 confluence with them now being come to Loddon bridge, it passeth on by a
 part of Wiltshire to Twiford bridge, then to Wargraue, and so into the
 Thames that now is maruellouslie increased and growen vnto triple
 greatnesse (to that it was at Oxford.)

 Being therefore past Shiplake and Wargraue, it runneth by Horsependon,
 or Harding: then to Henleie vpon Thames, where sometime a great rill
 voideth it selfe in the same. Then to Remenham, Greneland (going all
 this waie from Shiplake iust north, and now turning eastwards againe) by
 Medenham, Hurlie, Bisham, Marlow the greater, Marlow the lesse, it
 meeteth with a brooke soone after that consisteth of the water of two
 [Sidenote: Vsa.]
 rilles, whereof the one called the Vse, riseth about west Wickham, out
 of one of the Chilterne hilles, and goeth from thence to east Wickham or
 high Wickham, a pretie market towne. The other named Higden, descendeth
 [Sidenote: Higden.]
 also from those mounteines but a mile beneath west Wickham, and ioining
 both in one at the last, in the west end of east Wickham towne, they go
 togither to Wooburne, Hedsor, & so into the Thames. Some call it the
 Tide; and that word doo I vse in my former treatise: but to proceed.
 After this confluence our Thames goeth on by Cowkham, Topleie,
 Maidenhead, alias Sudlington, Braie, Dorneie, Clure, new Windsore
 (taking in neuerthelesse, at Eaton by the waie, the Burne which riseth
 out of a Moore, & commeth thither by Burnham) old Windsor, Wraiborow,
 and a little by east therof doth crosse the Cole, whereof I find this
 short description insuing.

 [Sidenote: Colus, alias Vere and Vertume.]
 The Cole riseth neere vnto Flamsted, from whence it goeth to Redburn, S.
 Michaels, S. Albons, Aldenham, Watford, and so by More to Richmansworth,
 where there is a confluence of three waters, of which this Cole is the
 [Sidenote: Gadus.]
 first. The second called Gadus riseth not farre from Ashridge, an house
 or palace belonging to the prince: from whence it runneth to great
 Gaddesdin, Hemsted, betweene Kings Langleie, and Abbots Langleie, then
 to Hunters, and Cashew bridges, and so to Richmanswoorth, receiuing by
 the waie a rill comming from Alburie by northwest, to Northchurch,
 Barkehamsted, and beneath Hemsted ioining with the same. The last
 commeth in at northwest from aboue Chesham, by Chesham it selfe, then by
 Chesham Bois, Latimers, Mawdlens, Cheinies, Sarret and Richmanswoorth,
 and so going on all in one chanell vnder the name of Cole, it runneth to
 Vxbridge, where it taketh in the Missenden water, from northwest, which
 rising aboue Missenden the greater goeth by Missenden the lesse,
 Hagmondesham (now Hammersham) the Vach, Chalfhunt Giles, Chalfhunt S.
 Peters, Denham, and then into the Cole aboue Vxbridge (as I haue said.)
 Soone after this our Cole doth part it selfe into two branches, neuer to
 ioine againe before they come at the Thames, for the greater of them
 goeth thorough the goodlie medows straight to Colebrooke, the other vnto
 two milles, a mile and a halfe east of Colebrooke, in the waie to
 London, leauing an Iland betweene them of no small size and quantitie.

 [Sidenote: Vindeles.]
 Being past the Cole, we come to the fall of the Vindeles, which riseth
 by northwest neere vnto Bagshot, from whence it goeth to Windlesham,
 Chobham, and meeting with a brooklet comming westward from Bisleie, they
 run togither toward Cherteseie, where when they haue met with a small
 rill rising north of Sonning hill in Windlesoure great parke, it falleth
 into the Thames on the northeast side of Cherteseie. When we were come
 beyond this water, it was not long yer we came vnto another on the same
 side, that fell into the Thames betweene Shepperton on the one side, and
 [Sidenote: Veius.]
 Oteland on the other, and is called the Waie. The Weie or the Waie
 rising by west, commeth from Olsted, & soone after taking the Hedleie
 brooke withall (which riseth in Wulmere forrest, and goeth by Hedleie
 and Frensham) hasteth by Bentleie, Farnham, Alton, Waiberleie, Elsted,
 [Sidenote: Thuresbie.]
 and so to Pepper harrow, where it ioineth with the Thuresbie water,
 which commeth not farre off from a village of the same denomination.
 From hence also it goeth to Godalming, and then toward Shawford, but yer
 it come there, it crosseth Craulie becke, which rising somewhere about
 [Sidenote: Crawleie.]
 the edge of Sussex short of Ridgewijc, goeth by Vacherie parke, Knoll,
 Craulie, Bramleie, Wonarsh, and so into the Waie. From hence then our
 [Sidenote: Abbinger.]
 riuer goeth to Shawford, and soone after (meeting with the Abbinger
 water that commeth by Shere, Albirie, and the chappell on the hill) it
 proceedeth to Guldeford, thence to Stoke, Sutton in the parke, Send,
 Woking, and at Newarke parke side taketh in a brooke that riseth of two
 heads, whereof one dooth spring betweene two hils north of Pepper
 harrow, and so runneth through Henleie parke, the other aboue Purbright,
 and afterward ioining in one, they go foorth vnto Newarke, and being
 there vnited, after the confluence it goeth to Purford court, to Bifler,
 Waifred, Oteland, and so into the Thames.

 [Sidenote: Molts.]
 From Oteland the Thames goeth by Walton, Sunburie, west Moulseie,
 Hampton, and yer it come at Hampton court on the northside, and east
 Moulseie on the other, it taketh in the Moule water, which giueth name
 vnto the two townes that stand on each side of the place, where it
 falleth into our streame. It riseth in Word forrest, and going by
 Burstow, it meeteth afterward with another gullet, conteining a small
 course from two seuerall heads, whereof one is also in the forrest
 aforenamed, the other runneth from Febush wood, and comming by Iseld,
 meeteth with the first aboue Horleie, and so run on in one chanell, I
 saie, till they ioine with the Moule water, whereof I spake before.

 After this confluence in like sort, it is not long yer the Moule take in
 another from by north, which commeth from about Mesham on the one side,
 and another on the other side, running by Ocleie and Capell, and
 whereinto also a branch or rill commeth from a wood on the northwest
 part. Finallie, being thus increased with these manie rilles, it goeth
 by east Becheworth, west Becheworth, and ouer against the Swalow on the
 side of Drake hill, taking in another that c[=o]meth thither from
 Wootton by Darking and Milton, it runneth to Mickleham, Letherhed,
 Stoke, Cobham, Ashire parke, east Moulseie, and so into the Thames,
 which after this coniunction goeth on to Kingston, and there also
 meeteth with another becke, rising at Ewell south of Nonsuch. Certes,
 this rill goeth from Ewell by the old parke, then to Mauldon, & so to
 Kingston towne. The Thames in like maner being past Kingston, goeth to
 Tuddington, Petersham, Twickenham, Richmond, and Shene, where it
 receiueth a water on the northwest side, which comming from about Harrow
 on the hill, and by west of the same, goeth by Haies, Harlington,
 Felthan, and Thistleworth into the Thames.

 The next fall of water is at Sion, neere vnto new Brainford, so that it
 [Sidenote: Brane.]
 issueth into the Thames between them both. This water is called Brane,
 that is in the Brittish toong (as Leland saith) a frog. It riseth about
 Edgeworth, and commeth from thence by Kingesburie, Twiford, Periuall,
 Hanwell, and Austerleie. Thence we followed our riuer to old Brentford,
 Mortlach, Cheswijc, Barnelmes, Fulham, and Putneie, beneath which townes
 it crossed a becke from Wandlesworth, that riseth at Woodmans turne, and
 going by Easthalton, meeteth another comming from Croidon by Bedington,
 and so going on to Mitcham, Marton abbeie, and Wandlesworth, it is not
 [Sidenote: Mariburne.]
 long yer it fall into the Thames. Next vnto this is Mariburne rill on
 the other side, which commeth in by S. Iames, so that by this time we
 haue either brought the Thames, or the Thames conueied vs to London,
 where we rested for a season to take view of the seuerall tides there,
 of which each one differeth from other, by foure & twentie minuts, that
 is fortie eight in a whole daie, as I haue noted before, except the
 wether alter them. Being past London, and in the waie toward the sea:
 the first water that it meeteth withall, is the Brome on Kent side,
 [Sidenote: Bromis.]
 west of Greenewich, whose head is Bromis in Bromleie parish, and going
 from thence to Lewsham, it taketh in a water from by east, and so
 directeth his course foorth right vnto the Thames.

 The next water that it meeteth withall, is on Essex side, almost against
 [Sidenote: Lee.]
 Woolwich, and that is the Lee or Luie, whose head riseth short of
 Kempton in Hertfordshire, foure miles southeast of Luton, sometime
 [Sidenote: Logus.]
 called Logodunum or Logrodunum, & going through a peece of Brokehall
 parke (leauing Woodhall parke on the north, and Hatfield on the south,
 with another parke adioining) it goeth toward Hartford towne. But yer it
 [Sidenote: Marran.]
 come there, it receiueth a water (peraduenture the Marran) rising at
 northwest in Brodewater hundred, from aboue Welwin, northeast of
 Digeswell, and going to Hartingfeld burie, where the said confluence
 is within one mile of the towne. Beneath Hatfield also it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Beane.]
 Beane (as I gesse) comming from Boxwood by Benington, Aston, Watton, and
 Stapleford, and a little lower, the third arme of increase from aboue
 Ware, which descendeth from two heads: whereof the greatest commeth from
 Barkewaie in Edwinster hundred, the other Sandon in Oddesey hundred, and
 after they be met beneath little Hornemeade, they go togither by
 Pulcherchurch, or Puckrich, Stonden, Thunderidge, Wadesmill, Benghoo,
 and so into the Lee, which from hence runneth on till it come at Ware,
 which was drowned by the rage of the same 1408, and so to Amwell, where
 on the north side it receiueth the water that commeth from little
 Hadham, through a peece of Singleshall parke, then by great Hadham, and
 so from Widford to the aforesaid towne. From hence also they go as one
 to old Stansted called Le Veil, branching in such wise yer it come
 there, that it runneth through the towne in sundrie places. Thence it
 goeth foorth to Abbats Stansted, beneath which it meeteth with the
 [Sidenote: Sturus.]
 Stoure, west (as I remember) of Roidon. This Sture riseth at Wenden
 lootes, from whence it goeth to Langleie, Clauering, Berden, Manhuden, &
 Birchanger (where it taketh a rill comming from Elsingham, & Stansted
 Mountfitchet.) Thence it hieth on to Bishops Stourford, Sabrichfoord,
 and beneath this towne crosseth with another from the east side of
 Elsingham, that goeth to Hatfield, Brodocke, Shiring, Harlo, & so into
 the Stoure, and from whence they go togither to Eastwic, Parmedon, and
 next into the Lee. These things being thus performed, the Lee runneth on
 beneath Hoddesdon, Broxburne, and Wormleie, where a water breaketh out
 by west of the maine streame, a mile lower than Wormeleie it selfe, but
 yet within the paroch, and is called Wormeleie locke.

 It runneth also by Cheston nunrie, and out of this a little beneath the
 said house, breaketh an arme called the Shirelake, bicause it diuideth
 Eastsex and Hartford shire in sunder, and in the length of one medow
 called Fritheie. This lake runneth not but at great flouds, and meeteth
 againe with a succor of ditchwater, at a place called Hockesditch, halfe
 a mile from his first breaking out, and halfe a mile lower at Marsh
 point ioineth againe with the streame from whence it came before. Thence
 commeth the first arme to S. Maulie bridge (the first bridge westward
 vpon that riuer) vpon Waltham causie, & halfe a mile lower than Maulie
 bridge, at the corner of Ramnie mead, it meeteth with the kings streame
 & principall course of Luy, or Lee, as it is commonlie called. The
 second arme breaketh out of the kings streame at Halifield halfe a mile
 lower than Cheston nunrie, and so to the fulling mill, and two bridges
 by west of the kings streame, wherinto it falleth about a stones cast
 lower at a place called Malkins shelffe, except I was wrong informed.
 Cheston & Hartfordshire men doo saie, that the kings streame at Waltham
 dooth part Hartfordshire and Essex, but the Essex men by forrest charter
 doo plead their liberties to hold vnto S. Maulies bridge. On the east
 side also of the kings streame breaketh out but one principall arme at
 Halifield, three quarters of a mile aboue Waltham, & so goeth to the
 corne mill in Waltham, and then to the K. streame againe a little
 beneath the kings bridge.

 From hence the Lee runneth on by south on Waltonstow till it come to
 Stretford Langthorne, where it brancheth partlie of it selfe, and partlie
 [Sidenote: Alfred.]
 by mans industrie for mils. Howbeit heerein the dealing of Alfred
 (sometimes king of England) was not of smallest force, who vnderstanding
 the Danes to be gotten vp with their ships into the countrie, there to
 kill and slaie his subiects, in the yeere of grace 896, by the conduct
 of this riuer: he in the meane time before they could returne, did so
 mightilie weaken the maine chanell, by drawing great numbers of trenches
 from the same; that when they purposed to come backe, there was nothing
 so much water left as the ships did draw: wherefore being set on ground,
 they were soone fired, & the aduersaries ouercome. By this policie also
 much medow ground was woone, & made firme land, whereby the countrie
 about was not a little inriched, as was also a part of Assyria by the
 like practise of Cyrus with the Ganges, at such time as he came against
 Babylon, which riuer before time was in maner equall with Euphrates. For
 he was so offended, that one of his knights whom he loued deerlie, was
 drowned and borne awaie with the water in his passage ouer the same,
 that he sware a deepe oth yer long to make it so shallow that it should
 not wet a woman to the knees. Which came to passe, for he caused all his
 armie to dig 46 new draines fr[=o] the same, wherby the vow that he had
 made was at the full performed. Senec. de Tra. li. 3. But to conclude
 with the Lee that somtime ouerflowed all those medowes, through which it
 passeth (as for a great waie not inferior to the Thames) and I find that
 being past Westham, it is not long yer it fall into that streame. One
 thing I read more of this riuer before the conquest, that is, how Edward
 the first, & sonne of Alfred, in the yeare of grace 912, builded
 Hartford towne: at which time also he had Wittham a towne in Essex in
 hand, as his sister called Aelfled repaired Oxford & London, and all
 this foure yeares before the building of Maldon; of some called Hertford
 or Herudford betweene three waters, that is, the Lee, the Benefuth, and
 Memmarran, or rather Penmarran: but how these waters are distinguished
 in these daies, as yet I cannot tell. It is possible, that the Bene may
 be the same which commeth by Benington, and Benghoo: which if it be so,
 then must the Memmarran be the same that descendeth from Whitwell, for
 not farre from thence is Branfield, which might in time past right well
 be called Marranfield, for of like inuersion of names I could shew manie
 examples.

 Being past the Lee (whose chanell is begun to be purged 1576, with
 further hope to bring the same to the north side of London) we come vnto
 [Sidenote: Rodon or Rodunus.]
 the Rodon, vpon Essex side in like maner, and not verie farre (for foure
 miles is the most) from the fall of the Lee. This water riseth at little
 Canfield, from whence it goeth to great Canfield, high Roding, Eithorpe
 Roding, Ledon Roding, White Roding, Beauchampe Roding, Fifeld, Shelleie,
 high Ongar, and Cheping Ongar, where the Lauer falleth into it, that
 [Sidenote: Lauer.]
 ariseth betwixt Matching and high Lauer; and taking another rill withall
 comming from aboue Northweld at Cheping Ongar, they ioine (I saie) with
 the Rodon, after which confluence Leland coniectureth that the streame
 [Sidenote: Iuelus.]
 is called Iuell: for my part, I wot not what to say of it. But heerof I
 am sure, that the whole course being past Ongar, it goeth to Stansted
 riuers, Theidon mount, Heibridge, Chigwell, Woodford bridge, Ilford
 bridge, Barking, & so into the Thames.

 [Sidenote: Darwent.]
 The Darwent meeteth with our said Thames vpon Kents side, two miles and
 more beneath Erith. It riseth at Tanridge, or there abouts, as I haue
 beene informed by Christopher Saxtons card late made of the same, and
 the like (I hope) he will doo in all the seuerall shires of England at
 the infinit charges of sir Thomas Sackford knight, & maister of the
 requests, whose zeale vnto his countrie heerin I cannot but remember, &
 so much the rather, for that he meaneth to imitate Ortelius, & somewhat
 beside this hath holpen me in the names of the townes, by which these
 riuers for the Kentish part do run. Would to God his plats were once
 finished for the rest! But to proceed. The Darwent therefore, rising at
 Tanridge, goeth on by Titseie toward Brasted, and receiuing on ech side
 of that towne (& seuerall bankes) a riuer or rill, it goeth on to
 Nockhold, Shorham, Kinsford, Horton, Darnhith, Dartford or Derwentford,
 [Sidenote: Craie.]
 & there taking in the Craie on the left hand that coms from Orpington by
 Marie Craie, Paules Craie, North Craie, and Craiford, it is not long yer
 it fall into the Thames. But after I had once passed the fall of the
 brooke, it is a world to see what plentie of Serephium groweth vpon the
 Kentish shore, in whose description Fuichsius hath not a little halted;
 whilest he giueth foorth the hearbe Argentaria for Serephium, betweene
 which there is no maner of likelihood. This neuerthelesse is notable in
 the said hearbe, that being translated into the garden, it receiueth
 another forme cleane different from the first, which it yeelded when it
 grew vpon the shore, and therevnto appeareth of more fat & foggie
 substance. Which maketh me to thinke that our physicians do take it for
 a distinct kind of wormewood, whereof controuersie ariseth among them.
 The next water that falleth into the Thames, is west of the Wauie Iles,
 a rill of no great fame, neither long course, for rising about Coringham,
 it runneth not manie miles east and by south, yer it fall into the mouth
 of this riuer, which I doo now describe.

 I would haue spoken of one creeke that commeth in at Cliffe, and another
 that runneth downe from Haltsto by S. Maries: but sith I vnderstand not
 with what backewaters they be serued, I let them passe as not skilfull
 of their courses. And thus much of the riuers that fall into the Thames,
 wherein I haue doone what I maie, but not what I would for mine owne
 satisfaction, till I came from the head to Lechlade, vnto which, as in
 lieu of a farewell, I will ascribe that distichon which Apollonius
 Rhodius writeth of the Thermodon:

   Huic non est aliud flumen par, nec tot in agros
   Vllum dimittit riuos quot fundit vtrinque.

 [Sidenote: Midwaie.]
 Next vnto the Thames we haue the Midwaie water, whereof I find two
 descriptions, the first beginneth thus. The Midwaie water is called in
 Latine Medeuia (as some write) bicause the course therof is midwaie in a
 manner betweene London and Dorobernia, or (as we now call it)
 Canturburie. In British it hight Dourbree: and thereof Rochester was
 sometime called Durobreuum. But in an old charter which I haue seene
 (conteining a donation sometime made to the monasterie of saint Andrews
 there by Ceadwalla) I find that the Saxons called this riuer Wedring;
 and also a towne standing betweene Malling and east Farleie, Wedrington;
 and finallie, a forrest also of the same denomination, Wedrington, now
 Waterdon, wherby the originall name appeareth to be fetched from this
 streame. It ariseth in Waterdon forrest east of Whetlin or Wedring, and
 ioineth with another brooke that descendeth from Ward forrest in Sussex:
 and after this confluence they go on togither, as one by Ashhirst, where
 hauing receiued also the second brooke, it hasteth to Pensherst, and
 there carrieth withall the Eden, that commeth from Lingfield parke.
 After this it goeth to the southeast part of Kent, and taketh with it
 [Sidenote: Frethus.]
 the Frith or Firth, on the northwest side, and an other little streame
 that commeth from the hilles betweene Peuenburie and Horsemon on the
 southeast. From thence also, and not farre from Yalling it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Theise.]
 Theise (a pretie streame that ariseth about Theise Hirst) & afterward
 [Sidenote: Grane alias Cranus.]
 the Gran or Crane, which hauing his head not farre from Cranbrooke, and
 meeting with sundrie other riuelets by the waie, whereof one branch of
 Theise is the last, for it parteth at the Twist, and including a pretie
 Iland, doth ioine with the said Midwaie, a little aboue Yalding, and
 then with the Lowse. Finallie at Maidstone it meeteth with another
 brooke, whose name I know not, and then passeth by Allington, Duton,
 Newhide, Halling, Cuckestane, Rochester, Chattham, Gillingham, Vpchurch,
 Kingsferrie, and falleth into the maine sea betweene Shepeie and the
 Grane.

 And thus much out of the first authour, who commendeth it also, for that
 in time past it did yeeld such plentie of sturgeon, as beside the kings
 portion, and a due vnto the archbishop of Canturburie out of the same,
 the deane and chapter of Rochester had no small allowance also of that
 commoditie: likewise for the shrimps that are taken therein, which are
 no lesse esteemed of in their kind, than the westerne smelts or
 flounders taken in the Thames, &c. The second authour describeth it
 after this manner, and more copiouslie than the other.

 The cheefe head of this streame riseth in Waterdon forrest, from whence
 after it hath runne a pretie waie still within the same, east of
 Whetlin, it meeteth with a brooke, whose head is in Ward forrest,
 southwest of Greenested, which goeth to Hartfield, and so to Whetlin,
 and yer long ioineth with the Midwaie. After this confluence it is not
 long yer it take in another by west from Cowden ward, and the third
 aboue Pensherst, growing from two heads, whereof one is in Lingfield
 parke, the other west of Crawherst; and ioining aboue Edinbridge, it
 doth fall into the midwaie beneath Heuer towne, and Chiddingston. From
 Pensherst our maine streame hasteth to Ligh, Tunbridge, and Twidleie,
 and beneath the towne, it crosseth a water from North, whereof one head
 is at the Mote, another at Wroteham, the third at west Peckham, &
 likewise another from southest, that runneth east of Capell. Next after
 this it receiueth the These, whose forked head is at Theise Hirst, which
 descending downe toward the north, taketh in not farre from Scotnie a
 brooke out of the northside of Waterden forrest, whose name I find not,
 except it be the Dour. After this confluence our riuer goeth to
 Goldhirst, and comming to the Twist, it brancheth in such wise, that one
 part of it runneth into Midwaie, another into the Garan, or rather
 [Sidenote: Garunus, Cranus.]
 Cranebrooke (if my coniecture be anie thing.) The Garan (as Leland
 calleth it) or the Crane (as I doo take it) riseth neere to Cranebrooke,
 and going by Siffinghirst, it receiueth yer long one water that commeth
 by Fretingdon, and another that runneth from great Chard by Smerdon, and
 Hedcorne, crossing two rilles by the waie from by north, Hedcorne it
 selfe standing betweene them both. Finallie, the Garan or Crane meeting
 with Midwaie south of Yalling, they on the one side, and the These on
 the other, leaue a pretie Iland in the middest, of foure miles in
 length, and two in breadth, wherein is some hillie soile, but neither
 towne nor village, so farre as I remember.

 From Yalling forward, the Midwaie goeth to west Farlegh, east Farlegh:
 and yer it come at Maidstone, it interteineth a rill that riseth short
 of Ienham, and goeth by Ledes and Otteringden, which is verie
 beneficiall to clothiers in drie yeeres: for thither they conueie their
 clothes to be thicked at the fulling milles, sometimes ten miles for the
 same: there is also at Ledes great plentie of fulling earth, which is a
 necessarie commoditie.

 Being past Maidstone, it runneth by Allington, Snodland, Halling,
 Cuckstane, and Rochester, where it passeth vnder a faire bridge of
 stone, with a verie swift course, which bridge was begun 1388 by the
 lord Iohn Cobham, the ladie Margaret his wife, and the valiant sir
 Robert Knolles, who gaue the first onset vpon that peece of worke, and
 therevnto builded a chappell of the Trinitie at the end therof, in
 testimonie of his pietie. In processe of time also one Iohn Warner of
 Rochester made the new coping thereof; and archbishop Warham of
 Canturburie the iron barres: the bishops also of that see were not
 slacke in their beneuolence and furtherances toward that worke,
 especiallie Walter Merton founder of Merton college in Oxford, who by
 misfortune perished by falling from the same, as he rode to surueie the
 workemen. Being past Rochester, this noble riuer goeth to Chatham,
 Gillingham, Vpchurch, and soone after branching, it imbraceth the Greene
 at his fall, as his two heads doo Ashdon forrest, that lieth betweene
 them both.




 OF SUCH STREAMES AS FALL INTO THE SEA, BETWEENE THE THAMES AND THE MOUTH
 OF THE SAUERNE.

 CHAP. XII.


 [Sidenote: Stoure.]
 After the Midwaie we haue the Stoure that riseth at Kingeswood, which is
 [Sidenote: Nailburne water also (as I heare) neer to Cantwarbirie,
 but I wote not whereabouts: see _Marianus Scotus_.]
 fourteene or fifteene miles from Canturburie. This riuer passeth by
 Ashford, Wie, Nackington, Canturburie, Fordish, Standish, and
 Sturemouth, where it receiueth another riuer growing of three branches.
 After our Stoure or Sture parteth it self in twaine, & in such wise,
 that one arme therof goeth toward the north, and is called (when it
 commeth at the sea) the north mouth of Stoure; the other runneth
 southeastward vp to Richborow, and so to Sandwich, from whence it goeth
 northeast againe and falleth into the sea. The issue of this later tract
 is called the hauen of Sandwich. And peraduenture the streame that
 commeth downe thither, after the diuision of the Stoure, maie be the
 [Sidenote: Wantsome.]
 same which Beda calleth Wantsome; but as I cannot vndoo this knot at
 will, so this is certeine, that the Stoure on the one side, and
 peraduenture the Wantsome on the other, parteth and cutteth the Tenet
 from the maine land of Kent, whereby it is left for an Iland.

 There are other little brookes which fall into the Stoure, whereof
 Leland speaketh, as Fishpoole becke that ariseth in Stonehirst wood, and
 meeteth with it foure miles from Canturburie: another beginneth at
 Chislet, and goeth into the Stoure gut, which sometime inclosed Thanet,
 as Leland saith: the third issueth out of the ground at Northburne
 (where Eadbert of Kent sometime past held his palace) and runneth to
 Sandwich hauen, as the said authour reporteth: and the fourth called
 Bridgewater that riseth by S. Marie Burne church, and going by Bishops
 Burne, meeteth with Canturburie water at Stourmouth: also Wiham that
 riseth aboue Wiham short of Adsam, and falleth into Bridgewater at
 Dudmill, or Wenderton: and the third namelesse, which riseth short of
 Wodensburgh (a towne wherein Hengist & the Saxons honored their grand
 idoll Woden, or Othine) and goeth by Staple to Wingam: but sith they are
 obscure I will not touch them here. From hence passing by the Goodwine,
 a plot verie perilous for sea-faring men (sometime firme land, that is,
 vntill the tenth of the conquerours sonne, whose name was William Rufus,
 and wherein a great part of the inheritance of erle Goodwine in time
 past was knowne to lie) but escaping it with ease, we came at length to
 [Sidenote: Dour.]
 Douer. In all which voiage we found no streame, by reason of the cliffes
 that inuiron the said coast. Howbeit vpon the south side of Douer, there
 is a pretie fresh riuer, whose head ariseth at Erwell, not passing foure
 miles from the sea, and of some is called Dour, which in the British
 toong is a common name for waters, as is also the old British word Auon
 for the greatest riuers, into whose mouthes or falles shippes might find
 safe entrance; and therefore such are in my time called hauens, a new
 word growen by an aspiration added to the old: the Scots call it Auen.
 But more of this else-where, sith I am now onelie to speake of Dour,
 wherof it is likelie that the towne & castell of Douer did sometime take
 the name. From hence we go toward the Camber (omitting peraduenture here
 and there sundrie small creeks void of backwater by the waie)
 [Sidenote: Rother.]
 whereabouts the Rother a noble riuer falleth into the sea. This Rother
 separateth Sussex from Kent, and hath his head in Sussex, not farre from
 Argas hill neere to Waterden forrest, and from thence directeth his
 course vnto Rotherfield. After this it goeth to Ethlingham or
 Hitchingham, and so foorth by Newendon vnto Mattham ferrie, where it
 diuideth it selfe in such wise, that one branch thereof goeth to
 Appledoure (where is a castell sometime builded by the Danes, in the
 time of Alfred, as they did erect another at Middleton, and the third at
 [Sidenote: Bilie.]
 Beamflete) and at this towne, where it meeteth the Bilie that riseth
 about Bilsington, the other by Iden, so that it includeth a fine parcell
 of ground called Oxneie, which in time past was reputed as a parcell of
 Sussex; but now vpon some occasion or other (to me vnknowne) annexed
 vnto Kent. From hence also growing into some greatnesse, it runneth to
 [Sidenote: Becke.]
 Rie, where it meeteth finallie with the Becke, which commeth from
 Beckleie: so that the plot wherein Rie standeth, is in manner a by-land
 or peninsula, as experience doth confirme. Leland and most men are of the
 [Sidenote: Limenus.]
 likeliest opinion, that this riuer should be called the Limen, which (as
 Peter of Cornhull saith) doth issue out of Andredeswald, where the head
 thereof is knowne to be. Certes, I am of the opinion, that it is called
 the Rother vnto Appledoure, & from thence the Limen, bicause the Danes
 are noted to enter into these parts by the Limen; and sailing on the
 same to Appledoure, did there begin to fortifie, as I haue noted
 alreadie. Howbeit, in our time it is knowne by none other name than the
 Rother or Appledoure water, whereof let this suffice.

 Being thus crossed ouer to the west side of Rie hauen, & in vewing the
 issues that fall into the same, I meet first of all with a water that
 groweth of two brookes, which come downe by one chanell into the east
 side of the mouth of the said port. The first therfore that falleth into
 it descendeth from Beckleie or thereabouts (as I take it) the next
 runneth along by Pesemarsh, & soone after ioining with all, they hold on
 as one, till they fall into the same at the westerlie side of Rie: the
 third streame commeth from the north, and as it mounteth vp not farre
 from Munfield, so it runneth betweene Sescambe and Wacklinton neere vnto
 Bread, taking another rill withall that riseth (as I heare) not verie
 far from Westfield. There is likewise a fourth that groweth of two heads
 betweene Ielingham and Pet, and going by Winchelseie it meeteth with all
 about Rie hauen, so that Winchelseie standeth inuironed on three parts
 with water, and the streames of these two that I haue last rehearsed.

 The water that falleth into the Ocean, a mile by southwest of Hastings,
 [Sidenote: Aestus.]
 or therabouts, is called AEstus or Asten: perhaps of Hasten or Hasting
 the Dane, (who in time past was a plague to France and England) & rising
 not far from Penhirst, it meeteth with the sea (as I heare) by east of
 [Sidenote: Buluerhithe.]
 Hollington. Buluerhith is but a creeke (as I remember) serued with no
 backewater; and so I heare of Codding or Old hauen, wherefore I meane
 not to touch them.

 [Sidenote: Peuenseie.]
 Into Peuenseie hauen diuerse waters doo resort, and of these, that which
 entereth into the same on the east side riseth out from two heads,
 [Sidenote: Ash.]
 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 whereof the most easterlie is called Ash, the next vnto the Burne, and
 vniting themselues not farre from Ashburne, they continue their course
 vnder the name and tide of Ashburne water, as I read. The second that
 commeth thereinto issueth also of two heads, whereof the one is so manie
 miles from Boreham, the other not far from the Parke east of
 Hellingstowne, and both of them concurring southwest of Hirstmowsen,
 they direct their course toward Peuenseie (beneath which they meet with
 another rising at Foington) and thence go in one chanell for a mile or
 [Sidenote: Cucomarus.]
 more, till they fall togither into Peuenseie hauen. The Cuckmer issueth
 out at seuerall places, and hereof the more easterlie branch commeth
 from Warbleton ward, the other from Bishops wood, and meeting beneath
 Halling, they run one bottome by Micham, Arlington, Wellington, old
 Frithstan, and so into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Isis.]
 [Sidenote: Ni fallor.]
 Vnto the water that commeth out at Newhauen, sundrie brookes and
 riuerets doo resort, but the chiefe head riseth toward the west,
 somewhat betweene Etchinford and Shepleie, as I heare. The first water
 therefore that falleth into the same on the east side, issueth out of
 the ground about Vertwood, and running from thence by Langhton and Ripe,
 on the west side; it falleth into the aforesaid riuer beneath Forle and
 Glime, or three miles lower than Lewis, if the other buttall like you
 not. The next herevnto hath his head in Argas hill, the third descendeth
 from Ashedon forrest, and ioining with the last mentioned, they crosse
 the maine riuer a little beneath Isefield. The fourth water commeth from
 Ashedon forrest by Horsteed Caines (or Ousestate Caines) and falleth
 into the same, likewise east of Linfield. Certes I am deceiued if this
 riuer be not called Isis, after it is past Isefield. The fift riseth
 [Sidenote: Sturewell.]
 about Storuelgate, and meeteth also with the maine streame aboue
 Linfield, and these are knowen to lie vpon the right hand as we rowed vp
 the riuer. On the other side are onelie two, whereof the first hath his
 originall neere vnto Wenefield, and holding on his course toward the
 east, it meeteth with his maister betweene Newicke and Isefield (or
 [Sidenote: Plimus.]
 Ifield) as some read it. The last of all commeth from Plimodune or
 Plumpton, and hauing met in like sort with the maine riuer about
 Barcham, it runneth foorth with it, & they rest in one chanell by
 Barcham, Hamseie, Malling, Lewis, Piddingburne, and so foorth into the
 maine.

 [Sidenote: Soru.]
 The next riuer that we came vnto west of Brighthemston is the Sore,
 which notwithstanding I find to be called Brember water, in the ancient
 map of Marton colledge in Oxford: but in such sort (as I take it) as the
 Rother or Limen is called Appledoure streame, bicause of the said towne
 that standeth thervpon. But to proceed, it is a pleasant water, &
 thereto if you consider the situation of his armes, and branches from
 the higher grounds, verie much resembling a foure stringed whip.
 Whereabout the head of this riuer is, or which of these branches may
 safelie be called Sora from the rising, in good sooth I cannot say. For
 after we had passed nine or ten mils thereon vp into the land, suddenlie
 the crosse waters stopped vs, so that we were inforced to turne either
 east or west, for directlie foorth right we had no waie to go. The first
 arme on the right hand as we went, riseth out of a parke by south of
 Alborne, and going on for a certeine space toward the northwest, it
 turneth southward betweene Shermonburie and Twinham, and soone after
 [Sidenote: Bimarus.]
 meeteth with the Bimar, not much south from Shermonburie, whence they
 run togither almost two miles, till they fall into the Sore. That on the
 west side descendeth from about Billingeshirst, & going toward the east,
 it crosseth with the fourth (which riseth a litle by west of Thacam)
 east from Pulborow, and so they run as one into the Sore, that after
 this confluence hasteth it selfe southward by Brember, Burleis, the
 Combes, and yer long into the Ocean.

 [Sidenote: Arunus.]
 The Arun (of which beside Arundell towne the castell and the vallie
 wherin it runneth is called Vallis Aruntina, or Arundale in English) is
 a goodlie water, and thereto increased with no small number of excellent
 & pleasant brookes. It springeth vp of two heads, whereof one descendeth
 from the north not far from Gretham, and going by Lis, meeteth with the
 next streame (as I gesse) about Doursford house. The second riseth by
 west from the hils that lie toward the rising of the sunne from East
 maine, and runneth by Peterfield. The third commeth from Beriton ward,
 and ioineth with the second betweene Peterfield and Doursford, after
 which confluence they go togither in one chanell still toward the east
 (taking a rill with them that c[=o]mmeth betweene Fernehirst and S.
 Lukes chappell, southwest of Linchmere, and meeting with it east of
 Loddesworth (as I doo read, and likewise sundrie other in one chanell
 beneath Stopham) to Waltham, Burie, Houghton, Stoke, Arundell,
 Tortington ford, Climping (all on the west side) and so into the sea.

 Hauing thus described the west side of Arun, let vs doo the like with
 the other in such sort as we best may. The first riuer that we come vnto
 therfore on the east side, and also the second, rise of sundrie places
 in S. Leonards forrest, & ioining a little aboue Horsham, they meet with
 the third, which commeth from Ifield parke, not verie farre from
 Slinfeld. The fourth hath two heads, whereof one riseth in Witleie
 parke, the other by west, neere vnto Heselmeere chappell, and meeting by
 west of Doursfeld, they vnite themselues with the chanell, growing by
 the confluence that I spake of beneath Slinfeld, a little aboue
 Billingshirst. The last water commeth from the hils aboue Linchemere,
 and runneth west and south, and passing betweene Billingshirst and
 Stopham it commeth vnto the chanell last mentioned, and so into the Arun
 beneath Stopham, without anie further increase, at the least that I doo
 heare of.

 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 Burne hath his issue in a parke neere Aldingburrie (or rather a little
 aboue the same toward the north, as I haue since beene informed) and
 running by the bottomes toward the south, it falleth betweene north
 [Sidenote: Elin.]
 Berflete and Flesham. Erin riseth of sundrie heads, by east of Erinleie,
 and directing his course toward the sunne rising, it peninsulateth
 [Sidenote: Del[=u]s.]
 Seleseie towne on the southwest and Pagham at northwest. Deel springeth
 about Benderton, and thence running betweene middle Lauant and east
 Lauant, it goeth by west of west Hampnet, by east of Chichester, or west
 of Rumbaldesdowne, and afterward by Fishburne, where it meeteth with a
 rill comming north west from Funtingdon (a little beneath the towne) &
 then running thus in one streame toward the sea, it meeteth with another
 rillet comming by north of Bosham, and so into Auant gulfe by east of
 Thorneie Iland.

 [Sidenote: Racunus.]
 The Racon riseth by east of Racton or Racodunum (as Leland calleth it)
 and comming by Chidham, it falleth into the sea, northeast of Thorneie
 [Sidenote: Emill.]
 aforesaid. The Emill commeth first betweene Racton and Stansted, then
 downe to Emilsworth or Emmesworth, & so vnto the Ocean, separating
 Sussex from Hampshire almost from the very head. Hauing in this maner
 passed along the coasts of Sussex, the next water that I remember,
 riseth by east of the forrest of Estbirie, from whence it goeth by
 Southwike, west Burhunt, Farham, and so into the gulfe almost full
 [Sidenote: Badunus forte.]
 south. Then come we to Bedenham creeke (so called of a village standing
 thereby) the mouth whereof lieth almost directlie against Porchester
 castell, which is situat about three miles by water from Portesmouth
 towne, as Leland dooth report. Then go we within halfe a mile further
 [Sidenote: Forten or Fordon.]
 to Forten creeke, which either giueth or taketh name of a village hard
 [Sidenote: Osterpoole.]
 by. After this we come to Osterpoole lake, a great creeke, that goeth vp
 by west into the land, and lieth not far from a round turret of stone,
 from whence also there goeth a chaine to another tower on the east side
 directlie ouer against it, the like whereof is to be seene in diuerse
 other hauens of the west countrie, wherby the entrance of great vessels
 into that part may be at pleasure restreined.

 From hence we go further to Tichefeld water, that riseth about Eastmaine
 [Sidenote: Tichefield.]
 parke, ten or twelue miles by northeast or there abouts from Tichefeld.
 From Eastmaine it goeth (parting the forrests of Waltham, and Eastberie
 by the way) to Wicham or Wicombe, a pretie market towne & large
 throughfare, where also the water separateth it selfe into two armelets,
 and going vnder two bridges of wood commeth yer long againe vnto one
 chanell. From hence it goeth three or foure miles further, to a bridge
 of timber by maister Writhoseleies house (leauing Tichfeld towne on the
 right side) and a little beneath runneth vnder Ware bridge, whither the
 sea floweth as hir naturall course inforceth. Finallie, within a mile of
 this bridge it goeth into the water of Hampton hauen, whervnto diuerse
 streames resort, as you shall heare hereafter.

 [Sidenote: Hamelrish.]
 After this we come to Hamble hauen, or Hamelrish creeke, whose fall is
 betweene saint Andrewes castell, and Hoke. It riseth about Shidford in
 Waltham forrest, & when it is past Croke bridge, it meeteth with another
 brooke, which issueth not farre from Bishops Waltham, out of sundrie
 springs in the high waie on Winchester, from whence it passeth (as I
 said) by Bishops Waltham, then to Budeleie or Botleie, and then ioining
 with the Hamble, they run togither by Prowlingsworth, Vpton, Brusill,
 Hamble towne, and so into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Southhampton.]
 Now come we to the hauen of Southhampton, by Ptolomie called Magnus
 portus, which I will briefelie describe so neere as I can possiblie. The
 bredth or entrie of the mouth hereof (as I take it) is by estimation two
 miles from shore to shore. At the west point therof also is a strong
 castell latelie builded, which is rightlie named Caldshore, but now
 Cawshot, I wote not by what occasion. On the east side thereof also is a
 place called Hoke (afore mentioned) or Hamell hoke; wherein are not
 aboue three or foure fisher houses, not worthie to be remembred. This
 hauen shooteth vp on the west side by the space of seuen miles, vntill
 it come to Hampton towne, standing on the other side, where it is by
 estimation a mile from land to land. Thence it goeth vp further about
 three miles to Redbridge, still ebbing and flowing thither, and one mile
 further, so farre as my memorie dooth serue mee. Now it resteth that I
 describe the Alresford streame, which some doo call the Arre or Arle,
 and I will proceed withall in this order following.

 [Sidenote: Alresford.]
 The Alresford beginneth of diuerse faire springs, about a mile or more
 fr[=o] Alresford, or Alford as it is now called, and soone after
 resorting to one bottome, they become a broad lake, which for the most
 part is called Alford pond. Afterward returning againe to a narrow
 chanell, it goeth through a stone bridge at the end of Alford towne
 (leauing the towne it selfe on the left hand) toward Hicthingstocke
 three miles off, but yer it commeth there, it receiueth two rils in one
 bottome, whereof one commeth from the Forrest in maner at hand, and by
 northwest of old Alresford, the other fr[=o] Browne Candiuer, that goeth
 by Northenton, Swarewotton, Aberstone, &c: vntill we meet with the said
 water beneath Alford towne. Being past Hichinstocke, it commeth by
 Auington to Eston village, and to Woorthie, where it beginneth to
 branch, and ech arme to part it selfe into other that resort to Hide and
 the lower soiles by east of Winchester, there seruing the streets, the
 close of S. Maries, Wolueseie, and the new college verie plentifullie
 with their water. But in this meane while, the great streame commeth
 from Worthie to the east bridge, and so to saint Elizabeth college,
 where it dooth also part in twaine, enuironing the said house in most
 delectable maner. After this it goeth toward S. Crosses, leauing it a
 quarter of a mile on the right hand: then to Twiford (a mile lower)
 where it gathereth againe into one bottome, and goeth six miles further
 [Sidenote: Otter.]
 to Woodmill, taking the Otter brooke withall on the east side, and so
 into the salt creeke that leadeth downe to the hauen.

 On the other side of Southhampton, there resorteth into this hauen also
 [Sidenote: Stocke.]
 both the Test & the Stockbridge water in one bottome, whereof I find
 this large description insuing. The verie head of the Stockewater, is
 supposed to be somewhere about Basing stoke, or church Hockleie, and
 going from thence betweene Ouerton and Steuenton, it commeth at last by
 Lauerstocke & Whitchurch, and soone after receiuing a brooke by
 [Sidenote: Bourne.]
 northwest, called the Bourne (descending from S. Marie Bourne, southeast
 from Horsseburne) it proceedeth by Long paroch and the wood, till it
 meet with the Cranburne, on the east side (a pretie riuelet rising about
 Michelneie, and going by Fullington, Barton, and to Cramburne) thence to
 Horwell in one bottome, beneath which it meeteth with the Andeuer water,
 that is increased yer it come there by an other brooke, whose name I doo
 not know. This Andeuer streame riseth in Culhamshire forrest, not far by
 north from Andeuer towne, and going to vpper Clatford, yer it touch
 there it receiueth the rill of which I spake before, which rising also
 neere vnto Anport, goeth to Monketon, to Abbatesham, the Andeuer, and
 both (as I said) vnto the Test beneath Horwell, whereof I spake euen
 now.

 These streames being thus brought into one bottome, it runneth toward
 the south vnder Stockbridge, and soone after diuiding it selfe in
 twaine, one branch thereof goeth by Houghton, & a little beneath meeteth
 with a rill, that commeth from bywest of S. Ans hil, and goeth by east
 of vpper Wallop, west of nether Wallop, by Bucholt forrest, Broughton,
 [Sidenote: Valopius.]
 and called (as I haue beene informed) the Gallop, but now it is named
 Wallop. The other arme runneth through the parke, by north west of kings
 Somburne, and vniting themselues againe, they go forth by Motteshunt, and
 [Sidenote: Test.]
 then receiue the Test, a pretie water rising in Clarendun parke, that
 goeth by west Deane, and east Deane, so to Motteshunt, and finallie to
 the aforesaid water, which from thencefoorth is called the Test, euen
 vnto the sea. But to proceed. After this confluence, it taketh the gate
 to Kimbebridge, then to Rumseie, Longbridge, and beneath the same
 receiueth a concourse of two rilles whereof the one commeth from
 Sherefield, the other from the new Forrest, and ioining in Wadeleie
 parke, they beat vpon the Test, not verie farre from Murseling. From
 thence the Test goeth vnder a pretie bridge, before it come at
 Redbridge, from whence it is not long yer it fall into the hauen.

 The next riuer that runneth into this port, springeth in the new
 [Sidenote: Eling.]
 Forrest, and commeth thereinto about Eling, not passing one mile by west
 of the fall of Test. From hence casting about againe into the maine sea,
 and leauing Calde shore castell on the right hand, we directed our
 course toward the southwest, vnto Beaulieu hauen, whereinto the Mineie
 [Sidenote: Mineie.]
 descendeth. The Mineie riseth not far from Mineiesteed, a village in the
 north part of the new Forrest; and going by Beaulieu, it falleth into
 the sea southwest (as I take it) of Exburie, a village standing vpon the
 shore.

 [Sidenote: Limen.]
 Being past the Mineie, we crossed the Limen as it is now called, whose
 head is in the verie hart of the new Forrest (sometime conuerted into a
 place of nourishment for deere by William Rufus, buieng his pleasure
 with the ruine of manie towns and villages, as diuerse haue inclosed or
 inlarged their parks by the spoile of better occupiengs) & running
 southwest of Lindhirst & the parke, it goeth by east of Brokenhirst,
 west of Bulder, & finallie into the sea south and by east of Lemington.
 I take this not to be the proper name of the water, but of the hauen,
 for Limen in Greeke is an hauen: so that Limendune is nothing else, but
 a downe or higher plot of ground lieng on the hauen: neuerthelesse, sith
 this denomination of the riuer hath now hir free passage, I think it not
 conuenient to seeke out any other name that should be giuen vnto it. The
 next fall that we passed by is namelesse, except it be called Bure, & as
 [Sidenote: Bure.]
 [Sidenote: Milis.]
 it descendeth from new Forrest, so the next vnto it hight Mile, as I
 haue heard in English. Certes the head thereof is also in the southwest
 part of the said Forrest, & the fall not far from Milford bridge, beyond
 the which I find a narrow going or strictland leading fr[=o] the point
 to Hirst castell which standeth into the sea, as if it hoong by a thred,
 from the maine of the Iland, readie to be washed awaie by the continuall
 working and dailie beating of the waues.

 [Sidenote: Auon.]
 The next riuer that we came vnto of anie name is the Auon, which (as
 Leland saith) riseth by northeast, and not far from Woolfehall in
 Wiltshire, supposed to be the same which Ptolomie called Halenus. The
 first notable bridge that it runneth vnto, is at Vphauen, thence foure
 miles further it goeth to little Ambresburie, and there is another
 bridge, from thence to Woodford village, standing at the right hand
 banke, and Newton village on the left. The bishops of Sarum had a proper
 manor place at Woodford, which bishop Sharton pulled downe altogither,
 bicause it was somewhat in ruine. Thence it goeth to Fisherton bridge,
 to Cranebridge, old Salisburie, new Salisburie, and finallie to Harnham,
 which is a statelie bridge of stone, of six arches at the least. There
 is at the west end of the said bridge, a little Iland, that lieth
 betwixt this and another bridge, of foure pretie arches, and vnder this
 later runneth a good round streame, which (as I take it) is a branch of
 Auon, that breaketh out a little aboue, & soone after it reuniteth it
 selfe againe: or else that Wilton water hath there his entrie into the
 Auon, which I cannot yet determine. From Harneham bridge it goeth to
 Dounton, that is about foure miles, and so much in like sort from thence
 to Fordingbridge, to Ringwood bridge fiue miles, to Christes church
 Twinham fiue miles, and streight into the sea; and hitherto Leland of
 this streame, which for the worthinesse thereof (in mine opinion) is not
 sufficientlie described. Wherefore I thinke good to deliuer a second
 receiued of another, which in more particular maner dooth exhibit his
 course vnto vs.

 Certes this Auon is a goodlie riuer, rising (as I said before neere)
 vnto Wolfe hall; although he that will seeke more scrupulouslie for the
 head in deed, must looke for the same about the borders of the forrest
 of Sauernake (that is Soure oke) which lieth as if it were imbraced
 betweene the first armes thereof, as I haue beene informed. These heads
 also doo make a confluence by east of Martinshall hill, and west of
 Wootton. From whence it goeth to Milton, Powseie, Manningfield abbeie,
 Manningfield crosse, and beneath Newington taketh in one rill west from
 Rudborow, and another a little lower that riseth also west of
 Alcanninges, and runneth into the same by Patneie, Merden, Wilford,
 Charleton, and Rustisall. Being therefore past Newington, it goeth to
 Vphauen (whereof Leland speaketh) to Chesilburie, Compton, Ablington,
 little Almsburie, Darntford, Woodford, old Salisburie, and so to new
 Salisburie, where it receiueth one notable riuer from by northwest, &
 another from north east, which two I will first describe, leauing the
 [Sidenote: Wilugh.]
 Auon at Salisburie for a while. The first of these is called the Wilugh,
 whereof the whole shire dooth take hir name, and not of the great
 plentie of willowes growing therein, as some fantasticall heads doo
 imagine: whereof also there is more plentie in that countrie than is to
 be found in other places. It riseth among the Deuerels, and running
 thence by hill Deuerell, & Deuerell long bridge, it goeth toward Bishops
 straw, taking in one rill by west & another from Vpton by Werminster at
 northwest. From Bishops straw it goeth to Norton, Vpton, Badhampton,
 Steplinford, and Stapleford, where it meeteth with the Winterburie water
 from by north, descending from Maddenton by Winterburne. From Stapleford
 it hasteth to Wishford, Newton, Chilhampton, Wilton: and thither commeth
 a water vnto it from southwest, which riseth of two heads aboue
 Ouerdonet. After this it goeth by Wordcastell, to Tisburie, and there
 receiueth a water on ech side, whereof one commeth from Funthill, the
 other from two issues (of which one riseth at Austie, the other at
 Swalodise) and so keeping on still with his course, our Wilugh runneth
 next of all by Sutton. Thence it goeth to Fouant, Boberstocke,
 [Sidenote: Nader becke.]
 Southburcombe, Wilton (where it taketh in the Fomington or Nader water)
 Westharnam, Salisburie, and Eastharnam: and this is the race of Wilugh.

 The other is a naked arme or streame without anie branches. It riseth
 aboue Colingburne Kingston in the hils, and thence it goeth to
 Colingburne, the Tidworths (whereof the more southerlie is in Wiltshire)
 Shipton, Cholterton, Newton, Toneie, Idmerson, Porton, the Winterburns,
 Lauerstocke, and so into Auon east of Salisburie. And thus is the
 confluence made of the aforesaid waters, with this our second Auon,
 [Sidenote: Becquith brooke.]
 whereinto another water falleth (called Becquithes brooke) a mile
 beneath Harneham bridge, whose head is fiue miles from Sarum, and three
 miles aboue Becquithes bridge, as Leland doth remember, who noteth the
 [Sidenote: Chalkeburne.]
 Chalkeburne water to haue his due recourse also at this place into the
 aforesaid riuer. Certes it is a pretie brooke, and riseth six miles from
 Shaftesburie, and in the waie toward Salisburie in a bottome on the
 right hand, whence it commeth by Knighton and Fennistratford, to
 Honington, that is about twelue miles from the head, and about two miles
 and an halfe from Honington beneath Odstocke, goeth into the Auon, a
 mile lower than Harnham bridge, except he forget himselfe. This Harnham,
 whereof I now intreat, was sometime a pretie village before the erection
 of new Salisburie, and had a church of S. Martine belonging vnto it, but
 now in steed of this church, there is onelie a barne standing in a verie
 low mead on the northside of S. Michaels hospitall. The cause of the
 relinquishing of it was the moistnesse of the soile, verie oft
 ouerflowne. And whereas the kings high waie laie sometime through
 Wilton, licence was obteined of the king and Richard bishop of
 Salisburie, to remooue that passage vnto new Salisburie in like maner,
 and vpon this occasion was the maine bridge made ouer Auon at Harneham.
 [Sidenote: Three towns decaied by changing one waie.]
 By this exchange of the waie also old Salisburie fell into vtter decaie,
 & Wilton which was before the head towne of the shire, and furnished
 with twelue parish churches, grew to be but a poore village, and of
 small reputation. Howbeit, this was not the onelie cause of the ruine of
 old Salisburie, sith I read of two other, whereof the first was a salue
 vnto the latter, as I take it. For whereas it was giuen out, that the
 townesmen wanted water in old Salisburie, it is flat otherwise; sith
 that hill is verie plentifullie serued with springs and wels of verie
 sweet water. The truth of the matter therefore is this.

 [Sidenote: An holie conflict.]
 In the time of ciuill warres, the souldiors of the castell and chanons
 of old Sarum fell at ods, insomuch that after often bralles, they fell
 at last to sad blowes. It happened therefore in a rogation weeke that
 the cleargie going in solemne procession, a controuersie fell betweene
 them about certeine walkes and limits, which the one side claimed and
 the other denied. Such also was the hot intertainment on ech part, that
 at the last the Castellanes espieng their time, gate betweene the
 cleargie and the towne, and so coiled them as they returned homeward,
 that they feared anie more to gang about their bounds for the yeare.
 Heerevpon the people missing their bellie cheare (for they were woont to
 haue banketing at euerie station, a thing commonlie practised by the
 religious in old time, wherewith to linke in the commons vnto them, whom
 anie man may lead whither he will by the bellie, or as Latimer said,
 with beefe, bread and beere) they conceiued foorthwith a deadlie hatred
 against the Castellans. But not being able to cope with them by force of
 armes, they consulted with Richard Pore their bishop, and he with them
 so effectuallie, that it was not long yer they, I meane the chanons,
 began a new church vpon a peece of their owne ground called Mirifield,
 pretending to serue God there in better safetie, and with far more
 [Sidenote: New Salisburie begun.]
 quietnesse than they could doo before. This church was begun 1219, the
 nine and twentith of Aprill, and finished with the expenses of 42000
 marks, in the yeare 1260, and fiue & twentith of March, whereby it
 appeereth that it was aboue fortie yeers in hand, although the clearks
 were translated to the new towne 1220, or the third yeere after the
 fraie. The people also seeing the diligence of the chanons, and reputing
 their harmes for their owne inconuenience, were as earnest on the other
 side to be neere vnto these prelats, and therefore euerie man brought
 his house vnto that place, & thus became old Sarum in few yeeres
 vtterlie desolate, and new Salisburie raised vp in steed thereof, to the
 great decaie also of Harnham and Wilton, whereof I spake of late.
 Neuerthelesse it should seeme to me that this new citie is not
 altogither void of some great hinderances now and then by water: for in
 the second of Edward the second (who held a parlement there) there was a
 sudden thaw after a great frost, which caused the waters so fast to
 arise, that euen at high masse time the water came into the minster, and
 not onelie ouerflowed the nether part of the same, but came vp all to
 the kings pauase where he sate, whereby he became wetshod, and in the
 end inforced to leaue the church, as the executour did his masse, least
 they should all haue beene drowned: and this rage indured there for the
 space of two daies, wherevpon no seruice could be said in the said
 minster.

 Now to returne againe from whence I thus digressed. Our Auon therefore
 departing from Salisburie, goeth by Burtford, Longford, and taking in
 the waters afore mentioned by the waie, it goeth by Stanleie, Dunketon,
 Craiford, Burgate, Fording bridge, Ringwood, Auon, Christes church; and
 finallie into the sea. But yer it come all there & a litle beneth
 [Sidenote: Sturus.]
 Christes church, it crosseth the Stoure or Sture, a verie faire streame,
 whose course is such as may not be left vntouched. It riseth of six
 heads, whereof three lie on the north side of the parke at Sturton
 within the pale, the other rise without the parke; & of this riuer the
 towne and baronie of Sturton dooth take his name as I gesse, for except
 my memorie do too much faile me, the lord Sturton giueth the six heads
 of the said water in his armes. But to proceed. After these branches are
 conioined in one bottome, it goeth to long Laime mill, Stilton, Milton,
 and beneath Gillingham receiueth a water that descendeth from Mere.
 Thence the Sture goeth to Bugleie, Stoure, Westouer bridge, Stoure
 [Sidenote: Cale.]
 prouost, and yer long it taketh in the Cale water, from Pen that commeth
 downe by Wickhampton to Moreland, & so to Stapleford, seuen miles from
 Wickhampton, passing in the said voiage, by Wine Caunton, and the fiue
 bridges. After this confluence, it runneth to Hinton Maries, and soone
 [Sidenote: Lidden.]
 [Sidenote: Deuilis.]
 after crosseth the Lidden and Deuilis waters all in one chanell, whereof
 the first riseth in Blackemore vale, and goeth to the bishops Caundell:
 the second in the hils south of Pulham, and so runneth to Lidlinch; the
 [Sidenote: Iber.]
 third water issueth neere Ibberton, and going by Fifehed to Lidlington,
 [Sidenote: Blackewater.]
 and there meeting with the Lidden, they receiue the Blackewater aboue
 Bagburne, and so go into the Stoure.

 After this the Stoure runneth on to Stoureton minster, Fitleford,
 Hammond, and soone after taking in one water that commeth from Hargraue
 by west Orchard, and a second from Funtmill, it goeth on to Chele,
 Ankeford, Handford, Durweston, Knighton, Brainston, Blandford,
 Charleton: and crossing yer long a rill that riseth about Tarrent, and
 goeth to Launston, Munketon, Caunston, Tarrant, it proceedeth foorth by
 Shepwijc, and by and by receiuing another brooke on the right hand, that
 riseth about Strictland, and goeth by Quarleston, Whitchurch, Anderston,
 and Winterburne, it hasteth forward to Stoureminster, Berford lake, Alen
 bridge, Winburne, alias Twinburne minster, whither commeth a water
 called Alen (from Knolton, Wikehampton, Estambridge, Hinton, Barnsleie)
 which hath two heads, whereof one riseth short of Woodcotes, and east of
 Farneham, named Terig, the other at Munketon aboue S. Giles Winburne,
 and going thence to S. Giles Ashleie, it taketh in the Horton becke, as
 the Horton dooth the Cranburne. Finallie, meeting with the Terig aboue
 Knolton, they run on vnder the name of Alen to the Stoure, which goeth
 to the Canfords, Preston, Kingston, Perleie, and Yolnest: but yer it
 [Sidenote: This Stoure aboundeth with pike, perch, roch,
 dace, gudgeon and eeles.]
 come at Yolnest it taketh in two brookes in one bottome, whereof one
 commeth from Woodland parke by Holt parke, and Holt, another from aboue
 vpper Winburne, by Edmondesham, Vertwood, and Mannington, and ioining
 about S. Leonards, they go to Hornebridge, and so into Stoure. After
 which confluence, the said Stoure runneth by Iuor bridge, and so into
 Auon, leauing Christs church aboue the meeting of the said waters (as I
 haue said before.)

 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 Hauing in this maner passed Christes church head we come to the fall of
 the Burne, which is a little brooke running from Stourefield heath,
 without branches; from whence we proceeded: & the next fall that we come
 [Sidenote: Poole.]
 vnto is Poole, from whose mouth vpon the shore, by southwest in a baie
 of three miles off, is a poore fisher towne called Sandwich, where we
 saw a peere and a little fresh brooke. The verie vtter part of saint
 Adelmes point, is fiue miles from Sandwich. In another baie lieth west
 Lilleworth, where (as I heare) is some profitable harborough for ships.
 The towne of Poole is from Winburne about foure miles, and it standeth
 almost as an Ile in the hauen. The hauen it selfe also, if a man should
 measure it by the circuit, wanteth little of twentie miles, as I did
 gesse by the view.

 Going therefore into the same, betweene the north and the south points,
 to see what waters were there, we left Brunkeseie Iland, and the castell
 on the left hand within the said points; and passing about by Pole, and
 leauing that creeke, bicause it hath no fresh, we came by Holton and
 Kesworth, where we beheld two falles, of which one was called the north,
 [Sidenote: Piddle.]
 the other the south waters. The north streame hight Piddle as I heare.
 It riseth about Alton, and goeth from thence to Piddle trench head,
 [Sidenote: Deuils.]
 Piddle hinton, Walterstow, and yer it come at Birstam, receiueth Deuils
 brooke that commeth thither from Brugham and Melcombe by Deuilish towne.
 Thence it goeth to Tow piddle, Ashe piddle, Turners piddle (taking in
 yer it come there, a water that runneth from Helton by Middleton,
 Milburne & Biere) then to Hide, and so into Pole hauen, and of this
 water Marianus Scotus speaketh, except I be deceiued. The south water
 [Sidenote: Frome.]
 is properlie called Frome for Frame. It riseth neere vnto Euershot, and
 going downe by Fromequitaine, Chelmington, and Catstocke, it receiueth
 there a rill from beside Rowsham, and Wraxehall. After this it goeth on
 [Sidenote: Ocus.]
 to Chilfrome, and thence to Maden Newton, where it meeteth with the
 Owke, that riseth either two miles aboue Hoke parke at Kenford, or in
 the great pond within Hoke parke, and going by the Tollards, falleth
 into the Frome about Maden Newton, & so go as one from thence to
 Fromevauchirch, Crokewaie, Frampton, and Muckilford, and receiueth neere
 vnto the same a rill from aboue Vpsidling by S. Nicholas Sidling, and
 Grimston. From hence it goeth on by Stratton and Bradford Peuerell, and
 [Sidenote: Silleie.]
 [Sidenote: Minterne.]
 [Sidenote: Cherne.]
 beneath this Bradford, it crosseth the Silleie alias Minterne and Cherne
 brooks both in one chanell: whereof the first riseth in vpper Cherne
 parish, the other at Minterne, and meeting aboue middle Cherne, they go
 by nether Cherne, Forston, Godmanston, and aboue Charneminster into
 Frome. In the meane time also our Frome brancheth and leaueth an Iland
 aboue Charneminster, and ioining againe neere Dorchester, it goeth by
 Dorchester, and Forthington; but yer it come at Beckington, it meeteth
 with another Becke that runneth thereinto from Winterburne, Stapleton,
 Martinstow, Heringstow, Caine and Stafford, and from thence goeth
 without anie further increase as yet to Beckington, Knighton, Tinkleton,
 Morton, Wooll, Bindon, Stoke, & beneath Stoke receiueth the issue of the
 [Sidenote: Luckford.]
 Luckford lake, from whence also it passeth by Eastholme, Warham, and so
 [Sidenote: Seeke more for Wilie brooke that goeth by
 West burie to Pole hauen.]
 into the Baie. From this fall we went about the arme point by Slepe,
 where we saw a little creeke, then by Owre, where we beheld an other, &
 then comming againe toward the entrance by saint Helens, and Furleie
 castell, we went abroad into the maine, and found ourselues at libertie.

 When we were past Pole hauen, we left the Handfast point, the Peuerell
 point, S. Adelmes chappell, and came at last to Lughport hauen, whereby
 and also the Luckeford lake, all this portion of ground last remembred,
 is left in maner of a byland or peninsula, and called the Ile of
 Burbecke, wherein is good store of alum and hard stone. In like sort
 going still westerlie, we came to Sutton points, where is a creeke. Then
 vnto Waie or Wilemouth, by kings Welcombe, which is twentie miles from
 Pole, and whose head is not full foure miles aboue the hauen by
 northwest at Vphill in the side of a great hill. Hereinto when we were
 entred, we saw three falles, whereof the first and greatest commeth from
 Vpweie by Bradweie, and Radipoole, receiuing afterward the second that
 ran from east Chekerell, and likewise the third that maketh the ground
 betweene Weimouth and Smalmouth passage almost an Iland. There is a
 little barre of sand at the hauen mouth, and a great arme of the sea
 runneth vp by the right hand; and scant a mile aboue the hauen mouth on
 the shore, is a right goodlie and warlike castell made, which hath one
 open barbicane. This arme runneth vp also further by a mile as in a
 baie, to a point of land where a passage is into Portland, by a little
 course of pibble sand. It goeth vp also from the said passage vnto
 Abbatsbirie about seauen miles off, where a litle fresh rondell
 resorteth to the sea. And somewhat aboue this, is the head or point of
 [Sidenote: Chesill.]
 the Chesill lieng northwest, which stretcheth vp from thence about
 seauen miles, as a maine narrow banke, by a right line vnto the
 southeast, and there abutteth vpon Portland scant a quarter of a mile
 aboue the Newcastle there. The nature of this banke is such, that so
 often as the wind bloweth vehementlie at southeast, so often the sea
 beateth in, and losing the banke soketh through it: so that if this wind
 should blow from that corner anie long time togither, Portland should be
 left an Iland as it hath beene before. But as the southwest wind dooth
 appaire this banke, so a northwest dooth barre it vp againe. It is
 pretie to note of the Townelet of Waimouth, which lieth streight against
 Milton on the other side, and of this place where the water of the hauen
 is but of small breadth, that a rope is commonlie tied from one side of
 the shore to another, whereby the ferrie men doo guide their botes
 without anie helpe of Ores. But to proceed with our purpose. Into the
 mouth of this riuer doo ships often come for succour.

 Going by Portland and the point thereof called the Rase, we sailed along
 by the Shingle, till we came by saint Katharins chappell, where we saw
 the fall of a water that came downe from Blackdeene Beaconward, by
 Portsham and Abbatsburie. Thence we went to another that fell into the
 sea, neere Birton, and descended from Litton by Chilcombe, then vnto the
 [Sidenote: Bride.]
 Bride or Brute port, a pretie hauen, and the riuer it selfe serued with
 [Sidenote: Nature hath set the mouth of this riuer in maner betwixt
 two hils, so that a little cost would make an hau[=e] there.]
 sundrie waters. It riseth halfe a mile or more aboue Bemister, and so
 goeth from Bemister to Netherburie by Parneham, then to Melplash, and so
 to Briteport, where it taketh in two waters from by east in one chanell,
 of which one riseth east of Nettlecort, and goeth by Porestoke and
 Milton, the other at Askerwell, and runneth by Longlether. From hence
 [Sidenote: Simen.]
 also our Bride going toward the sea, taketh the Simen on the west that
 commeth by Simensburge into the same, the whole streame soone after
 falling into the sea, and leauing a pretie hauenet.

 [Sidenote: Chare.]
 The next port is the Chare, serued with two rils in one confluence,
 beneath Charemouth. The cheefe head of this riuer is (as Leland saith)
 in Marshwood parke, and commeth downe by Whitechurch: the other runneth
 by west of Wootton, and meeting beneath Charemouth towne (as I said)
 dooth fall into the sea. Then came we to the Cobbe, and beheld the Lime
 [Sidenote: Buddle.]
 water, which the townesmen call the Buddle, which commeth about three
 miles by north of Lime, from the hils, fleting vpon Rockie soile, and so
 falleth into the sea. Certes, there is no hauen heere that I could see,
 but a quarter of a mile by west southwest of the towne, is a great and
 costlie iuttie in the sea for succour of ships. The towne is distant
 from Coliton, about fiue miles. And heere we ended our voiage from the
 Auon, which conteineth the whole coast of Dorcester, or Dorcetshire, so
 that next we must enter into Summerset countie, and see what waters are
 there.

 [Sidenote: Axe.]
 The first water that we meet withall in Summersetshire is the Axe, which
 riseth in a place called Axe knoll, longing to sir Giles Strangwaie,
 neere vnto Cheddington in Dorsetshire, from whence it runneth to
 Mosterne, Feborow, Claxton, Weiford bridge, Winsham foord, and receiuing
 one rill from the east by Hawkechurch, and soone after another comming
 from northwest by Churchstoke, from Wainbroke, it goeth to Axeminster,
 [Sidenote: Yare alias Arte.]
 beneath which it crosseth the Yare, that commeth from about Buckland, by
 Whitstaunton, Yarecombe, Long bridge, Stockeland, Kilmington bridge
 (where it receiueth a brooke from by south, that runneth by Dalwood) and
 so into the Axe. From hence our Axe goeth to Drake, Musburie, Culliford:
 but yer it come altogither at Culliford, it meeteth with a water that
 riseth aboue Cotleie, and goeth from thence by Widworthie, Culliton, and
 there receiuing a rill also, proceedeth on after the confluence aboue
 Culliford bridge, into the Axe, and from thence hold on togither into
 the maine sea, whereinto they fall vnder the roots of the winter
 cliffes, the points of them being almost a mile in sunder. The most
 westerlie of them called Berewood, lieth within halfe a mile of Seton.

 But the other toward the east is named Whitecliffe, of which I saie no
 more, but that "in the time of Athelstane, the greatest nauie that euer
 aduentured into this Iland, arriued at Seton in Deuonshire, being
 replenished with aliens that sought the conquest of this Iland, but
 Athelstane met and incountered with them in the field, where he
 ouerthrew six thousand of his aforesaid enimies. Not one of them also
 that remained aliue, escaped from the battell without some deadlie or
 verie greeuous wound. In this conflict moreouer were slaine fiue kings,
 which were interred in the churchyard of Axe minster, and of the part of
 the king of England were killed eight earles of the cheefe of his
 nobilitie, and they also buried in the churchyard aforesaid. Heervnto it
 addeth how the bishop of Shireburne was in like sort slaine in this
 battell, that began at Brunedune neere to Coliton, and indured euen to
 Axe minster, which then was called Brunberie or Brunburg. The same daie
 that this thing happened the sunne lost his light, and so continued
 without anie brightnesse, vntill the setting of that planet, though
 otherwise the season was cleere and nothing cloudie."

 As for the hauen which in times past as I haue heard, hath beene at
 [Sidenote: Sidde.]
 Sidmouth (so called of Sidde a rillet that runneth thereto) and likewise
 [Sidenote: Seton.]
 at Seton, I passe it ouer, sith now there is none at all. Yet hath there
 beene sometime a notable one, albeit, that at this present betweene the
 two points of the old hauen, there lieth a mightie bar of pibble stones,
 in the verie mouth of it, and the riuer Axe is driuen to the verie east
 point of the hauen called White cliffe. Thereat also a verie little gull
 goeth into the sea, whither small fisherbotes doo oft resort for succour.
 The men of Seton began of late to stake and make a maine wall within the
 hauen to haue changed the course of the Axe, and (almost in the middle of
 the old hauen) to haue trenched through the Chesill, thereby to haue let
 out the Axe, & to haue taken in the maine sea, but I heare of none effect
 that this attempt did come vnto. From Seton westward lieth Coliton, about
 [Sidenote: Colie.]
 two miles by west northwest, whereof riseth the riuer Colie, which going
 by the aforesaid towne, passeth by Colecombe parke, and afterward falleth
 betweene Axe bridge and Axe mouth towne into the Axe riuer.

 By west of Bereworth point lieth a creeke, serued (so farre as I
 remember) with a fresh water that commeth from the hilles south of
 [Sidenote: Sid.]
 Soutleie or Branscombe. Sidmouth hauen is the next, and thither commeth a
 fresh water by S. Maries from the said hils, that goeth from S. Maries
 aforesaid to Sidburie, & betweene Saltcombe & Sidmouth into the maine
 [Sidenote: Autrie alias Ottereie.]
 sea. By west of Auterton point also lieth another hauen, and thither
 commeth a pretie riueret, whose head is in the Hackpendon hilles, and
 commeth downe first by Vpauter, then by a parke side to Mohuns Auter,
 Munketon, Honniton, Buckewell, and north of Autrie receiueth a rill
 [Sidenote: Tale.]
 called Tale, that riseth northwest of Brodemburie in a wood, and from
 whence it commeth by Pehemburie, Vinniton, and making a confluence with
 the other, they go as one betweene Cadde and Autrie, to Herford, Luton,
 Collaton, Auterton, Budeleie, and so into the sea. On the west side of
 this hauen is Budeleie almost directly against Otterton. It is easie to
 be seene also, that within lesse space than one hundred yeers, ships did
 vse this hauen, but now it is barred vp. Some call it Budeleie hauen of
 Budeleie towne, others Salterne port, of a little creeke comming out of
 the maine hauen vnto Salterne village, that hath in time past beene a
 towne of great estimation.

 [Sidenote: Exe.]
 The Ex riseth in Exmore in Summersetshire, neere vnto Ex crosse, and
 goeth from thence vnto Exeford, Winsford, and Extun, where it receiueth
 a water comming from Cutcombe, by north. After this confluence it goeth
 on toward the south, till it meet with a pretie brooke rising northeast
 of Whettell (going by Brunton Regis) increased at the least with three
 rilles which come all from by north. These being once met, this water
 runneth on by west of the beacon that beareth the name of Haddon, & soone
 [Sidenote: Barleie.]
 after taketh in the Barleie, that receiueth in like sort the Done at
 [Sidenote: Done alias Done stroke.]
 Hawkbridge, and from hence goeth by Dauerton, and Combe, and then doth
 meet with the Exe, almost in the verie confines betweene Dorset &
 Summersetshires. Being past this coniunction, our Exe passeth betweene
 Brushford and Murbath, and then to Exe bridge, where it taketh in (as I
 heare) a water by west from east Austie: and after this likewise another
 on ech side, whereof one commeth from Dixford, and Baunton, the other
 [Sidenote: Woodburne.]
 called Woodburne, somewhat by east of Okeford. From these meetings it
 goeth to Caue and through the forrest and woods to Hatherland and
 Washfields, vntill it come to Tiuerton, and here it receiueth the Lomund
 water that riseth aboue Ashbrittle, & commeth downe by Hockworthie,
 vpper Loman, and so to Tiuerton that standeth almost euen in the verie
 [Sidenote: Lomund or Simming.]
 confluence. Some call this Lomund the Simming brooke or Sunnings bath.
 After this our Exe goeth to Bickleie, Theuerten, (taking in a rill by
 [Sidenote: Columbe.]
 west) nether Exe, Bramford, beneath which it ioineth with the Columbe
 that riseth of one head northeast of Clarie Haidon, and of another south
 of Shildon, and meeting beneath Columbe stocke, goeth by Columbe and
 Bradfeld, and there crossing a rill that commeth by Ashford, it runneth
 south to Wood, More haies, Columbton, Brandnicke, Beare, Columbe Iohn,
 Hoxham, and ioining (as I said) with the Exe at Bramford, passing vnder
 but one bridge, yer it meet with another water by west, growing of the
 [Sidenote: Cride.]
 [Sidenote: Forten.]
 Forten and Cride waters (except it be so that I doo iudge amisse.) The
 Cride riseth aboue Wollesworthie, and neere vnto Vpton: after it is past
 Dewrish, crosseth a rill from betweene Puggill and Stockeleie by Stocke
 English, &c. From hence it goeth to Fulford, where it meeteth with the
 Forten, wherof one branch commeth by Caldbrooke, the other from S. Marie
 Tedburne, and ioining aboue Crediton, the chanell goeth on to the Cride,
 (which yer long also receiueth another from by north, comming by
 Stockeleie and Combe) then betweene Haine and Newton Sires, to Pines,
 and so into the Exe, which staieth not vntill it come to Excester. From
 Excester (whither the burgesses in time past laboured to bring the same,
 but in vaine) it runneth to Were, there taking in a rill from by west,
 and an other lower by Exminster, next of all vnto Toppesham; beneath
 [Sidenote: Cliuus.]
 which towne the Cliue entreth thereinto, which rising about Plumtree,
 goeth by Cliff Haidon, Cliff Laurence, Brode Cliff, Honiton, Souton,
 Bishops Cliff, S. Marie Cliff, Cliff saint George, and then into the
 Exe, that runneth forward by Notwell court, Limston and Pouderham
 [Sidenote: Ken.]
 castell. Here (as I heare) it taketh in the Ken, or Kenton brooke (as
 Leland calleth it) comming from Holcombe parke, by Dunsdike,
 Shillingford, Kenford, Ken, Kenton, and so into Exe hauen, at whose
 mouth lie certeine rocks which they call the Checkstones, except I be
 deceiued. The next fall, whereof Leland saith nothing at all, commeth by
 Ashcombe and Dulish, and hath his head in the hilles thereby.

 [Sidenote: Teigne.]
 The Teigne mouth is the next fall that we came to, & it is a goodlie
 port foure miles from Exemouth. The head of this water is twentie miles
 from the sea at Teigne head in Dartmore among the Gidleie hilles. From
 whence it goeth to Gidleie towne, Teignton drue, where it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Crokerne.]
 Crokerne comming from by north, and likewise an other west of Fulford
 parke. Then it goeth to Dufford, Bridford, Kirslowe, Chidleie, Knighton,
 [Sidenote: Bouie.]
 and beneath the bridge there receiueth the Bouie, whose course is to
 north Bouie, Lilleie, and Bouitracie. Thence it runneth to kings
 [Sidenote: Eidis.]
 Teignton, taking in Eidis, a brooke beneath Preston that commeth from
 Edeford by the waie. And when it is past this confluence, at kings
 [Sidenote: Leman.]
 Teignton, it crosseth the Leman, which commeth from Saddleton rocke by
 [Sidenote: Aller.]
 Beckington, and Newton Bushels: and soone after the Aller that riseth
 betweene Danburie and Warog well, afterward falling into the sea by
 Bishops Teignton, south of Teignmouth towne.

 The verie vtter west point of the land, at the mouth of Teigne is called
 the Nesse, and is a verie high red cliffe. The east part of the hauen is
 named the Poles, a low sandie ground, either cast vp by the spuing of
 the sand out of the Teigne, or else throwne vp from the shore by the
 rage of wind and water. This sand occupieth now a great quantitie of the
 ground betweene the hauen where the sand riseth, and Teignmouth towne,
 which towne (surnamed Regis) hath in time past beene sore defaced by the
 Danes, and of late time by the French.

 From Teignemouth we came to Tor baie, wherof the west point is called
 Birie, and the east Perritorie, betweene which is little aboue foure
 miles. From Tor baie also to Dartmouth is six miles, where (saith
 Leland) I marked diuerse things. First of all vpon the east side of the
 hauen a great hillie point called Downesend, and betwixt Downesend, and
 a pointlet named Wereford is a little baie. Were it selfe, in like sort,
 is not full a mile from Downesend vpward into the hauen. Kingswere towne
 standeth out as another pointlet, and betwixt it & Wereford is the
 second baie. Somewhat moreouer aboue Kingswere towne goeth a little
 creeke vp into the land from the maine streame of the hauen called
 Waterhead, and this is a verie fit place for vessels to be made in. In
 like sort halfe a mile beyond this into the landward goeth another
 longer creeke, and aboue that also a greater than either of these called
 Gawnston, whose head is here not halfe a mile from the maine sea, by the
 compassing thereof, as it runneth in Tor baie.

 [Sidenote: Dart.]
 The riuer of Dart or Darent (for I read Derenta muth for Dartmouth)
 commeth out of Dartmore fifteene miles aboue Totnesse, in a verie large
 plot, and such another wild morish & forrestie ground as Exmore is. Of
 it selfe moreouer this water is verie swift, and thorough occasion of
 tin-workes whereby it passeth, it carrieth much sand to Totnesse bridge,
 and so choketh the depth of the riuer downeward, that the hauen it selfe
 is almost spoiled by the same. The mariners of Dartmouth accompt this to
 be about a kenning from Plimmouth. The Darent therefore proceeding from
 the place of his vprising, goeth on to Buckland, from whence it goeth to
 [Sidenote: Ashburne.]
 Buckland hole; and soone after taking in the Ashburne water on the one
 [Sidenote: Buckfastlich.]
 side that runneth from Saddleton rocke by north, and the Buckfastlich
 that commeth from north west, it runneth to Staunton, Darington,
 Hemston, and there also crossing a rill on ech side passeth foorth to
 [Sidenote: Hartburne.]
 Totnesse, Bowden, and aboue Gabriell Stoke, meeteth with the Hartburne
 that runneth vnder Rost bridge, two miles aboue Totnes, or (as another
 saith) by Ratter, Harberton, Painesford, and Asprempton into Darent,
 which yon long also commeth to Corneworthie, Grenewaie, Ditsham,
 Darntmouth towne (wherevnto king Iohn gaue sometimes a maior, as he did
 vnto Totnesse) from thence betweene the castelles, and finallie into sea.

 From hence we went by Stokeflemming to another water, which commeth from
 blacke Auton, then to the second that falleth in east of Slapton, and so
 coasting out of this baie by the Start point, we saile almost directlie
 west, till we come to Saltcombe hauen. Certes this port hath verie
 little fresh water comming to it, and therefore no meruell though it be
 barred; yet the head of it (such as it is) riseth neere Buckland, and
 goeth to Dudbrooke, which standeth betweene two creekes. Thence it hieth
 to Charleton, where it taketh in a rill, whose head commeth from south
 and north of Shereford. Finallie it hath another creeke that runneth vp
 by Ilton: and the last of all that falleth in north of Portlemouth,
 whose head is so neere the baie last afore remembred, that it maketh it
 a sorie peninsula (as I haue heard it said.)

 [Sidenote: Awne.]
 Then come we to the Awne, whose head is in the hils farre aboue Brent
 towne, from whence it goeth to Dixford wood, Loddewell, Hache, Aunton,
 Thorleston, and so into the sea ouer against a rocke called S. Michaels
 [Sidenote: Arme.]
 burrow. Arme riseth aboue Harford, thence to Stoford, Iuie bridge,
 Armington bridge, Fleet, Orchardton, Ownewell, and so vnto the sea,
 which is full of flats and rocks, so that no ship commeth thither in
 anie tempest, except it be forced therto, through the vttermost
 extremitie and desperat hazard of the fearefull mariners. King Philip of
 [Sidenote: See Hen. 7. pag. 792, 793, 794.]
 Castile lost two ships here in the daies of king Henrie the seuenth,
 when he was driuen to land in the west countrie by the rage of weather.
 [Sidenote: Yalme.]
 Yalme goeth by Cornewood, Slade, Stratleie, Yalmeton, Collaton, Newton
 ferrie, and so into the sea, about foure miles by south east from the
 [Sidenote: Plim.]
 maine streame of Plimmouth. Being past these portlets, then next of all
 we come to Plimmouth hauen, a verie busie peece to describe, bicause of
 the numbers of waters that resort vnto it, & small helpe that I haue for
 the knowledge of their courses; yet will I doo what I may in this, as in
 the rest, and so much I hope by Gods grace to performe, as shall suffice
 my purpose in this behalfe.

 [Sidenote: Plim.]
 The Plimne or Plim, is the verie same water that giueth name to Plimpton
 towne. The mouth of this gulfe, wherein the ships doo ride, is walled on
 ech side and chained ouer in time of necessitie, and on the south side
 of the hauen is a blocke house vpon a rockie hill: but as touching the
 riuer it selfe, it riseth in the hils west of Cornewood, and commeth
 downe a short course of three miles to Newenham after it be issued out
 of the ground. From Newenham also it runneth to Plimpton, and soone after
 [Sidenote: Stoure alias Catwater.]
 into the Stoure, which Stoure ariseth northwest of Shepistour, & goeth
 fr[=o] thence to Memchurch, Hele, Shane, Bickleie, and so to Eford,
 where taking in the Plim, it runneth downe as one vnder the name of
 Plim, vntill it go past Plimmouth, and fall into the hauen south east of
 Plimmouth aforesaid. I haue oftentimes trauelled to find out the cause
 whie so manie riuers in England are called by this name Stoure, and at
 the first supposing that it was growne by the corruption of Dour, the
 British word for a streame, I rested thervpon as resolued for a season:
 but afterward finding the word to be meere Saxon, and that Stouremare is
 a prouince subiect to the duke of Saxonie, I yeelded to another opinion:
 whereby I conceiue that the said name was first deriued from the Saxons.
 But to returne to our purpose.

 Plimmouth it selfe standeth betweene two creeks, not serued with anie
 backewater, therefore passing ouer these two, we enter into the Thamar
 that dischargeth it selfe into the aforesaid hauen. Going therfore vp
 that streame, which for the most part parteth Deuonshire from Cornewall,
 [Sidenote: Taue or Tauie.]
 the first riueret that I met withall on the east side is called Tauie,
 the head whereof is among the mounteins foure miles aboue Peters Tauie,
 beneath which it meeteth with another water from by west, so that these
 two waters include Marie Tauie betweene them, though nothing neere the
 confluence. From hence the Taue or Tauie runneth to Tauistocke, aboue
 which it taketh in a rill from by west, and another aboue north
 Buckland, whose head is in Dartmore, and commeth therevnto by Sandford
 and Harrow bridge. From hence it goeth into Thamar, by north Buckland,
 moonks Buckland, Beare, and Tamerton follie. Hauing thus dispatched the
 [Sidenote: Lidde.]
 Tauie, the next that falleth in on the east side vpwards is the Lidde,
 which rising in the hils aboue Lidford, runneth downe by Curriton and
 [Sidenote: Trushell.]
 Siddenham, and so to Lidstone, aboue which it receiueth the Trushell
 brooke, which rising north east of Brediston, goeth by Trusholton to
 Ibaine, where it receiueth a rill that commeth by Bradwood from
 Germanswike, and after the confluence runneth to Liston, and from thence
 [Sidenote: Core.]
 into the Thamar. The next aboue this is the Corewater, this ariseth
 somewhere about Elwell or Helwell, and going by Virginston, runneth on
 by saint Giles without anie increase vntill it come to Thamar. Next of
 all it taketh in two brookes not much distant in sunder, whereof the one
 commeth in by Glanton, the other from Holsworthie, and both east of
 Tamerton, which standeth on the further banke, & other side of the
 Thamar, and west northwest of Tedcote, except the quarter deceiue me.

 [Sidenote: Thamar.]
 Certes, the Thamar it selfe riseth in Summersetshire, about three miles
 northeast of Hartland, and in maner so crosseth ouer the whole west
 countrie betweene sea and sea, that it leaueth Cornewall, a byland or
 peninsula. Being therefore descended from the head, by a tract of six
 miles, it commeth to Denborow, Pancrase well, Bridge Reuell, Tamerton,
 Tetcote, Luffencote, Boiton, and Wirrington, where it meeteth with a
 [Sidenote: Arteie.]
 water on the west side called Arteie, that riseth short of Jacobstow.
 [Sidenote: Kenseie.]
 Two miles in like sort fr[=o] this confluence, we met with the Kenseie,
 whose head is short of Warpeston by south east: from whence it goeth by
 Treneglos, Tremone, Tresmure, Trewen, Lanston, and so into the Thamar,
 that runneth from hence by Lowwhitton vnto Bradston, and going on toward
 Dunterton, taketh in a rill from south Pitherwijc, and by Lesant;
 [Sidenote: Enian.]
 beneath Dunterton also it crosseth the Enian. This riuer riseth at
 Dauidston, and directeth his race by saint Clethir, Lancast, and
 Trelaske first; and then vnder sundrie bridges, vntill it meet with the
 Thamar. From hence also the Thamar goeth by Siddenham to Calstocke
 bridge, Calstocke towne, Clifton, Cargreue (there abouts taking in a
 creeke aboue Landilip) and running on from thence, hasteth toward
 [Sidenote: Liuer.]
 Saltash, where it receiueth the Liuer water. The head of Liuer is about
 Broomwellie hill, from whence it goeth on to North hill, Lekenhorne,
 South hill, and taking in a rill by east (from aboue Kellington) it
 runneth on to Newton, Pillaton, Wootton, Blosfleming, saint Erne, and
 beneath this village crosseth a rillet that runneth thither from Bicton
 by Quithiocke, saint Germans, and Sheuiocke. But to proceed. After the
 confluence, it goeth betweene Erlie and Fro Martine castell, and soone
 after taking in a rill from by north, that passeth west of saint
 Steuens, it is not long yer it fall into the Thamar, which after this
 (receiuing the Milbrooke creeke) goeth on by Edgecombe, and betweene
 saint Michaels Ile and Ridden point into the maine sea. And thus haue I
 finished the description of Plimmouth water, and all such falles as are
 betweene Newston rocke on the east side, and the Ram head on the other.

 After this we proceeded on with our iournie toward the west, and passing
 by Longstone, we came soone after to Sothan baie, where we crossed the
 Seton water, whose head is about Liscard, & his course by Minheniet,
 [Sidenote: Sutton.]
 [Sidenote: Low.]
 Chafrench, Tregowike, Sutton and so into the sea. Then came we to Low,
 and going in betweene it and Mount Ile, we find that it had a branched
 course, and thereto the confluence aboue Low. The chiefe head riseth in
 the hils, as it were two miles aboue Gaine, and going by that towne, it
 ceaseth not to continue his course east of Dulo, till it come a little
 aboue Low, where it crosseth and ioineth with the Brodoke water that
 runneth from Brodokes by Trewargo, and so into the sea. Next vnto these
 [Sidenote: Polpir.]
 are two other rils, of which one is called Polpir, before we come at
 Foy, or Fawy.

 [Sidenote: Fawie.]
 Foy or Fawy riuer riseth in Fawy moore, on the side of an hill in Fawy
 moore, from whence it runneth by certeine bridges, till it meet with the
 [Sidenote: Glin.]
 Glin water west of Glin towne, which rising aboue Temple, & meeting with
 a rill that commeth in from S. Neotes, doth fall into Fawy a mile and
 more aboue Resprin from by east. After this confluence then, it goeth to
 Resprin bridge, Lestermen castell, Lostwithiell bridge, Pill, saint
 [Sidenote: Lerinus.]
 Kingtons, saint Winnow, and Golant, and here also receiueth the Lerine
 water out of a parke, that taketh his waie into the maine streame by
 Biconke, Tethe, and the Fining house. Being thus vnited, it proceedeth
 vnto Fawy towne, taking in a rill or creeke from aboue it on the one
 side, and another beneath it south of Halling on the other: of which two
 this latter is the longest of course, sith it runneth three good miles
 [Sidenote: Faw.]
 before it come at the Foy. Leland writing of this riuer addeth verie
 largelie vnto it after this maner. The Fawy riseth in Fawy moore (about
 two miles from Camilford by south, and sixteene miles from Fawy towne)
 in a verie quaue mire on the side of an hill. From hence it goeth to
 Drainesbridge, to Clobham bridge, Lergen bridge, New bridge, Resprin
 bridge, and Lostwithiell bridge, where it meeteth with a little brooke,
 and neere therevnto parteth it selfe in twaine. Of these two armes
 therefore one goeth to a bridge of stone, the other to another of
 timber, and soone after ioining againe, the maine riuer goeth to saint
 Gwinnowes, from thence also to the point of saint Gwinnowes wood, which
 is about halfe a mile from thence, except my memorie dooth faile me.
 Here goeth in a salt creeke halfe a mile on the east side of the hauen,
 and at the head of it is a bridge called Lerine bridge; the creeke it
 selfe in like maner bearing the same denomination.

 [Sidenote: In the middle of this creeke was a cell of S. Ciret in an
 Islet longing sometime to Mountegew a priorie.]
 From Lerine creeke, to S. Caracs pill or creeke, is about halfe a mile,
 and Lower on the east side of the said hauen: it goeth vp also not aboue
 a mile and an halfe into the land. From Caracs creeke to Poulmorland a
 mile, and this likewise goeth vp scant a quarter of a mile into the
 land, yet at the head it parteth it selfe in twaine. From Poulmorland
 vnto Bodnecke village halfe a mile, where the passage and repassage is
 commonlie to Fawy. From Bodnecke to Pelene point (where a creeke goeth
 vp not fullie a thousand paces into the land) a mile, thence to Poulruan
 a quarter of a mile, and at this Poulruan is a tower of force, marching
 against the tower on Fawy side, betweene which (as I doo heare) a chaine
 hath sometime beene stretched, and likelie inough; for the hauen there
 is hardly two bow shot ouer. The verie point of land at the east side of
 the mouth of this hauen, is called Pontus crosse, but now Panuche
 crosse. It shall not be amisse in this place somewhat to intreat of the
 [Sidenote: Comwhath.]
 towne of Fawy, which is called in Cornish Comwhath, and being situat on
 the northside of the hauen, is set hanging on a maine rockie hill, being
 in length about one quarter of a mile, except my memorie deceiue me.

 The renowme of Fawy rose by the wars vnder king Edward the first, Edward
 the third, and Henrie the fift, partlie by feats of armes, and partlie
 by plaine pirasie. Finallie, the townesmen feeling themselues somwhat at
 ease and strong in their purses, they fell to merchandize, and so they
 prospered in this their new deuise, that as they trauelled into all
 places, so merchants from all countries made resort to them, whereby
 within a while they grew to be exceeding rich. The ships of Fawy sailing
 on a time by Rhie and Winchelseie in the time of king Edward the third,
 refused stoutlie to vale anie bonet there, although warning was giuen
 them so to doo by the portgreues or rulers of those townes. Herevpon the
 Rhie and Winchelseie men made out vpon them with cut and long taile: but
 so hardlie were they interteined by the Fawy pirates (I should saie
 aduenturers) that they were driuen home againe with no small losse and
 hinderance. Such fauour found the Fawy men also immediatlie vpon this
 bickering, that in token of their victorie ouer their winching
 aduersaries, and riding ripiers (as they called them in mockerie) they
 altered their armes and compounded for new, wherein the scutchion of
 Rhie and Winchelseie is quartered with theirs, and beside this the Foyens
 [Sidenote: Gallants of Foy or Fawy.]
 were called the gallants of Fawy or Foy, whereof they not a little
 reioiced, and more peraduenture than for some greater bootie. And thus
 much of Fawy towne, wherein we see what great successe often commeth of
 witlesse and rash aduentures. But to returne againe to our purpose from
 whence we haue digressed, and as hauing some desire to finish vp this
 our voiage, we will leaue the Fawmouth & go forward on our iournie.

 Being therefore past this hauen, we come into Trewardith baie, which
 lieth into the land betweene Canuasse and the Blacke head point, and
 here about Leland placeth Vrctoum promontorium. In this we saw the fall
 of two small brookes, not one verie far distant from another. The first
 of them entring west of Trewardith, the other east of saint Blaies, and
 both directlie against Curwarder rocke, except I mistake my compasse.
 Neither of them are of anie great course, and the longest not full three
 miles and an halfe. Wherfore sith they are neither branched nor of anie
 great quantitie, what should I make long haruest of a little corne and
 spend more time than may well be spared about them?

 [Sidenote: Austell.]
 When we were past the Blacke head, we came to Austell brooke, which is
 increased with a water that commeth from aboue Mewan, and within a mile
 after the confluence, they fall into the sea at Pentoren, from whence we
 went by the Blacke rocke, and about the Dudman point, till we came to
 [Sidenote: Chare.]
 Chare haies, where falleth in a pretie water, whose head is two miles
 aboue saint Tues. Thence we went by here and there a meere salt creeke,
 till we passed the Graie rocke, in Gwindraith baie, and S. Anthonies
 point, where Leland maketh his accompt to enter into Falamouth hauen.

 [Sidenote: Fala.]
 The Fala riseth a little by north of Penuenton towne, and going westward
 till it come downwards toward saint Dionise, it goeth forth from thence
 to Melader, saint Steuens Grampont, Goldon, Crede, Corneleie, Tregue,
 Moran, Tregunnan, it falleth into the hauen with a good indifferent
 force: and this is the course of Fala. But least I should seeme to omit
 those creekes that are betweene this and S. Anthonies point, I will go a
 little backe againe, and fetch in so manie of them, as come now to my
 remembrance. Entring therefore into the port, we haue a creeke that
 runneth vp by saint Anthonies toward saint Gereus, then another that
 goeth into the land by east of saint Maries castell, with a forked head,
 passing in the meane time by a great rocke that lieth in the verie midst
 of the hauen, in maner of the third point of a triangle, betweene saint
 Maries castell and Pendinant.

 Thence we cast about by the said castell, and came by another creeke
 that falleth in by east, then the second aboue saint Iustus, the third
 at Ardenora, the fourth at Rilan. And hauing as it were visited all
 these in order, we came backe againe about by Tregonnian, and then going
 vpward betweene it and Taluerne, till we came to Fentangolan, we found
 the confluence of two great creekes beneath saint Clements, whereof one
 hath a fresh water comming downe by S. Merther, the other another from
 Truro, increased with sundrie branches, though not one of them of anie
 greatnesse, and therefore vnworthie to be handled. Pole hole standeth
 vpon the head almost of the most easterlie of them. S. Kenwen and Truro
 stand aboue the confluence of other two. The fourth falleth in by west
 from certeine hils: as for the fift and sixt, as they be little creeks
 and no fresh, so haue I lesse language and talke to spend about them.

 [Sidenote: S. Caie.]
 Of saint Caie, and saint Feokes creeke, whose issue is betweene
 Restronget and creeke of Trurie, I see no cause to make any long speech;
 [Sidenote: S. Feoks.]
 yet I remember that the towne of S. Feoke standeth betweene them both.
 That also called after this saint, rising aboue Perannarwothill, and
 [Sidenote: Milor.]
 comming thence by Kirklo, falleth into Falamouth, northeast of Milor,
 which standeth vpon the point betweene it and Milor creeke. Milor creeke
 is next Restronget: some call it Milor poole, from whence we went by
 Trefusis point, and there found an other great fall from Perin, which
 being branched in the top, hath Perin towne almost in the verie
 confluence. And thus much by my collection of the fall. But for somuch
 as Leland hath taken some paines in the description of this riuer, I
 will not suffer it to perish, sith there is other matter conteined
 therein worthie remembrance, although not deliuered in such order as the
 thing it selfe requireth.

 [Sidenote: Fala.]
 The verie point (saith he) of the hauen mouth (being an hill whereon the
 king hath builded a castell) is called Pendinant. It is about a mile in
 compasse, almost inuironed with the sea: and where the sea couereth not,
 the ground is so low that it were a small mastrie to make Pendinant an
 Iland. Furthermore, there lieth a cape or foreland within the hauen a
 mile and a halfe, and betwixt this and maister Killigrewes house one
 great arme of the hauen runneth vp to Penrine towne, which is three
 miles from the verie entrie
 [Sidenote: Leuine.]
 of Falamouth hauen, and two good miles from Penfusis. Moreouer there is
 Leuine, Priselo, betwixt saint Budocus and Pendinas, which were a good
 hauen but for the barre of sand. But to proceed.

 The first creeke or arme that casteth on the northwest side of Falemouth
 hauen, goeth vp to Perin, and at the end it breaketh into two armes,
 whereof the lesse runneth to Glasenith, Viridis nidus, the greene nest,
 or Wagmeere at Penrine: the other to saint Glunias the parish church of
 Penrine. In like sort out of each side of Penrine creeke, breaketh an
 arme yer it come to Penrine. This I vnderstand also that stakes and
 foundations of stone haue beene set in the creeke at Penrine a little
 lower than the wharfe, where it breaketh into armes: but howsoeuer this
 standeth, betwixt the point of Trefusis and the point of Restronget is
 [Sidenote: Milor.]
 Milor creeke, which goeth vp a mile into the land, and by the church is
 a good rode for ships. The next creeke beyond the point of Restronget
 [Sidenote: Restronget.]
 wood, is called Restronget, which going two miles vp into the maine,
 breaketh into two armes. In like order betwixt Restronget and the creeke
 [Sidenote: S. Feoks.]
 [Sidenote: S. Caie.]
 of Trurie be two creekes; one called saint Feokes, the other saint Caie,
 next vnto which is Trurie creeke that goeth vp about two miles creeking
 from the principall streame, and breaketh within halfe a mile of Trurie,
 casting in a branch westward euen hard by Newham wood.

 [Sidenote: Trurie creeke.]
 This creeke of Trurie is diuided into two parts before the towne of
 Trurie, and each of them hauing a brooke comming downe and a bridge, the
 towne of Trurie standeth betwixt them both. In like sort Kenwen street
 is seuered from the said towne with this arme, and Clements street by
 east with the other. Out of the bodie also of Trurie creeke breaketh
 another eastward a mile from Trurie, and goeth vp a mile and a halfe to
 Cresilian bridge of stone. At the verie entrie and mouth of this creeke
 is a rode of ships called Maples rode: and here fought not long since
 eighteene ships of Spanish merchants, with foure ships of warre of
 Deepe, but the Spaniards draue the Frenchmen all into this harborow. A
 mile and an halfe aboue the mouth of Crurie creeke, is another named
 [Sidenote: Moran.]
 Lhan Moran of S. Morans church at hand. This creeke goeth vp a quarter
 of a mile from the maine streame into the hauen, as the maine streame
 goeth vp two miles aboue Moran creeke ebbing and flowing: and a quarter
 of a mile higher, is the towne of Cregowie, where we found a bridge of
 stone vpon the Fala riuer. Fala it selfe riseth a mile or more west of
 Roche hill, and goeth by Graund pont, where I saw a bridge of stone.

 [Sidenote: Graund pont.]
 This Graund pont is foure miles from Roche hill, and two little miles
 from Cregowie, betwixt which the Fala taketh his course. From Cregowie
 to passe downe by the bodie of the hauen of Falamouth to the mouth of
 Lanie horne pill or creeke, on the south side of the hauen is a mile,
 and (as I remember) it goeth vp halfe a mile from the principall streame
 of the hauen. From Lanihorne pill also is a place or point of sand about
 a mile waie of fortie acres or thereabout (as a peninsula) called
 Ardeuerauter. As for the water or creeke that runneth into the south
 southeast part, it is but a little thing of halfe a mile vp into the
 land, and the creeke that hemmeth in this peninsula, of both dooth seeme
 to be the greater. From the mouth of the west creeke of this peninsula,
 vnto saint Iustes creeke, is foure miles or more.

 [Sidenote: S. Iustus.]
 [Sidenote: S. Mawes.]
 In like maner from saint Iustes pill or creeke (for both signifie one
 thing) to saint Mawes creeke is a mile and a halfe, and the point
 betweene them both is called Pendinas. The creeke of saint Mawes goeth
 vp a two miles by east northeast into the land, and beside that it
 ebbeth and floweth so farre, there is a mill driuen with a fresh creeke
 that resorteth to the same. Halfe a mile from the head of this downeward
 to the hauen, is a creeke in maner of a poole, whereon is a mill also
 that grindeth with the tide. And a mile beneath that on the south side
 entereth a creeke (about halfe a mile into the countrie) which is barred
 from the maine sea by a small sandie banke, and another mile yet lower,
 is an other little creekelet. But how so euer these creekes doo run,
 certeine it is that the bankes of them that belong to Fala are
 meruellouslie well woodded. And hitherto Leland, whose words I dare not
 alter, for feare of corruption and alteration of his iudgement. Being
 past Falmouth hauen therefore (as it were a quarter of a mile beyond
 Arwennach, maister Killegrewes place which standeth on the brimme or
 shore within Falmouth) we came to a little hauen which ran vp betweene
 two hilles, but it was barred: wherefore we could not learne whether it
 were serued with anie backe fresh water or not.

 [Sidenote: Polwitherall.]
 From thence we went by Polwitherall creeke (parted into two armes) then
 [Sidenote: Polpenrith.]
 to the Polpenrith, wherevnto a riueret falleth that riseth not farre
 from thence, and so goeth to the maine streame of the hauen at the last,
 whither the creeke resorteth about three miles and more from the mouth
 of the hauen, and into which the water that goeth vnder Gare bridges,
 doo fall in one bottome (as Leland hath reported.) Vnto this hauen
 [Sidenote: Wike.]
 [Sidenote: Gare.]
 [Sidenote: Mogun.]
 [Sidenote: Penkestell.]
 [Sidenote: Callous.]
 [Sidenote: Cheilow.]
 [Sidenote: Gilling.]
 also repaireth the Penkestell, the Callous, the Cheilow, and the
 Gilling, although this latter lieth against saint Mawuons on the hither
 side hard without the hauen mouth (if I haue doone aright.) For so
 motheaten, mouldie, & rotten are those bookes of Leland which I haue,
 and beside that, his annotations are such and so confounded, as no man
 can (in a maner) picke out anie sense from them by a leafe togither.
 Wherefore I suppose that he dispersed and made his notes intricate of
 set purpose: or else he was loth that anie man should easilie come to
 that knowledge by reading, which he with his great charge & no lesse
 trauell attained vnto by experience. Thus leauing Fala hauen, as more
 troublesome for me to describe, than profitable for seafaring men,
 without good aduise to enter into, we left the rocke on our left hand,
 and came straight southwest to Helford hauen, whose water commeth downe
 [Sidenote: Haile.]
 from Wreeke (where is a confluence of two small rilles whereof that rill
 consisteth) by Mawgan and Trelawarren, and then it receiueth a rill on
 the north ripe from Constantine, after whose confluence it goeth a maine
 vntill it come to the Ocean, where the mouth is spoiled by sand comming
 from the tinworks. See Leland in the life of S. Breaca. Beneath this
 also is another rill comming from S. Martyrs, by whose course, and
 another ouer against it on the west side that falleth into the sea by
 Winniton, all Menage is left almost in maner of an Iland. From hence we
 go south to the Manacle point, then southwest to Lisard, and so north
 and by west to Predannocke points, beyond which we meet with the fall of
 the said water that riseth in the edge of Menag, and goeth into the sea
 by Melien on the north, and Winniton on the south. By north also of
 [Sidenote: Curie.]
 Winniton is the Curie water that runneth short of Magan, and toucheth
 with the Ocean south of Pengwenian point.

 [Sidenote: Loo.]
 From hence we sailed to the Loo mouth, which some call Lopoole, because
 it is narrower at the fall into the sea, than it is betweene the sea and
 Hailston. It riseth aboue S. Sethians, and comming downe by Wendron, it
 hasteth to Hailston or Helston, from whence onelie it is called Loo: but
 betweene Helston and the head, men call it commonlie Cohor. Of this
 riuer Leland saith thus: The Lopoole is two miles in length, and betwixt
 it and the maine Ocean is but a barre of sand that once in three or
 foure yeeres, what by weight of the fresh water, and working of the sea
 breaketh out, at which time it maketh a wonderfull noise: but soone
 after the mouth of it is barred vp againe. At all other times the
 superfluitie of the water of Lopole (which is full of trout and eele)
 draineth out through the sandie barre into the open sea: certes if this
 barre could alwaies be kept open, it would make a goodlie hauen vp vnto
 Haileston towne, where coinage of tin is also vsed, as at Trurie and
 Lostwithiell, for the queenes aduantage.

 Being passed the Loo, I came to another water that descendeth without
 [Sidenote: Simneie.]
 anie increase from Crowan by Simneie, whose whole course is not aboue
 three miles in all. Then going by the Cuddan point, we entered the
 mounts Baie, and going streight north (leauing S. Michaels mount a
 [Sidenote: Lid.]
 little vpon the left hand) we came to the Lid, which rising short of
 Tewidnacke, descendeth by Lidgenan, and so into the sea. Certes the
 course of these waters cannot be long, sith in this verie place this
 breadth of land is not aboue foure miles, and not more than fiue at the
 verie lands end. There is also a rill east of Korugie, and Guluall, and
 another west of the same hard at hand, and likewise the third east of
 Pensants: and not a full quarter of a mile from the second, southwest of
 Pensants also lieth the fourth that commeth from Sancrete ward by
 Newlin, from whence going southwest out of the baie by Moushole Ile,
 that lieth south of Moushole towne, we come to a water that entreth into
 the Ocean betwixt Remels & Lamorleie point. Trulie the one head thereof
 commeth from by west of Sancrete, the other from by west of an hill that
 standeth betweene them both, and ioining aboue Remels, it is not long
 yer they salute their grandame. After this, and before we come at
 Rosecastell, there are two other creekes, whereof one is called
 Boskennie, that riseth south of saint Buriens, and an other somewhat
 longer than the first, that issueth by west of the aforesaid towne,
 wherein is to be noted, that our cards made heretofore doo appoint
 S. Buriens to be at the very lands end of Cornewall, but experience now
 teacheth vs, that it commeth not neere the lands end by three miles.
 This latter rill also is the last that I doo reade of on the south side,
 and likewise on the west and north, till we haue sailed to S. Ies baie,
 [Sidenote: Bresan Ile.]
 which is full ten miles from the lands end, or Bresan Ile eastward, &
 rather more, if you reckon to the fall of the Haile, which lieth in the
 very middest and highest part of the baie of the same. The soile also is
 verie hillie here, as for saint Ies towne, it is almost (as I said) a
 byland, and yet is it well watered with sundrie rilles that come from
 those hilles vnto the same.

 [Sidenote: Haile.]
 The Haile riseth in such maner, and from so manie heads, as I haue
 before said: howbeit I will adde somewhat more vnto it, for the benefit
 of my readers. Certes the cheefe head of Haile riseth by west of
 Goodalfin hilles, and going downe toward saint Erthes, it receiueth the
 second, and best of the other three rilles from Goodalfin towne:
 finallie, comming to saint Erthes, and so vnto the maine baie, it taketh
 [Sidenote: Clowart.]
 in the Clowart water from Guimer, south of Phelacke, which hath two
 heads, the said village standing directlie betwixt them both.

 [Sidenote: Caine.]
 The Caine riseth southeast of Caineburne towne a mile and more, from
 whence it goeth without increase by west of Gwethian, and so into the
 sea west of Mara Darwaie. From hence we coasted about the point, & left
 the baie till we came to a water that riseth of two heads from those
 hilles that lie by south of the same: one of them also runneth by saint
 Vni, another by Redreuth, and meeting within a mile, they fall into the
 [Sidenote: Luggam.]
 Ocean beneath Luggam or Tuggan. A mile and a halfe from this fall we
 come vnto another small rill, and likewise two other creekes, betwixt
 which the towne of saint Agnes standeth; and likewise the fourth halfe a
 mile beyond the most easterlie of these, whose head is almost three
 miles within the land in a towne called saint Alin. Thence going by the
 Manrocke, and west of saint Piran in the sand, we find a course of three
 miles and more from the head, and hauing a forked branch, the parts doo
 meet at west aboue saint Kibbard, and so go into the sea. I take this to
 [Sidenote: S. Pirans creeke. Carantocke.]
 be saint Pirans creeke, for the next is Carantocke pill or creeke, whose
 head is at Guswarth, from whence it goeth vnto Trerise, and soone after
 taking in a rill from by west, it runneth into the sea coast of saint
 Carantakes. Beyond this is another creeke that riseth aboue little saint
 Colan, and goeth by lesse saint Columbe: and east and by north hereof
 commeth downe one more whose head is almost south of the Nine stones, &
 going from thence to great saint Columbes, it passeth by Lamberne, and
 so into the sea. S. Merous creeke is but a little one, rising west of
 Padstow, and falling in almost ouer against the Gull rocke. Then turning
 [Sidenote: Padstow.]
 [Sidenote: Locus bufonis.]
 betweene the point and the blacke rocke, we entred into Padstow hauen
 three miles lower than port Issec, and a mile from port Ewin, whose
 waters remaine next of all to be described.

 [Sidenote: Alannus.]
 The Alan ariseth flat east from the hauen mouth of Padstow, well neere
 [Sidenote: Eniam.]
 eight or nine miles about Dauidstone, neere vnto which the Eniam also
 issueth, that runneth into the Thamar. Going therefore from hence it
 passeth to Camelford, saint Aduen, saint Bernard (both Cornish saints)
 and soone after receiueth a rill at northeast, descending from Rowters
 hill. Thence it goeth to Bliseland, and Helham, the first bridge of name
 that standeth vpon Alin. Yer long also it taketh in one rill by south
 from Bodman, another from saint Laurence, the third by west of this, and
 the fourth that commeth by Wethiell, no one of them exceeding the course
 of three miles, and all by south. From hence it goeth toward
 Iglesaleward, and there receiueth a water on the east side, which
 commeth about two miles from saint Teath, by Michelston, saint Tuchoe,
 saint Maben (mo Cornish patrons) and finallie south of Iglesall, meeteth
 with the Alen that goeth from thence by S. Breaca to Woodbridge.
 Hereabout I find, that into our Alein or Alen, there should fall two
 [Sidenote: Carneseie.]
 [Sidenote: Laine.]
 riuerets, whereof the one is called Carneseie, the other Laine, and
 comming in the end to full notice of the matter, I see them to issue on
 seuerall sides beneath Woodbridge almost directlie the one against the
 other. That which descendeth from northwest, and riseth about saint Kew,
 is named Carneseie, as I heare: the other that commeth in on the
 southwest banke hight Laine, and noted by Leland to rise two miles aboue
 S. Esse. But howsoeuer this matter standeth, there are two other creekes
 [Sidenote: Pethrike.]
 [Sidenote: Minner.]
 [Sidenote: Dunmere.]
 on ech side also, beneath these, as Pethrike creeke, and Minner creeke
 (so called of the Cornish saints) for that soile bred manie, wherewith I
 finish the description of Alen, or (as some call it) Dunmere, and other
 Padstow water.

 From Padstow hauen also they saile out full west to Waterford in
 Ireland. There are likewise two rockes, which lie in the east side of
 the hauen, secretlie hidden at full sea, as two pads in the straw,
 whereof I think it taketh the name. Yet I remember how I haue read that
 Padstow is a corrupted word for Adlestow, and should signifie so much as
 Athelstani locus, as it may well be. For it is euident that they had in
 time past sundrie charters of priuilege from Athelstane, although at
 this present it be well stored with Irishmen. But to our purpose. Leland
 supposed this riuer to be the same Camblan, where Arthur fought his last
 and fatall conflict: for to this daie men that doo eare the ground
 there, doo oft plow vp bones of a large size, and great store of armour,
 or else it may be (as I rather coniecture) that the Romans had some
 field (or Castra) thereabout, for not long since (and in the remembrance
 of man) a brasse pot full of Romane coine was found there, as I haue
 often heard. Being thus passed Padstow hauen, and after we had gone
 three miles from hence, we came to Portgwin a poore fisher towne, where
 I find a brooke and a peere. Then I came to Portissec alias Cunilus two
 miles further, and found there a brooke, a peere, and some succor for
 fisher boats. Next of all vnto a brooke that ran from south east,
 directlie north into the Sauerne sea, and within halfe a mile of the
 same laie a great blacke rocke like an Iland. From this water to
 Treuenni is about a mile, where the paroch church is dedicated to saint
 Simphorian, and in which paroch also Tintagell or Dundagie castell
 standeth, which is a thing inexpugnable for the situation, and would be
 made with little reparations one of the strongest things in England. For
 it standeth on a great high terrible crag inuironed with the sea. There
 is a chappell yet standing in the dungeon thereof, dedicated to saint
 Vlet. Tintagell towne and Treuenni are not a mile in sunder.

 [Sidenote: Tredwie.]
 The next creeke is called Bosinni, which is a mile from Tintagell, and
 to the same Tredwie water resorteth, and so they go to the sea betwixt
 two hils, whereof that on the one side lieth out like an arme or cape,
 and maketh the fashion of an hauenet or peere, whither shiplets sometime
 doo resort for succour. A frier of late daies tooke vpon him to make an
 hauen at this place, but in vaine. There lie also two blacke rocks as
 Ilets, at the west northwest point, or side of this creeke, the one
 (sauing that a little gut dooth part them) ioining with the other, and
 in these by all likelihood is great store of gulles. I can not tell
 whether this be the water that runneth by Boscastell or not, but if it
 [Sidenote: Boscastell.]
 be not, then haue I this description of the latter. Boscastell creeke
 that lieth east of Tintagell, is but a small thing, running at the most
 not aboue two miles into the land, yet it passeth by foure townes,
 whereof the first is called Lesneth, the second saint Juliet, the third
 Minster, and the fourth Boscastell or Bushcastell, as some men doo
 pronounce it.

 [Sidenote: Bede.]
 In Bede baie I find the Bedewater, whose chiefe head is not farre from
 [Sidenote: Lancels.]
 Norton. Thence running to Stratton, it receiueth the Lancels rill before
 it come at Norham. And here also it crosseth another whose head is east
 of saint Marie wijke, from whence it runneth by Wolston and Whalesborow,
 and thence into the sea betweene Efford and Plough hill. And thus much
 of the waters that lie betweene the point of Cornewall, and the Hartland
 head vpon the north side of Cornewall. Now let vs doo the like with
 those that remaine of Deuonshire, whereo the said Hartland is the verie
 first point in this our poeticall voiage. Hauing therefore brought
 Hartland point on our backs, we come next of all to Barstable bar, and
 so into the hauen, whereinto two principall streams doo perpetuallie
 vnburden their chanels.

 [Sidenote: Ocus.]
 The first and more westerlie of these is called Ocus, whose head is not
 farre west of the head of Darnt, and Loth in Darntmore. Rising therefore
 in the aforesaid place, it runneth northwest to Snorton, and so to
 Okehampton, beneath which towne it meeteth with an other water comming
 from southeast, & riseth not much west from the head of Tawe. From hence
 it goeth to Stow Exborne, Moonke Okington, & Iddesleie, where it taketh
 [Sidenote: Tanridge.]
 [Sidenote: Turrege.]
 in the Tanridge a verie pretie streamelet, whose issue is not full a mile
 by east from the head of Thamar, three miles by north east from
 Hartland. Comming therefore by west and east Putford, Bulworthie,
 Bockington, Newton, and Shebbor, it receiueth a forked rill that runneth
 from ech side of Bradworthie by Sutcombe, Treborow, Milton, & so to
 Thornebirie, where meeting with an other forked water (whereof one head
 comming from Dunsland, ioineth with the other north of Cockbirie) it
 goeth with speed into the Tanridge water. After this confluence it
 [Sidenote: Buckland.]
 runneth on to Sheepewash (by west whereof falleth in the Buckland water
 from by north) thence to high Hainton, and so to Haitherlaie, north
 wherof it taketh in a rill from by south, and endeth his race at
 Iddesleie, by ioining with the Oke. Hence then the Ocus hasteth to
 Dowland, and betweene it and Doulton, receiueth one rill from by east,
 as it dooth an other betweene Doulton and Marton from by west, and so
 proceeding on with his course, it commeth east of Torrington the lesse,
 and taking in a water at east, that runneth from three heads (by Wollie
 parke) betweene which Combe and Roughborow are situat, it descendeth to
 [Sidenote: Langtree.]
 Torington the more, and meeting with the Langtree water on the one side,
 [Sidenote: Were or Ware.]
 and the Ware brooke on the other, it proceedeth to Bediford, crossing a
 rill by the waie that commeth vnto it betweene Annarie & Littham. From
 Bediford bridge it goeth without anie increase to Westleie, Norham,
 Appledoure, and so into the hauen.

 [Sidenote: Taw.]
 The Taw of both is the more noble water, notwithstanding that his hauen
 be barred with sand; and thereby dangerous, and hath most rils
 descending into his chanell. Howbeit, by these two is all the hart of
 Deuonshire well watered on the northside of the moores. The Tawy riseth
 directlie at south west of Throwlie, and north of the head of Darnt, or
 (as Leland saith) in Exmore south east from Barstable. From thence also
 it runneth to Sele, South Taueton, Cockatre, Bath, Northtaueton,
 Ashridge, Colridge, and soone after receiueth the Bowmill creeke, wherof
 [Sidenote: Bowmill.]
 one head riseth at Bow, the other at Mill, and meeting beneth Bishops
 Morchard, they fall into the Taw north of Nimeth Rowland, as I haue
 beene informed. From hence then it runneth by Edgeforth, to Chimligh, by
 south whereof it meeteth with a rill comming downe of two heads from
 about Rakenford, by Wetheridge and Chawleie. Thence it goeth to
 [Sidenote: Moulebraie.]
 Burrington, and Chiltenholtwood, and there taketh in the Moulebraie
 water consisting of two in one chanell, wherof the Moll dooth rise aboue
 north Moulton, and comming to Moulton receiueth another rill running
 from Molland, and soone after the second that growing by two brookes
 (the head of one being at Knawston, and of the other west of Crokeham,
 and both vniting themselues beneath Mariston) dooth fall into the same
 yer long also, and so go togither till it crosse the Braie, which (being
 [Sidenote: Braie.]
 the second of the two that maketh the Moulbraie) riseth at Braie,
 commeth by Buckland, and south of Holtwood dooth make his confluence
 with Taw. Being past the wood, it goeth on to Brightleie hall, Taueton,
 Tauestocke, & Berstable, sometime a pretie walled towne with foure
 gates, but now a little thing; and such in deed, as that the suburbes
 thereof are greater than it selfe. I suppose that the name of this towne
 in the British speach was Abertaw, bicause it stood toward the mouth of
 Taw, and Berdnesse pronounced short (as I gesse) for Abernesse. As for
 Staple, it is an addition for a market, & therefore hath nothing to doo
 in the proper name of the towne. King Athelstane is taken here for the
 chiefe priuileger of the towne. This is also worthie to be noted hereof,
 that the houses there are of stone, as most are in all the good townes
 thereabout.

 But to proceed with our purpose. Beneath this towne there falleth in a
 water that hath one head neere about Challacombe, & another at east
 Downe, whereof this descending by Stoke riuer, and the other by
 Sherwell, they vnite themselues within three miles of Berstaple. Soone
 after also it taketh in another that descendeth from Bitenden by
 Ashford, and the last of all east of saint Anthonies chappell, named the
 [Sidenote: Doneham.]
 Doneham, bicause one head is at west Done, and the other at Ham, both of
 them meeting west of Ash. And thus is Taue described, which is no great
 water nor quicke streame, as may appeere in Low water marke at Berstable
 and yet is it a pretie riueret. This also is worthie to be noted
 thereof, that it receiueth no brooke from by west, whereof I would
 somewhat maruell, if Taurige were not at hand.

 Being past the Taue, Cride baie and Bugpoint alias Bagpoint, we go by
 More baie, Morstone alias Mortstone, and then toward the northeast, till
 we come by a creekelet to Ilfare combe, & so to Combe Marton, whereat (I
 meane ech of them) are sundrie creekes of salt water, but not serued
 with anie fresh that I as yet doo heare of. Marrie there is betweene
 Martinbow & Trensow, a creeke that hath a backewater, which descendeth
 [Sidenote: Paradine.]
 from Parracombe (so farre as I call to mind named Parradine becke) but
 [Sidenote: Orus.]
 the greatest of all is betweene Linton and Connisberie called Ore, which
 riseth in Summersetshire in Exmore (east of Hore oke, more than a mile)
 and going by Owre, falleth into the sea betweene Linton and Conisberie,
 so that the whole race thereof amounteth in and out to an eight miles,
 as I haue heard reported. Thus haue I finished the discourse of the
 [Sidenote: The bredth of Deuonshire & Cornewall.]
 waters of Deuonshire, whose breadth in this place from hence ouerthwart
 to the Checkstones in the mouth of Ex, on the south side of the Ile, is
 eight and thirtie miles or vnder fortie, and so much likewise is it from
 Plimmouth to Hartland point, but the broadest part there commeth to six
 and thirtie miles, whereas the broadest part of Cornewall doth want two
 miles of fortie.

 Being past the aforesaid limits of the counties we came to Portlochbaie,
 [Sidenote: Loch.]
 whither commeth a water named Loch that descendeth from Stokepero,
 [Sidenote: Durus.]
 Lucham and Portloch without increase. Thence to Dunsteir brooke, which
 runneth from about Wootton, and Courtneie by Tunbercombe and Dunsteir,
 then to another that commeth west of Old Cliffe, leauing a parke on the
 [Sidenote: Vacetus.]
 west side, next of all to Watchet water, whereof one head commeth from
 the Quantocke hils south of Bickualer by Westquantocke head, and almost
 [Sidenote: Williton.]
 at Doniford, receiueth the Williton becke, then to east Quantocke brooke
 [Sidenote: Doddington.]
 (omitting a creeket) & next of all to Doddington water, that goeth by
 Holford, Alfoxton, and afterward into the sea. From hence we go by
 Bottesall point, to Stert point, where two noble riuers doo make their
 confluence, which I will seuerallie describe, as to my purpose
 apperteineth.

 [Sidenote: Iuelus.]
 The first of these is called the Iuell, or (as I find it in an ancient
 writer) Yoo, who saith that the riuer Yoo dooth runne from Ilchester to
 Bridgewater, and so into the sea. It riseth aboue Oburne, and at
 Shirburne receiueth a water, whereof Leland saith thus. There are seuen
 [Sidenote: The seuen sisters.]
 springs in an hill called the seuen sisters, north east from Shireburne,
 which gather into one bottome, & come into the Mere. Another brooke
 likewise commeth by Heidon from Puscandell, three miles from thence by
 flat east, betwixt the parke and the Mere full so great as the streame
 of the Mere, and ioining at the lower mill of Shireburne, with the Mere
 water, it is not long yer it fall into the Euill. Thence our Euill goeth
 on towards Glasen Bradford, and yer it come there taketh in a forked
 rill from by south, descending from about west Chelburie and Chetnall in
 Dorsetshire, beneath which towne the other head falleth into the same,
 so that they run foorth by Bearhaggard and Thorneford (till they meet
 with the Iuell) and so to Clifton, Euill a proper market towne, Trent,
 [Sidenote: Cade.]
 Mutford, Ashinton, and east of Limminton it meeteth with the Cade that
 runneth from Yarlington, by north Cadbirie, and soone after crossing a
 rill also from by east, that commeth from Blackeford by Compton, it
 hasteth to south Cadbirie, Sparkeford, Queenes Camell, west Camell, and
 so into Iuell, which runneth on to Kimmington, Ilchester, Ilbridge, long
 Sutton, and yer it come at Langport, taketh in two famous waters in one
 chanell, next of all to be remembred before I go anie further. The first
 of all these riseth southeast betweene the Parrets (where it is called
 [Sidenote: Parret.]
 Parret water) and goeth to Crokehorne, and at Meriot taketh in a brooke
 from the east, which consisteth of two courses vnited at Bowbridge,
 whereof the one descendeth from Pen by Hasilburie, the other from aboue
 the three Chenocks, as I doo vnderstand.

 From hence also they go as one with the Parret water, toward south
 Pederton (taking in at east a becke comming from Hamden hill) thence to
 Pederton, Lambrooke, Thorneie bridge, and Muchelneie where it meeteth
 [Sidenote: Ill.]
 with the second called Ill or Ilus, whose head is aboue Chellington, &
 comming downe from thence by Cadworth, before it come at Dunniet, it
 taketh in a rill that runneth by Chascombe and Knoll. Thence leauing
 Ilmister on the east side, it meeteth with another from by east,
 descending from about Whitlakington. Then it goeth to Pokington (where it
 [Sidenote: Ilton.]
 crosseth the Ilton water by west) next to Ilbruers, and there it ioineth
 with a rillet that riseth by west at Staple, and runneth by Bicknell and
 Abbats Ilie, and after this confluence goeth on toward Langport. And
 here after some mens opinion, the Iuell looseth his name, and is called
 Parret: but this coniecture cannot hold, sith in the old writers it is
 called Iuell, till it fall into the sea. Neuerthelesse, how soeuer this
 matter standeth, being past Langport, it goeth by Awber toward saint
 Anthonies, where it meeteth with the Tone next of all to be described.

 [Sidenote: Tone.]
 The Tone issueth at Clatworthie, and goeth by west of Wiuelscombe, to
 Stawleie, Ritford, Runton, Wellington and Bradford, beneath which it
 taketh in a faire water c[=o]ming from Sanford Combe, Elworthie, Brunt
 Rafe, Miluerton, Oke and Hilfarens. After this confluence also it
 runneth to Helebridge, and there below meeteth with one water that
 runneth by Hawse, Hethford, and Norton, then another from Crokeham by
 bishops Slediard, and the third & fourth at Taunton, that descendeth
 from Kingston by north, and another by south that riseth about
 Pidmister. And thus is the Tone increased, which goeth from Taunton to
 Riston, Crech, Northcurrie, Ling, and so by Anthonie into the Iuell,
 [Sidenote: Chare or Care.]
 that after this confluence meeteth yer long with the Chare, a pretie
 riuer that commeth by east from Northborow, by Carleton, Badcare,
 Litecare, Somerton, Higham, Audrie moore, Audrie, and Michelsborow. From
 whence going on betweene Queenes moore and North moore, it receiueth one
 [Sidenote: Peder.]
 brooke called Peder from by southwest, that runneth through Pederton
 parke and North moore; and likewise another that passeth by Durleie, yer
 it doo come at Bridgewater. From Bridgewater it goeth by Chilton
 directlie northwest, and then turning flat west, it goeth northward
 towards the sea, taking in two waters by the waie, whereof one runneth
 [Sidenote: Camington.]
 by Coripole & Camington, and beareth the name of Camington, the other by
 [Sidenote: Brier.]
 Siddington and Comage, and then receiuing the Brier before it come at
 Start point, they fall as one into the Ocean, whereof let this suffice
 for the description of the Iuell, whose streame dooth water all the west
 part of Summersetshire and leaueth it verie fruitfull.

 [Sidenote: Brier.]
 The Brier, Bruer, or Breer, riseth of two waters, wherof one is in
 Selwood forest, & commeth downe by Bruecombe, Bruham, and Bruton. The
 [Sidenote: _Leland_ writeth the first Brieuelus and the second
 Mellodunus or the Milton water.]
 other which Leland nameth Mellos, is northest of Staffordell towne, and
 going by the same, it runneth by Redlinch, to Wike; where it meeteth
 with the other head, and thence go on as one to Awnsford, Alford (where
 [Sidenote: Dulis.]
 it taketh in a water called Dulis from by north that riseth neere
 Dolting, and commeth by Euerchurch parke) then to the Lidfords, Basborow
 wood, the Torhill, Pont perilous (whereinto they fable that Arthur being
 wounded to death did throw Calibur his sword) by Glastenburie and so into
 the Meere. Beside this riuer there are two other also that fall into the
 [Sidenote: Sowaie or Stowaie.]
 said Meere, whereof the one called Sowaie commeth from Creechurch parke,
 [Sidenote: Cos.]
 and Pulton by Hartlacke bridge, the other named Cos or the Coscombe
 water, from aboue Shepton, Mallet (which east of Wike taketh in a water
 comming from Welles) by Wike, Gedneie, and so into the Meere. Finallie,
 returning all into one chanell, it runneth to Burtlehouse, and soone
 after diuiding it selfe, one arme goeth by Bastian alias Brent bridge,
 to High bridge, leauing Huntspill a market towne by southwest, the other
 by Marke to Rokes bridge, Hebbes passage, and so into the sea, leauing a
 faire Iland, wherin beside Brentmarsh are seuen or eight townes, of
 whose names I haue no knowledge.

 Now as touching the water that commeth from Welles, which falleth (as I
 said) into the Coscombe water on the right hand of the Cawseie; you shall
 vnderstand that as manie springs are in Wels, so the chiefe of them is
 named Andres well, which riseth in a medow plat not farre from the east
 end of the cathedrall church, and afterward goeth into the Coscombe, in
 [Sidenote: Milton.]
 [Sidenote: Golafer.]
 such place as I haue noted. Leland speaketh of the Milton & Golafer
 waters, which should fall likewise into the Brier: but whether those be
 they whereof the one riseth aboue Staffordell, and in the descent
 runneth by Shipton, Pitcombe, and so to Awnsford on the one side, as the
 other dooth rise betweene Batcombe and Vpton noble on the other halfe;
 or vnto whether of them either of these names are seuerallie to be
 attributed: as yet I doo not read.

 [Sidenote: Axe. 2.]
 The second Axe which commeth by Axe towne in old time called Vexa,
 issueth out of Owkie hole, from whence it goeth by Owkie towne, afterward
 [Sidenote: The Chederbrooke, driueth twelue miles within a quarter of
 a mile of his head.]
 meeting with the Chederbrooke that commeth from the Cheder rocks,
 wherein is an hole in old time called Carcer AEoli, wherof much hath
 beene written & surmised past credit. It runneth by Were, Ratcliffe, and
 after a little compasse into the northeast branch of the aforesaid riuer
 last described, betweene Rokes bridge and Hebbes passage, as I haue
 beene informed. From the fall of Axe we come to an other called Bane,
 [Sidenote: Bane.]
 northeast of Woodspring, whose head is about Banwell parke, or else in
 [Sidenote: Artro.]
 Smaldon wood. Then to an other, and to the third, called Artro, which
 riseth about Litton, and going by the Artroes, Vbbeie, Perribridge
 (receiuing a rill yer it come thither from by south) beneath
 Cungesbirie, or (as I learne) betweene Kingston and Laurence Wike, it
 meeteth with the sea.

 [Sidenote: Sottespill.]
 Sottespill water riseth betweene Cheueleie and Naileseie, howbeit it
 hath no increase before it come into the sea at Sottespill, more than
 [Sidenote: Cleueden.]
 the next vnto it, which is named Cleueden water, of a certeine towne
 neere to the fall thereof. It riseth southeast of Barrow, goeth by
 [Sidenote: Auon. 3.]
 Burton Naileseie, and so vnto Cleuedon. The Auon, commonlie called the
 third Auon, is a goodlie water, and growne to be verie famous by sundrie
 occasions, to be particularlie touched in our description of Bristow.
 Yet thus much will I note heere thereof as a rare accident, how that in
 king Edgars daies, the verie same yeare that the old monasterie of
 Euesham fell downe by itselfe, a porpasse was taken therein neere to the
 said monasterie, and neuer anie before or since that time heard of to
 haue beene found in that streame. And euen so not manie yeares before I
 [Sidenote: Sturgion taken in Rochester water.]
 first wrote this treatise, a sturgion was taken aliue in Rochester
 streame, which the bishop gaue vnto your honor, and you would as gladlie
 haue sent it to the queenes maiestie, if she might haue beene presented
 withall aliue as it was taken. Certes both these rare occurrents gaue no
 lesse occasion of strange surmises to the inhabitants of both places,
 than the blockes of Brerton, when they appeare, doo vnto that familie;
 of which the report goeth that they are neuer seene but against some
 mischeefe or other to befall vnto that house. But how farre am I gone
 from my purpose?

 The Auon therefore riseth in the verie edge of Tetburie, and goeth by
 long Newton to Brokenton, Whitchurch, and Malmsburie, where it receiueth
 two waters, that is to saie, one from by west comming by Foreleie and
 Bromleham, which runneth so neere to the Auon in the west suburbe of
 Malmsburie, that the towne thereby is almost made an Iland. Another from
 Okeseie parke by Hankerton, Charleton, and Garesden. After this
 confluence it hasteth to Cole parke, then goeth it toward the southeast,
 till it meet with a water comming from southwest (betweene Hullauington
 and Bradfield) by Aston: and soone after with another at the northside
 from Binall by Wootton Basset (through the parke to Gretenham, and
 Idouer bridges) and after the confluence to Dauntseie, Segar, Sutton,
 Christmalford, Auon, Calwaies house, and then to west Tetherton. Beneath
 this towne also it taketh in a water increased by two brookes, whereof
 one comming from Cleue by Hilmarton, Whitleie house and Bramble (and
 there receiuing another that commeth by Calne) passeth on by Stanlie
 into the Auon, which from thencefoorth goeth to Chippenham, Rowdon,
 [Sidenote: Cosham.]
 Lekham, and then receiuing Cosham water, goeth to Lacocke, Melsham, and
 yer it come at Whaddon, crosseth two other in one chanell, whereof one
 riseth about Brumham house, and goeth to Sene, the other about the
 Diuizes, and from thence runneth to Potterne wood, Creeke wood, Worton,
 Maston, Bucklington, and ioining with the other aboue Litleton, they run
 by Semmington, and north of Whaddon aforesaid into the maine streame,
 whereof I now intreat. From hence our Auon runneth to Stauerton, and
 [Sidenote: Were.]
 southwest of that towne meeteth with the Were that commeth from Vpton by
 [Sidenote: Westbirie vnder the plaine,
 neuer without a theefe or twaine.]
 Dilton, Brooke parke (there crossing a rill called Bisse from Westbirie
 vnder the plaine) then to north Bradleie, Trubridge, and so into Auon
 that goeth from thence to Bradford, & within a mile or thereabouts,
 before it come at Freshford, it meeteth with the Frome, whose
 description dooth insue.

 [Sidenote: Frome.]
 The Frome riseth in the east part of Mendip hils, and from thence
 runneth by Astwijc, the Cole pits, Lie vnder Mendip, Whateleie,
 [Sidenote: Nonneie.]
 Elmesbridge, and soone after taketh in the Nonneie water, comming from
 Nonneie castell, thence to Walles and Orcharleie bridge, where it
 receiueth a pretie brooke descending from Frome Selwood west of
 Brackleie, increased with sundrie rils, whereof two come out of Selwood
 forrest (and one of them from the Fratrie) another out of Long lead
 parke, from Horningsham, and the fourth from Cosleie. Hence our Frome
 goeth to Lullington, Beckington, Farleie castell, Bord and Fresh foord,
 [Sidenote: Silling.]
 and taking in the Silling brooke, falleth into the Auon beneath
 Bradford, and east of Freshford. From thence going beneath Stoke, it
 receiueth on the left hand a water comming from southwest, increased by
 sundrie brookes, whereof one commeth from Camelet by Litleton, and
 Dankerton, the other from Stone Eston, Midsummer Norton, by Welston,
 Rodstocke, Wrigleton, Foscot, and Wellow, and there (taking in a rill
 from Phillips Norton) it goeth by Clauerton to Hampton, and there it
 meeteth with another water comming from Barthford, whose head is at
 Litleton from whence it runneth by west Kineton to Castell combe (where
 it ioineth with a rill rising by north from Litleton drue) and thence
 commeth south to Slaughtenford, Haselburie, Box, Baithford, and so into
 the Auon, which turning plaine west, hasteth to Baithwijc, and (meeting
 with another in his passage from Caldaston) to Bath, the Tiuertons, and
 Coston.

 Heere also it taketh in a rill by the waie from Markesburie by Wilmerton
 and Newton, and then going on to Sawford, it meeteth with one rill soone
 [Sidenote: Swinford.]
 west of Northstocke, named Swinford, and another by Bitton, from Durhain
 by Wike, and so proceedeth still holding on his way to Caimsham, a towne
 [Sidenote: Swinford parteth Summerset & Glocestershires in sunder.]
 in Summerset shire (so called of Caim an English saint, by whose
 praiers, as the countrie once beleeued, all the adders, snakes and
 serpents were turned into stone, their formes reserued, and for a
 certeine space of ground about the said towne, and whereof some store as
 yet is to be found in those quaries. But this miracle is so true as the
 historie of Hilda, or that S. Patrike should chase all venemous
 creatures out of Italie, with his staffe; or that maid Radegund should
 driue the crowes to the pound, which did annoie hir corne while she went
 vnto a chappell to heare & see a masse) where it crosseth the Chute,
 which issueth at Winford, and goeth by bishops Chue to Penford, and
 there receiueth the Clue comming from Cluton, and from thence to Chute,
 & so into the Auon. The Auon likewise after all these confluences goeth
 to Briselton, and so to Bristow, beneath which it receiueth a rill on
 each side (wherof one commeth from about Stoke lodge in Glocestershire,
 being a faire water and running by Acton, Frampton, Hambroch, Stapleton,
 and through Bristow, the other by south from Dundreie hill and towne, by
 Bisport and Bedminster) and so descending yet lower, goeth to Rawneham
 passage and Clifton, then by S. Vincents rocke and Laie, next of all to
 Crocampill, and finallie into the sea, whither all waters by nature doo
 resort.

 [Sidenote: Alderleie.]
 Beside this water, Leland maketh mention of Alderleie brooke, which in
 some ancient records is also called Auon, and runneth by Barkeleie. In
 [Sidenote: Douresleie.]
 like maner he talketh of Douresleie becke, whose principall head is in
 Douresleie towne: howbeit he saith no thing of it more, than that it
 [Sidenote: Torworth.]
 serueth sundrie tucking lucking milles, and goeth by Tortworth or foure
 miles further, before it come at the Sauerne. Finallie, making mention
 of an excellent quarrie of hard stone about Douresleie, he telleth of
 the Tortworth becke, that runneth within a flight shot of Barkeleie
 towne, and falleth on the left hand into Sauerne marches, taking with
 all the Alderleie or Auon, except I mistake his meaning, which may soone
 be doone among his confused notes.




 THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SAUERNE, & SUCH WATERS AS DISCHARGE THEMSELUES
 INTO THE SAME.

 CHAP. XIII.


 [Sidenote: Sauerne.]
 The Sauerne which Ptolomie calleth Sabriana, Tacitus Sabrina, diuideth
 England or that part of the Iland, which sometime was called Lhoegres
 from Cambria, so called of Camber, the second sonne of Brute, as our
 histories doo report. But now that region hight Wales, of the Germane
 word Walsh, whereby that nation dooth vse to call all strangers without
 respect of countrie. This riuer tooke the name of a certeine ladie,
 called Habren or Hafren, base daughter to Locrinus begotten vpon
 Estrildis daughter to Humber otherwise called Cumbrus or Vmar, and for
 which some write Chonibrus king of Scithia, that sometime inuaded this
 Island, and was ouerthrowne here in the daies of this Locrinus, as shall
 be shewed at hand: although I suppose rather that this ladie was called
 Ine, and that the word Sabrina is compounded of Aber and Ine, and the
 letter S added "Propter euphoniam:" for the mouth or fall of euerie
 riuer in the British speech is called Aber, whereby Aber Ine is so much
 to saie as, the fall of Ine. But let vs returne againe to our discourse
 of Humber or Vmar, which is worthie to be remembred.

 For after the death of Locrinus, it came to passe that Guendolena his
 wife ruled the kingdome in the nonage of hir sonne: and then getting the
 said Estrildis and Habren hir daughter into hir hands, she drowned them
 both in this riuer. And in perpetuall remembrance of hir husbands
 disloialtie towards hir, she caused the streame to be called Habren of
 the yoong ladie, for which the Romans in processe of time for readinesse
 and mildnesse of pronunciation, wrote Sabrina, and we at this time doo
 pronounce the Sauerne. Of the drowning of the said Abren also I find
 these verses insuing:

                   In fluuium praecipitatur Abren,
   Nomen Abren, fluuio de virgine, nomen eidem
     Nomine corrupto deinde Sabrina datur.

 But to returne to our Sauerne. It falleth into the maine sea betweene
 Wales and Cornewall, which is and shall be called the Sauerne sea, so
 long as the riuer dooth keepe hir name. But as the said streame in
 length of course, bountie of water, and depth of chanell commeth farre
 behind the Thames: so for other commodities, as trade of merchandize,
 plentie of cariage, & store of all kind of fish, as salmon, trouts,
 breames, pikerell, tench, perch, &c: it is nothing at all inferiour or
 second to the same. Finallie, there is nothing to be discommended in
 this riuer, but the opennesse thereof in manie places to the weather,
 whereby sundrie perils oft ouertake such as fish or saile in small
 vessels on the same.

 The head of this noble streame is found in the high mounteines of south
 Wales called Helennith or Plim limmon; in English, the blacke mounteins,
 or moore heads, from whence also the Wie and the Rhidoll do proceed: and
 therefore these three waters are commonlie called the three sisters, and
 haue in latitude two and fiftie degrees ten minutes, in longitude
 fifteene and fiftie, as the description inferreth. So soone as it is out
 of the ground, it goeth southeastward, till it come within a mile of
 Laundlos, where it receiueth a chanell from by south southwest, called
 the Dulas, which commeth thereinto on the south side, & southwest of Lan
 Idlos. It riseth (as it should seeme) of diuerse heads in the edge of
 Radnorshire, and taking in sundrie small rilles, it meeteth at the last
 [Sidenote: Brueham.]
 with the Brueham brooke, and so they go togither till they fall into the
 [Side note: Clewdogh.]
 Sauerne. Beneath Lan Idlos it taketh in the Clewdogh, from northwest, a
 water producted by the influence of foure pretie brookes, whereof one is
 [Sidenote: Bacho.]
 [Sidenote: Dungum.]
 [Sidenote: Lhoid.]
 [Sidenote: Bigga.]
 [Sidenote: Couine.]
 called Bacho, another Dungum comming out of lin Glaslin, the third Lhoid
 rising in lin Begilin, and the most southerlie called Bigga. After which
 confluence our Sauerne proceedeth on by Berhlaid toward Landiman, taking
 in by the waie, on the east side the Couine, thence to Cairfuse castell,
 [Sidenote: Carnon.]
 [Sidenote: Taran.]
 where it meeteth with the Carnon, and the Taran both in one chanell, and
 going not far from the aforesaid fortresse. After this it crosseth the
 [Sidenote: Hawes.]
 [Sidenote: Dulesse 2.]
 Hawes on the north halfe beneath Aberhawes, next of all the Dulesse that
 riseth in the edge of Radnor shire, and meeteth with it before it come
 at Newton in Powisie, otherwise called Trenewith, as I find in British
 language. Being come to Trenewith, I cannot eschue (right honorable) to
 giue one note, as by the waie, touching the originall of my ladie your
 bedfellowes ancestrie, which came from hence, & were surnamed Newtons
 onelie, for that the grandfather of sir John Newton either dwelled or
 was borne there: otherwise the right name is Caradoc, for which some doo
 corruptlie write Cradocke, respecting rather the shortnesse of
 pronuntiation, than the true orthographie and writing of the word.
 Certes the Caradockes haue beene, and yet are a linage of great honor,
 antiquitie, and seruice; their lands also sometime belonged (for the
 most part) to the noble Connoanies of Summersetshire: but in what order
 they descended to the Newtons, in good sooth I cannot tell. But to
 proceed with our riuer, which being past Newton, runneth foorth by
 [Sidenote: Mule.]
 Landilouarne, and so foorth on till it come to the fall of the Mule,
 whose head is in the edge of Radnor also, and thereto his passage by
 Kerie and Lanmereiwijc. After this also it proceedeth further till it
 [Sidenote: Kenlet.]
 [Sidenote: Camalet.]
 [Sidenote: Tate.]
 meet with the Kenlet or the Camalet, which taketh in also the Tate or
 Tadbrooke water rising out of the hilles a mile from Bishops towne, the
 whole course thereof being about seauen miles from the head (as I haue
 often heard.) Of this also I find two descriptions, whereof one I borrow
 out of Leland, who saith that it is a pretie brooke, running in the vale
 by Mountgomerie, and comming within halfe a mile of the place where
 Chirbirie priorie stood, it falleth into the Sauerne about a mile from
 thence. Of the rilles (saith he) that run from the hilles thorough
 Mountgomerie, which are a mile from the Sauerne shore, and likewise of
 [Sidenote: Lan Idlos.]
 the Lan Idlos brooke that meeteth withall within foure miles of the
 head, I speake not, but thinke it sufficient to touch those of some
 estimation, onelie leauing the rest to such as maie hereafter deale with
 things more particularlie as time and trauell maie reueale the truth to
 them. And hitherto Leland, whose words I dare not alter. But another
 noteth this Camalet or Kenlet to run by More, Liddiom, Sned,
 Churchstocke, Chirbirie, Walcote, and Winsbirie, and so into the
 Sauerne.

 From hence then, and after this confluence it goeth on by Fordon,
 Leighton, and Landbreuie toward Meluerleie, and there it meeteth with
 [Sidenote: Tanet.]
 sundrie waters in one chanell, whereof the one called the Tanet is a
 [Sidenote: Peuereie or Murnewie.]
 verie pretie water (whereinto the Peuereie or Murneweie doth fall, which
 descendeth from the hilles by west of Matrafall not farre from Lhan
 [Sidenote: Auernie.]
 Filin) the other Auernie, and ioining beneath Abertannoth, or aboue
 Lannamonach neere unto the ditch of Offa, it is not long yer they meet
 [Sidenote: Mordant.]
 with the Mordant brooke, and there loose their names so soone as they
 ioine and mix their waters with it. The head of the Mordant issueth out
 of the Lanuerdan hilles, where diuerse saie, that the parish church of
 crosse Oswald or Oswester sometimes stood. Certes, Oswester is thirteene
 miles northwest from Shrewesburie, and conteineth a mile within the
 walles. It hath in like sort foure suburbs or great streetes, of which
 one is called Stratlan, another Wuliho, the third Beterich, wherein are
 one hundred and fortie barns standing on a row belonging to the citizens
 or burgesses, and the fourth named the Blackegate street, in which are
 thirtie barns mainteined for corne and haie. There is also a brooke
 [Sidenote: Simons becke.]
 running thorough the towne by the crosse, comming from Simons well, a
 bow shoote without the wall; & going vnder the same betweene Thorowgate
 & Newgate, running vnder the Blacke gate. There is another, ouer whose
 [Sidenote: Bederich.]
 course the Baderikes or Bederich gate standeth, and therefore called
 Bederich brooke. The third passeth by the Willigate or Newgate, & these
 fall all togither with the Crosse brooke, a mile lower by south into the
 Mordant that runneth (as I said) by Oswester. From hence also it goeth
 to Mordant towne, and betweene Landbreuie and Meluerleie doth fall into
 the Sauerne. After this our principall streame goeth to Sheauerdon
 castell, Mountford, and Bicton chappell: and here it receiueth a water
 on the left hand, that riseth of two heads, whereof one is aboue Merton,
 the other at Ellismere, and ioining betweene Woodhouses & Bagleie, the
 confluence runneth on by Radnall, Halton, Teddesmer, Roiton, Baschurch,
 Walford, Grafton, Mitton, and so into the Sauerne. From hence it runneth
 to Fitz, Eton, or Leiton, Barwijc, vpper Rossall, Shelton, and so to
 Shrewsburie, where it crosseth the Mele water, whose head (as I heare)
 is said to be in Weston.

 [Sidenote: Mele.]
 The Mele therefore rising at Weston, goeth by Brocton, Worthen, Aston
 [Sidenote: Haberleie.]
 Pigot, Westleie, Asterleie, and at Lea it meeteth with the Haberleie
 water that commeth downe by Pontesford and Aunston. After this
 confluence also it runneth to Newenham & Crokemele, there taking in a
 rill on the other side that descendeth by Westburie and Stretton, &
 thence going on to Hanwood, Noball, Pulleie, Bracemele, and
 Shrewesburie, it falleth (as I said) into the open Sauerne. From hence
 our Sauerne hasteth to Vffington, Preston, and betweene Chilton and
 Brampton taketh in the Terne, a faire streame and worthie to be well
 handled; if it laie in me to performe it. This riuer riseth in a mere
 beside Welbridge parke, neere vnto Ternemere village in Staffordshire.
 From whence it runneth by the parkes side to Knighton, Norton, Betton,
 and at Draiton Hales crosseth with a water comming from about Adbaston
 (where maister Brodocke dwelleth) and runneth by Chippenham and Amming:
 [Sidenote: Terne.]
 so that the Terne on the one side, and this brooke on the other, doo
 [Sidenote: * See Hen. 6. pag. 649]
 inclose a great part of [*]Blore heath, where a noble battell was
 somtime purposed betweene king Henrie the sixt, and the duke of Yorke:
 but it wanted execution.

 But to proceed. After this confluence, it runneth to Draiton Hales,
 Ternehill bridge: and yer long taking in a rill from Sandford by
 Blechleie, it goeth to Stoke Allerton, Peplaw, and Eaton, where it
 crosseth with a brooke that riseth about Brinton, and going by Higham,
 Morton, the great Mere, Forton, Pilson, Pickstocke, Keinton, Tibberton,
 and Bolas, it ioineth with the said Terne not farre from Water Vpton.
 Thence passing to Crogenton, it meeteth with another brooke that commeth
 from Chaltwen Aston, by Newport, Longford, Aldneie, and so through the
 Wilde moore to Kinsleie & Sleepe, and finallie into the Terne, which
 hasteth from thence to Eston bridge, and neere vnto Walcote taketh in
 [Sidenote: Roden.]
 the Roden. This water riseth at Halton in Cumbermere lake: and comming
 to Ouenleie, crosseth a rill from Cowlemere by Leniall. Thence it goeth
 to Horton, and (ioining with another rill beneath Nonlaie that commeth
 from Midle) runneth on to Wen, Aston, there crossing a rill beneath
 Lacon hall from Prees ward, and so to Lee, Befford, Stanton, Morton,
 Shabree, Painton, Roden, Rodington, and then into Terne, that runneth
 from thence by Charlton, Vpton, Norton, Barwijc, Acham, and so into the
 Sauerne two miles beneath Shrewesburie (as I weene.)

 Thus haue I described the Terne in such wise as my simple skill is able
 to performe. Now it resteth that I proceed on (as I maie) with the
 Sauerne streame, with which, after this former confluence, it goeth vnto
 Roxater or Roxcester, Brampton, Eaton vpon Sauerne, Draiton, where it
 [Sidenote: Euerne.]
 ioineth with the Euerne that runneth from Frodesleieward by Withiall and
 Pitchford, Cresfedge, Garneston, Leighton, and betweene the two
 [Sidenote: Wenlocke or Rhe.]
 Bildasses crosseth the Rhe or Wenlocke water, and so goeth on to
 Browsleie and Hoord parke, where it vniteth it selfe with another brooke
 to be described in this place, whilest the Sauerne rests, and recreates
 it selfe here among the plesant bottoms.

 This water ariseth aboue Tongcastell, and yer it haue run anie great
 distance from the head, it meeteth with a rill comming by Sheriffe
 Hales, and Staunton. Thence it goeth on to Hatton, Roiton, and there
 crossing another from Woodhouses, comming by Haughton and Euelin, it
 [Sidenote: Worfe.]
 proceedeth to Beckebirie and Higford, and not omitting here to crosse
 the Worfe (sometime a great streame that runneth vnto it out of Snowdon
 poole) and so passeth foorth to Badger, Acleton, Worffield: a litle from
 whence (about Wickin) it taketh in another brooke into it called Churle,
 & so goeth on to Rindleford, and then into Sauerne somwhat aboue
 Bridgenorth at Penston mill (except mine information deceiue me.) From
 Bridgenorth our Sauerne descendeth to Woodburie, Quatford, and there
 [Sidenote: Marbrooke.]
 taking in the Marbrooke beneath Eaton that riseth aboue Collaton, and
 goeth by Moruill & Vnderton, it runneth by Didmanston, Hempton, Aueleie,
 & beneath in the waie to Bargate, crosseth with a brooke comming from
 Vpton parke, by Chetton, Billingsleie, and Highleie, which being
 admitted, it holdeth on to Areleie, Ciarnewood parke, Hawbach and
 [Sidenote: Dowlesse.]
 Dowlesse. Here also it meeteth with the Dowlesse water, a pretie brooke
 issuing out of the Cle hilles in Shropshire, verie high to looke vpon,
 and three miles or thereabouts from Ludlow, which runneth through
 [Sidenote: Lempe.]
 Clebirie parke in Wire forrest, & taking withall the Lempe, dooth fall
 into the Sauerne not far from Bewdleie.

 But to proceed. From Bewdleie our Sauerne hasteth directlie to Ribford,
 [Sidenote: Stoure.]
 Areleie and Redston, and here it meeteth with a water called Stoure,
 descending from Elie, or out of the ponds of Hales Owen in
 Worcestershire, where it receiueth a rill from the left hand, and
 another from the right, and then goeth on to Sturbridge (taking in there
 the third water yer long running from Sturton castell) then to Kniuer
 Whittenton, Ouerleie and Kidormister, aboue which it crosseth one
 brookelet that commeth thither by Church hill, and another beneath it
 that runneth by Belborow, betwixt which two waters lieth an od peece of
 Staffordshire included, and also the Cle hill. From hence the aforesaid
 Sauerne hasteth by Redston to Shrawleie; and aboue this towne receiueth
 [Sidenote: Astleie.]
 the Astleie water, as beneath the same it dooth another. From Witleie
 then it goeth on to Holt castell, and so to Grimleie, taking in
 [Sidenote: Doure.]
 [Sidenote: Sulwaie.]
 thereabout with the Doure, and Sulwaie waters, whereof this riseth at
 Chadswijc, and runneth by Stoke priorie, & Droitwich, the other aboue
 Chaddesleie, and commeth by Dourdale. After this it goeth foorth vnto
 Worcester, in old time called Cair Brangon, or Cair Frangon, where it
 [Sidenote: Tiber.]
 meeteth with the Tiber, or Tiberton water, on the right hand aboue that
 citie, and beneth it neere vnto Powijc with the Temde, whose description
 shall be set downe before I proceed or go anie further with the Sauerne.

 [Sidenote: Temde.]
 The Temde, or (as some name it) the Tame riseth vp in Radnorshire, out
 of the Melenith hilles, and soone after his issue, meeting with a water
 from Withall, it runneth to Begeldie, Lanuerwaterden, and so to
 Knighton, which is fiue or six miles (as I heare) from his originall.
 From Knighton it goeth ouer the ditch of Offa vnto Standish, and
 [Sidenote: Clude.]
 crossing a rill that commeth from betweene the parke named Clude, (and
 is a bound of Radnorshire) it goeth to Buckton, Walford, and Lanuarden,
 where it meeteth with the Bardwell or Berfield, and the Clun, both in
 one chanell, of which I find these descriptions here folowing word for
 [Sidenote: Barfield.]
 word in Leland. The Bardwell or Barfield riseth aboue New Chappell, in
 [Sidenote: Clun.]
 the honour of Clun, hard by the ditch of Offa, and goeth by Bucknell.
 The Clun issueth out of the ground betweene Lhan Vehan and Maiston, and
 going on by Bucton, Cluncastell, Clundon, Purslaw, and Clunbirie, it
 crosseth with a brooke that runneth along by Kempton and Brampton.
 Thence going foorth by Clunbirie, Brome, Abcot and Marlow, it meeteth
 with the Bardwell, and so in the Temde, not verie far from Temderton. I
 [Sidenote: Owke.]
 suppose that Leland calleth the Bardwell by the name of Owke, but I will
 not abide by it bicause I am not sure of it. After these confluences
 therefore, our Temde goeth by Trippleton, Dounton, Burrington, and
 [Sidenote: Oneie.]
 Broomefield, where it meeteth with the Oneie, which is an indifferent
 streame, and increased with sundrie waters, whereof I saie as followeth.

 [Sidenote: Bow.]
 The first of all is called the Bow. It riseth (as I learne) in the
 hilles betweene Hissington and Shelue, and from thence commeth downe by
 [Sidenote: Warren.]
 Lindleie and Hardwijc, where it crosseth the Warren that issueth out of
 the ground about Rotlie chappell, and runneth by Adston and Wentnor.
 After the confluence also going on by Choulton and Cheinies, it taketh
 [Sidenote: Queneie and Strabroke.]
 in the Queneie and Strabroke both in one chanell, wherof the first
 riseth at Lebotwood, and commeth downe by the Strettons, till it passe
 by Fellanton. The second mounteth about Longuill, and goeth by
 Rushburie, Newhall, Harton, and Alcaster, from whence it is not long yer
 it fall into the Queneie, and so by Stratford into the Oneie, which hath
 borne that name since the confluence of the Bow and Warren at Hardwijc,
 whereof I spake before. Finallie, the Oneie which some call the
 [Sidenote: Somergill.]
 Somergill being thus increased, it runneth on to Hawford chappell,
 Oneibirie, Broomefield, and so into Temde, and next of all to Ludlow.
 [Sidenote: Corue.]
 The Temde being thus brought to Ludlow, meeteth with the Corue, which
 commeth thorough Coruedale from aboue Brocton by Morehouses, Shipton,
 Hungerford, and a little beneath taking in a rill that commeth by
 Tugford, and Brencost castell, goeth on to Corsham castell, and there
 crossing another from saint Margarets Clee, it hieth to Stanton Lacie,
 and so likewise to Ludlow.

 From Ludlow in like sort it goeth to Ludford, the Ashfordes, little
 [Sidenote: Ladwich.]
 Hereford, Burrington, and at Burfford vniteth it selfe with the Ladwich
 that commeth beneath Milburne stoke, from betweene Browne, Cleehill, and
 Stittertons hill, to Middleton, Henleie, Ladwich, Conam, and so into
 Temde, which beneath Temdbirie receiueth another rill on the other side,
 [Sidenote: Rhe.]
 and the second on the left hand called Rhe, that commeth from aboue
 Ricton, Staterton, Hound, Nene, Clebirie, Knighton, and then into the
 Temde. From hence the Temde doeth goe by Astham, Lingridge, Shelleie
 Welch, Clifton, Whitburne (and crossing a water that commeth from the
 Sapies) to Knightwijc and Bradwaies. Hereabout againe it interteineth a
 rill that descendeth from about Kidburie on the right hand, and goeth by
 Collomatherne, Credeleie, Aufrike, and so into Temde, and then
 proceeding forward, the said streame runneth to Braunford, and yer long
 [Sidenote: Langherne.]
 (taking in the Langherne that riseth about Martleie, and passeth by
 Kengewijc) it goeth to Powijc, and so into the Sauerne before it come at
 Wickecester.

 Thus haue I brought all such streames before me that fall into the
 Sauerne from the head, vntill I come to Powijc, wherof (as you may
 easily perceiue) the Temde is the most excellent. Now it resteth that I
 proceed with the rest of the discourse intended concerning this our
 riuer. Certes, from Powijc mils which are about halfe a mile beneth
 Worcester, the Sauerne runneth on to Kempseie and Cleueld, whence after
 it hath crossed a brooke comming from Cowleie, it hasteth first to
 Stoke, and so to Vpton, which is eleuen or twelue miles from Glocester,
 whither it floweth manie times at high tides, but yer it come there, it
 drowneth another fall descending from Maluerne hilles by Blackemoore
 parke, & soone after the third growing by two branches, wherof one
 commeth also from Maluerne hils by little Maluerne and Welland, the
 other from Elderford by Pendocke and Longdon. After these confluences in
 like sort, it runneth to Bushelleie, and Tewkesburie, where it receiueth
 the Auon, that followed next of all in order to be described, before I
 proceed anie further in my discourse of Sauerne.

 [Sidenote: Auon 4.]
 The Auon riseth at Nauesbie in the borders of Northamptonshire, a little
 side hand of Gillesborow and foot of the hils whereon Nauesbie standeth,
 and euen out of the church yard of the said village. From hence it goeth
 to Welford, Stamford, Lilburne, Clifton, and Rugbie, by north whereof it
 [Sidenote: Swiuethus.]
 crosseth a water called Swift, which commeth from aboue Kimcote, to
 Lutterworth, Browne ouer and Colsford. From thence also it goeth to
 [Sidenote: Souus.]
 Newbold, Wolston, Ruington, and betweene the Stonlies taketh in the Sow.
 This Sow is a pretie water comming from aboue Calendon to Whitleie, and
 soone after meeting with a riueret from Couentrie, which some doo call
 Shirburne water, it goeth thence to Bagginton, where it taketh in a rill
 [Sidenote: Kinell.]
 called Kinell, as I haue read from Kenelsworth, from whence it runneth
 to Stonleie, & so into the Auon. After this confluence the Auon
 proceedeth on to Stonleie abbeie, Ashehow, Miluerton, Edmonds cote, and
 appace to Warwijc.

 But yer it come there, it meeteth from south east with two waters in one
 chanell, whereof the least commeth to Marton from Bishops Itchington, by
 Herburbirie and Thorpe, where it crosseth a rill from Southam. The other
 [Sidenote: Leame.]
 is called Leame, or Lime that descendeth from about Helladon, or neere
 vnto Catesbie in Northamptonshire, and going by Ouencote, Braunston,
 Lemington and Mertun, it ioineth with the other, and then go from thence
 togither vnder the name of Leame, to Hunnington, Cobbington, and so into
 the Auon, as I gaue notice before. At Warwike also the Auon taketh in a
 water running northwest from Groue parke. Thence it goeth on to
 Bereford, and there crossing another from Shirburne, it passeth forth to
 Bishops Hampton, meeting finallie with the third, from Kineton that
 runneth by Walton and Charlecote. After this last rehearsed confluence,
 it hasteth to Stretford vpon Auon, and then to Luddington ward, where it
 [Sidenote: Stoure.]
 taketh in the Stoure that riseth aboue Cherington, & whose course from
 thence is such, as that being once past the head, it goeth by Weston, and
 yer long crossing a water from Campden, hanging Aston, & Todnam, it
 runneth to Barcheston, Aldermaston, Clifford, & so into the Auon.
 From hence then the said Auon goeth to Luddington, Burton, Bitford, and
 Cleue, and being parted from the said towne, yer it come at Sawford, it
 [Sidenote: Arow.]
 receiueth the Arow or Aur, which rising in the blacke hils in
 Worchestershire, commeth by Alchurch, Beleie parke, Ypsleie, Studleie,
 [Sidenote: Alne.]
 and then taking in another rill called Alne, out of Fecknam forrest, and
 going by Coughton parke, it hasteth to Alcester, Arow, Ragleie,
 Wheteleie, Bouington, Standford, and so into Auon, which after this
 conjunction goeth to Vffenton & then to Eouesholme: but yer it come
 there it receiueth two waters in one chanell, whereof the first riseth
 about Willerseie, the other neere to Buckland, and ioining beneath
 [Sidenote: Pludor.]
 Badseie, they fall into Anon, vnder the name of Pludor brooke, before it
 come to Eouesholme.

 [Sidenote: Vincelus.]
 Being past Eouesholme it crosseth the Vincell, which rising out of the
 hils somewhere about Sudleie, runneth two miles further to Winchelcombe,
 and Gretton, and taking in a rill by the waie from Hailes, proceedeth on
 (going within one quarter of a mile of Hailes abbaie) to Tuddington, or
 Doddington, beneath which when it hath crossed another rill that commeth
 from Stanwaie, it goeth to Wannington, Sedgeborow, and receiuing there
 the last on the right hand also (as all aboue rehearsed) it falleth into
 the Auon, when it is come by Hinton, vnto a towne called Hampton, or (as
 some doo write it) Ampton. After this confluence the Auon goeth to
 Charleton, to Crapthorne (and there taking in a rill on the left hand)
 to Fladbirie wike, and almost at Persore bridge, meeteth with a branched
 [Sidenote: Piddle.]
 water that commeth by Piddle, whereof one head is at Alberton, an other
 at Piddle. From Persore it goeth to Birlingham, and soone after carrieng
 a brooke withall descending from Fakenham, by Bradleie, Himbleton,
 Huddenton, Crowleie, Churchhill, Pibleton, Besseford and Desseford, it
 fleeteth to Eckington, Bredon, Twining, Mitton, and Tewkesburie, where
 it ioineth with the Sauerne.

 Now to resume the course of the Sauerne, you shall vnderstand, that from
 Tewkesburie it goeth to Derehirst, the How passage, and soone after
 [Sidenote: Chilus.]
 receiuing the Chiltenham water that commeth thither by Bodenton, Sawton,
 and Norton, it runneth to Ashelworth, Sainthirst; and here it parteth it
 selfe till it come to Glocester, where it vniteth it selfe againe. But
 in the meane time the easterlie branch receiueth a forked chanell,
 whereof one head is not far fr[=o] Leke Hampton, the other about
 Witcombe, from whence it goeth to Brockworth. The other branch or arme
 taketh in the Leadon that commeth downe by Preston, Dimmocke, Pantleie
 [Sidenote: Leadon.]
 vpper Leadon, Leadon court, and there taking in one rill that commeth
 from Linton by Areknoll, and another beneath it from Tainton by Rudford,
 it falleth into the said branch on the right side, before it come at
 Glocester.

 The Sauerne therefore being past Glocester, it meeteth with a litle rill
 on the right hand, and thence holding on his course by Elmore,
 Minsterworth, Longneie, to Framilode, it receiueth yer it come at this
 [Sidenote: Strowd.]
 latter the Strowd brooke, which rising not farre from Side, goeth by
 Massade, Edgeworth, Frampton, Strowd, and receiuing there a water that
 commeth from Panneswijc Lodge, by Pittescombe on the one side, and
 another from Radbridge on the other, it prosecuteth his voiage to Stone
 house, Eslington, white Misen, & so toward Framilode, where the said
 Strowd dooth fall into the Sauerne. After the fall of Strowd, the
 Sauerne goeth from thence to Newenham, and Arlingham, and soone after
 receiuing a water on each side, whereof one commeth from Vleie by Cham
 and Chambridge, the other by Blackneie and Catcombe, it goeth foorth
 till it meet with another water on ech side, whereof that on the English
 halfe is forked, so that one head thereof is to be found about Borwell,
 the other at Horton, and meeting aboue Tortworthie, they run by Stone
 and Barkeleie castell, and so into the Sauerne. That on the Welsh halfe
 [Sidenote: Newarne.]
 is named Newarne, which coemeth from the forrest of Deane, and so into
 the Sauerne.




 OF SUCH WATERS AS FALL INTO THE SEA IN COMPASSE OF THE ILAND, BETWEENE
 THE SAUERNE AND THE HUMBER.

 CHAP. XIV.


 The Sauerne being thus described, it resteth that I go forward with the
 names of those that lie vpon the coast of Southwales, making my entrie
 at the ferrie ouer betweene Aust in Glocestershire, and a village on the
 further banke of Sauerne, not farre from Tarendacus chappell, in the
 [Sidenote: Wie mouth.]
 mouth of the riuer Wie, which ferrie is about three miles ouer (saith
 [Sidenote: Guie alias Wie.]
 Leland) or else my memorie dooth faile me. This riuer Guie or Wie
 beginneth (as I said before) on the side of the hilles, where the
 Sauerne dooth arise, and passing through Wenceland, that is, southeast
 by Raiader Guie to Buelt (where the Irwon meeteth withall) it goeth to
 Glasburie, Hereford, Monmouth, and finallie into the Sauerne sea at
 Chepstow: for so they call Monhafren, which seuereth Wales from
 Summersetshire, Deuonshire, Cornewall: as for the Rhidoll which is the
 third sister, it hath the shortest course of all, for it runneth
 northward, and into the sea at Aberistwith, which is not farre off, as
 the writers doo report.

 Leland writing of this riuer Guie or Wie saith thus; The Wie goeth
 thorough all Herefordshire by Bradwarden castell, belonging to sir
 Richard Vehan, and so to Hereford east, thence eight miles to Rosse, a
 [Sidenote: Vmber a fish onelie in the Wie.]
 market towne in Herefordshire: and in this riuer be vmbers, otherwise
 called grailings. It is also found by common experience, that the salmon
 of this riuer is in season, when the like fish to be found in all other
 riuers is abandoned and out of vse; wherof we of the east parts doo not
 a little maruell. But let vs not staie vpon these descriptions, sith an
 other is come to my hand more exact than either of these.

 The Guie therefore riseth out of the blacke mounteines of Wales, out of
 which the Sauerne springeth in Radnorshire, and comming by Lhangerike,
 [Sidenote: Darnoll.]
 and Raiadargoie, it receiueth one rill from the west called Darnoll, and
 another from by northeast comming by saint Harmon. Thence it goeth to
 Lhanuthell, and in the waie betwixt Raiader and Lhanuthell, it ioineth
 [Sidenote: Elland.]
 with the Elland, whose head is neere to Comeristwith, and taketh
 [Sidenote: Clardwen.]
 likewise into him the Clardwen that diuideth for a season Radnorshire
 from Brecknoch, which Clardwen is likewise increased by the Clarthie
 within three miles of his head and lesse, hauing his course from
 southwest & hille soile adiacent. From Lhanuthell it goeth west of
 [Sidenote: Ithan.]
 Dissart, where it receiueth the Ithan, a riuer rising aboue Lhanibister,
 and from whence it runneth to Landwie, and Lambaderne vawr: beneath
 which it crosseth a water on ech side, whereof that on the right hand
 [Sidenote: Dulesse.]
 [Sidenote: Cluedoch.]
 consisteth on the Dulesse and the Cluedoch, after their confluence: the
 [Sidenote: Lamaron.]
 other hight Lomaron, whose head is aboue Lanthangle, and in the forrest
 of Blethwag. After these confluences, it runneth on crinkeling in
 [Sidenote: Hawie.]
 strange manner, vnder the name of Ithor, till it come to Dissart, taking
 in the Hawie on the left side yer it come there, and then into the Wie
 on the north side, which directeth his course further to Bealt, where it
 [Sidenote: Yrwon.]
 receiueth the Yrwon, a notable streame, descending from the hilles aboue
 Lanihangle Abergwessen, and thence comming downe by Lanurid Lang marsh,
 Lanauan, Vechan, Langantan, and so to Beth or Bealt, being inlarged by
 [Sidenote: Weuereie.]
 the waie with sundrie faire waters, as the Weuereie, whose head is about
 Lanauan moore, the Dulasse, or (as some call it) the Dowlasse, that
 [Sidenote: Dulasse.]
 [Sidenote: Comarch.]
 [Sidenote: Dulasse.]
 commeth from the hilles west of the head of Weuereie. The Comarch whose
 head and course is west of the Dowlasse on the north side, and likewise
 by two other on the southwest, and Dilasse from by southwest, which last
 rehearsed falleth into him halfe a mile and more aboue the influence of
 the Comarch which lieth on the other side. After this our Yrwon goeth to
 [Sidenote: Dehon.]
 Lhanuareth, where it crosseth the Dehon on the southwest side, then to
 [Sidenote: Edwie.]
 Aberedwie, and there receiueth the Edwie on the northeast, which ariseth
 in the hilles aboue Botins chappell, and commeth downe by Crigend and
 Lanhaderne, thence the Guie goeth on to Lanstephan, and there (or a
 [Sidenote: Machaweie.]
 little aboue) taketh in the Machaweie that commeth by castell Paine, and
 [Sidenote: Leuenni.]
 so going on in processe of time with the Leuenni, whereof Leland in his
 commentaries doth write as here insueth.

 [Sidenote: Euer.]
 [Sidenote: Euerie.]
 The Leuenni, otherwise called the Euer or Euerie, is a farre streame
 rising in Welch Talgarth hard by Blaine Leuenni, among the Atterill
 hilles, from whence it goeth to Brecknoch mere, which is two miles long,
 and a mile broad, and where men doo fish in Vniligneis or botes of one
 peece, as they doo in Lhin Seuathan, which is foure miles from Brecknoch.
 Finallie bringing great store of red sand withall, and there with the
 [Sidenote: Brennich.]
 Brennich water (that hath his originall issue at Mennith gader, and is
 [Sidenote: Trufrin.]
 increased with the Trufrin) it falleth into the Wie aboue Glesbirie
 three miles from Haie, at a place that of the onelie fall of this brooke
 is named Aberleuenni, after this the Guie. Being come to Haie, a pretie
 towne where much Romane coine is found, which they call Jewes monie: and
 after it hath passed or crossed a little brooke, which commeth from
 [Sidenote: Dulesse.]
 Lanigon, it meeteth with the Dulesse that commeth also from the Atterill
 by Kersop, and from thence goeth to Clifford castell (being now entred
 into Herefordshire, and leauing Radnor, wherevnto it hath for a long
 course beene march) then to the Whitneies, Winferton, Letton,
 Bradwarden, Broberie, Monington, Biford, Bridgesalers, Eaton, Brinton,
 and Hereford, without anie influence of riuer worthie of memorie, and
 yet with manie windlesses, & there meeteth with a water rising short of
 Wormesleie, which goeth by Maunsell, Lacie, Brinsop, Crednell, Stretton,
 and Huntington, and soone after into the Wie, beside a little rill that
 runneth betweene them both euen into Hereford towne. From hence in like
 sort the Wie hasteth to Rotheras church, Hampton, and Mordeford, where
 [Sidenote: Lug.]
 it taketh in sundrie waters in one chanell, of which the Lug or Luie is
 the principall, and next of all to be described, before I go anie
 further with the course of the Wie, whereinto it dischargeth the
 chanell. It riseth in the edge of the forrest of Kemples aboue Langunlo:
 from whence it goeth to Momonacht, Pilleth Whitton, Fuldibrooke,
 Prestaine, so into Herefordshire, where betweene Bonie & Beton, or
 Bitton, it receiueth in the Somergill, whose crotched head being march
 to Radnor forrest, directeth his streame betweene the new and old
 Radnors, to Knill, to Nash, and so into the Lug, which presentlie
 passeth by Kinsham, Shirleie, Ailmister, Kingsland, Eaton chappell, and
 so into Lemister, where it crosseth the Oneie (a streamelet rising short
 of Shobden, and going by Chorlester) a little before it come to the west
 side of the towne.

 At Lemister it selfe in like sort three waters doo meet, and almost
 [Sidenote: Pinsell.]
 inuiron the towne, that is to saie, the Lug, the Pinfulleie or Pinsell
 [Sidenote: Kenbrooke.]
 (a riueret rising at Kingsland two miles from Lemister) & the Kenbrooke,
 which commeth out of the blacke mounteins, from Lemister, otherwise
 called Leofminster, of the builder, and also Leonminster, the Lug or
 Luie goeth on to Eaton, and there taketh in a rill beneath Hampton, and
 aboue Hope, whereof one head is betweene Hatfield and Bickleton, another
 neere vnto Marston, and meeting of both at Humber. From Hampton it goeth
 to Bodenham, Wellington, Morton, Sutton, Shelwijc, Lugwardin, and
 [Sidenote: Fromeie.]
 Longward, where it crosseth the Fromeie or Frome, a pretie water, and
 worthie to be remembred. It riseth about Wolferelaw, from whence it
 commeth downe toward the southest by Edwinsloch to Bromyard, Auenburie,
 Bishops Frome, Castell Frome, Can Frome, to Stretton vpon Frome, and
 [Sidenote: Loden alias Acton.]
 there taking in a water called Loden, comming from aboue Bishops
 Grendon, by Pencombe, Cowarne, Stoke Lacie, Cowarne, and Engleton, our
 Frome goeth on to Yarkeleie, Dornington, and Longward, and so into the
 Lug, betweene Longward and Suston, which runneth foorthwith to Mordford,
 or Morthford, and there into the Wie, vnto whose description I now
 returne againe.

 Being come therefore vnto Mordford, it goeth to Fawnehope, Hamlacie,
 [Sidenote: Treske.]
 Ballingham, Capull regis, where it receiueth a water called Treske, from
 little Berch by Treske, Fawleie, How, Capull Inkeston, Foie, Brampton,
 Bridstow, Wilton castell, the Rosse, and there a rill from Bishops
 Vptonward by Rudhall, Weresend, Ham, Glewston, Godderich, here in like
 sort meeting with another that commeth from Ecleswall in the confines of
 Glocestershire, by Peniard castell & Coughton, to Welch Bicknor, English
 Bicknor, Huntesham, including a parcell of Monmouthshire, being an
 outliggand, as ye may find in that parcell of Herefordshire which butteth
 vpon Glocestershire (as you shall find the like peece of Herefordshire
 in the confines of Salop and Worcester, wherein Rochford standeth,
 beside manie other which I haue elsewhere spoken of) Whitchurch, where
 [Sidenote: Gainar.]
 it taketh in Gainar water that commeth from Much Birch, by Lanwarne,
 [Sidenote: Garran.]
 Michaell church, and at Langarran crosseth the Garran brooke, that
 riseth in Gregwood, short of Arcop, six miles from Monemouth by
 northwest: after which these two doo runne as one to Marston, and almost
 Whitchurch, and so into the Wie, which goeth from thence to Gunnarew, S.
 Michaell, Dixton, and Monemouth, where I will staie a while, till I haue
 described the Mone, next of all to be remembred here.

 [Sidenote: Mona.]
 The Mona or Monbecke, riseth in the forrest of Hene, twentie miles from
 Monemouth by west in Eirisland, and going by Creswell, or Craswall
 chappell not farre from the marches of Brecknocke, and northeast of
 Hatuill hils, which after it hath run a good distance from the head
 [Sidenote: Eskill.]
 receiueth first the Eskle, and passeth by Lanihangle and the old Court,
 [Sidenote: Elkon.]
 from northweast, then the Olcon, from southwest, which meeteth withall
 neere Cledoll or Knedoch, & passing by the old towne, it hasteth to
 Altrinis, where it becommeth march betweene Hereford and Monemouth
 shires, and taketh in a water comming by Trewin, & likewise the Hordwie
 [Sidenote: Hodneie.]
 or Hodneie which riseth in Becknocke, among the Saterelles, & runneth by
 Capell a fin, Lantonie, Cumroie, Michaell church in Monemouthshire, and
 ioineth with our Mona at Altrinis, which after this confluence hasteth
 to Walderstone, Lansillo Langua, betweene which and Kinechurch it ioineth
 [Sidenote: Doure.]
 with the Doure that riseth about the Bache aboue Dourston, which is six
 miles aboue Doure abbie, so that it runneth through the Gilden dale, by
 Peterchurch, Fowchurch, Morehampton, Newcourt, Doure, and beneath Doure
 [Sidenote: Dulesse.]
 taketh in the Dulesse, from southwest and Lanihangle, by Harleswas
 [Sidenote: Wormesbecke.]
 castell on the one side, and yer long the Wormesbecke, descending from
 aboue Keuernall by Didleie, Deuerox, Workebridge, and Kenderchurch on
 the other, and so running all in one chanell vnto Mona, that riuer goeth
 on to Kinech church, Grismond, Cardwaie, Skenfrith, Warnethall,
 Perthire, and so to Monemouth, where it meeteth with the Wie, ouer each
 of which riuers Monemuth towne hath his particular bridge.

 The Guie or Wie therefore being increased with thus manie brookes and
 waters, passeth on from hence, and going toward Landogo, it meeteth with
 [Sidenote: Trollie.]
 the Trollie becke, whose head is aboue Lannam ferrie in the north part
 of Monemouth shire, and goeth from thence by Lhantellio, Lanihangle,
 Gracedieu, Diggestow, Wonastow, Troie, and so into Wie, that runneth
 [Sidenote: Elwie.]
 also by Wies wood chase, taking in there the Elwie that commeth from
 aboue Landelwie by Langowen, Lannissen, Penclase, Trilegh, and Langogo,
 where meeting with the aforesaid streame, the Wie directeth his course
 from thence by Tinterne abbeie (where it crosseth a rill from Trile
 grange) Chapell hill, Parcasicke, Penterie chapell, Lancante, Chepstowe,
 and so into the sea, leauing the Treacle (a chappell standing on a
 rocke) on the hand betweene it & Sauerne, ouer against the point that
 lieth south of Betteslie. Next vnto the Wie, I find a rill of no great
 course, comming downe from Mounton chappell, by a place of the bishops
 of Landaffe. Thence passing by Charston rocke, and the point whereon
 [Sidenote: Trogie.]
 Trinitie chappell standeth, I come vnto the fall of Trogie, which riseth
 short of Trogie castell, and runneth toward the sea, by Landuair,
 Dewston, Calicot, and so into the Ocean, ouer against the Charston
 rocke. The next fall is of a water that commeth from aboue Penho by saint
 [Sidenote: Dennie Iland in the middest of the Sauerne,
 and likewise another litle one called Beuerage.]
 Brides, north and by west of Dennie Iland, which lieth midwaie betweene
 that fall & Porshot point, and before I touch at Goldcliffe point, I
 crosse another fall of a fresh brooke, whose head is aboue Landueigo in
 Wencewood, and course by Lhanbed, Langston, Lhanwarme, and through the
 More to Witston.

 [Sidenote: Wiske.]
 Next vnto this is the Aberwish, or Wiske, in Latine Osca, whereon
 Caerleon standeth, sometime called Chester and Ciuitas legionum, bicause
 the Romans soiourned there, as did afterward Arthur the great, who also
 held a noble parlement in the same, whereof Galfride maketh mention Lib.
 7. cap. 4. affirming thereto, that in those daies the maiestie thereof
 was such, as that all the forefronts of their houses were in maner laid
 ouer with gold, according to the Romane vsage. There was in the same in
 like sort a famous vniuersitie, wherein were 200 philosophers; also two
 goodlie churches erected in the remembrance of Iulius and Aaron, two
 Brittish martyrs, whereby it might well be reputed for the third
 metropoliticall see in Britaine. But to our water, whereof I read that
 it is furthermore one of the greatest in Southwales, and huge ships
 might well come to the towne of Caerleon, as they did in the time of the
 Romans, if Newport bridge were not a let vnto them; neuerthelesse, big
 botes come thereto. It is eight Welsh or twelue English miles from
 Chepstow or Strigull, and of some thought to be in base Wenceland,
 though other be of the contrarie opinion. But howsoeuer the matter
 standeth, this riuer is taken to be the bounds of Brechnockshire, as
 Renni is middle to Wenceland & Glamorganshire. But to leaue these
 by-matters, and come to the description of the water.

 [Sidenote: Vske.]
 You shall vnderstand that the Vske or Wiske, in Latin Osca riseth in the
 blacke mounteins ten miles aboue Brechnocke toward Carmardine, the hill
 being properlie called Yminidh Duy out of which it falleth, and situate
 in the verie confines betweene Brechnocke and Carmardine shires, from
 whence winding into the northeast, it commeth to Trecastle, and in the
 [Sidenote: Craie.]
 waie betweene it and Capell Ridburne, it taketh in the Craie brooke, on
 the right hand before it come to Ridburne chappell. Going also from
 [Sidenote: Sennie.]
 thence toward Deuinocke, it crosseth the Senneie on the same side (which
 [Sidenote: Camblas.]
 [Sidenote: Brane.]
 riseth aboue Capell Senneie) next of all the Camblas, & at Aberbraine,
 the Brane, or the Bremich, whose head is three miles from Brechnocke,
 and running by Lanihangle, it meeteth I saie with the Vske, about master
 [Sidenote: Yster.]
 Awbries manor. Beneath Aber Yster, it receiueth the Yster, which riseth
 northwest aboue Martyr Kinoch, and commeth by Battell chappell, and
 going from thence by Lanspithed and Newton, it runneth in the end to
 [Sidenote: Hodneie.]
 Brechnocke, where it taketh in the Hodneie or Honthie on the one side,
 whose head is in Blaine Hodneie, and comming downe from thence by
 Defrune chappell, Lanihangle and Landiuilog, it meeteth with the Vske or
 Brechnocke townes end, which of the fall of this water was sometime
 called Aberhodni, as I haue beene informed: on the other halfe likewise
 [Sidenote: Tertarith.]
 it receiueth the Tertarith that riseth among the Bane hils, fiue miles
 from Brechnocke, and commeth likewise into the verie suburbs of the
 towne, beneath Trenewith, or new Troie, whereby it taketh the course.

 [Sidenote: Kinuricke.]
 After these confluences, the Vske proceedeth on toward Aberkinurike, or
 the fall of a water whose head is in the roots of Menuchdennie hill, and
 passage by Cantreffe. Thence it goeth by Lanhamlaghe, Penkethleie
 castell, Lansanfreid, Landettie, Langonider, and soone after receiuing
 [Sidenote: Riangall.]
 the Riangall (which riseth about the hill whereon Dinas castell
 standeth, and runneth by Lanihangle and Tretoure) it passeth betweene
 Laugattocke and Cerigkhowell, to Langroinie, and there about crosseth
 [Sidenote: Groini.]
 the Groinie brooke, that descendeth from Monegather, Arthur hill, by
 Peter church, as I find. When the Vske is past this brooke, it taketh in
 three other short rils, from by south within a little distance, whereof
 [Sidenote: Cledoch Vaur.]
 [Sidenote: Fidan.]
 [Sidenote: Cledochveh[=a].]
 the first hight Cledoch Vaur, the second Fidan, and the third
 Cledochvehan. Of these also the last falleth in neere to Lanwenarth.
 From hence the Vske runneth to Abergeuenni towne, where it meeteth
 [Sidenote: Kebbie.]
 with the Kebbie water from by north, that riseth short of Bettus
 [Sidenote: Geuenni.]
 chappell aboue the towne, and the Geuennie that descendeth from aboue
 Landilobartholl beneath not farre from Colbroke, and so goeth on to
 Hardwijc, beneath which it crosseth three namelesse rilles, on the right
 hand or southwest side before it come at Lanihangle vpon Vske, of whose
 courses I know not anie more than that they are not of anie length, nor
 the chanell of sufficient greatnesse seuerallie to intreat of. Betweene
 [Sidenote: Birthin.]
 Kemmeis and Trostreie it meeteth with such an other rill that commeth
 [Sidenote: Caer Vske standeth on one side of
 Vske, and Caerleon on the other, but Caer Vske
 by diuerse miles further into the land.]
 downe by Bettus Newith. Thence it goeth to Caer Vske or Brenbigeie
 (whose bridge, I mene that of Vske, was ouerthrowne by rage of this
 riuer, in the six and twentith yeare of king Henrie the eight, vpon
 saint Hughes daie after a great snow) but yer it come there, it
 receiueth the Birthin on the right hand, which is a pretie water,
 descending from two heads, whereof the first is northwest of Manihilot,
 as the other is of Lanihangle and Pentmorell.

 [Sidenote: Elwie.]
 Next vnto this it ioineth with the Elwie aboue Lanbadocke, whose head is
 east of Penclase, and running westwards by Penclase, Lanislen, Langowen
 (and beneath Landewie taking in a brooket from Ragland castell, that
 commeth downe thither by Ragland parke) it bendeth southwest, vntill it
 come at the Vske, which crinkling towards the south, and going by
 Lanhowell, meeteth with three rilles before it come to Marthenie
 chappell, whereof the first lieth on the right hand, and the other on
 the left: the midlemost falling into the same, not farre from
 Lantressen, as I haue beene informed. From the mouth of the Romeneie to
 the mouth of the Taffe are two miles. Certes the Taffe is the greatest
 riuer in all Glamorganshire, (called by Ptolomie Rhatostathybius, as I
 gesse) and the citie Taffe it selfe of good countenance, sith it is
 indued with the cathedrall see of a bishop. The course of the water in
 like maner is verie swift, and bringeth oft such logs and bodies of
 trees withall from the wooddie hilles, that they doo not seldome crush
 the bridge in peeces, but for so much as it is made with timber it is
 repaired with lighter cost, wheras if it were of hard stone, all the
 countrie about would hardlie be able to amend it. It riseth in
 Brechnockshire among the woodie hilles, from two heads, whereof one is
 in Monuchdenie, the other west of that mounteine, of which the first
 called Taffe vaure, goeth by Capell lan vehan, Vainor, and Morlais, the
 other by Capell Nantie, and ioining at southwest beneath Morlais castle,
 they go to Martyr Tiduill, and toward Lannabor, but by the waie it
 taketh in from northwest a brooke called Cunnon, which commeth out of
 Brechnockshire by Abardare, and afterward the Rodneie comming out of the
 same quarter (but not out of the same shire) which runneth by
 Estridinodoch, a crotched brooke, & therefore diuided into Rodneie
 vaure, & Rodneie vehan, that being ioined with the Taffe, doth run on
 withall to Eglefilian, castle Coch, Whitchurch, Landaffe, Cardiffe, and
 so into the sea, not far from Pennarth point, where also the Laie dooth
 bid him welcome vnto his chanell or streame. Furthermore, from
 Marthellie it hasteth to Kemmeis, and yer it come at Caerleon or Chester
 in the south, taketh in two waters on the right hand, of which the first
 commeth downe from the north betweene Landgwie, Landgweth, and by Lhan
 Henoch, without anie further increase: but the other is a more
 beautifull streame, called Auon, and thus described as I find it among
 [Sidenote: Auon.]
 my pamphlets. The Auon riseth in the hilles that seeme to part Monemouth
 and Brechenocke shires in sunder, and after a rill receiued from
 Blorench hill on the northside of the same, running downe from thence by
 Capell Newith and Triuethin, it receiueth a water from by south almost
 of equall course, and from that quarter of the countrie, and in processe
 of time another little one from the same side, yer it come to Lanurgwaie
 and Lanihangle, from whence it goeth to Guennocke and Penrose, & so in
 Vske before it go by Caerleon. But here you must note, that the course
 of this streame ioining beneath Quenocke chappell, with the other which
 descendeth (as I said) from the hilles about foure miles aboue Landgwaie
 and Langweth, dooth make an Iland aboue Caerleon, where Penrose
 standeth, & much Romane coine is found of all sorts, so that the
 influence of the one into the other seemeth to me to be but a draine
 deuised by man, to keepe the citie from the violence of such water as
 otherwise would oft annoie the same.

 Being past Caerleon it runneth to Crindie, where maister Harbert
 dwelleth, and there carieng another brooke withall, that riseth north of
 Tomberlow hill, and descendeth by Henlis and Bettus chappell, it runneth
 forth to Newport (in Welch castle Newith) and from thence vnder a bridge,
 [Sidenote: Ebowith.]
 after three or foure miles course to the sea, taking the Ebowith water
 withall, which meeteth with the same almost in the verie mouth or fall,
 and riseth in the edge of Brecknoch shire, or (as Leland saith) high
 Winceland, from two heads of which one is called Eberith Vehan, the
 other Eberith Mawr, as I haue beene informed. The course of the first
 head is by Blamgrent, and after the confluence they passe togither by
 Lanhileth, and comming by west of Tomberlow hill (crossing a rill, from
 [Sidenote: Serowie.]
 north east by the waie) it taketh in thereabout the Serowie, that
 runneth by Trestrent, & is of lesse race hitherto than the Ebowith, and
 from that same quarter. After this confluence it goeth to Risleie,
 Rocheston castell, next of all thorough a parke, and so by Greenefield
 castell, and is not long yer it fall into the sea, being the last issue
 that I doo find in the countie,
 which beareth the name of Monemouth, and was in old time a part of the
 region of the Silures.

 [Sidenote: Romeneie.]
 The Romenie or (as some corruptlie call it) the Nonneie, is a goodlie
 water, and from the head a march betweene Monemouth & Glamorgan shires.
 The head hereof is aboue Egglins Tider vap Hoell otherwise called Fanum
 Theodori, or the church of Theodorus, whence commeth manie springs, &
 taking one bottome, the water is called Canoch and not Romeneie till it
 be come to Romeneie. It receiueth no water on the east side, but on the
 west diuerse small beckes, whereof three (and one of them called Ifra)
 are betweene the rising and Brathetere chappell, the fourth c[=o]meth in
 by Capell Gledis, and Kethligaire, the fift from betweene the Faldraie
 and Lanuabor, the sixt & seuenth before it come to Bedwas, and the eight
 ouer against Bedwas it selfe from chappell Martin, Cairfillie castell,
 and Thauan, after which confluences it runneth on by Maghan, Keuen,
 Mableie and Romeneie, & yer long crossing a becke at north west that
 commeth from aboue Lisuan, Lamssen and Roch, it falleth into the sea,
 about six miles from the Wisbe, and albeit the mouth therof be nothing
 profitable for ships, yet is it also a march betweene the Silures and
 Glamorganshire.

 [Sidenote: Laie.]
 The Laie falleth into the sea a mile almost from the Taffe, and riseth
 in the hilles aboue Lantrissent (for all the region is verie hillie.)
 From whence comming by Lantrissent and Auercastell, it runneth by Coit
 Marchan parke, Lambedder, S. Brides, Lhannihangle, saint Fagans and
 Elaie, Leckwith, Landowgh, Cogampill, and so into the sea, without anie
 [Sidenote: Dunelais.]
 maner increase by anie rils at all sauing the Dunelais, which riseth
 foure miles from his fall, east northeast, and meeteth withall a little
 more than a quarter of a mile from Pont Velim Vaur, and likewise by west,
 [Sidenote: Methcoid.]
 the Methcoid that commeth from Glinne Rodeneie, and wherein to the
 [Sidenote: Pedware.]
 Pedware dischargeth that small water gathered in his chanell. Here will
 I staie a little and breake off into a discourse, which Leland left also
 as parcell of this coast who toucheth it after this maner.

 [Sidenote: Laie.]
 From Taffe to Laie mouth or Ele riuer a mile, from Laie mouth (or rather
 [Sidenote: Thawan.]
 Penarth, that standeth on the west point of it) to the mouth of Thawan
 riuer (from whence is a common passage ouer vnto Mineheued in
 Summersetshire of 17 miles) are about seuen Welsh miles, which are
 [Sidenote: Scilleie.]
 counted after this maner. A mile and a halfe aboue Thawan is Scilleie
 hauenet (a pretie succour for ships) whose head is in Wenno paroch two
 [Sidenote: Barrie.]
 miles and a halfe from the shore. From Scilleie mouth to Aber Barrie a
 mile, and thither commeth a little rill of fresh water into Sauerne,
 whose head is scant a mile off in plaine ground by northeast, and right
 [Sidenote: This Ile went fiftie yeares agone for x. pounds.]
 against the fall of this becke lieth Barrie Iland a flight shot from the
 shore at the full sea. Halfe a mile aboue Aber Barrie is the mouth of
 [Sidenote: Come kidie.]
 Come kidie, which riseth flat north from the place where it goeth into
 the Sauerne, and serueth oft for harbour vnto sea-farers. Thence to the
 mouth of Thawan are three miles, wherevnto ships may come at will.

 [Sidenote: Colhow.]
 Two miles aboue Thawan is Colhow, whither a little rill resorteth from
 Lau Iltuit, thence to the mouth of Alen foure miles, that is a mile to
 [Sidenote: Alen.]
 saint Dinothes castell, and three miles further. The Alen riseth by
 northeast vp into the land at a place called Lhes Broimith, or Skirpton,
 about foure miles aboue the plot where it commeth by it selfe into
 [Sidenote: Ogur.]
 Sauerne. From thence to the mouth of Ogur alias Gur three miles. Then
 [Sidenote: Kensike.]
 come they in processe of time vnto the Kensike or Colbrooke riuer, which
 is no great thing, sith it riseth not aboue three miles from the shore.
 [Sidenote: Auon.]
 From Kensike to Aber Auon two miles, and herein doo ships molested with
 weather oftentimes seeke harborough. It commeth of two armes, wherof
 that which lieth northeast is called Auon Vaur, the other that lieth
 northwest Auon Vehan. They meet togither at Lhanuoie Hengle, about two
 miles aboue Aber Auon village, which is two miles also from the sea.

 [Sidenote: Neth.]
 From hence to the Neth is about two miles and a halfe, thereon come
 shiplets almost to the towne of Neth from the Sauerne. From the mouth of
 Neth vnto the mouth of Crimline becke is two miles, and being passed the
 [Sidenote: Tauie.]
 same we come vnto the Tauie, which descendeth from the aforesaid hilles
 and falleth into the sea by east of Swanseie. Being past this we come
 [Sidenote: Lochar.]
 vnto the Lichwr, or Lochar mouth, and then gliding by the Wormes head,
 [Sidenote: Wandres.]
 we passed to the Wandresmouth, wherof I find this description following
 [Sidenote: Vendraith Vaur, Vendraith Vehan.]
 in Leland. Both Vendraith Vaur and Vendraith Vehan rise in a peece of
 Carmardineshire, called Issekenen, that is to saie, the low quarter
 about Kennen riuer, and betwixt the heads of these two hils is another
 hill, wherein be stones of a greenish colour, whereof the inhabitants
 make their lime. The name of the hill that Vendraith Vaur riseth in, is
 called Mennith Vaur, and therein is a poole as in a moorish ground,
 named Lhintegowen, where the principall spring is, and this hill is
 eight or nine miles from Kidwellie: the hill that Vendraith Vehan
 springeth out of, is called Mennith Vehan, and this water commeth by
 Kidwellie towne.

 But about three or foure miles yer it come thither, it receiueth a
 brooke called Tresgirth, the course whereof is little aboue a mile from
 the place where it goeth into Vendraith, and yet it hath foure or fiue
 tucking milles and three corne milles vpon it. At the head of this
 brooke is an hole in the hilles side, where men often enter and walke in
 a large space. And as for the brooke it selfe, it is one of the most
 plentifull and commodious that is to be found in Wales. All along the
 sides also of Vendraith Vaur, you shall find great plentie of sea-coles.
 There is a great hole by head of Vendraith Vehan, where men vse to enter
 into vaults of great compasse, and it is said, that they maie go one
 waie vnder the ground to Wormes head, and another waie to Cairkemen
 castell, which is three miles or more into the land. But how true these
 things are, it is not in me to determine; yet this is certeine, that
 there is verie good hawking at the Heron in Vendraith Vehan. There are
 diuerse prints of the passage of certeine worms also in the caue, at the
 head of Vendraith Vehan, as the inhabitants doo fable: but I neuer heard
 of anie man that saw anie worme there, and yet it is beleeued that manie
 wormes are there. Hitherto out of Leland. But now to returne to mine
 owne course.

 [Sidenote: Laie.]
 Leauing the Laie, which some call Elaie, and passing the Pennarth baie,
 that lieth betweene the Pennarth and the Lauerocke points, we left
 Scillie Ilet (which lieth on the mouth of Scillie hauen before
 [Sidenote: Barrie.]
 described) and came vnto the Barrie, whose head is aboue Wrinston
 castell, and from whence he runneth by Deinspowis, Cadoxton, Barrie, and
 so into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Aberthaw.]
 Being past the Barrie water, we come to a fall called Aberthaw, which
 riseth two or three miles aboue Lansanor, and going by Welch Newton, it
 commeth at length to Cowbridge, and from thence goeth to Lanblethian,
 Landoch, Beanpeere, Flimston, Gilston, and betweene the east and the
 west Aberthaw, & into the Sauerne sea. But yer it come all there it
 receiueth a brooke called Kensan, or Karnsan, or Kensech, on the east
 side, whose head is east of Bolston, & comming by Charnelhoid,
 Lhancaruan, & Lancadle, it falleth into the former aboue either of the
 [Sidenote: Kensan.]
 Thawans. Leland saith, that Kensan hath two heads, whereof the more
 northerlie called Brane, lieth in Luenlithan, and runneth seauen miles
 before it meet with the other. Leauing this water we sailed on, casting
 about the Nash point, omitting two or three small waters (whereof Leland
 hath alreadie as ye see made mention) because I haue nothing more to add
 vnto their descriptions, except it be, that the Colhow taketh in a rill
 from Lan Iltruit, of whose course (to saie the truth) I haue no manner
 of knowledge.

 [Sidenote: Ogur.]
 The Ogur or Gur, which some call the Ogmur, is a well faire streame (as
 we were woont to saie in our old English) whose head is in the same
 hilles, where the Rodeneies are to be found, but much more westerlie,
 and running a long course yer it come to anie village, it goeth at the
 length beneath Languineuere or Langouodoch, to S. Brides vpon Ogur, then
 [Sidenote: Wennie.]
 to Newcastell, and Marthermaure, beneath which it meeteth the Wennie,
 halfe a mile from Ogur or Ogmur castell on the east side of the banke.
 It riseth fiue or six miles from this place, among the hilles, and
 comming downe at last by Lanharne, it crosseth a rill yer long from
 northeast, and the confluence passeth foorth by Coitchurch, Ogur
 castell, & so into the Ogur. Leland writing of the waters that fall into
 [Sidenote: Garrow.]
 this Ogur saith thus. Into the Ogur also resorteth the Garrow two miles
 aboue Lansanfride bridge, descending from Blaingarow. It taketh
 [Sidenote: Leuennie.]
 furthermore (saith he) another called Leuennie rising in the parish of
 [Sidenote: Corug.]
 Glin Corug, at northwest, and then running two miles lower, vniteth it
 selfe with the Corug brooke, a little short thing, and worthie no longer
 speach. From this confluence the Leuennie goeth seauen miles further yer
 it meete with the Ogur on the west side, at Lansanfride, two miles aboue
 Penbowt. And so far Leland. But I wot not what he meaneth by it.

 [Sidenote: Kensig.]
 Next vnto the Ogur is the Kensig water, that commeth downe by the Pile
 [Sidenote: Margan.]
 and Kensig castell, and being past the same we crosse the Margan rill,
 [Sidenote: Auon.]
 where sir Edward Manxell dwelt, and so vnto Auon, which hauing two heads
 (as is said) the more easterlie of them commeth downe by Hauodaport
 chappell, the other by Glin Corug, Michaell church, Aber Auon, and so
 into the sea, yeelding also in time of need a good harbour for ships to
 lodge and ride in. From hence we went along by the Cole pits to the
 [Sidenote: Neth.]
 [Sidenote: Nethuehan.]
 mouth of the Neth. The Neth is a faire water, rising of diuerse heads,
 whereof the more easterlie named Nethuehan riseth not farre from the
 head of the Kennon, and comming downe by Penedorin to Aberpirgwin it
 [Sidenote: Nethuaur.]
 receiueth Nethuaur, a little aboue the towne, which rising not farre
 southeast of the head of Tauie in Brecknoch shire (as all the rest doo)
 [Sidenote: Trangarth.]
 [Sidenote: Meltaie.]
 [Sidenote: Hepsaie.]
 receiueth the Trangarth, the Meltaie and the Hepsaie, all which are
 accounted as members of his head in one chanell, about a mile or more
 before it ioine with Nethuehan. For as Trangarth riseth east of
 Nethuaur, so the Melta riseth by east of Trangarth, and ioineth with the
 same aboue Istrad wealthie, and a little beneath the same towne taketh
 in the Hepsaie. So that albeit their seuerall risings be half or a whole
 mile in sunder, yet haue they (in a maner) like distance from
 Aberpirgwin, and their finall confluence in the edge of Glamorganshire,
 which they directlie doo crosse. After these confluences, the maine
 streame runneth in and out by sundrie miles, and through the wooddie
 soiles, till it meet with Cledaugh, which ioineth with the same beneath
 the Resonlaie, and goeth withall to Lanisted, where it taketh in the
 [Sidenote: Dulesse.]
 Dulesse, whose head is aboue Chappell Krenaunt, in the marches of
 Brecknoch. Thence it goeth to Cador towne, or betweene it and
 Lannistide, then to Neth towne, whither small vessels often come: and
 [Sidenote: Cledoch.]
 beneath the same receiuing the Cledoch that runneth by Kelebebilch (and
 also Neth abbeie where maister Crumwell dwelleth) it goeth on by
 Coitfranke forrest, Nethwood, Briton ferrie, and so into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Tauie.]
 The Tauie riseth in the thickest of the blacke mounteines in
 Brecknochshire west of Nethnaur, and comming downe west of Calwen
 [Sidenote: Coilus.]
 chappell, it receiueth on the east banke a rill named Coiell that
 runneth thither by Coielburne chappell: and being thus vnited, the
 [Sidenote: Torch.]
 chanell passeth foorth by Istradgunles, and then meeting with the Turch
 or Torch water that c[=o]meth from the foot of the blacke mounteines,
 and is march to parcell of Caermardinshire, it runneth to Langoge,
 Lansamled, saint Iohns, Swanseie, and so into the Baie. Being past this,
 we come by another little fall, whose water runneth three or foure miles
 yer it come into Swanseie baie, but without name. Thence we go to the
 Crimline becke, whose description I neither haue, nor find anie great
 want therof. Wherfore going about by Oistermont castell, and Mumbles
 point, we passe foorth toward the southwest, by Penmarch point, til we
 [Sidenote: Ilston.]
 come to Ilston water, whose head is not farre within the land; and yet
 as it commeth thorough the woodland, and downe by Penmarch castell, a
 rill or two dooth fall into the same. Then casting about by Oxwich
 point, we go onward there by, and sailing flat north by the Holme
 (hauing passed the Wormeshead and S. Kennets chappell) and then
 [Sidenote: Lochar.]
 northeast by Whitford point, we went at length to the Lochar or Loghor,
 or as Lhoyd nameth it, the Lichwr, whose indraught for a certene space
 is march betweene Caermardine and Glamorgan shires. It riseth aboue
 Gwenwie chappell, from whence it goeth Landbea, to and aboue Bettus
 [Sidenote: Amond.]
 receiueth a rill named Amond that entreth thereinto from northeast.
 Being past Bettus, it passeth by Laneddie, Arthelas bridge and ouer
 [Sidenote: Combwilie.]
 against Landilo Talabout, it crosseth from by west, the Combwilie by
 [Sidenote: Morlais.]
 west of Parkreame, and afterward the Morlais aboue Langnarch on the same
 side. Then comming to Loghor castell, it taketh in on the east side, the
 [Sidenote: Lhu.]
 Lhu, whose course is not aboue fiue miles, and thence loosing the name
 [Sidenote: Burraie.]
 of Lochar, it is called Burraie, as some gesse, vntill it come to the
 sea, where it parteth it selfe going on each side (of Bachannie Iland, a
 small thing) and not worthie for anie thing I read thereof, as yet to be
 particularlie described. From this water we passed (I saie) by
 Bachannies Ile, to the Aberlheddie water, whose head being in the hilles
 aboue Prenacrois, it passeth by Lhaneltheie, and thence into the sea.
 [Sidenote: Dulesse.]
 Then went we to the Dulesse a little rill, whose head is not farre from
 Trinsaren: thence by the Pembraie and Calicoit points, till we came
 [Sidenote: Wandres.]
 about to the Wandres or Vendraith mouth, whose description is partlie
 touched alreadie; but bicause it is not such as I would wish it to be, I
 will here after my owne maner deale somewhat further withall. Gwendrath
 or Vendraith vaur riseth in the lower ground, or not far from the hill
 Renneth Vaur, whereon castell Careg standeth, and descending by a pretie
 long course vnder sundrie bridges, commeth at the last to Glin, then to
 Capull Lanberie, and so vnto the sea, being little augmented with
 influences by the waie. Vendraith Vehan riseth a mile higher towards the
 north than Vendraith Vaur, but out of the same soile, & thence directing
 his course toward the southwest, it goeth by Lancharog, Langendarne,
 Capull Langell, Bithon, Leighdenie, Kidwillie, and so into the sea,
 about one mile from the fall of Vendraith Vaur.

 [Sidenote: Towie.]
 The Towie riseth in the mounteines of Elennith foure miles by southeast
 from Lintiue, and two from Lingonon, in a moorish ground foure & twentie
 miles from Caermardine, and in a forrest called Bishops forrest, midwaie
 betwixt Landwibreuie & Landanuerie castell. For fish, in my opinion,
 this is much better than the Taw or Taffe, whose head breedeth no fish,
 but if it be cast into it, they turne vp their bellies flote aloft and
 die out of hand. It parteth Brecknoch from Cardigonshire also for a
 [Sidenote: Trausnant.]
 certeine season, till it come by the water of Trausnant, that falleth
 thereinto from by east out of the confins of Brecknoch, vnto Pilin
 [Sidenote: Tothee.]
 capell, and so to Istrodefine, where it meeteth with the Tothee that
 commeth thither from Lhinuerwin where it riseth, and so through Rescoth
 [Sidenote: Pescotter.]
 forrest, vniting it selfe by the waie with the Pescotter, which mounting
 out of the ground in the edge of Cardigonshire, runneth along as a limit
 and march vnto the same, till it ioine with the Tothee, and both come
 togither beneath Istrodefine into Towie, which we haue now in hand.
 After this confluence it commeth to Lhanuair Awbreie, Lanihowell, and
 Lanimphfrie, and here it receiueth two waters in one chanell, whereof
 [Sidenote: Brane.]
 [Sidenote: Gutherijc.]
 the first is called Brane, the other Gutherijc (which lieth more
 southerlie of the two) and fall (as I said) into Towie beneath
 [Sidenote: Dulesse.]
 [Sidenote: Morlais.]
 Landonuereie, which runneth on till it meet with the first Dulesse that
 goeth by Lenurdie, then with the Morlais, and these on the northwest.
 Certes the Brane is a pretie brooke rising two or three miles aboue
 Capell Newith, and descending by Lanbrane and Vstradwalter, it meeteth
 (I saie) with the Gutherijc, whose head is west of Tridcastell in
 Brecknochshire, and thereby it is not a little increased. But to proceed
 with the Towie, which being past Lanimphfrie and a rill that meeteth
 with the same, descending from northwest of Lanurdan, it taketh in the
 influences of diuerse waters in one chanell, of which the greatest is
 called Modewie, and thereof I find this description.

 [Sidenote: Modewie.]
 The Modewie, or (as some pronounce it) Motheuie, riseth of two heads,
 which ioining aboue Lanihangle, the streame runneth on till it meet with
 [Sidenote: Cledoch.]
 the Cledoch on the left hand, proceeding also further toward Langadocke,
 [Sidenote: Sawtheie.]
 it receiueth not far from thence the Sawtheie, whose two heads descend
 from the blacke mounteines or east edge of Carmardineshire (as mine
 [Sidenote: Dulesse. 2.]
 information leadeth me.) After this confluence the second Dulesse dooth
 meet with the Towie, whose head is in the hilles aboue Talthogaie
 abbeie, northwest from Langadocke full fiue miles: then comming downe by
 Landilovaur, Newton, Dinefar castell, and Golden groue, it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Dulesse. 3.]
 third Dulesse from by north that commeth in by Lanihangle and Drislan
 [Sidenote: Cothie.]
 castell, and after that the Cothie, whose race is somewhat long, and
 therefore his description not vtterlie to be passed ouer.

 Not farre from the head (which is three miles from Landanbreuie, vnder
 the hulke of Blame Icorne, a narrow passage, and therein manie heaps of
 stones) and somewhat beneath Lana Pinsent chappell, it taketh in the
 [Sidenote: Turche.]
 Turche becke that runneth thither from aboue Lanacroies: thence it goeth
 to Lansawell, Abergorlech, Breghuangothie, Lannigood, and so into Towie,
 [Sidenote: Rauelthie.]
 which hasting forward by chappell Dewie, receiueth the Rauelthie from by
 [Sidenote: Gwilie.]
 north, then the Gwilie from northwest, whose head is aboue Lanie
 Pinsent, and race by Canwell, Eluert, Comewilie, and Merling hill as I
 haue often heard. After this confluence with the Gwilie, the Towie goeth
 to Caermardine, then to Lanigang, then to Lanstephan, S. Ismaels, and so
 into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Taue.]
 Next vnto the Towie is the Taue, whose head is in the blacke mounteines,
 as at the roots of Wrenni vaur hill in Pembrookeshire, from whence it
 [Sidenote: Dudderie.]
 runneth by Lanuurnach, Langludien, Lanualteg, and taking in the Dudderie
 from southwest, out of the same countie by Lanbederuelfraie, and Lindwie,
 [Sidenote: Marlais.]
 it goeth to Eglesware chappell, beneath which it crosseth the Marlais by
 north that runneth by Lanbedie and Whitland. Thence meeting with one
 [Sidenote: Vennie.]
 rill called Venni, as I take it, that commeth through Cardith forrest on
 [Sidenote: Caire.]
 the one side, and the Caire on the other that runneth into it west of
 [Sidenote: Carthkinnie.]
 Landowror, it hasteth to S. Clares, where it taketh in the Carthkinnie,
 [Sidenote: Gow.]
 or Barthkinnie (as Leland calleth it) and the Gow or Tow both in one
 chanell, of which the first riseth aboue Capell Bettus, from whence it
 runneth by Talacouthe, Kilsant, and Langinnin, the other issueth out of
 the ground aboue Trologh Bettus, by Midrun, & ioining with the former a
 little aboue S. Clares, they run into the Taue, and from thence to
 [Sidenote: Gowen.]
 Lanihangle, and betweene it and Abercowen, admitteth finallie the Gowen
 or Gow streame, which comming likewise from the blacke mounteines, goeth
 by Ebbernant, & so into the Taue, who directeth his course by Lancharne
 castell, and then into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Gwair.]
 The next water that we come to is the Gwair, which is but a small thing
 rising aboue Lambeder Velfraie, and going from thence by east of castell
 Merhie hill, Crumuier and Argwaire, it is not long yer it fall into the
 sea, and so we leaue Cairdinshire, and go ouer into Penbrooke. Then
 passed we by an other comming out of Rathe forrest called Coit Rathe,
 the water it selfe rising about Templeton. Thence leauing the Monkeston
 rocke, we came to Tenbie or Dinbechie Piscood, and passing into the port
 [Sidenote: Brechnocke.]
 betweene the castell and S. Katharines rocke, we found it serued with
 two little backe waters, of so small countenance, that they are not
 worthie of anie further talke to be spent in their descriptions: yet the
 one seemeth to be called Florence brooke, the other Fresto, Gunfreston
 standing betweene them both, when by their sight cannot perish. After
 [Sidenote: From Londie to Caldie thirtie miles.]
 this we passed betweene Londie and an other Ilet or rocke lieng by
 northwest of the same, to Ludsop point, & so to Abertrewent, where I
 [Sidenote: Trewent.]
 found a sillie fresh water named Trewend that riseth a mile or
 thereabout within the land. From thence we went southwards by Brode
 hauen, till we came to S. Gowans point. Then gathering west and by north
 before we came at Shepe Iland, we found another fresh water, that riseth
 short of Kiriog Maharen, and running south of Vggarston, Windmill hill,
 or betweene it and Castell Norton and Gupton, it holdeth on flat west
 all the waie till it come to the Ocean.

 [Sidenote: Pennar.]
 Being passed this water, we cast about toward the northwest, by the
 Poptons and Pennar, till we came to the Pennar mouth, out of which the
 salt water issueth that in manor inuironneth Penbroke. From this
 (omitting sundrie salt creekes on both sides of the hauen, not
 appertinent to our purpose) we came to the fall of two waters in one
 chanell, aboue whose confluence Williamston parke standeth, and whereof
 one (a meere salt course) incloseth three parts of Carew castell. The
 other rising neere to Coit Rath forrest is a fresh, & going by
 Geffraiston, Creswell & Lawrenie, it leaueth the parke on the south
 side, & goeth into the hauen after confluence with the former.

 Now come I to the two swords, or hauen of Milford, whereinto two riuers
 [Sidenote: Dugledu.]
 direct their course from the northeast called Dugledu or the two swords,
 [Sidenote: Cultlell.]
 and betweene them both is a rill which they call also Cultlell (that is
 to saie) the knife. Hereof riseth a merrie tale of a Welshman, that
 lieng in this place abroad all night in the cold weather, and
 peraduenture not verie well occupied, was demanded of his hostesse
 (where he did breake his fast the next morrow) at what inne he laie in
 the night precedent, bicause he came so soone to hir house yer anie of
 hir maids were vp? Oh good hostesse (quoth he) be contented, I laie to
 night in a dangerous estate, for I slept betweene two swords with a long
 knife at my heart; meaning indeed that he laie betweene these two
 riuers, and his brest towards the south neere to the head of Cultlell.
 But to passe ouer these iests. Here Leland speaketh of a riuer called
 [Sidenote: Gwilie.]
 Gwilie, but where it riseth or falleth, he maketh no certeine report:
 wherefore it is requisit that I proceed according to my purpose.

 The one of these swords is called Clotheie or Clothie, of which I find
 [Sidenote: Clotheie.]
 this short and breefe description. The Clothie riseth at the foot of
 Wrennie vaure hill and comming downe to Monachlodge, Langelman,
 Lannakeuen, and Egremond, it receiueth a rill from by northwest before
 it come at Lanhaddon castell, which commeth from aboue the moore by
 Clarbaston and Bletherston, his head arising in the hill west of
 Mancloghaie, as Leland dooth informe me. Yer long also and beneath
 Lanhaddon it taketh in another on the east side from Narbarth castell,
 comming by Robeston, then going by Cunaston, Slebach, Picton castell,
 Sister houses, Minware & Martheltwie, at Rise castell point west of Coit
 [Sidenote: Dugledie.]
 Kenles (as I haue beene informed) it taketh in the other sword, named
 Dugledie, wherof I read as followeth. The head of the Dugledie is
 somwhere at northwest, betwixt S. Laurences & S. Dugwels, from whence it
 runneth to Trauegarne, Redbaxton, & taking in a rill by the waie from
 Camrose at the west, it goeth to Hauerford or Hereford west, and there
 vniteth it selfe with a water, which peraduenture is the same that
 [Sidenote: Gwilie.]
 Leland called Gwilie. Certes it riseth short of Walton, and comming by
 S. Leonards chappell and Pendergest, it falleth I saie into the
 Dugledie, ouer against the towne of Hauerford or Herford west, but in
 Welsh Hufford; as Lhoid dooth set it downe. Beneath Herford it taketh in
 another water from south west, whose head is short of S. Margarets
 chappell, and enterance betweene Harraldston and Herford, which
 Harraldstone receiueth the name of Harrald the successour of Edward the
 confessour as some call him, who was a greeuous mall vnto the Britons
 that remained in the time of the said Edward; as I haue noted elsewhere.
 Then the Dugledie still descending taketh in the Frese fr[=o]
 Fresethorpe, a rill of no great accompt, and therefore I go from it
 making hast vnto Culthell, & omitting two rils betweene it and the
 Clotheie on the southside, of no great weight and moment. The Cultlhell
 commeth into the Dugledie beneath Bolston, with a streight course from
 by north, of three or foure miles, rising by west of Slebach, and
 comming by Bowlston, after whose vnition with the aforesaid water they
 run on as one till they meet with the Clothie, casting out by the waie
 sundrie salt creekes, as the maine chanell dooth from thence foorth
 vntill it passe the Sandie hauen, the Dale rode (whither a sillie fresh
 rill commeth of small value) & be come about againe to the large Ocean.

 Having thus shewed the courses of those few fresh waters that come to
 Milford hauen, we cast about by the Blockehouse and S. Annes chappell
 [Sidenote: Gateholme Ile.]
 to Gateholme Ile, that lieth betweene S. Annes and the Wilocke point,
 [Sidenote: Stockholme Ile.]
 directlie ouer against Stockeholme Iland that is situat further off into
 the sea, toward the southwest, and is full halfe so great as the
 Scalmeie that I elsewhere described. Betweene the Willocke point also
 [Sidenote: Midland Ile.]
 and the Scalmeie, directlie west is the Midland Ile, full so great as
 the Gateholme. As for the two rocks that lie by north and south of the
 Scalmeie, of which the one is called the Yardland stone, the other
 Mewstone, it shall not be greatlie requisit to stand on their
 discourses, sith they are such as may hardlie be taken for Ilands, and
 euen in like sort we may iudge of S. Brides Ile, which is southwest of
 [Sidenote: Gresholme.]
 Calthrop rode, & likewise of the Gresholme, whereof I find this short
 description. The Gresholme lieth directlie west of Scalmeie, from whence
 if you saile thither on the south side, you must needs passe by the
 Mewstone rocke: if on the north of Scalmeie, you must leaue the Yarland
 stone on your left hand. Wherto if you note well the situation of these
 Ilands alreadie named, and confer them with the Ramseie and S. Dauids
 land, you shall find them to produce as it were two dangerous points,
 including the Bridbaie, wherein (notwithstanding the greatnesse) are
 1000 perils, and no fresh brookes for me to deale withall. Finallie,
 hauing doubled the Willocke point, we thought it not good altogether to
 leaue that baie vnsearched, at lestwise to see what Ilands might there
 be found, & long entred into the same, we beheld one which the men of
 [Sidenote: S. Brides Iland.]
 the countrie call S. Brides Iland, a verie little place and situate
 neere the land, before I came at Galtroie rode. From thence we went
 about by the little hauen, Doluach hauen, Caruaie hauen, Shirelace
 rocke, Carnbuddie, and Carnaie baies, Portelais, and so into the sound
 betweene Ramseie and the point. In this sound likewise is a little Ile,
 almost annexed to the maine: but in the middest thereof, I meane of the
 sound, is a rocke called the horsse (a mile and more by north of Ribbie
 rocke, that lieth south east of Ramseie) and more infortunate than ten
 [Sidenote: A sort of dangerous rocks lieng on a row upon the
 west end of South-wales called the Bishop & his clerkes.]
 of Seians colts, but thanked be God I neuer came on his backe. Thence
 passing by S. Stephans, and Whitesand baies, we saluted the Bishop and
 his clerks, as they went on procession on our left side (being loth to
 take anie salted holie water at their hands) and came at last to the
 point called S. Dauids head, which Ptolomie calleth Octapitanum
 promontorium, except I be deceiued. But here gentle reader giue me leaue
 to staie a while, and insert the words of Leland touching the land
 called S. Dewies or S. Dauids land, whereof some men may peraduenture
 haue vse, his words are these. Being therefore past this hauen and point
 [Sidenote: S. Dewie or Dauid all one.]
 of Demetia, in casting about the coast we come to S. Dewies or S. Dauids
 land, which Ptolomie calleth Octapitanum promontorium, I read to be
 separated from the rest of the countrie much after this maner, although
 I grant that there may be and are diuerse other little creekes betwixt
 Newgale and S. Dauids head, and betwixt S. Dauids and Fischard, beside
 those that are heere mentioned out of a register of that house.

 As we turne therefore from Milford, S. Dauids land beginneth at Newgale,
 a creeke serued with a backe fresh water. Howbeit there is a baie before
 this creeke betwixt it and Milford. From hence about foure miles is
 [Sidenote: Saluach.]
 Saluach creeke, otherwise called Sauerach, whither some fresh water
 resorteth: the mouth also thereof is a good rescue for balingers, as it
 [Sidenote: Portelais.]
 (I meane the register) saith. Thence go we to Portelais three miles,
 [Sidenote: Alen.]
 where is a little portlet, whither the Alen that commeth through saint
 Dewies close dooth run. It lieth a mile south-west from S. Dewies,
 [Sidenote: Portmaw.]
 saint Stinans Chappell also is betweene Portelais, and Portmaw. The next
 [Sidenote: Maw.]
 [Sidenote: Pendwie.]
 [Sidenote: Lanuehan.]
 is Port Maw, where I found a great estuarie into the land. The Pendwie
 halfe a mile from that: Lhand Vehan is three miles from Pendwie, where
 [Sidenote: Tredine.]
 is a salt creeke, then to Tredine three miles, where is another creeke
 [Sidenote: Langunda.]
 to Langunda, foure miles, and another creeke is there in like sort where
 fishermen catch herrings. Heere also the Gwerne riuer diuideth
 [Sidenote: Fischard.]
 Penbidiane from Fischerdine Kemmeis land. From Langunda to Fischard at
 [Sidenote: Gwerne.]
 the Gwerne mouth foure miles, and here is a portlet or hauenet also for
 ships. And thus much of S. Dauids land.

 Besides this also, Leland in a third booke talketh of lhinnes and
 pooles, but for as much as my purpose is not to speake of lakes and
 lhinnes, I passe them ouer as hasting to Teifie, in Latine Tibius, and
 after Ptolomie Tuerobius or Tiuirobius, which is the next riuer that
 serueth for my purpose. And yet not forgetting to touch the Gwerne, for
 after we came from saint Dauids head, we coasted along toward the
 southeast, till wee came ouer against saint Catharins, where going
 northwards by the broad hauen, and the Strombles head, we sailed thence
 northeast, and by north, to Langlas head, then flat south by the Cow and
 Calfe (two cruell rockes) which we left on the left hand, & so coasted
 ouer to Abergwin or Fischard where we found a fresh water named Guin, or
 [Sidenote: Gwerne.]
 Gwerne, whose course is in manner directlie out of the east into the
 west, from Vremie hils by pont Vaunt and Lanichair, vntill it come
 within a mile of the foresaid towne. It riseth flat north of the
 Perselie hill, from whence it goeth by Pont vaine, Lauerillidoch,
 Lanchar, Landilouair, & so to Abergwine, or Abergwerne, for I read both.
 [Sidenote: Neuerne.]
 From Abergwine, we cast about by Dinas head, till we come to the fall of
 Neuerne, where Newport standeth. The head of this riuer is aboue Capell
 Nantgwin, from whence it runneth by Whitchurch, but yer it come at
 Kilgwin, it taketh in a little water that riseth short of Wrenie vaure,
 and thence go foorth as one vntill they come to Newport. Cardigan hauen
 is the next fall that I did stumble on, wherein lieth a little Iland
 [Sidenote: Teifie or Tine.]
 ouer against the north point. Hereinto also commeth the Teifie, a noble
 riuer which riseth in Lintiuie, and is fraught with delicate samons, and
 herein and not else where in all the riuers of Britaine, is the Castor
 or Beuer to be found. But to proceed. The verie hed thereof (I saie) is
 foure miles aboue Stradflore in Luitie, and after it hath run from
 thence a little space, it receiueth a brooke from southeast that commeth
 out of Lin Legnant, and then after the confluence runneth on to
 [Sidenote: Miricke.]
 Stradflore abbeie, beneth which it meeteth with the Miricke water (that
 [Sidenote: Landurch.]
 riseth aboue Stradmirich) and soone after with the Landurch (both from
 the northwest) and finallie the Bremich aboue Tregaron, that commeth in
 by the east; as Leland hath set downe.

 [Sidenote: Bromis.]
 Neere to Landwibreuie also it crosseth the Bromis by east northeast, and
 [Sidenote: Matherne.]
 then goeth to Landuair, Cledogh, Kellan, and soone after taking in the
 Matherne from by east, that parteth Cardigan partlie from Carmardine
 [Sidenote: Dulas.]
 shire, and likewise that Dulas aboue Lanbedder (which riseth aboue
 Langibbie, and goeth thence to Bettus) on the northwest, it goeth next
 of all to Lanbedder towne, then to Laniuair, beneath which it crosseth
 [Sidenote: Grauelth.]
 the Grauelth, thence to Pencarocke, Lanibether, Lanlonie, Lanihangle,
 [Sidenote: Clethor.]
 and Sandissell, and there it vniteth it selfe with the Clethor or
 Dettor, which commeth downe thither by Lantisilued chappell, Lanfraine,
 and finallie Landissell from by north, as I doo here affirme. After this
 confluence it proceedeth on to Landuaie, Alloine, Bangor, Langeler,
 [Sidenote: Kerie.]
 Landeureog and Newcastell, yer long taking in the Kerie from by north,
 whose head is not farre from that of Clethor, and whose course is
 somewhat inlarged by such rilles as descend into the same. For west of
 Kenwith two becks in one chanell doo fall into it, which be namelesse,
 and but of a little length.

 Beneath Tredwair also it crosseth another from by west, that runneth
 along by Bettus, Euan, and finallie meeting with the Teifie, they run as
 one by Kennarth (still parting Cardigon shire from Carmardin, as it hath
 doone sith it met with the Matherne) and so forth on till they ioine
 [Sidenote: Cheach.]
 with the Cheach, which rising southeast aboue chappell Euan, dooth part
 Carmardine and Brechnocke shire in sunder, till it come vnto the Teifie.
 From this confluence, and being still a limit vnto Cardigon shire, it
 goeth by Marierdine, and so to Cardigon, taking in one rill from by
 north descending by Penneralt, by north of Monardiue or Marierdine, and
 two other from by southwest, of which the one commeth in beneath
 Kilgaron castell, the other from Lantwood north west of Oscoid Mortemer,
 which lieth southeast of Cardigan, and then going forward betweene S.
 Dogmaile, & Langordmere, it is not long yer it fall into the Irish sea,
 flat west and by north from his vprise, and sending vs forth from
 Penlooke into Cardigon shire, wherevnto it hath become march euer
 sithence it came from Kellam, or confluence with the Matherne.

 Being come into Cardigon shire, and hauing passed the Cardigon point, an
 Iland of the same denomination lieng by west thereof, we came vnto the
 [Sidenote: Airon.]
 fall of Airon three miles beneath Lancleere, it riseth in the mounteines
 by a chappell called Blam Peniall belonging to Landwie breuie about
 three or foure miles from Tiue banks, & runneth on by Lamberwooddie,
 Langitho, Tregrigaron hill, Treuilian, Talaferne, and soone after taking
 in a rill from by south from Siliam by Lanleir it runneth by Istrade,
 Kilkennen, Lanicharin, and finallie into the sea, crossing by the waie
 [Sidenote: Bidder.]
 the Bidder brooke, which comming from Dehewide, dooth fall into the same,
 [Sidenote: Arth.]
 betweene Lanchairin, and Henuenneie. The Arth which is the next fall is
 no great thing, neither of anie long course, yet somewhat crotched, and
 it riseth three or foure miles or more within the land slopewise, and
 comming by Lambaderne, and Treueglois, it falleth into the sea,
 northeast of Aberarth.

 Being past the Arth, & hauing staied there a while bicause we found some
 [Sidenote: Ris alias Wereie.]
 harborough, we came next of all vnto the Wereie, which riseth of two
 heads, aboue whose confluence standeth a towne, named Lanihangle,
 Redrod, and from whence it goeth by Lanigruthen to Laristed, & so into
 the Ocean. Then went we to the Ystwith, which riseth in the blacke
 mounteins aboue Comerstwith, from whence it runneth certeine miles,
 [Sidenote: Istwith.]
 vntill it come vnto Ispittie, Istwith, Lananon, Laniler, Lan Nachairne,
 [Sidenote: Redholl.]
 and so into the sea, taking withall first the Meleuen, then the Ridall
 or Redholl not farre from the shore, whereof I haue this description.
 The Ridall riseth in the top of Plimlimmon hill out of a lake named Lin
 Ridall, from whence going toward Spittie Kinwen, it crosseth one water
 on the north, and another beneth it on the southeast, and so goeth on by
 Lanbeder vaure, till it come to Aberistwith, the Istwith, and so into
 the Ocean. Hauing thus viewed the Istwith, and taken our selues againe
 [Sidenote: Salique.]
 to the sea, we crossed the Salke or Salique brooke, whereof I find this
 memoriall.

 The Salique brooke descendeth in like sort from the blacke mounteins, &
 going from Vmmaboue, toward Gogarth, or Gogirthar, it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Massalique.]
 Massalique, and from thence goeth into the sea, southwest from his
 [Sidenote: Lerie.]
 originall. From hence we went to the Lerie, an indraught of no great
 quantitie, neither commodious as I gesse (yet I may be deceiued) for
 anie ship to harborough in. It riseth toward the lower ground of the
 blacke hils, and going by Lanihangle castell Gwalter, it runneth from
 thence northeast into the Ocean, receiuing a rill by the waie from the
 hilles which lie by northeast of his course. But what stand I vpon
 trifles?

 [Sidenote: Wie.]
 Thus haue I brought my selfe out of Caerdigan shire vnto the Wie, which
 is limit betweene it and Merioneth for a certeine space, & being entred
 in the mouth thereof we gat vp to the head, minding in the description
 of the same to come downeward as in the rest, which we will doo in such
 good manner as for the time and want of some information is possible to
 be performed. It ariseth in the south part of Snowdonie and goeth on
 foorth right to Lammothwie, by Mowdhewie, Mathan laith, and comming
 downe to Dinas Mathew, it receiueth two rilles from northwest, and the
 third comming by Mailroid called Cludoch from northeast, & so holdeth on
 crossing the Angell water at the west, which boundeth Mongomerie shire
 [Sidenote: Remis.]
 in part, till it come to Romis, beneath which water it taketh in the
 Towin that passeth by Lambrin mawr from Talgarth, and then goeth to
 Mathrauerne, crossing another from by north and so foorth to Lanworing,
 where it meeteth with the Kerig on the one side, and the Gwidall which
 commeth from Dorowen on the other.

 After this, our maine riuer goeth by Pengos, and beneath the same taketh
 in an influence from southeast, called the Dulas, and another from the
 northwest: from thence it hasteth on to Magenillet, or Machenlet, first
 crossing the Leuennie from southeast, secondlie the Peniall from
 northwest, thirdlie the Einon, fourthlie the Kinar, fiftlie the Cleidor,
 these three last rehearsed falling into it from southeast, & the last
 hauing his course by Langwinhelin and so into the sea, as mine
 instruction vpholdeth. It seemeth in some mens iudgements to part
 Northwales and Westwales in sunder, and the same which in Latine hight
 Deuus, in Welsh or British Difi or Dewie, whereof the Latine doth seeme
 to fetch his sound. But to proceed with the rest of such falles and
 waters as are to be found in this countie. Going therfore northwestward
 we come to a fall fr[=o] the north called Towen Merionneth which is the
 mouth of the Difonnie streame, a pretie riuer rising in the hilles aboue
 Lanihangle, and west of castell Traherne receiueth the Ridrijc, which
 commeth from Chadridrijc hill, by Tallillin castell, Treherie, and so
 into the Difonnie from southeast, fetching his course by Lanegrin, and
 so into the sea within fiue miles thereof.

 Being past this we did cast about by the Sarnabigh point, till we came
 to the Lingouen becke, and so to the Barre, which is a faire water, and
 therefore worthie to be with diligence described, yet it is not called
 Bar from the head, but rather Moth or Derie, for so are the two chiefe
 heads called out of which this riuer descendeth, and are about six miles
 west of the Lin, out of which the Dee hath his issue, and betweene which
 the Raran vaure hilles are situat and haue their being. After the
 ioining of the two heds of this Barre, as I name it from the originall,
 it receiueth a rill from northeast called Cain, & another beneath the
 same, comming from Beurose wood, and so holdeth on towards the south
 betweene Laniltid and Kemmor abbaie, till it meet a little by west of
 Dolgelth with the Auon vaure, which comming also out of the Woodland
 soile, & taking in a rill from Gwannas, hasteth northwestward (by
 Dolgelth) to ioine with the Barre, and being met they receiue the
 Kessilgunt, then the Hirgun, & after a course of foure to fiue miles it
 falleth into the sea, hauing watered the verie hart & inward parts of
 this shire. From hence we crosse the Skethie which runneth by Corsogdale
 and Lanthwie, alias Lanthonie, then the Lambader which receiuing the
 Artro aboue Lambader, doth fall into the sea, southeast of the point,
 and flat south of Landango, which is a towne situat on the other side of
 the turning.

 [Sidenote: Ho.]
 After this we passed by Aberho, so named of the riuer Ho, that falleth
 there into the sea, and commeth thither from the Alpes or hils of
 Snowdonie, mounteins, no lesse fertile for grasse, wood, cattell, fish
 and foule, than the famous Alpes beyond the seas, whereof all the
 writers doo make so honorable report. From hence we sailed by Abermawr
 [Sidenote: Mawr.]
 or mouth of Mawr, which commeth in like sort from Snowdonie, and taketh
 [Sidenote: Artro.]
 diuerse riuers with him whose names I doo not know. Then vnto the Artro
 a brooke, whose head commeth from by north east, and in his course
 receiueth the Gedar on the north side, and so holdeth on till it fall
 into the sea, after a few windlesses which it maketh as it passeth.
 After this we come to Traith vehan, which is the fall of the Drurid, a
 pretie riuer comming from the marches of Caernaruonshire, which passing
 by Festimog, soone after taketh in the Cunwell, then the Velenrid; and
 so holdeth on to Deckoin, where it falleth into the said Traith. For of
 the other two rilles that lie by south hereof, and haue their issue also
 into the same, I make but small accompt, bicause their quantitie is not
 [Sidenote: Farles.]
 great. Next vnto this we haue Traith mawr, whereinto the Farles hath his
 issue, a riuer proceeding from Snowdonie or the Snowdon hils, descending
 by Bethkelerke and Lanwrothen, without mixture of anie other water in
 all his course and passage. It is parcell of the march also betweene
 Merioneth and Caernaruon shires. From Traith mawr we passe by the
 Krekith, and come to another water descending from the north by
 Lanstidwie, and after that to the Moie, whose mouthes are so neere
 togither, that no more than halfe a mile of the land dooth seeme to
 keepe them in sunder.

 [Sidenote: Erke.]
 Then come we vnto the Erke, a pretie brooke descending from Madrijn
 hils, into whose mouth two other of no lesse quantitie than it selfe doo
 seeme to haue their confluence, and whose courses doo come along from
 the west and northwest; the most southerlie being called Girch, and the
 other the Hellie: except my memorie doo faile me. Then casting about
 toward the south (as the coast lieth) we saw the Abersoch or mouth of
 [Sidenote: Soch.]
 the Soch riuer vpon our right hand, in the mouth whereof, or not farre
 by south thereof lie two Ilands, of which the more northerlie is called
 Tudfall, and the other Penrijn: as Leland did obserue. I would set downe
 the British names of such townes and villages as these waters passe by;
 but the writing of them (for want of the language) is so hard to me,
 that I choose rather to shew their falles and risings, than to corrupt
 their denominations in the writing: and yet now and then I vse such
 words as our Englishmen doo giue vnto some of them, but that is not
 often, where the British name is easie to be found out and sounded.

 After this, going about by the point, and leauing Gwelin Ile on the
 [Sidenote: Daron.]
 right hand, we come to Daron riuer, wherevpon standeth Aberdaron a
 quarter of a mile from the shore betwixt Aberdaron and Vortigernes vale,
 where the compasse of the sea gathereth in a head, and entereth at both
 [Sidenote: Edarne beck.]
 ends. Then come we about the point to Edarne becke, a mile and more
 south of Newin. And ten or twelue miles from hence is the Vennie brooke,
 whose course is little aboue so manie miles; and not farre from it is
 the Liuan, a farre lesse water, comming also from the east: and next
 vnto that another, wherinto the Willie by south and the Carrog by north
 after their coniunction doo make their common influence. Hauing passed
 this riuer, we cast about toward the north east, and enter at Abermenaie
 ferrie, into the streicts or streame called Menaie, betweene Angleseie
 and the maine, meeting first of all with the Gornaie, which commeth from
 the Snowdonie out of the Treuennian lake, and passeth by Lanunda into
 the sea or Menaie streame at Southcrocke. Next of all we meet with the
 Saint, which commeth from Lin Lanbereie, passeth by Lanihangle, and so
 falleth into the Menaie at Abersaint, which is on the southwest side of
 Caernaruon: on the other side also of the said towne is the Skeuernocke,
 whereby it standeth betweene two riuers, of which this hath his head not
 farre from Dinas Orueg.

 Then come we (saith Leland) to Gwiniwith mirith (or Horsse brooke) two
 miles from Moilethon, and it riseth at a Well so called full a mile from
 thence. Moilethon is a bowe shot from Aberpowle, from whence ferrie
 [Sidenote: Conte.]
 botes go to the Termone or Angleseie. Aberpowle runneth three miles into
 the land, and hath his head foure miles beyond Bangor in Meneie shore:
 and here is a little comming in for botes bending into the Meneie. Aber
 [Sidenote: Gegeine.]
 Gegeine commeth out of a mounteine a mile aboue, and Bangor (thorough
 [Sidenote: Torronnen.]
 which a rill called Torronnen hath his course) almost a mile aboue it.
 [Sidenote: Ogwine.]
 Aber Ogwine is two miles aboue that; it riseth at Tale linne, Ogwine
 [Sidenote: Auon.]
 poole, fiue miles aboue Bangor in the east side of Withow. Aber Auon is
 two miles aboue Aberogwene, and it riseth in a poole called Lin man Auon,
 [Sidenote: Lannar.
 Vehan.]
 three miles off. Auon lan var Vehan riseth in a mounteine therby, and
 [Sidenote: Duegeuelth.]
 goeth into the sea, two miles aboue Duegeuelth. Auon Duegeuelth is three
 miles aboue Conweie, which rising in the mounteins a mile off, goeth by
 it selfe into Meneie salt arme. On the said shore also lieth Conweie,
 and this riuer dooth run betwixt Penmaine Maur, and Penmaine Vehan. It
 riseth about three miles from Penmaclon hils which lie about sixtie
 miles from Conweie abbeie, now dissolued out of a lake called Lin
 Conweie, and on the north and west of this riuer standeth the towne of
 Conweie, which taketh his name thereof.

 [Sidenote: Teec.]
 This riuer (which Ptolomie calleth Toesobius, as I take it) after the
 deriuation thereof from the head, passeth on the west side by Spittieuan
 and Tiherio, beneath which it taketh in a streame comming from the east
 out of Denbighshire, deriued from three heads, and of the greatest
 called Nag. Soone after also another, and then the third, which commeth
 in from the west by Lanpen Mawr: next of all the Leder on the same side,
 which commeth by Dolathelan castell: and aboue that from a Lin of the
 [Sidenote: Ligow.]
 same denomination. Beneath this and selfe hand lieth likewise the Ligow
 or Ligwie, proceeding from two lakes, that is, the Mumber and the Ligow.
 On the right hand as we still descend, is the Coid, then the Glin, & a
 little lower we meet with the Lin Gerioneth: and after we be past
 another on the right side, we come to the Perloid, which commeth out of
 Lin Cowlid, to the Ygan, to the Idulin, to the castell Water on the
 left, & then to the Melandider on the right, without the sight of anie
 other, till we come almost to Conweie, where we find a notched streame
 comming from by west, and called Guffen or Gyffin into the same by one
 chanell on the northeast side of the towne, beneath Guffin or Gyffin,
 and ouer against Lansanfraid in Denbighshire; so farre as I now
 remember. Some part of Carnaruonshire stretcheth also beyond Aber
 [Sidenote: Ormeshed.]
 Conweie, or the fall of Conweie, & it is called Ormeshed point, wherein
 also is a rill, whose fall into the sea is betweene Penrin and
 Landright. And thus we haue made an end of the cheefe waters which are
 to be found in this countie.

 The next is a corner of Denbigh, by which we doo as it were step ouer
 into Flintshire, and whose first water is not great, yet it commeth from
 southwest, and falleth into the north or Irish sea called Virginium,
 beneath Landilas; as the next that commeth south from Bettas dooth the
 [Sidenote: Gele.]
 like three miles beneath Abergele, and is not onelie called Gele (as the
 name it selfe importeth) but also noted to take his course through the
 Canges. Hauing thus gone ouer the angle of Denbighshire, that lieth
 betweene those of Carnaruon and Flint, we come next of all vnto Aber
 Cluide, or the fall of Clotha or Glota, which is a streame not to be
 shortlie intreated of. It riseth among certeine hilles, which lie not
 far distant from the confines of Merioneth and Denbighshires. Southeast
 from his fall, and hauing run foure or fiue miles from the head, it
 [Sidenote: Maniton.]
 commeth about to Darwen, taking in the Maniton on the left hand, and the
 Mespin on the right: and soone after the third from bywest, whose head
 is not farre from Gloucanocke. Beneath Ruthen also it taketh in the
 Leueneie: and after that another, and the third, all on the right hand,
 [Sidenote: Cluedoch.]
 and so holdeth on till it meet with the Cluedoch, then with the Ystrade,
 which passeth by Whitchurch on the left hand. After which we come to the
 Wheeler on the right, and so to his ioining with the Elwie, which is
 [Sidenote: Elwie.]
 beneath S. Asaphes, a bishops see that is inuironed with them both. This
 Elwie riseth aboue Gwitherne, & beneath Lanuair taketh in the Alode,
 which commeth from lin Alode, by Lansannan, and ioineth with him fiue
 miles beneath Langrenew. The Cluda therefore and the Elwie being met,
 the confluence passeth on to the sea by Rutland castell, where it taketh
 in the Sarne, which commeth from by east, and hath a course almost of
 sixteene miles. From hence we tooke sea toward the Dee mouth: and as we
 passed by the rest of the shore, we saw the fall of a little brooke
 neere Basing Werke, of another neere to Flint, of the third at Yowleie
 castell, which with his two armes in maner includeth it; and the fourth
 beneath Hawarden hold, which in like sort goeth round about the same, &
 from whence we came to the Dee, where we landed and tooke vp our lodging
 in Chester. In this place also it was no hard matter to deliuer & set
 downe the names of such riuers and streames as are also to be found in
 Angleseie, finding my selfe to haue some leasure and fit opportunitie
 for the same: and imagining a iourneie thither also, as vnto the other
 places mentioned in this description, whither as yet it hath not beene
 my hap to trauell: I thought it not amisse to take it also in hand, and
 performe it after this maner.

 Ferrieng therefore ouer out of Carnaruonshire to Beaumarise, I went by
 land without crossing of anie riuer or streame worthie memorie, till I
 came to the Brant, which hath his fall not farre from the southest point
 of that Iland. This Brant riseth farre vp in the land, not farre from
 Lauredenell, and holding on his course southward to Lanthoniell Vaall,
 it goeth on to Bodoweruch, Langainwen, and so into the sea.

 The next fall we came vnto was called Maltrath, and it is producted by
 the confluence of two riuers, the Geuennie and the Gint, who ioine not
 farre from Langrestoll. This also last rehearsed hath his head neere to
 Penmoneth, the other being forked riseth in the hillie soile aboue
 Tregaion and Langwithlog: so that part of the Iland obteineth no small
 commoditie and benefit by their passage. Next vnto this we came vnto the
 [Sidenote: Fraw.]
 Fraw, whose head is neere to Langinewen, and passage by Cap Maer; after
 which it falleth into a lake, from whence it goeth east of Aberfraw, and
 so into the sea. The next riuer hath no name to my knowledge: yet hath
 it a longer course than that which I last described. For it riseth two
 or three miles aboue Haneglosse: and passing from thence to
 Treualghmaie, after the descent of foure miles, it falleth into the sea.
 After this we came to an other, which riseth more to Cap legan ferwie,
 and falleth into the sea; southeast of the little Iland, which is called
 Ynis Wealt, it is namelesse also as the other was: and therefore hauing
 small delight to write thereof, we passed ouer the salt creeke by a
 bridge into Cair Kibie, which by the same, is as it were cut from the
 maine Iland, and in some respect not vnworthie to be taken for an Ile.
 In the north side therefore of Cair Kibie is a little rill or creeke:
 but whether the water thereof be fresh or salt, as yet I doo not
 remember.

 This place being viewed, I came backe againe by the aforesaid bridge,
 into the maine of Angleseie, and going northwards I find a fall inforced
 by three riuerets, each one hauing his course almost south from other;
 and the last falling into the confluence of the two first, not halfe a
 mile from the west, where I first espied the streame: the name of the
 [Sidenote: Linon.]
 [Sidenote: Allo.]
 most northerlie is Linon, of the second Allo; but the third is
 altogither namelesse for aught that I can learne, wherefore it shall not
 be necessarie to spend anie time in the further searching of his course.
 Being past this, we went northwards till we came to the point, and then
 going eastward, we butted vpon the fall of a certeine confluence growing
 by the ioining of the Nathanon and the Geger, which meet beneath and
 neere to the Langechell. And after the same we passed on somewhat
 declining southward by the Hillarie point, toward the southeast, till we
 came to the Dulesse: and from thence to Pentraeth water: after which we
 turned northward, then eastward; and finallie southward, till we came to
 Langurdin; from whence vnto Beaumarise (where began our voiage) we find
 not anie water worthie to be remembred. And thence I go forward with the
 description of the Dee.

 [Sidenote: Dee or Deua.]
 The Dee or Deua (as Ptolomie calleth it) is a noble riuer, & breeder of
 the best trout, whose head is in Merioneth shire, about three miles
 aboue the lake, situate in the countie of Penthlin, and called Lin
 Tegnis, whose streame yet verie small, by reason of the shortnesse of
 his course, falleth into the said lake, not far from Lanullin. There are
 sundrie other waters which come also into the said lake, which is foure
 or five miles in length, and about two miles ouer; as one from by south,
 whose fall is east, and not manie furlongs from the Dee: another hath
 his issue into the same by Langower: the third on the north side of
 Lanullin, named Leie: the fourth at Glanlintegid called Jauerne, the
 lake it selfe ending about Bala, and from thence running into the
 [Sidenote: Trowerin.]
 Trowerin, a pretie streame, and not a little augmented by the Kelme and
 Monach which fall by north into the same, and ioineth with the Dee south
 of Lanuair; from whence forth it looseth the name, and is afterward
 [Sidenote: Ruddoch.]
 called Dee. East of Bala in like sort it receiueth the Ruddoch, then the
 [Sidenote: Cleton.]
 Cleton, and so passing on by Landright to Langar, it meeteth with a
 confluence proceeding from the Alwen and the Giron, of which this riseth
 in the hils aboue Langham, the other in the mounteines about fiue or six
 miles by northwest of Lanihangle in Denbighshire, where (as I gesse) it
 falleth into the ground; and afterward rising againe betweene Lanihangle
 and Bettus, it holdeth on about two miles, and then ioineth with the
 Giron, full six miles aboue Dole, and before it come to the Dee. From
 hence the Dee goeth by Lansanfraid, and the marches of Merioneth into
 Denbighshire, and so to Langellon, Dinas, Bren, &c: keeping his course
 [Sidenote: Gristioneth.]
 by certeine windlesses, till he receiue the Gristioneth, descending by
 Ruabon, then another est of the same; the third from by west called
 [Sidenote: Keriog.]
 Keriog (whose head is not farre from the bounds of Merioneth and course
 by Lanarmon, Lansanfraid, and Chirke) the fourth from south east out of
 Shropshire, called Morlais, and so passeth as bounds betweene
 Denbighshire, and the Outliggand of Flintshire, to wit by Bistocke on
 the one side and Bangor on the other, till it come to Worthenburie:
 whereabout it receiueth a chanell descending from foure influences, of
 which one commeth by Penlie chappell, the second from Hamnere, which
 goeth downe by Emberhall, and falleth in a little by east of the other;
 the third from Blackmere (by Whitchurch) &c: and the fourth from
 betweene Chad and Worsall. These two later meeting aboue nether
 Durtwich, doo hold on to Talerne, as mine information instructeth me.

 From Wrothenburie the Dee goeth northwestwards toward Shocklige, meeting
 [Sidenote: Cluedoch.]
 by the waie with the confluence of the Cluedoch (or Dedoch originall
 mother to those trouts for which the Dee is commended) and descendeth
 [Sidenote: Gwinrogh.]
 from Capell Moinglath) and the Gwinrogh, that runneth through Wrexham,
 both ioining a mile and more beneath Wrexham, not far from Hantwerne.
 Soone after also our maine riuer receiueth another becke from by east,
 which is bound on the northwest side to the Outliggand of Flintshire,
 and so passeth on betweene Holt castell and Ferneton, Almere and Pulton,
 as march betweene Denbighshire and Cheshire, and then taketh in the
 [Sidenote: Alannus.]
 Alannus or Alen; a pretie riuer and worthie to be described. The head of
 this Alen therefore is in Denbighshire, and so disposed that it riseth
 in two seuerall places, ech being two miles from other, the one called
 Alen Mawr, the other Alen Vehan, as I doo find reported. They meet also
 beneath Landegleie, and run northwards till they come beyond Lanuerres,
 where meeting with a rill comming from by west, it runneth on to the
 Mold to Horsheth, and so in and out to Greseford, taking the Cagidog
 from southwest with it by the waie; then to Traue Alen, and so into the
 Dee, a mile and more aboue the fall of Powton becke, which also
 descendeth from southwest out of Flintshire, and is march vnto the same,
 euen from the verie head. After which confluence the Dee hauing
 Chestershire on both sides, goeth to Aldford with a swift course, where
 it meeteth with the Beston brooke, whereof I doo find this description
 following.

 [Sidenote: Beston.]
 "The Beston water riseth in the wooddie soile betweene Spruston and
 Beston castell with a forked head, and leauing Beston towne on the
 northeast, it goeth to Tarneton, and to Hakesleie, where it diuideth it
 selfe in such wise, that one branch thereof runneth by Totnall,
 Goldburne, and Leehall, to Alford, and so into the Dee, the other by
 Stapleford, Terwine, Barrow, Picton, and Therton, where it brancheth
 againe, sending foorth one arme by Stanneie poole, and the parke side
 into Merseie arme, toward the northwest, and another by southwest, which
 commeth as it were backe againe, by Stoke, Croughton, Backeford,
 Charleton, Vpton, the Baites, and so vnder a bridge to Chester ward,
 where it falleth into the Dee arme at Flockes brooke, excluding Wirall
 on the northwest as an Iland, which lieth out like a leg betweene the
 Merseie and the Dee armes, and including and making another fresh Iland
 within the same, whose limits by northwest are betweene Thorneton,
 Chester, & Aldford, on the northeast Thorneton and Hakesleie, and on the
 southeast Hakesleie and Aldford, whereby the forme thereof dooth in part
 resemble a triangle." And thus much of the Dee, which is a troublesome
 streame when the wind is at southwest, and verie dangerous, in so much
 that few dare passe thereon. Sometimes also in haruest time it sendeth
 downe such store of water, when the wind bloweth in the same quarter,
 that it drowneth all their grasse and corne that groweth in the lower
 grounds neere vnto the bankes thereof. Certes it is about three hundred
 foot, at his departure from the Tignie, and worthilie called a litigious
 streame; because that by often alteration of chanell, it inforceth men
 to seeke new bounds vnto their lands, for here it laieth new ground, and
 there translateth and taketh awaie the old, so that there is nothing
 more vnconstant than the course of the said water. Of the monasterie
 Bangor also, by which it passeth after it hath left Orton bridge, I find
 this note, which I will not omit, because of the slaughter of monks made
 sometime neere vnto the same. For although the place require it not, yet
 I am not willing altogither to omit it.

 [Sidenote: The situation of the monasterie of Bangor.]
 This abbeie of Bangor stood sometime in English Mailor, by hither and
 south of the riuer Dee. It is now ploughed ground where that house
 stood, by the space of a Welsh mile (which reacheth vnto a mile and an
 halfe English) and to this day the tillers of the soile there doo plow
 vp bones (as they saie) of those monks that were slaine in the quarrell
 of Augustine, and within the memorie of man some of them were taken vp
 in their rotten weeds, which were much like vnto those of our late
 blacke monks, as Leland set it downe: yet Erasmus is of the opinion,
 that the apparell of the Benedictine monks was such as most men did
 weare generallie at their first institution. But to proceed. This abbeie
 stood in a valleie, and in those times the riuer ran hard by it. The
 compasse thereof likewise was as the circuit of a walled towne, and to
 this daie two of the gates may easilie be discerned, of which the one is
 named Port Hogan lieng by north, the other Port Clais situat vpon the
 south. But the Dee hauing now changed his chanell, runneth through the
 verie middest of the house betwixt those two gates, the one being at the
 left a full halfe mile from the other. As for the squared stone that is
 found hereabout, and the Romane coine, there is no such necessitie of
 the rehersall therof, but that I may passe it ouer well inough without
 anie further mention.

 Being past the Dee we sailed about Wirall, passing by Hibrie or Hilbree
 Iland, and Leuerpole, Nasse, making our entrie into Merseie arme by
 Leuerpole hauen, where we find a water falling out betweene Seacombe and
 the Ferie, which dooth in maner cut off the point from the maine of
 Wirall. For rising neere to the northwest shore, it holdeth a course
 directlie toward the southeast by Wallaseie and Poton, and so leaueth
 all the north part beyond that water a peninsula, the same being three
 square, inuironed on two sides with the Ocean, & on the third with the
 aforesaid brooke, whose course is well neere three miles except I be
 deceiued. Fr[=o] hence entring further into the hauen, we find another
 fall betweene Bebington and Brombro chappell, descending from the
 hilles, which are seene to lie not farre from the shore, and thence
 crossing the fall of the Beston water, we come next of all vnto the
 [Sidenote: Wiuer.]
 Wiuer, than the which I read of no riuer in England that fetcheth more
 or halfe so many windlesses and crinklings, before it come at the sea.
 It riseth at Buckle hilles, which lie betweene Ridleie and Buckle
 townes, and soone after making a lake of a mile & more in length called
 Ridleie poole, it runneth by Ridleie to Chalmondlie.

 Thence it goeth to Wrenburie, where it taketh in a water out of a moore
 [Sidenote: Combrus.]
 that commeth from Marburie: and beneth Sandford bridge the Combrus from
 Combermer or Comber lake: and finallie the third that commeth from about
 Moneton, and runneth by Langerslaw, then betweene Shenton and Atherlie
 parkes, and so into the Wiuer, which watereth all the west part of
 England, and is no lesse notable than the fift Auon or third Ouze,
 whereof I haue spoken alreadie. After these confluences it hasteth also
 [Sidenote: Betleie.]
 to Audlem, Hawklow, and at Barderton crosseth the Betleie water, that
 runneth by Duddington, Widdenberie, and so by Barderton into the
 aforesaid streame. Thence it goeth to Nantwich, but yer it come at
 [Sidenote: Salop.]
 Marchford bridge, it meeteth with a rill called Salopbrooke (as I gesse)
 comming from Caluerleie ward, and likewise beneath the said bridge, with
 [Sidenote: Lee and Wuluarne.]
 the Lee and the Wuluarne both in one chanell, wherof the first riseth at
 Weston, the ether goeth by Copnall. From hence the Wiuer runneth on to
 Minchion and Cardeswijc, and the next water that falleth into it is the
 [Sidenote: Ashe.]
 Ashe (which passeth by Darnall Grange) and afterward going to Warke, the
 vale Roiall, and Eaton, it commeth finallie to Northwich where it
 [Sidenote: Dane.]
 receiueth the Dane, to be described as followeth. The Dane riseth in the
 verie edges of Chester, Darbishire, & Staffordshire, and comming by
 Warneford, Swithamleie and Bosleie, is a limit betweene Stafford and
 Darbie shires, almost euen from the verie head, which is in Maxwell
 forrest.

 [Sidenote: Bidle.]
 It is not long also yer it doo meet with the Bidle water, that commeth
 by Congerton, and after the confluence goeth vnto Swetham, the
 Heremitage, Cotton and Croxton, there taking in two great waters,
 [Sidenote: Whelocke.]
 whereof the one is called Whelocke, which comming from the edge of the
 countie by Morton to Sandbach, crosseth another that descended from
 church Cawlhton, and after the confluence goeth to Warmingham, ioining
 also beneath Midlewish with the Croco or Croxston, the second great
 water, whose head commeth out of a lake aboue Bruerton (as I heare) and
 [Sidenote: Croco.]
 thence both the Whelocke and the Croco go as one vnto the Dane, at
 Croxton, as the Dane dooth from thence to Bostocke, Dauenham, Shebruch,
 Shurlach, and at Northwich into the foresaid Wiuer. After this
 confluence the Wiuer runneth on to Barneton, and there in like sort
 receiueth two brookes in one chanell, whereof one commeth from aboue
 Allostocke, by Holme & Lastocke, the other from beyond Birtles mill, by
 [Sidenote: Piuereie.]
 Chelford (where it taketh in a rill called Piuereie) thence to ouer
 [Sidenote: Waterlesse.]
 Peuer, Holford, and there crossing the Waterlesse brooke (growing of two
 becks and ioining at nether Tableie) it goeth foorth to Winshambridge,
 and then meeting with the other, after this confluence they proceed till
 they come almost at Barneton, where the said chanell ioineth with a
 pretie water running thorough two lakes, whereof the greatest lieth
 betweene Comberbach, Rudworth and Marburie. But to go forward with the
 course of the maine riuer. After these confluences our Wiuer goeth to
 Warham, Actonbridge, and Dutton, ouer against which towne, on the other
 side it meeteth with a rill, comming from Cuddington: also the second
 going by Norleie, and Gritton, finallie the third soone after from
 Kimsleie, and then proceedeth on in his passage by Asheton chappell,
 Frodesham, Rockesauage, and so into the sea: and this is all that I doo
 find of the Wiuer, whose influences might haue beene more largelie set
 downe, if mine iniunctions had beene amplie deliuered, yet this I hope
 may suffice for his description, and knowledge of his course.

 [Sidenote: Merseie.]
 The Merseie riseth among the Peke hils, and from thence going downe to
 the Woodhouse, and taking sundrie rilles withall by the waie, it
 becommeth the confines betweene Chester and Darbishires. Going also
 toward Goitehall, it meeteth with a faire brooke increased by sundrie
 [Sidenote: Goite.]
 waters called Goite, whereof I find this short and briefe description.
 The Goite riseth not far from the Shire meere hill (wherein the Doue and
 the Dane haue their originall) that parteth Darbishire and Chestershire
 in sunder, and thence commeth downe to Goite houses, Ouerton, Taxhall,
 [Sidenote: Frith.]
 Shawcrosse, and at Weibridge taketh in the Frith, and beneath Berdhall,
 [Sidenote: Set.]
 the Set that riseth aboue Thersethall and runneth by Ouerset. After this
 confluence also the Merseie goeth to Goite hall, & at Stockford or
 [Sidenote: Tame.]
 Stopford towne meeteth with the Tame, which diuideth Chestershire and
 Lancastershire in sunder, and whose head is in the verie edge of
 Yorkeshire, from whence it goeth southward to Sadleworth Firth, then to
 Mukelhirst, Stalie hall, Ashdon Vnderline, Dunkenfield, Denton, Reddish,
 and so at Stockford into the Merseie streame, which passeth foorth in
 like sort to Diddesbirie, receiuing a brooke by the waie that commeth
 from Lime parke, by Brumhall parke and Chedle.

 [Sidenote: Irwell.]
 From Diddesbirie it proceedeth to Norden, Ashton, Aiston, Flixston,
 where it receiueth the Irwell a notable water, and therefore his
 description is not to be omitted before I doo go forward anie further
 with the Merseie, although it be not nauigable by reason of sundrie
 rockes and shalowes that lie dispersed in the same. It riseth aboue
 Bacop, and goeth thence to Rosendale, and in the waie to Aitenfield it
 taketh in a water from Haselden. After this confluence it goeth to
 [Sidenote: Raeus, or Rache.]
 Newhall, Brandlesham, Brurie, and aboue Ratcliffe ioineth with the Rache
 [Sidenote: Leland speaketh of the Corue water about
 Manchester; but I know nothing of his course.]
 water, a faire streame and to be described when I haue finished the
 Irwell, as also the next vnto it beneath Ratcliffe, bicause I would not
 haue so manie ends at once in hand wherewith to trouble my readers.
 Being therfore past these two, our Irwell goeth on to Clifton, Hollond,
 Edgecroft, Strengwaies, and to Manchester, where it vniteth it selfe
 [Sidenote: Yrke.]
 with the Yrke, that runneth thereinto by Roiton Midleton, Heaton hill,
 [Sidenote: Medlockte.]
 and Blackeleie. Beneath Manchester also it meeteth with the Medlocke
 that commeth thither from the northeast side of Oldham, and betweene,
 Claiton and Garret Halles, and so betweene two parkes, falling into it
 about Holne. Thence our Irwell going forward to Woodsall, Whicleswijc,
 Ecles, Barton, and Deuelhom, it falleth neere vnto Flixton, into the
 water of Merseie, where I will staie a while withall, till I haue
 brought the other vnto some passe, of which I spake before.

 [Sidenote: Rache.]
 The Rache, Rech or Rish consisteth of sundrie waters, whereof ech one in
 maner hath a proper name, but the greatest of all is Rache it selfe,
 which riseth among the blacke stonie hils, from whence it goeth to
 [Sidenote: Beile.]
 Littlebrough, and being past Clegge, receiueth the Beile, that commeth
 thither by Milneraw chappell. After this confluence also, it meeteth
 [Sidenote: Sprotton.]
 with a rill neere vnto Rachedale, and soone after with the Sprotton
 [Sidenote: Sudleie.]
 water, and then the Sudleie brooke, whereby his chanell is not a little
 increased, which goeth from thence to Grisehirst and so into the Irwell,
 [Sidenote: Bradsha.]
 before it come at Ratcliffe. The second streame is called Bradsha. It
 riseth of two heds, aboue Tureton church, whence it runneth to Bradsha,
 [Sidenote: Walmesleie.]
 and yer long taking in the Walmesleie becke, they go in one chanell till
 they come beneath Bolton in the More. From hence (receiuing a water that
 commeth from the roots of Rauenpike hill by the way) it goeth by Deane
 and Bolton in the More, and so into Bradsha water, which taketh his waie
 to Leuermore, Farnworth, Leuerlesse, and finallie into the Irwell, which
 I before described, and whereof I find these two verses to be added at
 the last:

   Irke, Irwell, Medlocke, and Tame,
   When they meet with the Merseie, do loose their name.

 Now therefore to resume our Merseie, you shall vnderstand that after his
 confluence with the Irwell, he runneth to Partington, and not farre from
 [Sidenote: Gles.]
 thence interteineth the Gles, or Glesbrooke water, increased with
 sundrie armes, wherof one commeth from Lodward, another from aboue
 Houghton, the third from Hulton parke, and the fourth from Shakerleie:
 and being all vnited neere vnto Leigh, the confluence goeth to Holcroft,
 and aboue Holling greene into the swift Merseie. After this increase the
 said streame in like sort runneth to Rigston, & there admitteth the
 [Sidenote: Bollein brooke.]
 Bollein or Bolling brooke water into his societie, which rising neere
 the Chamber in Maxwell forrest goeth to Ridge, Sutton, Bollington,
 Prestbirie, and Newton, where it taketh in a water comming from about
 Pot Chappell, which runneth from thence by Adlington, Woodford,
 [Sidenote: Birkin.]
 Wimesleie, Ringeie, and Ashleie, there receiuing the Birkin brooke that
 commeth from betweene Allerton and Marchall, by Mawberleie, and soone
 [Sidenote: Mar.]
 after the Marus or Mar, that commeth thereinto from Mar towne, by
 Rawstorne, and after these confluences goeth on to Downham, and ouer
 against Rixton beneath Crosford bridge into the Merseie water, which
 proceeding on, admitteth not another that meeteth with all neere Lim
 before it go to Thelwall. Thence also it goeth by Bruche and so to
 Warrington, a little beneath crossing a brooke that commeth from Par by
 Browseie, Bradleie, and Saukeie on the one side, and another on the
 other that commeth thither from Gropenhall, and with these it runneth on
 to nether Walton, Acton grange, and so to Penkith, where it interteineth
 [Sidenote: Bold.]
 [Sidenote: Grundich.]
 the Bold, and soone after the Grundich water on the other side, that
 passeth by Preston, and Daresbirie. Finallie our Merseie going by
 Moulton, it falleth into Lirepoole, or as it was called of old
 Liuerpoole hauen, when it is past Runcorne. And thus much of the
 Merseie, comparable vnto the Wiuer, and of no lesse fame than most
 riuers of this Iland.

 [Sidenote: Tarbocke.]
 Being past these two, we come next of all to the Tarbocke water, that
 falleth into the sea at Harbocke, without finding anie mo till we be
 past all Wirall, out of Lirepoole hauen, and from the blacke rockes that
 lie vpon the north point of the aforesaid Iland. Then come we to the
 [Sidenote: Alt or Ast.]
 Altmouth, whose fresh rising not far into the land, commeth to Feston,
 and soone after receiuing another on the right hand, that passeth into
 it by Aughton, it is increased no more before it come at the sea.
 Neither find I anie other falles till I meet with the mouth of the
 [Sidenote: Duglesse or Dulesse.]
 Yarrow and Duglesse, which haue their recourse to the sea in one chanell
 as I take it. The Duglesse commeth from by west of Rauenspike hill, and
 yer long runneth by Andertonford to Worthington, and so (taking in two
 or three rilles by the waie) to Wigen, where it receiueth two waters in
 one chanell, of which one commeth in south from Brin parke, the other
 from northeast. Being past this, it receiueth one on the north side from
 Standish, and another by south from Hollond, and then goeth on toward
 [sidenote: Taud or Skelmere.]
 Rufford chappell taking the Taud withall, that descendeth from aboue
 Skelmersdale towne, and goeth through Lathan parke, belonging (as I
 heare) vnto the earle of Derbie. It meeteth also on the same side,
 [Sidenote: Merton.]
 with Merton meere water, in which meere is one Iland called Netholme
 beside other, and when it is past the hanging bridge, it is not long yer
 it fall into the Yarrow.

 [Sidenote: Yarrow.]
 [Sidenote: Bagen.]
 The Yarrow riseth of two heads, whereof the second is called Bagen
 brooke, and making a confluence beneath Helbie wood, it goeth on to
 Burgh, Eglestan, Crofton, and then ioineth next of all with the
 Dugglesse, after which confluence, the maine streame goeth foorth to
 Bankehall, Charleton, How, Hesket, and so into the sea. Leland writing
 of the Yarrow, saith thus of the same, so fare as I now remember. Into
 the Dugglesse also runneth the Yarrow, which commeth within a mile or
 thereabout of Chorleton towne, that parteth Lelandshire from
 Derbieshire. Vnder the foot of Chorle also I find a rill named Ceorle,
 and about a mile and a halfe from thence a notable quarreie of stones,
 whereof the inhabitants doo make a great boast and price. And hitherto
 to Leland.

 [Sidenote: Ribble.]
 The Ribble, a riuer verie rich of salmon, and lampreie, dooth in manner
 inuiron Preston in Andernesse, and it riseth neere to Kibbesdale aboue
 Gisborne, from whence it goeth to Sawleie or Salleie, Chathburne,
 [Sidenote: Odder.]
 Woodington, Clithero castell, and beneath Mitton meeteth the Odder at
 north west, which riseth not farre from the crosse of Greet in
 Yorkeshire, and going thence to Shilburne, Newton, Radholme parke, and
 Stonie hirst, it falleth yer long into the Ribble water. From hence the
 [Sidenote: Calder.]
 Ribble water hath not gone farre, but it meeteth with the Calder from
 southeast. This brooke riseth aboue Holme church in Yorkeshire, which
 lieth by east of Lancastershire, and going by Towleie and Burneleie,
 where it receiueth a trifling rill, thence to Higham, and yer long
 crossing one water that commeth from Wicoler by Colne, and another by
 [Sidenote: Pidle.]
 and by named Pidle brooke, that runneth by New church in the Pidle, it
 meeteth with the Calder, which passeth foorth to Paniam; and thence
 receiuing a becke on the other side, it runneth on to Altham, and so to
 [Sidenote: Henburne.]
 Martholme, where the Henburne brooke dooth ioine withall, that goeth by
 Akington chappell, Dunkinhalgh, Rishton, and so into the Calder, as I
 haue said before. The Calder therefore being thus inlarged, runneth
 foorth to Reade, where maister Nowell dwelleth, to Whallie, and soone
 after into Ribble, that goeth from this confluence to Salisburie hall,
 Ribchester, Osbastin, Samburie, Keuerden, Law, Ribbles bridge, & then
 [Sidenote: Darwent.]
 taketh in the Darwent, before it goeth by Pontwarth or Pentwarth into
 the maine sea. The Darwent diuideth Lelandshire from Andernesse, and it
 riseth by east aboue Darwent chappell; and soone after vniting it selfe
 [Sidenote: Blackeburne.]
 [Sidenote: Rodlesworth.]
 with the Blackeburne, and Rodlesworth water, it goeth through Houghton
 parke, by Houghton towne, to Walton hall, and so into the Ribble. As for
 [Sidenote: Sannocke.]
 the Sannocke brooke, it riseth somewhat aboue Longridge chappell, goeth
 to Broughton towne, Cotham, Lee hall, and so into Ribble. And here is
 all that I haue to saie of this riuer.

 [Sidenote: Wire.]
 The Wire riseth eight or ten miles from Garstan, out of an hill in
 Wiresdale forrest, from whence it runneth by Shireshed chappell, and
 then going by Wadland, or Waddiler, Grenelaw castell (which belongeth to
 the erle of Darbie) Garstan, and Kirkland hall, it first receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Calder. 2.]
 second Calder, that commeth downe by Edmerseie chappell, then another
 chanell increased with sundrie waters, which I will here describe before
 I proceed anie further with the Wire. I suppose that the first water is
 [Sidenote: Plimpton.]
 called Plimpton brooke, it riseth south of Gosner, and commeth by
 [Sidenote: Barton.]
 Cawford hall, and yer long receiuing the Barton becke, it proceedeth
 [Sidenote: Brooke.]
 forward till it ioineth with the Brooke rill that commeth from Bowland
 forrest, by Claughton hall, where master Brookehales dooth lie, & so
 through Mersco forrest. After this confluence the Plime or Plimpton
 water meeteth with the Calder, and then with the Wire, which passeth
 [Sidenote: Skipton.]
 foorth to Michaell church, and the Raw cliffes, and aboue Thorneton
 crosseth the Skipton that goeth by Potton, then into the Wire rode, and
 finallie through the sands into the sea, according to his nature. When
 we were past the fall of the Wire, we coasted vp by the salt cotes, to
 [Sidenote: Coker.]
 Coker mouth, whose head, though it be in Weresdale forrest, not far from
 that of the Wire, yet the shortnesse of course deserueth no description.
 [Sidenote: Cowdar.]
 The next is Cowdar, which is comming out of Wire dale, as I take it, is
 not increased with anie other waters more than Coker, and therefore I
 will rid my hands thereof so much the sooner.

 [Sidenote: Lune.]
 Being past these two, I came to a notable riuer called the Lune or
 Loine, or (as the booke of statutes hath) Lonwire Anno 13 Ric. 2. cap.
 19, and giueth name to Lancaster, Lonecaster, or Lunecaster, where much
 Romane monie is found, and that of diuerse stamps, whose course dooth
 rest to be described as followeth; and whereof I haue two descriptions.
 The first being set downe by Leland, as master Moore of Catharine hall
 in Cambridge deliuered it vnto him. The next I exhibit as it was giuen
 vnto me, by one that hath taken paines (as he saith) to search out and
 view the same, but verie latelie to speake of. The Lune (saith master
 Moore) of some commonlie called the Loine, riseth at Crosseho, in Dent
 dale, in the edge of Richmondshire out of three heads. North also from
 Dent dale is Garsdale, an vplandish towne, wherein are seene manie times
 great store of red deere that come downe to feed from the mounteins into
 the vallies, and thereby runneth a water, which afterward commeth to
 Sebbar vale, where likewise is a brooke meeting with Garsdale water, so
 that a little lower they go as one into Dent dale becke, which is the
 riuer that afterward is called Lune, or Lane, as I haue verie often
 noted it. Beside these waters also before mentioned, it receiueth at the
 foot of Sebbar vale, a great brooke, which commeth out of the Worth,
 betweene Westmerland and Richmondshire, which taking with him the
 aforesaid chanels, dooth run seauen miles yer it come to Dent dale foot.
 From hence it entreth into Lansdale, corruptlie so called, peraduenture
 for Lunesdale, & runneth therein eight or nine miles southward, and in
 this dale is Kirbie. Hitherto master Moore, as Leland hath exemplified
 that parcell of his letters. But mine other note writeth hereof in this
 [Sidenote: Burbecke.]
 manner. Burbecke water riseth at Wustall head, by west, and going by
 Wustall foot to Skaleg, it admitteth the Breder that descendeth thither
 [Sidenote: Breder.]
 from Breder dale. From hence our Burbecke goeth to Breder dale foot, &
 so to Tibarie, where it meeteth with foure rilles in one bottome, of
 which one commeth from besides Orton, another from betweene Rasebecke
 and Sunbiggin, the third and fourth from each side of Langdale: and
 after the generall confluence made, goeth toward Roundswath, aboue which
 [Sidenote: Barrow.]
 it vniteth it selfe with the Barrow. Thence it runneth to Howgill,
 Delaker, Firrebanke, and Killington, beneath which it meeteth with a
 [Sidenote: Dent.]
 water comming from the Moruill hilles, and afterward crossing the Dent
 brooke, that runneth thither from Dent towne, beneath Sebbar, they
 continue their course as one into the Burbecke, from whence it is called
 Lune. From hence it goeth to Burbon chappell, where it taketh in another
 rill comming from by east, then to Kirbie, Lansbele, and aboue
 Whittenton crosseth a brooke comming from the countie stone by Burros,
 [Sidenote: Greteie.]
 and soone after beneath Tunstall and Greteie, which descending from
 about Ingelborow hill, passeth by Twiselton, Ingleton, Thorneton,
 Burton, Wratton, and neere Thurland castell, toucheth finallie with the
 Lune, which brancheth, and soone after vniteth it selfe againe. After
 [Sidenote: Wennie.]
 this also it goeth on toward New parke, and receiueth the Wennie, and
 [Sidenote: Hinburne.]
 the Hinburne both in one chanell, of which this riseth north of the
 crosse of Greteie, and going by Benthams and Roberts hill, aboue Wraie
 [Sidenote: Rheburne.]
 taketh in the Rheburne that riseth north of Wulfecrag. After this
 confluence also aboue New parke, it maketh his gate by Aughton,
 Laughton, Skirton, Lancaster, Excliffe, Awcliffe, Soddaie, Orton, and so
 into the sea. Thus haue you both the descriptions of Lune, make your
 conference or election at your pleasure, for I am sworne to neither of
 them both.

 [Sidenote: Docker.]
 The next fall is called Docker, and peraduenture the same that Leland
 [Sidenote: Kerie.]
 dooth call the Kerie, which is not farre from Wharton, where the rich
 Kitson was borne, it riseth north of Docker towne, and going by Barwijc
 hall, it is not increased before it come at the sea, where it falleth
 into the Lune water at Lunesands. Next of all we come to Bitham beck,
 which riseth not far from Bitham towne and parke, in the hilles, where
 about are great numbers of goates kept and mainteined, and by all
 likelihood resorteth in the end to Linsands.

 Being past this, we find a forked arme of the sea called Kensands: into
 the first of which diuerse waters doo run in one chanell, as it were
 from foure principall heads, one of them comming from Grarrig hall,
 another fr[=o] by west of Whinfield, & ioining with the first on the east
 [Sidenote: Sprota.]
 side of Skelmere parke. The third called Sprot or Sprota riseth at
 Sloddale, & commeth downe by west of Skelmer parke, so that these two
 brookes haue the aforesaid parke betweene them, & fall into the fourth
 east of Barneside, not verie farre in sunder. The fourth or last called
 [Sidenote: Ken.]
 Ken, commeth from Kentmers side, out of Ken moore, in a poole of a mile
 compasse, verie well stored with fish, the head whereof, as of all the
 baronie of Kendall is in Westmerland, & going to Stauelope, it taketh in
 a rill from Chappleton Inges. Then leauing Colnehead parke by east, it
 passeth by Barneside, to Kendall, Helston, Sigath, Siggeswijc,
 Leuenbridge, Milnethorpe, and so into the sea. Certes this Ken is a
 pretie deepe riuer, and yet not safelie to be aduentured vpon, with
 boates and balingers, by reason of rolling stones, & other huge
 substances that oft annoie & trouble the middest of the chanell there.
 [Sidenote: Winstar.]
 The other peece of the forked arme, is called Winstar, the hed wherof is
 aboue Winstar chappell, & going downe almost by Carpmaunsell, &
 Netherslake, it is not long yer it fall into the sea, or sands, for all
 this coast, & a gulfe from the Ramside point to the Mealenasse, is so
 pestered with sands, that it is almost incredible to see how they
 increase. Those also which inuiron the Kenmouth, are named Kensands: but
 such as receiue the descent from the Fosse, Winander, and Sparke, are
 called Leuesands, as I find by sufficient testimonie. The mouth or fall
 of the Dodon also is not farre from this impechment: wherefore it is to
 be thought, that these issues will yer long become verie noisome, if not
 [Sidenote: Winander.]
 choked vp altogither. The Winander water riseth about Cunbalrasestones,
 from whence it goeth to Cangridge, where it maketh a meere: then to
 Ambleside, and taking in yer it come there, two rilles on the left hand,
 and one on the right that commeth by Clapergate, it maketh (as I take
 it) the greatest meere, or fresh water in England; for I read it is ten
 miles in length. Finallie, comming to one small chanell aboue Newbridge,
 it reacheth not aboue six miles yer it fall into the sea. There is in
 [Sidenote: Fosse.]
 like sort a water, called the Fosse that riseth neere vnto Arneside, and
 Tillerthwates, and goeth foorth by Grisdale, Satrethwate, Rusland,
 Powbridge, Bowth, and so falleth with the Winander water into the maine
 sea. On the west side of the Fosse also commeth another through Furnesse
 felles, and from the hilles by north thereof, which yer long making the
 Thurstan lake not far from Hollinhow, and going by Bridge end, in a
 narrow channell, passeth foorth by Nibthwaits, Blareth, Cowlton, &
 [Sidenote: Sparke.]
 Sparke bridge, and so into the sea. Hauing passed the Leuen or
 Conisands, or Conistonesands, or Winander fall (for all is one) I come
 [Sidenote: Lew.]
 to the Lew, which riseth at Cewike chappell, and falleth into the sea
 [Sidenote: Rawther.]
 beside Plumpton. The Rawther descending out of low Furnesse, hath two
 heads, whereof one commeth from Penniton, the other by Vlmerstone
 abbeie, and ioining both in one chanell, they hasten into the sea,
 whither all waters direct their voiage. Then come we to another rill
 southwest of Aldingham, descending by Glaiston castell; and likewise the
 fourth that riseth neere Lindell, and running by Dawlton castell and
 Furnesse abbeie, not farre from the Barrow head, it falleth into the sea
 ouer against Waueie and Waueie chappell, except mine aduertisements
 misleade me.

 [Sidenote: Dodon.]
 The Dodon, which from the head is bound vnto Cumberland and Westmerland,
 commeth from the Shire stone hill bottome, and going by Blackehill,
 Southwake, S. Iohns, Vffaie parke, & Broughton, it falleth into the
 orltwater, betweene Kirbie, and Mallum castell. And thus are we now come
 vnto the Rauenglasse point, and well entred into the Cumberland countie.

 Comming to Rauenglasse, I find hard by the towne a water comming from
 two heads, and both of them in lakes or pooles, whereof one issueth out
 [Sidenote: Denocke.]
 of Denocke or Deuenocke meere, and is called Denocke water, the other
 [Sidenote: Eske.]
 named Eske from Eske poole which runneth by Eskedale, Dalegarth, and
 soone after meeting with the Denocke, betweene Mawburthwate and
 Rauenglasse, falleth into the sea. On the other side of Rauenglasse also
 [Sidenote: Mite.]
 commeth the Mite brooke, from Miterdale as I read. Then find we another
 which commeth from the hils, and at the first is forked, but soone after
 making a lake, they gather againe into a smaller chanell: finallie
 [Sidenote: Brenge.]
 meeting with the Brenge, they fall into the sea at Carleton southeast, as
 [Sidenote: Cander.]
 I weene of Drig. The Cander, or (as Leland nameth it) the Calder,
 commeth out of Copeland forrest, by Cander, Sellefield, and so into the
 sea. Then come we to Euer water, descending out of a poole aboue
 Coswaldhow, and thence going by Euerdale, it crosseth a water from
 Arladon, and after proceedeth to Egremond, S. Iohns, and taking in
 another rill from Hide, it is not long yer it meeteth with the sea.

 The next fall is at Moresbie, whereof I haue no skill. From thence
 therefore we cast about by saint Bees to Derwentset hauen, whose water
 [Sidenote: Dargwent.]
 is truelie written Dargwent or Deruent. It riseth in the hils about
 Borrodale, from whence it goeth vnto the Grange, thence into a lake, in
 which are certeine Ilands, and so vnto Keswijc, where it falleth into
 [Sidenote: Burthmeere.]
 the Bure, whereof the said lake is called Bursemere, or the Burthmere
 poole. In like sort the Bure or Burthmere water, rising among the hils
 goeth to Tegburthesworth, Forneside, S. Iohns, and Threlcote: and there
 [Sidenote: Grise.]
 meeting with a water from Grisdale, by Wakethwate, called Grise, it
 runneth to Burnesse, Keswijc, and there receiueth the Darwent. From
 Keswijc in like sort it goeth to Thorneswate (and there making a plash)
 to Armanswate, Isell, Huthwate and Cokermouth, and here it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Cokar.]
 Cokar, which rising among the hils commeth by Lowsewater, Brakenthwate,
 Lorton, and so to Cokarmouth towne, from whence it hasteth to Bridgeham,
 and receiuing a rill called the Wire, on the south side that runneth by
 Dein, it leaueth Samburne and Wirketon behind it, and entereth into the
 sea.

 [Sidenote: Wire.]
 Leland saith that the Wire is a creeke where ships lie off at rode, and
 that Wirketon or Wirkington towne dooth take his name thereof. He addeth
 also that there is iron and coles, beside lead ore in Wiredale.
 Neuerthelesse the water of this riuer is for the most part sore
 troubled, as comming thorough a suddie or soddie more, so that little
 [Sidenote: Elmus.]
 good fish is said to liue therein. But to proceed. The Elme riseth in
 the mines aboue Amautree, and from Amautre goeth to Yeresbie, Harbie,
 Brow, and there taking in a rill on the left hand comming by Torpennie,
 it goeth to Hatton castell, Alwarbie, Birthie, Dereham, and so into the
 sea. Thence we go about by the chappell at the point, and come to a baie
 serued with two fresh waters, whereof one rising westward goeth by
 Warton, Rabbie, Cotes, and so into the maine, taking in a rill withall
 [Sidenote: Croco.]
 from by south, called Croco, that commeth from Crockdale, by Bromefield.
 [Sidenote: Vamus.]
 The second is named Wampoole broocke, & this riseth of two heads,
 whereof one is about Cardew. Thence in like sort it goeth to Thuresbie,
 Croston, Owton, Gamlesbie, Wampall, the Larth, and betweene Whiteridge
 and Kirbie into the saltwater. From hence we double the Bowlnesse, and
 come to an estuarie, whither three notable riuers doo resort, and this
 is named the Solueie mouth. But of all, the first exceedeth, which is
 called Eden, and whose description dooth follow here at hand.

 [Sidenote: Eden.]
 The Eden well fraught with samon, descendeth (as I heare) from the hils
 in Athelstane moore at the foot of Hussiat Moruell hil, where Swale also
 riseth, and southeast of Mallerstang forrest. From thence in like maner
 it goeth to Mallerstang towne, Pendragon castell, Wharton hall, Netbie,
 Hartleie castell, Kirkebie Stephan, and yer it come at great Musgrane,
 [Sidenote: Helbecke.]
 it receiueth three waters, whereof one is called Helbecke, bicause it
 commeth from the Derne and Elinge mounteins by a towne of the same
 [Sidenote: Bellow.]
 denomination. The other is named Bellow, and descendeth from the east
 mounteins by Sowarsbie, & these two on the northeast: the third falleth
 from Rauenstandale, by Newbiggin, Smardale, Soulbie, Blaterne, and so
 [Sidenote: Orne.]
 into Eden, that goeth from thence by Warcop; and taking in the Orne
 [Sidenote: Moreton.]
 about Burelles on the one side, and the Morton becke on the other, it
 [Sidenote: Dribecke.]
 hasteth to Applebie, thence to Cowlbie, where it crosseth the Dribecke,
 [Sidenote: Trowt becke.]
 [Sidenote: Liuenet.]
 thence to Bolton, and Kirbie, and there meeting with the Trowt becke,
 and beneath the same with the Liuenet (whereinto falleth an other water
 from Thurenlie meeting withall beneath Clebron) it runneth finallie into
 Eden. After the confluences also the Eden passeth to Temple, and soone
 [Sidenote: Milburne.]
 [Sidenote: Blincorne.]
 after meeting with the Milburne and Blincorne waters, in one chanell, it
 runneth to Winderwarth and Hornebie, where we will staie till I haue
 described the water that meeteth withall neere the aforesaid place
 [Sidenote: Vlse.]
 called the Vlse.

 This water commeth out of a lake, which is fed with six rils, whereof
 [Sidenote: Marke.]
 one is called the Marke, and neere the fall thereof into the plash is a
 [Sidenote: Harteshop.]
 towne of the same name; the second hight Harteshop, & runneth from
 [Sidenote: Paterdale.]
 Harteshop hall by Depedale; the third is Paterdale rill; the fourth
 [Sidenote: Roden.]
 [Sidenote: Glenkguin.]
 Glent Roden, the fift Glenkguin, but the sixt runneth into the said
 lake, south of Towthwate. Afterward when this lake commeth toward Pole
 towne, it runneth into a small chanell, & going by Barton, Dalumaine, it
 taketh in a rill by the waie from Daker castell. Thence it goeth to
 Stockebridge, Yoneworth, and soone after meeteth with a pretie brooke
 [Sidenote: Loder.]
 called Loder, comming from Thornethwate by Bauton, and heere a rill;
 then by Helton, and there another; thence to Askham, Clifton, and so
 ioining with the other called Vlse, they go to Brougham castell, Nine
 churches, Hornebie, and so into Eden, taking in a rill (as it goeth)
 that commeth downe from Pencath. Being past Hornebie, our Eden runneth
 to Langunbie, and soone after receiuing a rill that commeth from two
 heads, and ioining beneath Wingsell, it hasteth to Lasenbie, then to
 Kirke Oswald (on ech side whereof commeth in a rill from by east) thence
 to Nonneie, and there a rill, Anstable, Cotehill, Corbie castell,
 Wetherall, Newbie: where I will staie, till I haue described the Irding,
 and such waters as fall into the same before I go to Carleill.

 [Sidenote: Irding.]
 The Irding ariseth in a moore in the borders of Tindale, neere vnto
 [Sidenote: Terne.]
 Horsse head crag, where it is called Terne becke; vntill it come to
 Spicrag hill, that diuideth Northumberland and Gillesland in sunder,
 from whence it is named Irding. Being therfore come to Ouerhall, it
 [Sidenote: Pultrose.]
 receiueth the Pultrose becke, by east, and thence goeth on to
 Ouerdenton, Netherdenton, Leuercost, and Castelstead, where it taketh in
 [Sidenote: Cambocke.]
 the Cambocke, that runneth by Kirke Cambocke, Askerton castell, Walton,
 and so into Irding, which goeth from thence to Irdington, Newbie, & so
 into Eden. But a little before it come there, it crosseth with the
 [Sidenote: Gillie.]
 Gillie that commeth by Tankin, and soone after falleth into it. After
 these confluences, our Eden goeth to Linstocke castell, (and here it
 interteineth a brooke, comming from Cotehill ward by Aglionbie) and then
 vnto Carleill, which is now almost inuironed with foure waters.

 [Sidenote: Pedar alias Logus.]
 For beside the Eden it receiueth the Peder, which Leland calleth Logus
 from southeast. This Peder riseth in the hils southwest of Penruddocke,
 from whence it goeth to Penruddocke, then to Grastocke castell,
 Cateleie, and Kenderside hall, and then taking in a water from Vnthanke,
 it goeth to Cathwade, Pettrelwaie, Newbiggin, Carleton, and so into
 [Sidenote: Bruferth.]
 Eden, northeast of Carleill. But on the north side the Bruferth brooke
 dooth swiftlie make his entrance, running by Leuerdale, Scalbie castell,
 and Housedon; as I am informed. The third is named Candan (if not Deua
 after Leland) which rising about the Skidlow hils, runneth to Mosedale,
 Caldbecke, Warnell, Saberham, Rose castell, Dawston, Brounston,
 Harrington, and west of Carleill falleth into Eden, which going from
 thence by Grimsdale, Kirke Andros, Beaumont, falleth into the sea
 beneath the Rowcliffe castell. And thus much of the Eden, which Leland
 neuerthelesse describeth after another sort, whose words I will not let
 to set downe here in this place, as I find them in his commentaries.

 [Sidenote: Vlse after Leland.]
 The Eden, after it hath run a pretie space from his head, meeteth in
 time with the Vlse water, which is a great brooke in Westmerland, and
 [Sidenote: Loder.]
 rising aboue Maredale, a mile west of Loder, it commeth by the late
 dissolued house of Shappe priorie, three miles from Shappe, and by
 Brampton village into Loder or Lodon. Certes this streame within halfe a
 mile of the head, becommeth a great lake for two miles course, and
 afterward waxing narrow againe, it runneth foorth in a meane and
 [Sidenote: Aimote.]
 indifferent bottome. The said Eden in like sort receiueth the Aimote
 about three miles beneath Brougham castell, and into the same Aimote
 [Sidenote: Dacor.]
 falleth Dacor becke (alreadie touched) which riseth by northwest in
 Materdale hils, foure miles aboue Dacor castell, and then going through
 Dacor parke, it runneth by east a good mile lower into Eimote, a little
 beneath Delamaine, which standeth on the left side of Dacor. In one of
 his bookes also he saith, how Carleill standeth betweene two streames,
 [Sidenote: Deua.]
 that is to saie the Deua, which commeth thither from by southwest, and
 also the Logus that descendeth from the southeast. He addeth moreouer
 [Sidenote: Vala.]
 how the Deua in times past was named Vala or Bala, and that of the names
 of these two, Lugibala for Caerleill hath beene deriued, &c. And thus
 much out of Leland. But where he had the cause of this his coniecture as
 yet I haue not read. Of this am I certeine, that I vse the names of most
 riuers here and else-where described, accordinglie as they are called in
 my time, although I omit not to speake here and there of such as are
 more ancient, where iust occasion mooueth me to remember them, for the
 better vnderstanding of our histories, as they doo come to hand.

 [Sidenote: Leuen.]
 Blacke Leuen and white Leuen waters, fall into the sea in one chanell,
 [Sidenote: Lamford.]
 [Sidenote: Eske.]
 and with them the Lamford and the Eske, the last confluence being not a
 full mile from the maine sea. The white and blacke Leuen ioining
 [Sidenote: Tomunt.]
 therfore aboue Bucknesse, the confluence goeth to Bracken hill,
 Kirkleuenton, and at Tomunt water meeteth with the Eske. In like sort
 [Sidenote: Kirsop.]
 [Sidenote: Lidde.]
 the Kirsop ioining with the Lidde out of Scotland at Kirsop foot,
 running by Stangerdike side, Harlow, Hathwater, and taking in the Eske
 aboue the Mote, it looseth the former name, and is called Eske, vntill
 it come to the sea.

 Hauing thus gone thorough the riuers of England, now it resteth that we
 proceed with those which are to be found vpon the Scotish shore, in such
 order as we best may, vntill we haue fetched a compasse about the same,
 and come vnto Barwike, whence afterward it shall be easie for vs to make
 repaire vnto the Thames, from which we did set forward in the
 beginning of our voiage. The first riuer that I met withall on the
 [Sidenote: Eske.]
 Scotish coast, is the Eske, after I came past the Solueie, which hath
 his head in the Cheuiot hilles, runneth by Kirkinton, and falleth into
 the sea at Borow on the sands. This Eske hauing receiued the Ewis
 falleth into the Solueie first at Atterith. After this I passed ouer a
 little creeke from Kirthell, and so to Anand, whereof the vallie
 Anandale dooth seeme to take the name. There is also the Nide, whereof
 commeth Nidsdale, the Ken, the Dee, the Crale, and the Bladnecke, and
 all these (besides diuerse other small rilles of lesse name) doo lie
 vpon the south of Gallowaie.

 On the north side also we haue the Ruan, the Arde, the Cassile Dune, the
 Burwin, the Cluide (wherevpon sometime stood the famous citie of
 Alcluide, and whereinto runneth the Carath) the Hamell, the Dourglesse,
 and the Lame. From hence in like maner we came vnto the Leuind mouth,
 wherevnto the Blake on the southwest and the Lomund Lake, with his
 fleeting Iles and fish without finnes (yet verie holesome) dooth seeme
 to make his issue. This lake of Lomund in calme weather ariseth
 sometimes so high, and swelleth with such terrible billowes, that it
 causeth the best marriners of Scotland to abide the leisure of this
 water, before they dare aduenture to hoise vp sailes on hie. The like is
 seene in windie weather, but much more perillous. There are certeine
 Iles also in the same, which mooue and remooue, oftentimes by force of
 the water, but one of them especiallie, which otherwise is verie
 fruitfull for pasturage of cattell.

 [Sidenote: Leue. Long.]

 [Sidenote: Faro. Nesse.]
 Next vnto this is the Leue, the Rage, the Long, the Goile, & the Heke,
 which for the exceeding greatnesse of their heads, are called lakes.
 Then haue we the Robinseie, the Foreland, the Tarbat, the Lean, and the
 Abir, wherevnto the Spanseie, the Loine, the Louth, the Arke, and the
 Zefe doo fall, there is also the Sell, the Zord, the Owin, the Newisse,
 the Orne, the Lang, the Drun, the Hew, the Brun, the Kell, the Dowr, the
 Faro, the Nesse, the Herre, the Con, the Glasse, the Maur, the Vrdall,
 the Fers (that commeth out of the Caldell) the Fairsoke, which two latter
 lie a little by west of the Orchades, and are properlie called riuers,
 bicause they issue onelie from springs; but most of the other lakes,
 bicause they come from linnes and huge pooles, or such low bottomes,

 [Sidenote: Spaie. Downe.]
 [Sidenote: Dee. Eske.]
 fed with springs, as seeme to haue no accesse, but onelie recesse of
 waters, whereof there be manie in Scotland.

 But to proceed. Hauing once past Dungisbie head in Cathnesse, we shall
 yer long come to the mouth of the Wifle, a prettie streame, comming by
 south of the mounteins called the Maidens pappes. Then to the Browre,
 the Clin, the Twin (whereinto runneth three riuers, the Shin, the
 Sillan, and Carew) the Nesse, which beside the plentie of samon found
 therein is neuer frosen, nor suffereth yee to remaine there, that is
 cast into the poole. From thence we come vnto the Narding, the Finderne,
 the Spaie (which receiues the Vine) the Fitch, the Bulich, the Arrian,
 the Leuin, and the Bogh, from whence we saile vntill we come about the
 Buquhan head, and so to the Downe, and Dee: which two streames bring
 forth the greatest samons that are to be had in Scotland, and most
 plentie of the same. Then to the north Eske, whereinto the Esmond
 runneth aboue Brechin, the south Eske, then the Louen and the Taw, which
 is the finest riuer for water that is in all Scotland, and wherevnto
 most riuers and lakes doo run. As Farlake, Yrth, Goure, Loich, Cannach,
 Linell, Loion, Irewer, Erne, and diuerse other besides small rillets
 which I did neuer looke vpon.

 Then is there the lake Londors, vpon whose mouth saint Andrewes dooth
 stand, the lake Lewin vnto whose streame two other lakes haue recourse
 in Fifland, and then the Firth or Fortha, which some doo call the
 Pictish and Scotish sea, whither the kingdome of the Northumbers was
 sometime extended, and with the riuer last mentioned (I meane that
 commeth from Londors) includeth all Fife, the said Fortha being full of
 oisters and all kinds of huge fish that vse to lie in the deepe. How
 manie waters run into the Firth, called by Ptolomie Lora, it is not in
 my power iustlie to declare: yet are there both riuers, rills, & lakes
 [Sidenote: Clacke. Alon.]
 [Sidenote: Dune. Kerie.]
 [Sidenote: Cambell.]
 [Sidenote: Cumer. Tere.]
 [Sidenote: Man.]
 [Sidenote: Torkesan.]
 [Sidenote: Rosham.]
 [Sidenote: Mushell. Blene.]
 [Sidenote: Twede.]
 that fall into the same, as Clacke, Alon, Dune, Kerie, Cambell, Cumer,
 Tere, Man, Torkeson, Rosham, Mushell, Blene, and diuerse other which I
 call by these names, partlie after information, and partlie of such
 townes as are neere vnto their heads. Finallie, when we are past the
 Haie, then are we come vnto the Twede, whereinto we entred, leauing
 Barwike on the right hand and his appurtenances, wherein Halidon hill
 standeth, and conteineth a triangle of so much ground beyond the said
 riuer, as is well neere foure miles in length, and three miles in bredth
 in the broad end: except mine information doo faile me.

 The Twede (which Ptolomie nameth Toualsis or Toesis, & betweene which
 and the Tine the countie of Northumberland is in maner inclosed, and
 watred with sundrie noble riuers) is a noble streame and the limes or
 bound betweene England & Scotland, wherby those two kingdomes are now
 diuided in sunder. It riseth about Drimlar in Eusbale (or rather out of
 a faire well (as Leland saith) standing in the mosse of an hill called
 Airstane, or Harestan in Twede dale ten miles from Pibble) and so
 comming by Pibble, Lander, Dribiwgh, Lelse, Warke, Norham and
 Hagarstone, it falleth into the sea beneath Barwike, as I heare. Thus
 saith Leland. But I not contented with this so short a discourse of so
 long a riuer & briefe description of so faire a streame, will ad
 somewhat more of the same concerning his race on the English side, and
 rehearsall of such riuers as fall into it. Comming therefore to Ridam,
 it receiueth betweene that and Carham a becke, which descendeth from the
 hilles that lie by west of Windram. Going also from Ridam by
 Longbridgham (on the Scotish side) and to Carham, it hasteth immediatlie
 to Warke castell on the English, and by Spilaw on the other side, then
 to Cornewall, Cald streame, and Tilmouth, where it receiueth sundrie
 waters in one botome which is called the Till, and whose description
 insueth here at hand.

 [Sidenote: Till.]
 Certes there is no head of anie riuer that is named Till, but the issue
 of the furthest water that commeth hereinto, riseth not farre from the
 head of Vswaie in the Cheuiot hilles, where it is called Brennich,
 whereof the kingdome of Brennicia did sometime take the name. From
 thence it goeth to Hartside, Ingram, Branton, Crawleie, Hedgeleie,
 Beueleie, and Bewijc, beneath which it receiueth one water comming from
 Rodham by west, and soone after a second descending from the Middletons,
 [Sidenote: Bromis.]
 and so they go as one with the Bromish, by Chatton to Fowbreie (where
 they crosse the third water falling downe by north from Howborne by
 Heselbridge) thence to Woller, there also taking in a rill that riseth
 about Middleton hall, and runneth by Hardleie, Whereleie, and the rest
 afore remembred, wherby the water of Bromis is not a little increased,
 and after this latter confluence beneath Woller, no more called Bromis
 but the Till, vntill it come at the Twede. The Till passing therefore by
 Weteland and Dedington, meeteth soone after with a faire streame comming
 [Sidenote: Bowbent.]
 from by southwest, which most men call the Bowbent or Bobent.

 It riseth on the west side of the Cocklaw hill, and from thence hasteth
 to Hattons, beneath the which it ioineth from by southeast with the
 Hellerborne, and then goeth to Pudston, Downeham, Kilham, and a little
 by north of Newton Kirke, and betweene it and west Newton, it taketh in
 another water called Glin, comming from the Cheuiot hilles by Heth
 poole, and from thenseforth runneth on without anie further increase, by
 Copland Euart, and so in the Till. The Till for his part in like sort
 after this confluence goeth to Broneridge, Fodcastell, Eatall castell,
 Heaton, & north of Tilmouth into the Twede, or by west of Wesell, except
 my memorie dooth faile me. After this also our aforesaid water of Twede
 descendeth to Grotehugh, the Newbiggins, Norham castell, Foord,
 [Sidenote: Whitaker.]
 Lungridge, & crossing the Whitaker on the other side from Scotland
 beneath Cawmill, it runneth to Ordo, to Barwike, and so into the Ocean,
 leauing (as I said) so much English ground on the northwest ripe, as
 lieth in manner of a triangle betweene Cawmils, Barwike, and Lammeton,
 which (as one noteth) is no more but two miles and an halfe euerie waie,
 or not much more; except he be deceiued.

 Being past this noble streame, we came by a rill that descendeth from
 Bowsden by Barington. Then by the second which ariseth betweene
 Middleton and Detcham or Dereham, and runneth by Eskill and the Rosse,
 next of all to Warnemouth, of whose backe water I read as followeth. The
 [Sidenote: Warne.]
 Warne or Gwerne riseth southwest of Crokelaw, and going by Warneford,
 Bradford, Spindlestone, and Budill, it leaueth Newton on the right hand,
 and so falleth into the Ocean, after it hath run almost nine miles from
 the head within the land, and receiued a rill beneath Yessington, which
 commeth downe betweene Newland and Olchester, and hath a bridge beneath
 the confluence, which leadeth ouer the same. From Warnemouth we sailed
 by Bamborow castell, and came at last to a fall betweene Bedwell and
 Newton. The maine water that serueth this issue, riseth aboue Carleton
 from the foot of an hill, which seemeth to part the head of this and
 that of Warne in sunder. It runneth also by Carleton, Tonleie, Doxford,
 Brunton, and Tuggell, and finallie into the sea, as to his course
 apperteineth.

 [Sidenote: Aile, or Alne,
 alias Chalne.]
 From this water we went by Dunstanbugh castell, vnto the Chalne or
 Alnemouth, which is serued with a pretie riueret called Alne, the head
 whereof riseth in the hils west of Alnham towne, and called by Ptolomie,
 Celnius. From thense also it runneth by Rile, Kile, Eslington, and
 Whittingham, where it crosseth a rill comming from by south, and beneath
 the same, the second that descendeth from Eirchild at Brone, & likewise
 the third that riseth at Newton, and runneth by Edlingham castell and
 Lemmaton (all on the southeast side or right hand) and so passeth on
 further, till it meet with the fourth, comming from aboue Shipleie from
 by north, after which confluence it goeth to Alnewijc, & then to
 Dennijc, receiuing there a rillet from by south and a rill from by
 north, and thence going on to Bilton, betweene Ailmouth towne and
 Wooddon, it sweepeth into the Ocean.

 [Sidenote: Cocket.]
 The Cocket is a goodlie riuer, the head also thereof is in the roots of
 Kemblespeth hils, from whence it goeth to Whiteside, and there meeting
 [Sidenote: Vswaie.]
 with the Vswaie (which descendeth from the north) it goeth a little
 [Sidenote: Ridleie.]
 further to Linbridge, and there receiueth the Ridleie by southwest, and
 after that with another, called (as I thinke) the Hoc, which commeth
 from the Woodland and hillie soile by Allington, & falleth into the
 same, west of Parke head. It ioineth also yer long with the Ridland,
 which commeth in north by Bilstone, and then hieth to Sharpton, to
 [Sidenote: Yardop.]
 Harbotle, where it crosseth the Yardop water by south, then to
 Woodhouse, and swallowing in a little becke by the waie from southwest,
 to Bickerton, to Tossons, Newton, and running apace toward Whitton
 towre, it taketh a brooke withall that commeth in northwest of Alnham,
 neere Elihaw, and goeth by Skarnewood, ouer nether Trewhet, Snitter, and
 Throxton, and soone after vniteth it selfe with the Cocket, from whence
 [Sidenote: It may be Leland mistaketh
 Tickington water for one of these.]
 they go together to Rethburie, or Whitton towre, to Halie, to
 Brinkehorne, Welden, taking withall soone after the Tod or burne called
 Tod, which falleth in from by south, then to Elihaw, Felton (receiuing
 thereabout the Fareslie brooke, that goeth by Wintring by south east,
 and Sheldike water, that goeth by Hason, to Brainsaugh by north) and
 from thence to Morricke, Warkworth castell, and so into the sea.

 There is furthermore a little fall, betweene Hawkeslaw and Drurith,
 which riseth about Stokes wood, goeth by east Cheuington, and
 [Sidenote: Lune.]
 Whittington castell, and afterward into the Ocean. The Lune is a pretie
 brooke rising west of Espleie, from whence it goeth to Tritlington,
 [Sidenote: Wansbecke.]
 Vgham, Linton, and yer long in the sea. Wansbecke (in old time Diua) is
 far greater than the Lune. It issueth vp west and by north of west
 Whelpington, thence it runneth to Kirke Whelpington, Wallington,
 Middleton, and Angerton. Heere it meeteth with a water running from
 about Farnelaw by the grange, and Hartburne on the north, and then going
 from Angerton, it runneth by Moseden to Mitforth, and there in like
 [Sidenote: Font.]
 maner crosseth the Font, which issuing out of the ground about
 Newbiggin, goeth by Nonneie Kirke, Witton castell, Stanton, Nunriding,
 Newton, and so into the Wansbecke, which runneth in like maner from
 Mitford to Morpheth castell (within two miles whereof it ebbeth and
 floweth) the new Chappell, Bottle castell, Shepwash, and so into the
 sea, three miles from the next hauen which is called Blithe.

 [Sidenote: Blithe.]
 Blithe water riseth about kirke Heaton, and goeth by Belfe, Ogle, and
 (receiuing the Port alias the Brocket, that springeth east of S.
 Oswolds) passeth by Portgate, Whittington, Fennike hall, Madfennes,
 Hawkewell, the Grange, & Dissingtons. After it hath taken in the Pont
 [Sidenote: Hartleie.]
 from the east (whose head is not farre from that of Hartleie streame)
 and is past Barwijc on the hill, it runneth by Harford, Bedlington,
 Cowpon, and at Blithes nuke, into the deepe Ocean. Hartleie streamelet
 riseth in Weeteslade parioch, goeth by Haliwell, and at Hartleie towne
 yeeldeth to the sea.

 The Tine or Tinna, a riuer notablie stored with samon, and other good
 fish, and in old time called Alan, riseth of two heads, whereof that
 [Sidenote: North Tine.]
 called north Tine, is the first that followeth to be described. It
 springeth vp aboue Belkirke in the hils, & thence goeth to Butterhawgh
 [Sidenote: Shele.]
 (where it receiueth a confluence of Kirsop and the Shele) thence to
 Cragsheles, Leapelish (receiuing on the south a rill out of Tindale)
 then to Shilburne, against which it taketh in a becke that commeth out
 of Tindale called Shill, also two other on the same side, betweene Yarro
 and Fawston hall, and the third at Thorneburne, and so goeth on to
 Grenested, and there carrieth withall a fall, from by north also made by
 the confluence of one rill comming by Thecam, and another that passeth
 by Holinhead, and likewise another on the south comming from Tindale, by
 Chuden, Dalacastell, and Brokes: after which our north Tine goeth by
 Hellaside, to Billingham, and at Rhedes mouth meeteth with the Ridde, a
 verie prettie water, whose description is giuen me after this maner.

 [Sidenote: Ridde.]
 The Ridde therefore riseth within three miles of the Scotish march, as
 Leland saith, & commeth through Riddesdale, wherevnto it giueth the
 name. Another writeth how it riseth in the roots of the Carter, and
 Redsquibe hilles, and yer it hath gone farre from the head, beside a few
 [Sidenote: Shelhop.]
 little rilles it taketh in the Spelhop or Petop from the north and the
 [Sidenote: Cheslop.]
 Cheslop on the south, beside sundrie other wild rils nameless and
 obscure, as one on the north side next vnto the Petop or Spelhop;
 another by south out of Riddesdale, the third west of Burdop, the fourth
 runneth by Wullaw to Rochester, then two from southwest, another from by
 north which goeth by Durtburne, and is called Durt or Durth, then the
 Smalburne from the west. Next to the same is the Otter or Otterburne on
 the north side also the Ouereie, and finallie the last which descendeth
 from Ellesdon hilles, by Munkrige and ioineth with our Ridde, northwest
 of Nudhowgh, after which the said Ridde goeth by Woodburne, Risingham,
 Leame, and so into the Tine, a mile lower than Belingham or Bilingham,
 which standeth somewhat aloofe from north Tine and is (as I take it) ten
 miles at the least aboue the towne of Hexham. After this confluence it
 [Sidenote: 3. Burnes.]
 [Sidenote: Shitlington.]
 passeth to Leehall, to Carehouse (crossing Shitlington becke by west
 which also receiueth the Yare on the south side of Shitlington) another
 also beneath this on the same side, made by the confluence of
 Workesburne, and Middleburne, at Roseburne, beside the third called
 Morleis or Morelee aboue, and Simons burne beneath Shepechase, and
 likewise the Swine from by north that runneth by Swinburne castell, next
 of all the Riall from the northeast, which commeth by Erington, & so
 holding his course directlie southwards, it goeth by S. Oswolds through
 the Pictishwall, to Wall, and so into south Tine, beneath Accam, and
 northwest (as I doo weene) of Hexham.

 [Sidenote: Tine. S.]
 The south Tine ariseth in the Cheuiot hils, and yer it hath gone farre
 [Sidenote: Esgill.]
 from the head, it meeteth with Esgill on the east, and another rill on
 the west, and so going by the houses toward Awsten moore, it ioineth
 [Sidenote: Vent.]
 with Schud from by west, and soone after with the Vent from by east
 aboue Lowbier. From Lowbier it goeth to Whitehalton, to Kirke Haugh
 [Sidenote: Gilders beck.]
 (crossing the Gilders becke on the one side, and the Alne on the other)
 to Thornehope, where it is inlarged with a water on each side, to
 [Sidenote: Knare.]
 Williamstone, and almost at Knaresdale, taketh in the Knare, and then
 runneth withall to Fetherstone angle. At Fetherstone angle likewise it
 meeteth with Hartleie water, by southwest comming from Sibins or
 Sibbenes, another a little beneath from southeast, and thence when it
 commeth to Billester castell, it carieth another withall from by west,
 Thirlewall called Rippall which riseth in the forrest of Lowes, and
 goeth by the Waltowne, Blinkinsop, & Widon, and after which confluence
 it taketh in another from by north rising west of Swinsheld, which goeth
 by Grenelegh to Haltwestell: thence going by Vnthanke, it crosseth
 another rill from by south, descending from the hilles that lie north of
 Todlewood, and then proceeding vnto Wilmotteswijc, it admitteth the
 Wilmots becke from the south, and another running by Bradleie hall on
 the north side of Beltingham; after which it meeteth with the Alen a
 proper water, and described after this maner.

 [Sidenote: East Alen.]
 The Alen or Alon hath two heads, whereof one is called east Alen, the
 other west Alen. The first of them riseth southeast of Sibton Sheles, &
 going by Sundorp, it taketh in a rill withall from by est; after which
 confluence it runneth to Newshele, Allington, Caddon, Old towne, & in
 [Sidenote: West Alen.]
 the course to Stauertpele, meeteth with the west Alen. The west Alen
 riseth in Killop low hilles aboue Wheteleie sheles, from whence it goeth
 to Spartwell, Hawcopole, Owston, and taking in a rill thereabouts, it
 proceedeth on to Permandbie, and crossing there another rill in like
 maner from by west, it goeth by Whitefield, and ioining soone after with
 the est Alen, they run as one to Stauert poole, Plankford, and so into
 the Tine betweene Beltingham and Lees, from whence the Tine runneth on
 by Lees Haddon, Woodhall, Owmers, Whernebie, Costleie, & so by Warden,
 till it crosse the north Tine, and come to Hexham, from whence it goeth
 to Dilstan, crossing two waters by the waie, whereof one commeth from by
 south, and is called the Wolsh, which holdeth his course by Stelehall,
 and Newbiggin receiueth another comming from Grimbridge: the other
 called Dill somewhat lower descending from Hedleie, and running by
 Rising, till it fall into the south side of our streame from Dilstan, it
 goeth to Bywell castell, ouer against which it receiueth a rill that
 runneth by Hindleie, thence it hasteth to Eltingham, Pruddo, Willam,
 (and there it meeteth with another becke) then to Reton, Blaidon, and
 [Sidenote: Darwent.]
 next of all ioineth with the Darwent, from by south.

 This riuer riseth aboue Knewdon, and Rudlamhope in Northumberland, from
 two heads: the northerlie being called Dere, and the southerlie the
 Guent: and ioining so well yer long in chanell as in name, they runne on
 to Humsterworth, new Biggin, Blankeland, Acton, Aspersheles,
 Blackheadlie, Brentfield side, Pansheles, Ebchester, and there taking in
 a water from Hedleie in Northumberland, neere to Blacke hall in the
 bishoprike, it goeth on to Spen, Hollinside, Wickham, Swalwell, and so
 into Tine, which passeth from thence by Elswijc, and meeting with
 another water comming from Shildraw, by Rauensworth castell to Redhugh,
 it goeth on to Newcastell, Fellin, Netherheworth, Walker, Waswon,
 Hedburne, and next to Jerro or Girwie, where Beda dwelled in an abbeie;
 now a gentlemans place (although the church be made a parish church,
 wherevnto diuerse townes resort, as moonke Eaton where Beda was borne,
 which is a mile from thence, Southsheles, Harton, Westhow, Hebburne,
 Hedworth, Wardleie, Fellin, Follinsbie, the Heworthes) and from thence
 to the south and Northsheles, and so into the sea, fiue miles by
 northwest of Weremouth, and (as I gesse) somewhat more.

 Beneath the confluence in like sort of both the Tines, standeth
 Corbridge, a towne sometime inhabited by the Romans, and about twelue
 miles from Newcastell, and hereby dooth the Corue run, that meeteth yer
 long with the Tine. Not farre off also is a place called Colchester,
 wherby Leland gesseth that the name of the brooke should rather be Cole
 [Sidenote: Corue.]
 than Corue, and in my iudgement his coniecture is verie likelie; for in
 the life of S. Oswijn (otherwise a feeble authoritie) the word Colbridge
 is alwaies vsed for Corbridge, whereof I thought good to leaue this
 short aduertisement. In this countrie also are the three vales or dales,
 whereof men haue doubted whether theeues or true men doo most abound in
 them, that is to saie, Riddesdale, Tuidale, and Liddesdale: this last
 being for the most part Scotish, and without the marches of England.
 Neuerthelesse, sithens that by the diligence cheefelie of maister
 Gilpin, and finallie of other learned preachers, the grace of God
 working with them, they haue beene called to some obedience and zeale
 vnto the word, it is found that they haue so well profited by the same,
 that at this present their former sauage demeanour is verie much abated,
 and their barbarous wildnesse and fiercenesse so qualified, that there
 is great hope left of their reduction vnto ciuilitie, and better order
 of behauiour than hitherto they haue beene acquainted withall. But to
 proceed with the rest.

 [Sidenote: Were.]
 Ptolomie, writing of the Were, calleth it Vedra, a riuer well knowne
 vnto Beda the famous preest, who was brought vp in a monasterie that
 stood vpon the bankes thereof. It riseth of three heads in Kelloppeslaw
 [Sidenote: Burdop.]
 hill, whereof the most southerlie is called Burdop, the middlemost
 [Sidenote: Wallop.]
 [Sidenote: Kellop.]
 Wallop, and the northerliest Kellop, which vniting themselues about S.
 Iohns chappell, or a little by west thereof, their confluence runneth
 through Stanhope parke, by east Yare, and so to Frosterleie. But yer it
 come there, it receiueth three rilles from the north in Weredale,
 whereof one commeth in by Stanhope, another west of Woodcroft hall, and
 the third at Frosterleie afore mentioned. And a little beneath these, I
 find yet a fourth on the south side, which descendeth from southwest by
 Bolliop, Bishopsleie, Milhouses, and Landew, as I haue beene informed.
 Being therefore vnited all with the Were, this streame goeth on to
 [Sidenote: Wascrop.]
 Walsingham, there taking in the Wascropburne, beside another at
 Bradleie, the third at Harpleie hall (and these on the north side) and
 [Sidenote: Bedburne.]
 the fourth betweene Witton and Witton castell called Bedburne, comming
 by Hamsterleie, whereby this riuer dooth now wax verie great. Going
 therefore from hence, it hasteth to Bishops Akeland, and beneath it
 receiueth the Garondlesse, which (as Leland saith) riseth six miles by
 west of Akeland castell, and running south thereof, passeth by west
 Akeland, S. Helens Akeland, S. Andrewes Akeland, and bishops Akeland,
 and then into the Were which goeth to Newfield, and Willington. Neere
 vnto this place also and somewhat beneath Sunderland, the Were, crosseth
 one brooke from southest by Het, Croxseie, Cronefurth, Tursdale, and
 Cordale, and two other from by northwest in one botome, whereof the
 first commeth from aboue Ash by Langleie: the other called Coue, from
 aboue Kinchleie by Newbiggin, Lanchester, north Langlie, and through
 Beare parke, & so meeting beneath Kelleie or Hedleie with the other,
 they fall both as one into the Were, betweene south Sunderland and
 Burnall. From hence our riuer goeth on to Howghwell, Shirkeleie, old
 [Sidenote: Pidding brooke.]
 Duresme (and there taking in the Pidding brooke by northeast) it goeth
 to Duresme, Finkeleie, Harbarhouse, Lumleie castell (where it meeteth
 [Sidenote: Pilis.]
 with the Pilis, whose heads are vnited betweene Pelton and Whitwell (and
 after called Hedleie) and from thence to Lampton, Harroton, the Bedikes,
 Vfferton, Hilton parke, Bishops Weremouth, and so into the sea, betweene
 north Sunderland and north Weremouth towne, which now is called moonke
 Weremouth of the monasterie sometime standing there, wherin Beda read &
 wrote manie of his bookes, as to the world appeareth. This mouth of Were
 is eight miles from Durham, and six from Newcastell. Being thus passed
 the Were, & entered into the Bishoprijc, yer we come at the mouth of the
 These, almost by two miles, ouer passing a rill that runneth by castell
 Eden, and Hardwijc, and likewise Hartlepoole towne, which lieth ouer
 into the sea in maner of a byland or peninsula, we meet with a prettie
 fall, which groweth by a riuer that is increased with two waters,
 whereof one riseth by northwest about Moretons, and goeth by Stotfeld
 and Claxton, the other at Dawlton, going by Breerton, Owtham, and
 Grettam, finallie ioining within two miles of the sea, they make a
 prettie portlet: but I know not of what securitie.

 [Sidenote: Thesis.]
 The These, a riuer that beareth and feedeth an excellent samon, riseth
 in the Blacke lowes, aboue two miles flat west of the southerlie head of
 Were called Burdop, and south of the head of west Alen, and thence
 runneth through Tildale forrest: and taking in the Langdon water from
 northwest it runneth to Durtpit chappell, to Newbiggin, and so to
 Middleton, receiuing by west of each of these a rill comming from by
 [Sidenote: Hude.]
 north (of which the last is called Hude) and likewise the Lune afterward
 by southwest that riseth at three seuerall places, whereof the first is
 in the borders of Westmerland and there called Arnegill becke, the
 [Sidenote: Lune.]
 second more southerlie, named Lunebecke, and the third by south at
 [Sidenote: Arnegill.]
 Bandor Skarth hill, and meeting all aboue Arnegill house, they run
 togither in one bottome to Lathekirke bridge, and then into the These.
 Hauing therefore met with these, it runneth to Mickelton (& there taking
 [Sidenote: Skirkewith.]
 in the Skirkwith water) it goeth to Rombald kirke (crossing there also
 [Sidenote: Bander.]
 one rill and the Bander brooke by south west) and then going to Morewood
 hag, and Morewood parke, till it come to Bernards castell.

 [Sidenote: Rere crosse.]
 Here also it receiueth the Thuresgill water, comming east of Rere crosse
 in Yorkeshire, from the spittle in Stanmore by Crag almost southwest,
 and being vnited with the These, it goeth by Stratford, Eglesdon,
 Rokesbie, Thorpe, Wickliffe, Ouington, Winston, and betweene Barfurth
 and Gainfurth meeteth with another rill, that commeth from Langleie
 forest, betweene Rabie castell and Standorpe, of whose name I haue no
 knowledge. But to proceed. The These being past Ramforth, runneth
 betweene Persore and Cliffe, and in the waie to Crofts bridge taketh in
 [Sidenote: Skerne.]
 the Skerne a pretie water, which riseth about Trimdon, and goeth by
 Fishburne, Bradburie, Preston, Braforton, Skirmingham, the Burdens,
 Haughton and Darlington, & there finallie meeting with the Cocke becke
 or Dare, it falleth in the These beneath Stapleton, before it come at
 Crofts bridge, and (as it should seeme) is the same which Leland calleth
 Gretteie or Grettie. From thence it runneth to Sockburne, nether
 Dunsleie, Middleton row, Newsham, Yarne (crossing a brooke from Leuen
 bridge) called Leuen or Leuinus in Latine, whose crinkling course is
 notable, and the streame of some called Thorpe, which I find described
 in this maner.

 [Sidenote: Thorpe alias Leuand.]
 The Thorpe riseth of sundrie heads, whereof one is aboue Pinching
 Thorpe, from whence it goeth to Nonnethorpe, and so to Stokesleie. The
 second hath two branches, and so placed, that Kildale standeth betweene
 them both: finallie, meeting beneath Easbie they go by Eaton, and
 likewise vnto Stokesleie. The last hath also two branches, whereof one
 commeth from Inglesbie, and meeteth with the second beneath Broughton; &
 going from thence to Stokesleie, they meet with the Thorpe aboue the
 towne, as the other fall into it somewhat beneath the same. From hence
 it goeth to Ridleie, and there taketh in another rill comming
 [Sidenote: Crawthorne.]
 from Potto, thence to Crawthorne brooke, Leuanton, Milton, Hilton,
 Inglesbie, and so into the These, betweene Yarne and Barwijc, whereof I
 made mention before. After this confluence our These hasteth on to
 Barwijc, Preston, Thorne abbeie, and Arsham, which standeth on the
 southeast side of the riuer almost betweene the falles of two waters,
 whereof one descendeth from west Hartburne by long Newton, Elton, &
 Stockton; the other from Stillington, or Shillington, by Whitton,
 Thorpe, Blackestone, Billingham, and Norton. From Arsham finallie it
 goeth to Bellasis, Middleburgh, and so into the sea. Leland describing
 this riuer speaketh of the Wiske, which should come thereinto from by
 south vnder Wiske bridge, by Danbie, and Northalarton, and should ioine
 with a greater streame: but as yet I find no certeine place where to
 bestow the same.

 Next of all we come vnto the high Cliffe water, which rising aboue
 Hutton, goeth by Gisborow, and there receiueth another streame comming
 from by southeast, and then continuing on his course, it is not long yer
 it fall into the sea. The next is the Scaling water, which descendeth
 from Scaling towne, from whence we come to the Molemouth, not farre from
 whose head standeth Molgraue castell: then to Sandford creeke, and next
 [Sidenote: Eske.]
 of all to Eske mouth, which riseth aboue Danbie wood, and so goeth to
 Castelton, there meeting by the waie with another rill comming from
 about Westerdale by Danbie, and so they go on togither by Armar and
 Thwate castell, till they ioine with another water aboue Glasdule
 chappell, thence to new Biggin, taking yet another brooke with them,
 [Sidenote: Ibur.]
 running from Goodland ward, and likewise the Ibur, and so go on without
 anie further increase by Busworth, yer long into the sea.

 There is also a creeke on each side of Robin Whoodes baie, of whose
 names and courses I haue no skill, sauing that Fillingale the towne
 dooth stand betweene them both. There is another not far from Scarborow,
 on the north side called the Harwood brooke. It runneth through Harwood
 dale by Cloughton, Buniston, and soone after meeting with another rill
 on the southwest, they run as one into the ocean sea. From Scarborow to
 Bridlington, by Flamborow head, we met with no more falles. This water
 therefore that we saw at Bridlington, riseth at Dugglebie, from whence
 it goeth to Kirbie, Helperthorpe, Butterwijc, Boithorpe, Foxhole, (where
 it falleth into the ground, and riseth vp againe at Rudston) Thorpe,
 Cathorpe, Bridlington, and so into the Ocean.

 Being come about the Spurne head, I meete yer long with a riuer that
 riseth short of Withersie, and goeth by Fodringham and Wisted, from
 thence to another that commeth by Rosse, Halsham, Carmingham: then to
 the third, which riseth aboue Humbleton, and goeth to Esterwijc, Heddon,
 and so into the Humber. The fourth springeth short of Sprotleie, goeth
 by Witton, and falleth into the water of Humber at Merflete, as I heare.

 [Sidenote: Hull.]
 The next of all is the Hull water, which I will describe also here, and
 then crosse ouer vnto the southerlie shore. The furthest head of Hull
 water riseth at Kilham, from whence it goeth to Lewthorpe creeke, and so
 to Fodringham, a little beneath which it meeteth with sundrie waters,
 whereof one falleth in on the northest side, comming from about Lisset;
 the second on the northwest banke from Nafferton; the third from
 Emmeswell and Kirkeburne: for it hath two heads which ioined beneth
 little Drifield, and the fourth which falleth into the same: so that
 these two latter run vnto the maine riuer both in one chanell, as
 experience hath confirmed. From hence then our Hull goeth to Ratseie, to
 Goodalehouse, and then taking in a water from Hornesie mere, it goeth on
 through Beuerleie medowes, by Warron, Stoneferrie, Hull, and finallie
 into the Humber. Of the rill that falleth into this water from south
 Netherwijc, by Skirlow, and the two rilles that come from Cottingham and
 Woluerton, I saie no more, sith it is enough to name them in their
 order.




 THE DESCRIPTION OF THE HUMBER OR ISIS, AND SUCH WATER-COURSES AS DOO
 INCREASE HIR CHANELL.

 CHAP. XV.


 [Sidenote: Humber.]
 There is no riuer called Humber from the hed. Wherfore that which we now
 call Humber, Ptolomie Abie, Leland Aber, as he gesseth, hath the same
 denomination no higher than the confluence of Trent with the Ouze, as
 beside Leland sundrie ancient writers haue noted before vs both. Certes
 it is a noble arme of the sea, and although it be properlie to be called
 Ouze or Ocellus euen to the Nuke beneath Ancolme, yet are we contented
 to call it Humber of Humbrus or Vmar, a king of the Scithians, who
 inuaded this Ile in the time of Locrinus, thinking to make himselfe
 monarch of the same. But as God hath from time to time singularlie
 prouided for the benefit of Britaine, so in this businesse it came to
 passe, that Humber was put to flight, his men slaine: and furthermore,
 whilest he attempted to saue himselfe by hasting to his ships (such was
 the prease of his nobilitie that followed him into his owne vessell, and
 the rage of weather which hastened on his fatall daie) that both he and
 they were drowned togither in that arme. And this is the onelie cause
 wherefore it hath beene called Humber, as our writers saie; and wherof I
 find these verses:

   Dum fugit obstat ei flumen submergitur illic,
     Deque suo tribuit nomine nomen aquae.

 This riuer in old time parted Lhoegres or England from Albania, which
 was the portion of Albanactus, the yongest sonne of Brute. But since
 that time the limits of Lhoegres haue beene so inlarged, first by the
 prowesse of the Romans, then by the conquests of the English, that at
 this present daie, the Twede on the one side, & the Solue on the other,
 be taken for the principall bounds betweene vs and those of Scotland. In
 describing therefore the Humber, I must needs begin with the Ouze, whose
 water bringeth foorth a verie sweet, fat and delicat samon, as I haue
 beene informed, beside sundrie other kinds of fish, which we want here
 on the south and southwest coasts & riuers of our land, whereof I may
 take occasion to speake more at large heerafter.

 [Sidenote: Vre alias Ouze, or Isis.]
 The Vre therfore riseth in the furthest parts of all Richmondshire,
 among the Coterine hilles, in a mosse, toward the west fourteene miles
 beyond Midleham. Being therefore issued out of the ground, it goeth to
 Holbecke, Hardraw, Hawshouse, Butterside, Askebridge (which Leland
 calleth the Askaran, and saith thereof and the Bainham, that they are
 but obscure bridges) then to Askarth, through Wanlesse parke, Wenseleie
 bridge (made two hundred yeares since, by Alwin, parson of Winslaw) New
 parke, Spennithorne, Danbie, Geruise abbeie, Clifton and Masham. When it
 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 is come to Masham, it receiueth the Burne, by south west (as it did the
 [Sidenote: Wile.]
 Wile, from verie deepe scarrie rockes, before at Askaran) and diuerse
 other wild rilles not worthie to be remembred. From Masham, it hasteth
 vnto Tanfield (taking in by the waie a rill by southwest) then to
 another Tanfield, to Newton hall, and Northbridge, at the hither end of
 Rippon, and so to Huickes bridge. But yer it come there it meeteth with
 [Sidenote: Skell.]
 the Skell, which being incorporat with the same, they run as one to
 Thorpe, then to Alborow, and soone after receiue the Swale.

 [Sidenote: Swale.]
 Here (saith Leland) I am brought into no little streict, what to
 coniecture of the meeting of Isis and Vre, for some saie that the Isis
 and the Vre doo meet at Borowbridge, which to me dooth seeme to be verie
 vnlikelie, sith Isurium taketh his denomination of Isis and Vro, for it
 is often seene that the lesse riuers doo mingle their names with the
 greater, as in the Thamesis and other is easie to be found. Neither is
 there any more mention of the Vre after his passage vnder Borowbridge,
 but onelie of Isis or the Ouze in these daies, although in old time it
 held vnto Yorke it selfe, which of the Vre is truelie called Vrewijc (or
 Yorke short) or else my persuasion dooth faile me. I haue red also
 Ewerwijc and Yorwijc. But to proceed, and leaue this superfluous
 discourse.

 From Borowbridge, the Ouze goeth to Aldborough, and (receiuing the Swale
 by the waie) to Aldworke, taking in Vsburne water, from the southwest,
 then to Linton vpon Ouze, to Newton vpon Ouze, and to Munketun, meeting
 with the Nid yer long, and so going withall to the Redhouses, to
 [Sidenote: Fosse.]
 Popleton, Clifton, Yorke (where it crosseth the Fosse) to Foulfoorth,
 Middlethorpe, Acaster, & Acaster, Kelfleet, Welehall, Barelebie, Selbie,
 Turmonhall, Skurthall, Hokelath, Hoke, Sandhall, Rednesse, Whitegift,
 Vslet, Blacketoft, Foxfleet, Brownfleet, and so into Humber.

 [Sidenote: Ouze.]
 The course of the Ouze being thus described, and as it were simplie
 without his influences, now will I touch such riuers as fall into the
 same also by themselues, contrarie to my former proceeding, imagining a
 voiage from the Rauenspurne, vntill I come neere to the head of These, &
 so southwards about againe by the bottome of the hillie soile vntill I
 get to Buxston, Sheffeld, Scrobie, & the verie south point of Humber
 mouth, whereby I shall crosse them all that are to be found in this
 walke, & leaue (I doubt) some especiall notice of their seuerall heads
 [Sidenote: Hull or Hulne.]
 and courses. The course of the Hull, a streame abounding with sturgeon
 and lampreie, as also the riuers which haue their issue into the same,
 being (as I say) alreadie described, I thinke it not amisse, as by the
 waie to set downe what Leland saith thereof, to the end that his trauell
 shall not altogither be lost in this behalfe; and for that it is short,
 and hath one or two things worthie to be remembred conteined in the
 same.

 The Hulne (saith he) riseth of three seuerall heads, whereof the
 greatest is not far from Driefield, now a small village sixteene miles
 from Hull. Certes it hath beene a goodlie towne, and therein was the
 palace of Egbright king of the Northumbers, and place of sepulture of
 Alfred the noble king sometime of that nation, who died there 727, the
 nineteene Cal. of Julie, the twentith of his reigne, and whose toombe or
 monument dooth yet remaine (for ought that I doo know to the contrarie)
 with an inscription vpon the same written in Latine letters. Neere vnto
 this towne also is the Danefield, wherein great numbers of Danes were
 slaine, and buried in those hils, which yet remaine there to be seene
 ouer their bones and carcasses. The second head (saith he) is at
 Estburne, and the third at Emmeswell, and meeting all togither not farre
 from Drifield, the water there beginneth to be called Hulne, as I haue
 said alreadie.

 From hence also it goeth through Beuerleie medowes, and comming at the
 last not farre from an arme led from the Hulne by mans hand (and able to
 beare great vessels) almost to Beuerleie towne, which in old time either
 hight or stood in Deirwald, vntill John of Beuerleie (whom Leland nameth
 out of an old author to be the first doctor or teacher of diuinitie that
 euer was in Oxford, and (as it should seeme also by an ancient monument
 yet remaining) to be of an hostell where the vniuersitie college now
 standeth; & therfore they write him, Somtime fellow of that house) began
 to be of fame, of whom it is called Beuerleie (as some affirme) to this
 daie. Indeed all the countrie betweene the Deirwent & the Humber was
 sometime called Deira, and the lower part Caua Deira in respect of the
 higher soile, but now it is named the east Riding. But what is this to
 my purpose? The Hulne therefore being come almost to Beuerleie towne, &
 [Sidenote: Cottingham.]
 meeting thereabout also with the Cottingham becke comming from Westwood
 by the waie, it hasteth to Kingston vpon Hulne or Hull, and so into the
 Humber without anie maner impeachment.

 [Sidenote: Fowlneie.]
 The Fowlneie riseth about Godmanham, from whence it goeth by Wighton,
 Hareswell, Seton, Williams bridge, and soone after spreading it selfe,
 [Sidenote: Skelfleet.]
 one arme called Skelfleet goeth by Cane Cawseie to Brownefleet and so
 into the Ouze. The other passeth by Sandholme, Gilberts dike, Scalbie
 chappell, Blacketoft, and so into the aforesaid Ouze, leauing a verie
 pretie Iland, which is a parcell (as I heare) of Walding fen more,
 though otherwise obscure to vs that dwell here in the south.

 [Sidenote: Darwent.]
 The Darwent riseth in the hilles that lie west of Robin Whoodes baie, or
 two miles aboue Aiton bridge, west from Scarborow as Leland saith: and
 yer it hath run farre from the head, it receiueth two rilles in one
 bottome from by west, which ioine withall about Longdale end. Thence
 they go togither to Broxeie, and at Hacknesse take in another water
 comming from about Silseie. Afterward it commeth to Aiton, then to
 [Sidenote: Kenford.]
 Haibridge, and there crosseth the Kenford that descendeth from
 Roberteston. After this also it goeth on to Potersbrumton where it
 taketh in one rill, as it dooth another beneath running from Shirburne,
 and the third yet lower on the further banke, that descendeth from
 Brumton. From these confluences it runneth to Fowlbridge, Axbridge,
 Yeldingham bridge, & so to Cotehouse, receiuing by the waie manie
 waters, & yeelding great plentie of delicate samons to such as fish vpon
 the same. Leland reckoning vp the names of the seuerall brookes,
 numbreth them confusedlie after his accustomed order. The Darwent (saith
 [Sidenote: Shirihutton.]
 he) receiueth diuerse streames, as the Shirihutton. The second is the
 [Sidenote: Crambecke.]
 Crambecke, descending from Hunderskell castell (so called Tanquam a
 centum fontibus, or multitude of springs that rise about the same) and
 [Sidenote: Rie.]
 goeth to Rie, which comming out of the Blackemore, passeth by Riuers
 [Sidenote: Ricoll.]
 [Sidenote: Seuen.]
 abbeie, taking in the Ricoll on the left hand, then the Seuen, the
 [Sidenote: Costeie.]
 [Sidenote: Pickering.]
 Costeie, and Pickering brooke.

 The Seuin also (saith he) riseth in the side of Blackemoore, and thence
 goeth by Sinnington foure miles from Pickering, and about a mile aboue a
 certeine bridge ouer Rie goeth into the streame. The Costeie in like
 sort springeth in the verie edge of Pickering towne, at a place called
 Keld head, and goeth into the Rie two miles beneath Pickering, about
 Kirbie minster. Finallie, Pickering water ariseth in Blackemoore, and
 halfe a mile beneath Pickering falleth into Costeie, meeting by the way
 [Sidenote: Pocklington.]
 with the Pocklington becke, and an other small rill or two, of whose
 names I haue no knowledge. Hitherto Leland. But in mine opinion, it had
 beene far better to haue described them thus. Of those waters that fall
 into the Darwent beneath Cotehouse, the first commeth from Swenton, the
 second from Ebberston, the third from Ollerston, the fourth from
 Thorneton & Pickering, and the fift on the other side that commeth
 thither from Wintringham. For so should he haue dealt in better order,
 and rid his hands of them with more expedition, referring the rest also
 vnto their proper places.

 But to proceed after mine owne maner. Being past Cotehouse, & yer the
 [Sidenote: Rie.]
 Darwent come at Wickham, it crosseth the Rie, which riseth of two heads,
 and ioining west of Locton they run through Glansbie parke. Finallie,
 [Sidenote: Costeie.]
 receiuing the Costeie, it meeteth at the last with an other streame
 increased by the fals of six waters and more yer it come into the
 Darwent.

 [Sidenote: Seuen.]
 The most easterlie of these is called Seuen, and riseth (as is
 aforesaid) in Blackemoore, from whence it goeth by Sinnington, Murton,
 [Sidenote: Don or Done.]
 Normanbie, Newsound, How, and so into the Rie. The second named Don hath
 his originall likewise in Blackemoore, and descending by Rasmore, Keldon
 [Sidenote: Hodgebecke.]
 and Edston (where it receiueth the Hodgebecke, that commeth by Bernesdale,
 Kirkedale, & Welburne) it goeth to Sawlton, and there taketh in first the
 [Sidenote: Ricoll.]
 Ricoll, that goeth by Careton, and whereof Ridall (as some think, but
 [Sidenote: Fesse.]
 falslie) doth seeme to take the name. Then Fesse, which riseth aboue
 Bilisdale chappell, and meeteth with the Rie at the Shaking bridge, from
 whence they go togither vnder the Rie bridge, to Riuis abbeie, and
 thence (after it hath crossed a becke from the west) through a parke of
 the earle of Rutlands to Newton, Muniton, and so to Sawton or Sawlton,
 [Sidenote: Holbecke.]
 as I doo find it written. Here also it taketh in the Holbecke brooke,
 that commeth thither from by west by Gilling castell, and Stangraue,
 from whence it goeth on to Brabie, next into the Seuen, then into the
 Rie, and so into the Darwent, which from thence dooth run to Wickham.

 Being past Wickham, it meeteth with a water that commeth thereinto from
 Grinston to Setterington at southeast, and thence it goeth on to Malton
 and Malton (where the prouerbe saith that a bushell of rie and an other
 of malt is woorth but sixpence, carie awaie whilest you may, so as you
 can keepe them from running through the sackes) Sutton, Wellam, Furbie,
 and Kirkeham, receiuing by the waie one rill on the one side and an
 other on the other, whereof this commeth from Burdfall, that other from
 Conisthorpe. From Kirkeham it goeth to Cramburne and Owsham bridge
 (crossing by the waie an other brooke comming from saint Edwards gore,
 by Faston) then to Aldbie, Buttercram (alias Butterham) bridge, Stamford
 bridge, Kerbie bridge, Sutton, Ellerton, Aughton, Bubwith, Wresill,
 Babthorpe, and so into the Ouze, wherewith I finish the description of
 Darwent: sauing that I haue to let you vnderstand how Leland heard that
 an arme ran some time from the head of Darwent also to Scarborow, till
 such time as two hils betwixt which it ran, did shalder and so choke vp
 his course.

 [Sidenote: Fosse.]
 The Fosse (a slow streame yet able to beare a good vessell) riseth in
 Nemore Calaterio, that is, Galters wood or Cawood, among the wooddie
 hilles, and in his descent from the higher ground, he leaueth Crake
 castell, on his west side: thence he goeth by Marton abbeie, Marton,
 Stillington, Farlington, Towthorpe, Erswijc, Huntington, & at Yorke into
 [Sidenote: Kile.]
 the Ouze. The Kile riseth flat north at Newborow, from whence it goeth
 by Thorneton on the hill, Ruskell parke, Awne, Tollerton, and so into
 [Sidenote: Swale.]
 the Ouze about Newton vpon Ouze. The Swale is a right noble riuer, &
 march in some places betweene Richmondshire and Westmerland, it riseth
 not far from Pendragon castell in the hilles aboue Kirkedale, and from
 this towne it goeth to Kelde chappell, Carret house, Crackepot,
 [Sidenote: Barneie.]
 Whiteside, and neere vnto Yalen taketh in the Barneie water, which
 commeth from the north east. Thence it goeth by Harcaside to Reth (where
 [Sidenote: Arcleie.]
 it meeteth with the Arcleie) and so to Flemington, Grinton, Marrike
 [Sidenote: Holgate.]
 (taking in the Holgate that commeth from by south: and in the waie to
 [Sidenote: Mariske becke.]
 Thorpe, the Mariske becke, or peraduenture Applegarth water, as Leland
 calleth it, that descendeth from the north) then to Thorpe, Applegarth,
 Richmond, Easbie and Brunton.

 Here by north it interteineth two or three waters in one chanell, called
 [Sidenote: Rauenswath.]
 Rauenswath water, whereof the two furthest doo ioine not farre from the
 Dawltons, and so go by Rauenswath, Hartfoorth, Gilling, and at Skebie
 meet with the third, comming from Richmond beaconward. By west also of
 [Sidenote: Rhe.]
 Brunton, the Swale meeteth with the Rhe, running from Resdale, and being
 past Brunton, it goeth to Caterijc bridge beneath Brunton, then to
 Ellerton, Kirkebie, Langton parua, Thirtoft, Anderbie steeple: and
 [Sidenote: Bedall alias Leming.]
 before it come vnto Gatenbie, it meeteth with the Bedall brooke, alias
 Lemings becke, that commeth west of Kellirbie, by Cunstable, Burton,
 Langthorpe, Bedall, and Leming chappell. From Gattenbie likewise it
 [Sidenote: Wiske.]
 goeth to Mawbie, & at Brakenbirie receiueth the Wiske, which is a great
 water, rising betweene two parkes aboue Swanbie in one place, and
 southeast of Mountgrace abbeie in another; and after the confluence
 which is about Siddlebridge, goeth on betweene the Rughtons to Appleton,
 the Smetons, Birtbie, Hutton Coniers, Danbie, Wijc, Yafford, Warlabie,
 and taking in there a rill from Brunton Aluerton, it proceedeth to
 Otterington, Newlie, Kirbie Wiske, Newson, and Blackenburie, there
 meeting (as I said) with the Swale, that runneth fr[=o] thence by
 Skipton bridge, Catton, Topcliffe, and Raniton, and aboue Eldmire
 meeteth with sundrie other rilles in one bottome, whereof the
 [Sidenote: Cawdebec.]
 [Sidenote: Kebecke.]
 northwesterlie is called Cawdebec: the south easterlie Kebecke, which
 ioine est of Thorneton moore, and so go to Thorneton in the street,
 Kiluington, Thruske, Sowerbie, Grastwijc, and soone after crossing
 another growing of the mixture of the Willow, and likewise of the
 [Sidenote: Cuckwolds becke.]
 Cuckewold beckes, which ioine aboue Bridforth, and running on till it
 come almost at Dawlton, it maketh confluence with the Swale, and go
 thence as one with all their samons by Thorneton bridge, Mitton vpon
 Swale, and so into the Ouze.

 [Sidenote: Skell.]
 The Skell riseth out of the west two miles from Founteines abbeie, and
 commeth (as Leland saith) with a faire course by the one side of Rippon,
 as the Vre dooth on the other. And on the bankes hereof stood the famous
 abbeie called Founteines or Adfontes, so much renowmed for the lustie
 monks that sometimes dwelled in the same. It receiueth also the Lauer
 [Sidenote: Lauer.]
 water (which riseth three miles from Kirbie, and meeteth withall neere
 vnto Rippon) and finallie falleth into the Vre, a quarter of a mile
 beneath Rippon towne, & almost midwaie betweene the North and Huicke
 bridges.

 [Sidenote: Nidde.]
 The Nidde, which the booke of statutes called Nidor (anno 13. Edw. 1.)
 and thereto noteth it to be inriched with store of samon, as are also
 the Wheof and Aire, riseth among those hilles that lie by west northwest
 of Gnarresborow, fiue miles aboue Pakeleie bridge, and going in short
 processe of time by Westhouses, Lodgehouses, Woodhall, Newhouses,
 Midlesmore, Raunsgill, Cowthouse, Gowthwall, Bureleie, Brimham,
 [Sidenote: Killingale.]
 Hampeswale, and soone after meeting with the Killingale becke, it goeth
 after the confluence by Bilton parke, Gnaresbridge, Washford, Cathall,
 Willesthorpe, Munketon, or Nonmocke, and so into the Ouze, foureteene
 miles beneath Gnaresborow, being increased by the waie with verie few or
 no waters of anie countenance. Leland hauing said thus much of the
 Nidde, addeth herevnto the names of two other waters, that is to saie,
 [Sidenote: Couer.]
 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 the Couer and the Burne, which doo fall likewise into the Vre or Ouze.
 But as he saith little of the same, so among all my pamphlets, I can
 gather no more of them, than that the first riseth six miles aboue
 Couerham by west, and falleth into the Vre, a little beneath Middleham
 bridge, which is two miles beneath the towne of Couerham. As for the
 Burne, it riseth at More hilles, and falleth into the said riuer a
 little beneath Massham bridge. And so much of these two.

 [Sidenote: Wharfe alias Gwerfe.]
 The Wharffe or Gwerfe ariseth aboue Vghtershaw, from whence it runneth
 to Beggermons, Rosemill, Hubberham, Backden, Starbotton, Kettlewell,
 Cunniston in Kettlewell, and here it meeteth with a rill comming from
 Haltongill chappell, by Arnecliffe, and ioining withall northeast of
 Kilneseie crag, it passeth ouer by the lower grounds to Girsington, and
 receiuing a rill there also from Tresfeld parke, it proceedeth on to
 Brunsall bridge. Furthermore at Appletreewijc, it meeteth with a rill
 from by north, and thence goeth to Barden towre, Bolton, Beth and
 Misleie hall, where it crosseth a rill comming from by west, thence to
 Addingham, taking in there also another from by west, and so to Ikeleie,
 and receiuing yer long another by north from Denton hall, it hasteth to
 Weston Vauasour, Oteleie, and Letheleie, where it taketh in the Padside,
 & the Washburne (both in one streame from Lindleie ward) and thence to
 Casleie chappell, and there it crosseth one from by north, and another
 yer long from by south, and so to Yardwood castell, Kerebie, Woodhall,
 Collingham, Linton, Wetherbie, Thorpatch, Newton, Tadcaster, and when it
 [Sidenote: Cockebecke.]
 hath receiued the Cockebecke from southwest, that goeth by Barwie,
 Aberfoorth, Leadhall, and Grimston, it runneth to Exton, Kirbie Wharfe,
 Vskell, Rither, Nunapleton, & so into the Ouze beneath Cawood, a castell
 belonging to the archbishop of Yorke, where he vseth oft to lie when he
 refresheth himselfe with change of aire and shift of habitation, for the
 auoiding of such infection as may otherwise ingender by his long abode
 in one place, for want of due purgation and airing of his house.

 [Sidenote: Air.]
 The Air or Arre riseth out of a lake or tarne south of Darnbrooke,
 wherein (as I heare) is none other fish but red trowt, and perch. Leland
 saith it riseth neere vnto Orton in Crauen, wherfore the ods is but
 little. It goeth therefore from thence to Mawlam, Hamlith, Kirbie,
 Moldale, Calton hall, Areton, and so foorth till it come almost to
 [Sidenote: Otterburne.]
 Gargraue, there crossing the Otterburne water on the west, and the
 [Sidenote: Winterburne.]
 Winterburne on the north, which at Flasbie receiueth a rill from Helton,
 as I heare. Being past Gargraue, our Air goeth on to Eshton, Elswood,
 and so foorth on, first receiuing a brooke from southwest (whereof one
 branch commeth by Marton, the other by Thorneton, which meete about
 Broughton) then another from northeast, that runneth by Skipton castell.
 After this confluence it hasteth by manifold windlesses, which caused
 thirteene bridges at the last to be ouer the same within a little space,
 to Newbiggin, Bradleie, and Kildwijc, by south east whereof it meeteth
 [Sidenote: Glike.]
 with one water from Mawsis, and Glusburne or Glukesburne, called Glike;
 another likewise a little beneath from Seton, beside two rilles from by
 north, after which confluence it runneth by Reddlesden, and ouer against
 [Sidenote: Lacocke.]
 [Sidenote: Woorth.]
 this towne the Lacocke and the Woorth doo meet withall in one chanell,
 [Sidenote: Moreton.]
 as the Moreton water dooth on the north, although it be somewhat lower.
 Thence it goeth to Rishfoorth hall, and so to Bungleie, where it taketh
 a rill from Denholme parke to Shipeleie, and there crossing another from
 Thorneton, Leuenthorpe, and Bradleie, it goeth to Caluerleie, to
 Christall, and so to Leedes, where one water runneth thereinto by north
 from Wettlewood, & two other from by south in one chanell, wherof the
 first hath two armes, of which the one commeth from Pudseie chappell,
 the other from Adwalton, their confluence being made aboue Farnesleie
 hall. The other likewise hath two heads, whereof one is aboue Morleie,
 the other commeth from Domingleie, and meeting with the first not far
 southwest of Leedes, they fall both into the Air, and so run with the
 [Sidenote: Rodwell.]
 same to Swillington, and there taking in the Rodwell becke south of the
 bridge, it proceedeth to Ollerton, Castleford, Brotherton & Ferribridge,
 [Sidenote: Went.]
 there receiuing the Went, a becke from Pontefract or Pomfret, which
 riseth of diuerse heads, wherof one is among the cole pits. Thence to
 Beall, Berkin, Kellington, middle Hodleseie, Templehirst, Gowldall,
 Snath, Rawcliffe, Newland, Armie, and so into the Ouze with an
 indifferent course. Of all the riuers in the north, Leland (in so manie
 of his bookes as I haue seene) saith least of this. Mine annotations
 also are verie slender in the particular waters wherbie it is increased:
 wherfore I was compelled of necessitie to conclude euen thus with the
 description of the same, and had so left it in deed, if I had not
 receiued one other note more to ad vnto it (euen when the leafe was at
 the presse) which saith as followeth in maner word for word.

 There is a noble water that falleth into Air, whose head (as I take it)
 is about Stanford. From whence it goeth to Creston chappell, to
 Lingfield, and there about receiuing one rill neere Elfrabright bridge,
 [Sidenote: Hebden.]
 and also the Hebden by northwest, it goeth to Brearleie hall, and so
 taking in the third by north, it proceedeth on eastward by Sorsbie
 bridge chappell (and there a rill from southwest) and so to Coppeleie
 hall. Beneath this place I find also that it receiueth one rill from
 Hallifax, which riseth from two heads, and two other from southwest, of
 which one commeth by Baresland, and Staneland in one chanell, as I read.
 So that after this confluence the aforesaid water goeth on toward
 Cowford bridge, and as it taketh in two rilles aboue the same on the
 north side, so beneath that bridge there falleth into it a pretie arme
 increased by sundrie waters c[=o]ming from by south, as from Marsheden
 chappell, from Holmesworth chappell, and Kirke Heton, each one growing
 of sundrie heads; whereof I would saie more, if I had more intelligence
 of their seuerall gates and passages.

 But to proceed. From Cowford bridge it runneth to Munfeld, and receiuing
 yer long one rill from Leuersage hall, and another from Burshall by
 Dewesburie, it goeth on northeast of Thornehull, south of Horbirie
 thornes, and thereabout crossing one rill from by south from Woller by
 new Milner Dam, and soone after another from northwest, called Chald,
 [Sidenote: Chald.]
 rising in the Peke hils, whereon Wakefield standeth, and likewise the
 third from southeast, and Waterton hall, it goeth by Warmefield,
 Newland, Altoftes, and finallie into the Aire, west of Castelworth, as I
 learne. What the name of this riuer should be as yet I heare not, and
 therefore no maruell that I doo not set it downe, yet is it certeine
 that it is called Chald, after his c[=o]fluence with the Chald, and
 finallie Chaldair or Chaldar after it hath ioined with the Air or Ar.
 But what is this for his denominations from the head? It shall suffice
 therefore thus farre to haue shewed the course thereof: and as for the
 name I passe it ouer vntill another time.

 [Sidenote: Trent.]
 The Trent is one of the most excellent riuers in the land, not onelie
 for store of samon, sturgeon, and sundrie other kinds of delicate fish
 wherewith it dooth abound, but also for that it is increased with so
 manie waters, as for that onelie cause it may be compared either with
 the Ouze or Sauerne, I meane the second Ouze, whose course I haue
 latelie described. It riseth of two heads which ioine beneath Norton in
 the moore, and from thence goeth to Hilton abbeie, Bucknell church, and
 [Sidenote: Foulebrooke.]
 aboue Stoke receiueth in the Foulebrooke water, which commeth thither
 from Tunstall, by Shelton, and finallie making a confluence they go to
 Hanfleet, where they meet with another on the same side, that descendeth
 from Newcastell vnder Line, which Leland taketh to be the verie Trent it
 selfe, saieng: that it riseth in the hils aboue Newcastell, as may be
 seene by his commentaries.

 But to proceed. At Trentham, or not farre from thence, it crosseth a
 riueret from northeast, whose name I know not, & thence going to Stone
 Aston, Stoke Burston, the Sandons and Weston, a little aboue Shubburne &
 Hawood, it receiueth the Sow, a great chanell increased with sundrie
 waters, which I will here describe, leauing the Trent at Shubburne,
 [Sidenote: Sow.]
 till I come backe againe. The Sow descendeth from the hilles, aboue
 Whitemoore chappell, and goeth by Charleton, and Stawne, and beneath
 Shalford ioineth with another by northeast that commeth from bishops
 Offeleie, Egleshall, Chesbie, Raunton. After this confluence also it
 runneth by Bridgeford, Tillington, & Stafford, beneath which towne
 [Sidenote: Penke.]
 it crosseth the Penke becke, that riseth aboue Nigleton, & Berwood, &
 aboue Penke bridge vniteth it selfe with another comming from Knightleie
 ward, by Gnashall church, Eaton: and so going foorth as one, it is not
 long yer they fall into Sow, after they haue passed Draiton, Dunstan,
 Acton, and Banswich, where loosing their names, they with the Sow & the
 Sow with them doo ioine with the Trent, at Shubburne, vpon the
 southerlie banke.

 From Shubburne the Trent goeth on to little Harwood (meeting by the waie
 one rill at Ousleie bridge, and another south of Riddlesleie) thence by
 Hawksberie, Mauestane, Ridware, and so toward Yoxhall; where I must
 staie a while to consider of other waters, wherewith I meet in this
 voiage. Of these therefore the lesser commeth in by south from Farwall,
 the other from by west, a faire streame, and increased with two brooks,
 whereof the first riseth in Nedewood forrest, northeast of Haggersleie
 [Sidenote: Blith.]
 parke, whereinto falleth another west of Hamsteed Ridware, called Blith,
 which riseth among the hilles in Whateleie moore, aboue Weston Conie,
 and thence going to the same towne, it commeth to Druicote, alias
 Dracote, Painsleie, Gratwitch, Grimleie, Aldmaston, Hamsteed, Ridware,
 and finallie into the Trent, directlie west of Yoxhall, which runneth
 also from thence, & leauing kings Bromleie in a parke (as I take it) on
 the left hand, and the Blacke water comming from Southton and Lichfield
 on the right, goeth streightwaie to Catton, where it meeteth with the
 [Sidenote: Tame.]
 Tame, whose course I describe as followeth.

 It riseth in Staffordshire (as I remember) not farre from Petteshall,
 and goeth foorth by Hamsted, toward Pirihall and Brimichams Aston,
 taking in by the waie a rill on each side, whereof the first groweth
 through a confluence of two waters, the one of them comming from Tipton,
 the other from Aldburie, and so running as one by Wedburie till they
 fall into the same. The latter commeth from Woolfhall, and ioineth with
 it on the left hand. After this, and when it is past the aforesaid
 places, it crosseth in like sort a rill from Smethike ward: thence it
 [Sidenote: Rhee.]
 goeth to Yarneton hall, beneath which it meeteth with the Rhee, and
 thence through the parke, at Parke hall by Watercote, crossing finallie
 [Sidenote: Cole.]
 the Cole, whose head is in the forrest by Kingesnorton wood, and hath
 this course, whereof I now giue notice. It riseth (as I said) in the
 forrest by Kingesnorton wood, and going by Yareleie and Kingeshirst, it
 meeteth betweene that and the parke, with a water running betweene
 Helmedon and Sheldon.

 Thence it passeth on to Coleshull, by east whereof it ioineth with a
 [Sidenote: Blith.]
 brooke, mounting southwest of Golihull called Blith, which going by
 Henwood and Barston, crosseth on ech side of Temple Balshall, a rill,
 whereof one commeth through the Queenes parke or chase that lieth by
 west of Kenelworth, & the other by Kenelworth castell it selfe, from
 about Haselie parke. After which confluences it proceedeth in like maner
 to Hampton in Arden, and the Packingtons, and so to Coleshull, where it
 meeteth with the Cole, that going a little further, vniteth it selfe
 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 with the Burne on the one side (whereinto runneth a water comming from
 Ansleie on the east) and soone after on the other dooth fall into the
 [Sidenote: Rhee.]
 Tame, that which some call the Rhee, a common name to all waters that
 mooue and run from their head. For [Greek: reo] in Greeke is to flow and
 run, although in truth it is proper to the sea onelie to flow. Leland
 nameth the Brimicham water, whose head (as I heare) is aboue Norffield,
 so that his course shuld be by Kingesnorton, Bremicham, Budston hall,
 till it fall beneath Yarneton into the Tame it selfe, that runneth after
 these confluences on by Lee, Kingesbirie parke, and going by east of
 Draiton, Basset parke, to Falkesleie bridge, it meeteth with another
 water called Burne, also comming from Hammerwich church, by Chesterford,
 Shenton, Thickebrowne, and the north side of Draiton, Basset parke,
 wherof I spake before. From hence our Tame runneth on to Tamworth, there
 taking in the Anchor by east, whose description I had in this maner
 deliuered vnto me.

 It riseth aboue Burton, from whence it goeth by Nonneaton, Witherleie
 and Atherstone. Yer long also it taketh in a water from northeast, which
 commeth by Huglescote, Shapton, Cunston, Twicrosse (vniting it selfe
 [Sidenote: Anchor.]
 with a water from Bosworth) Ratcliffe, & so to the Anchor, which after
 this confluence passeth by Whittendon, Crindon, Pollesworth, Armington,
 Tamworth, & so into Tame, that hasteth to Hopwash, Comberford hall,
 Telford, and soone after crossing a rill that riseth short of Swinfield
 hall, and commeth by Festirike, it runneth not farre from Croxhall, and
 so to Catton, thereabout receiuing his last increase not worthie to be
 [Sidenote: Mese.]
 omitted. This brooke is named Mese, and it riseth in the great parke
 that lieth betweene Worthington, and Smethike, from whence also it goeth
 by Ashbie de la Souche, Packington, Mesham, and Stretton, and therabout
 crossing a rill about Nethersale grange, from Ouersale by east, it
 proceedeth by Chilcote, Clifton, Croxall, into the Thame, and both out
 of hand into the maine riuer a mile aboue Repton. Leland writing of this
 riuer (as I earst noted) saith thereof in this wise. Into the Thame also
 runneth the Bremicham brooke, which riseth foure or fiue miles about
 Bremicham in the Blacke hils in Worcestershire, and goeth into the
 aforesaid water a mile aboue Crudworth bridge. Certes (saith he) this
 Bremicham is a towne mainteined chieflie by smiths, nailers, cutlers,
 edgetoole forgers, lorimers or bitmakers, which haue their iron out of
 Stafford and Warwijc shires, and coles also out of the first countie.
 Hitherto Leland. Now to resume the Trent, which being growen to some
 greatnesse, goeth on to Walton, Drakelow, and there crossing a water
 that commeth by Newbold hall, it runneth to Stapenell, Winshull,
 Wightmere, and Newton Souch, where it receiueth two chanels within a
 short space, to be described apart.

 [Sidenote: Dou.]
 The first of these is called the Dou or Doue, it riseth about the three
 shires meere, and is as it were limes betweene Stafford and Darbishires,
 vntill it come at the Trent. Descending therefore from the head, it
 goeth by Earlesbooth, Pilsburie grange, Hartington, Wolscot, Eaton,
 [Sidenote: Manifold.]
 Hunsington grange, and aboue Thorpe receiueth the Manifold water, so
 called, bicause of the sundrie crinckling rills that it receiueth, and
 turnagaines that it selfe sheweth before it come at the Dou. Rising
 therefore not farre from Axe edge crosse (in the bottome thereby) it
 runneth from thence to Longmore, Sheene, Warslow chappell, and Welton.

 [Sidenote: Hansleie.]
 Beneath Welton also it taketh in the Hansleie water, that commeth out of
 Blackemoore hilles to Watersall, where it falleth into the ground: and
 afterward mounting againe is receiued into the Manifold, north of
 Throwleie (as I heare) which goeth from thence to Ilam, and aboue Thorpe
 dooth cast it selfe into Dou. Hauing therefore met togither after this
 maner, the Dou proceedeth on to Maplington, beneath which it crosseth
 one water descending from Brassington by Fennie Bentleie, and another
 somewhat lower that commeth from Hocston hall by Hognaston and Ashburne,
 and then going to Matterfield, Narburie, Ellaston, Rawston Rowcester, it
 [Sidenote: Churne.]
 meeteth with the Churne, euen here to be described before I go anie
 further. It riseth a good waie aboue Delacrasse abbie, and comming
 [Sidenote: Dunsmere.]
 thither by Hellesbie wood, it taketh in the Dunsmere, betweene
 Harracrasse and Leike.

 [Sidenote: Yendor.]
 Thence it goeth to the Walgrange, and a little beneath receiueth the
 Yendor that commeth from aboue Harton, thence to Cheddleton, and hauing
 [Sidenote: Aula Canuti.]
 [Sidenote: Ashenhirst.]
 crossed the Ashenhirst brooke aboue Cnutes hall, it runneth by Ypston,
 Froghall, Below hill, Alton castell, Preestwood, and at Rowcester
 falleth into the Dou, which yer long also receiueth a rill from Crowsden,
 [Sidenote: Teine.]
 and then going to Eton meeteth first with the Teine that commeth thither
 from each side of Chedleie by Teinetowne, Bramhirst and Stranehill.
 [Sidenote: Vttoxeter or Vncester.]
 Secondlie with the Vncester or Vttoxeter water, and then going on to
 Merchington, Sidberie, Cawlton, it crosseth a brooke from Sidmister
 college, by Saperton. From this confluence in like sort it passeth
 foorth to Tilberie castell, Marston, and at Edgerton meeteth with the
 water that commeth from Yeldersleie by Longford (whereinto runneth
 another that commeth from Hollington) and so to Hilton. These waters
 being thus ioined, and manie ends brought into one, the Dou it selfe
 falleth yer long likewise into the Trent, aboue Newton Souch. So that
 the maine riuer being thus inlarged, goeth onwards with his course, and
 betweene Willington and Repton meeteth with two waters on sundrie sides,
 whereof that which falleth in by Willington, riseth neere Dawberie Lies,
 and runneth by Trusselie and Ashe: the other that entereth aboue Repton,
 descendeth from Hartesburne, so that the Trent being past these, hasteth
 to Twiford, Inglebie, Staunton, Weston, Newton, and Aston, yer long also
 [Sidenote: Darwent.]
 meeting with the Darwent; next of all to be dispatched. The Darwent, or
 (to vse the verie British word) Dowr gwine (but in Latine Fluuius
 Dereuantanus) riseth plaine west, neere vnto the edge of Darbishire,
 aboue Blackwell a market towne, and from the head runneth to the New
 chappell, within a few miles after it be risen. From hence moreouer it
 goeth by Howden house, Darwent chappell, Yorkeshire bridge, and at
 [Sidenote: Neue.]
 Witham bridge dooth crosse the Neue or Nouius that commeth from Newstole
 hill, by Netherburgh, Hope (crossing there one rill from Castelton,
 another from Bradwell, and the third at Hathersage, from Stonie ridge
 hill) and so goeth on to Padleie, Stockehall, receiuing a rill by the
 waie from by west, to Stonie Middleton, and Baslow, and hauing here
 [Sidenote: Burbroke.]
 taken in the Burbrooke on the one side, and another from Halsop on the
 other, it goeth to Chatworth and to Rowseleie, where it is increased
 with the Wie comming from by west, and also a rill on the east, a little
 higher. But I will describe the Wie before I go anie further.

 [Sidenote: Wie.]
 The Wie riseth aboue Buxston well, and there is increased with the
 [Sidenote: Hawkeshow.]
 [Sidenote: Wile.]
 Hawkeshow, and the Wile brooke, whose heads are also further distant
 from the edge of Darbishire than that of Wie, and races somwhat longer,
 though neither of them be worthie to be accompted long. For the Wile,
 hauing two heads, the one of them is not farre aboue the place where
 Wilebecke abbeie stood, the other is further off by west, about
 Wilebecke towne: and finallie ioining in one they runne to Cuckneie
 village, where receiuing a becke that commeth downe from by west, it
 holdeth on two miles further, there taking in the second rill, and so
 [Sidenote: Rufford alias Manbecke.]
 resort to Rufford, or the Manbecke. Vnto this also doo other two rills
 repaire, wherof the one goeth through and the other hard by Maunsfield,
 of which two also this latter riseth west about foure miles, and runneth
 foorth to Clipston (three miles lower) and so likewise to Rufford,
 whereof I will speake hereafter. In the meane time to returne againe to
 the Wie. From Buxston well, it runneth to Staddon, Cowdale, Cowlow, New
 medow, Milhouses, Bankewell, and Haddon hall, beneath which it receiueth
 [Sidenote: Lathkell.]
 [Sidenote: Bradford.]
 the Lath kell, that runneth by Ouerhaddon, and the Bradford, both in one
 bottome after they be ioined in one at Alport. And this is the first
 great water that our Darwent dooth meet withall. Being therefore past
 the Rowsleies, the said Darwent goeth to Stancliffe, Darleie in the
 peake, Wensleie, Smitterton hall, and at Matlocke taketh in a rill by
 northeast, as it dooth another at Crumford that goeth by Boteshall.

 From Mattocke, it proceedeth to Watston, or Watsond, Well bridge,
 [Sidenote: Amber.]
 Alderwash, and ioineth with another streame called Amber comming in from
 by north by Amber bridge, whose description shall insue in this wise, as
 I find it. The head of Amber is aboue Edleston hall, or (as Leland
 saith) est of Chesterfield, and comming from thence by Middleton to
 Ogston hall, it taketh withall another brooke, descending from Hardwijc
 wood, by Alton and Streton. Thence it goeth to Higham, Brackenfield, and
 aboue Dale bridge meeteth with a brooke running from Hucknalward to
 [Sidenote: Moreton.]
 Shireland parke side, there crossing the Moreton becke, and so to
 Alferton, except I name it wrong. From Dale bridge it goeth by Wingfeld,
 to Hedge, Fritchlin, and so into Darwent, taking the water withall that
 descendeth from Swanswijc by Pentridge, as Leland doth remember. From
 this confluence likewise it runneth to Belper, where it meeteth with a
 rill comming from Morleie parke: thence to Makenie, and at Duffeld,
 [Sidenote: Eglesburne.]
 receiueth the Eglesburne, which ariseth about Wirkesworth or Oresworth,
 but in the same parish out of a rocke, and commeth in by Turnedich. From
 Duffeld, it passeth to Bradsall, Darleie abbeie, and at Darbie taketh in
 a rill comming from Mirkaston by Weston vnderwood, Kidleston and Merton.
 If a man should say that Darwent riuer giueth name to Darbie towne, he
 should not well know how euerie one would take it, and peraduenture
 therby he might happen to offend some. In the meane time I beleeue it,
 let other iudge as pleaseth them, sith my coniecture can preiudice none.
 To proceed therefore. From Darbie it runneth on by Aluaston, Ambaston,
 the Welles, and so into Trent, which goeth from hence to Sawleie, and
 [Sidenote: Sora, or Surus.]
 north of Thrumpton taketh in the Sore, a faire streame, and not worthie
 to be ouerpassed.

 It riseth in Leicestershire aboue Wigton, and thence goeth to
 Sharneford, Sapcote, and beneath Staunton taketh in a rill that commeth
 by Dounton and Broughton Astleie. Thence to Marleborow, and before it
 come to Eston, crosseth another on the same side (descending by Burton,
 Glen, Winstow, Kilbie and Blabie) then to Leircester towne, Belgraue,
 Burstall, Wanlip; and yer it come at Cussington or Cositon, crosseth the
 [Sidenote: Eie.]
 Eie, which riseth neere Occam aboue Bramston, going by Knawstow,
 [Sidenote: _Leland_ calleth one of these rilles Croco.]
 Somerbie, Pickwell, Whitesonden; and beneath (a litle) receiueth a rill
 on the right hand, from Coldnorton. Thence to Stapleford, & soone after
 crossing a brooke from aboue Sproxton, Coson, Garthorpe and Sarbie, it
 runneth to Wiuerbie, Brentingbie; and yer it come at Milton, meeteth
 with two other small rilles, from the right hand whereof one commeth
 from about Caldwell by Thorpe Arnold, and Waltham in the Would; the
 other from Skaleford ward, and from Melton goeth by Sisonbie, there
 meeting with another from northeast ouer against Kirbie Hellars, after
 [Sidenote: Warke, Vrke, or Wreke.]
 which time the name of Eie is changed into Warke or Vrke, and so
 continueth vntill it come at the Soure. From hence also it goeth to
 Asterbie, Radgale, Habie, Trussington, Ratcliffe; and soone after
 crosseth sundrie waters not verie farre in sunder, whereof one commeth
 from Oueston, by Twiford, Ashbie, and Gadesbie; another from Losebie, by
 Baggraue, and Crawston, and ioining with the first at Ouennihow, it is
 not long yer they fall into the Warke. The second runneth from
 Engarsbie, by Barkeleie, and Sison. But the third and greatest of the
 three, is a chanell increased with three waters, whereof one commeth
 from Norton by Burton, Kilbie, Foston and Blabie, the other from Dounton
 by Broughton and Astleie, and meeting with the third from Sapcoth, and
 stonie Staunton, they run togither by Narborow, and soone after ioining
 aboue Elston, with the first of the three, they go as one by Elston to
 Leircester, Belgraue, Wanlip, and aboue Cussington doo fall into the
 Warke, and soone after into the Soure. The Soure in like sort going from
 thence to mount Sorrell, & taking in another brooke southwest from
 Leircester forrest, by Glenfield, Austie, Thurcaston and Rodelie,
 ioineth with the Soure, which goeth from thence to mount Sorrell, and
 Quarendon (where it taketh in a water comming from Charnewood forrest,
 and goeth by Bradegate and Swithland) and then proceedeth to Cotes,
 Lughborow and Stanford, there also taking in one rill out of
 Nottinghamshire by northeast; and soone after another from southwest,
 comming from Braceden to Shepesheued, Garrington, & Dighlie grange, and
 likewise the third from Worthington, by Disworth, long Whitton, and
 Wathorne. Finallie, after these confluences, it hasteth to Sutton,
 Kingston, and Ratcliffe, and so into the Trent.

 These things being thus brought togither, and we now resuming the
 discourse of the same riuer, it dooth after his meeting with the Soure,
 [Sidenote: Erwash.]
 proceed withall to Barton, where it taketh in the Erwash, which riseth
 about Kirbie, and thence goeth to Selston, Wansbie, Codnor castell,
 Estwood, and crossing a water from Beuall, runneth to Coshall, Trowell
 (and there taking in another rill comming from Henor by Shipleie) it
 proceedeth on to Stapleford, long Eaton, and so into the Trent. This
 being doone it goeth to Clifton, and yer it come at Wilford, it meeteth
 with a brooke that passeth from Staunton by Bonnie and Rodington, and
 thence to Notingham, where it crosseth the Line, which riseth aboue
 Newsted; and passing by Papplewijc, Hucknall, Bafford, Radford and
 Linton, next of all to Thorpe & Farmdon, where it brancheth and maketh
 an Iland, and into the smaller of them goeth a brooke from Beuer
 castell, which rising betweene east Well and Eaton in Leircester is
 [Sidenote: Dene.]
 called the Dene, and from thence runneth by Bramston to Knipton, &
 beneath Knipton meeteth with a brooke that commeth by west of Croxston,
 and thence holdeth on with his course, betweene Willesthorpe and Beuer
 castell aforesaid, and so to Bottesworth, Normanton, Killington,
 [Sidenote: Snite.]
 Shilton, there receiuing the Snite from by south (whose head is neere
 Clauston, & course from thence by Hickling, Langer, Whalton, Orston, and
 Flareborow) and yer long another comming from Bingham, and Sibthorpe.
 Thence our Trent runneth to Coxam, Hawton, Newarke castell, and so to
 Winthorpe, where the branches are reunited, and thence going on by Holme
 to Cromwell (and soone after taking in a brooke comming from Bilsthorpe,
 by Kersall, Cawnton, Norwell and Willowbie) to Carlton, and to Sutton,
 there making a litle Ile, then to Grinton, where it toucheth a streame
 on ech side, whereof one commeth from Morehouse by Weston & Gresthorpe,
 another from Langthorpe, by Collingham, and Bosthorpe. From hence
 likewise it passeth to Clifton, Newton, Kettlethorpe, Torkeseie, Knash,
 Gainsborow, Waltrith, Stockwith; and leauing Axholme on the left hand,
 it taketh withall Hogdike water out of the Ile, and so goeth foorth to
 Wildsworth, Eastferrie, Frusworth, Burringham, Gummeis, Hixburgh,
 Burton, Walcote, and at Ankerburie into the Humber, receiuing the swift
 Doue by the waie, which for his noblenesse is not to be ouerpassed,
 especiallie for that Anno 1536 Hen. 8, 28, it was (by Gods prouidence) a
 staie of great bloudshed like to haue fallen out betweene the kings side
 and the rebelles of the north, in a quarrell about religion. For the
 [Sidenote: A miracle.]
 night before the battle should haue beene stricken, and without anie
 apparent cause (a little showre of raine excepted farre vnpossible vpon
 such a sudden to haue made so great a water) the said riuer arose so
 high, & ran with such vehemencie, that on the morow the armies could not
 ioine to trie & fight it out: after which a pacification insued, and
 those countries were left in quiet. Secondlie, the description hereof is
 not to be ouerpassed, bicause of the fine grasse which groweth vpon the
 banks thereof, which is so fine and batable, that there goeth a prouerbe
 vpon the same; so oft as a man will commend his pasture, to say that
 there is no better feed on Doue banke: that maketh it also the more
 famous.

 [Sidenote: Doue.]
 The Doue therefore riseth in Yorkeshire among the Peke hilles, and
 hauing receiued a water comming by Ingbirchworth (where the colour
 thereof is verie blacke) it goeth to Pennistone, which is foure miles
 from the head: then by Oxspring to Thurgoland, and soone after (ioining
 by the waie with the Midhop water, that runneth by Midhop chappell, and
 Hondshelfe) it meeteth with another comming from Bowsterston chappell.
 Then goeth it by Waddesleie wood to Waddesleie bridge, and at Aluerton
 receiueth the Bradfeld water. Then passeth it to Crokes, and so to
 Sheffeld castell (by east whereof it receiueth a brooke from by south
 that commeth through Sheffeld parke.) Thence it proceedeth to Westford
 [Sidenote: Cowleie.]
 bridge, Briksie bridge; and southwest of Timsleie receiueth the Cowleie
 streame that runneth by Ecclefield. Next of all it goeth to Rotheram,
 [Sidenote: Rother.]
 where it meeteth with the Rother, a goodlie water, whose head is in
 Darbieshire about Pilsleie, from whence it goeth vnder the name of
 Doleie, till it come at Rotheram, by north Winfield church, Wingerworth,
 and Foreland hall, twelue miles from Rotheram, to Chesterford, where it
 [Sidenote: Iber.]
 [Sidenote: Brampton.]
 meeteth with the Iber, and Brampton water that commeth by Holme hall,
 both in one chanell. Thence it runneth to Topton castell, and yer long
 crossing one water comming from Dronefeld by Whittington on the one
 side, and the second from aboue Birmington on the other, it goeth
 through Stalie parke, and soone after meeteth with the Crawleie becke,
 whereof I find this note.

 [Sidenote: Crawleie.]
 The Crawleie riseth not farre from Hardwijc, and going by Stanesbie and
 Woodhouse, it receiueth aboue Netherthorpe, one water on the one side
 comming from the Old parke, and another from Barlborow hill on the
 other, that runneth not farre from Woodthorpe. After this confluence
 likewise they run as one into the Rother, which hasteth from thence to
 Eckington (there crossing a rill that runneth by Birleie hill) and so to
 [Sidenote: Gunno.]
 Kilmarsh, in the confines of Darbieshire, where it taketh in the Gunno
 from by east. Thence to Boughton, vniting it selfe therabout with
 [Sidenote: Mesebrooke.]
 another by west from Gledles, called Mesebrooke, which diuideth
 Yorkeshire from Darbieshire, and so runneth to Treton, Whiston, there
 taking in a rill from Aston, and so to Rotheram, where it meeteth with
 the Doue, and from whence our Doue (yeelding plentie of samon all the
 waie as it passeth) hasteth to Aldwarke, Swaiton, Mexburge, there taking
 in the Darne, which I will next describe, and staie with the Doue,
 vntill I haue finished the same. It riseth at Combworth, and so commeth
 about by Bretton hall, to Darton ward, where it crosseth a water that
 runneth from Gonthwake hall, by Cawthorne vnited of two heads. From
 hence it goeth to Burton grange, then to Drax, where it toucheth with a
 water from southwest, & then goeth to Derfield and Goldthorpe: but yer
 it come to Sprotborow, it vniteth it selfe with a faire riuer, increased
 by diuerse waters, before it come at the Doue, & whereinto it falleth
 (as I heare) northeast of Mexburgh. After this confluence likewise the
 Doue goeth by Sprotborow, to Warnesworth, Doncaster, Wheatleie, (there
 [Sidenote: Hampall.]
 meeting with the Hampall creeke on the northeast side, which riseth east
 of Kirbie) thence to Sandall, Kirke Sandall, Branwith ferrie, Stanford,
 Fishlake, and so to Thuorne or Thurne, where it crosseth the Idle (whose
 description followeth) and finallie into Trent, and so into the Humber.

 But before I deale with the description of the Idle, I will adde
 somewhat of the Rume, a faire water. For though the description thereof
 be not so exactlie deliuered me as I looked for; yet such as it is I will
 set downe, conferring it with Lelands booke, and helping their defect so
 much as to me is possible. It riseth by south of Maunsfield, fiue miles
 from Rumford abbeie, and when the streame commeth neere the abbeie, it
 casteth it selfe abroad and maketh a faire lake. After this it commeth
 [Sidenote: Budbie.]
 againe into a narrow channell, and so goeth on to Rumford village,
 [Sidenote: Gerberton.]
 carrieng the Budbie and the Gerberton waters withall. From thence, and
 with a meetlie long course, it goeth to Bawtrie or Vautrie, a market
 towne in Nottinghamshire, fiue miles from Doncaster, and so into the
 [Sidenote: Girt.]
 Trent. Beneath Rumford also commeth in the Girt, which goeth vnto
 Southwell milles, and so into the Trent. Now as concerning our Idle.

 [Sidenote: Idle.]
 The Idle, which some call Brier streame, riseth at Sutton in Ashfield,
 from whence it runneth to Maunsfield, Clipston & Allerton, where it
 taketh in a water that riseth in the forrest, one mile north of
 Bledworth, and runneth on by Rughford abbeie, till it come to Allerton.
 [Sidenote: Manbecke.]
 The forresters call this Manbecke, whereof Leland also speaketh, who
 describeth it in this maner. Manbrooke riseth somewhere about Linthirst
 wood, from whence it goeth to Blisthorpe, and so to Allerton. But to
 proceed. The Idle hauing taken in the Manbecke, it runneth to
 Bothomsall, by Boughton, & Perlethorpe: but yer it come there, it
 [Sidenote: Meding becke.]
 meeteth the Meding Maiden, or Midding brooke, which rising about
 Teuersall, goeth to Pleasleie, Nettleworth, Sawcan, Warsop, Budleie,
 Thursbie, Bothomsall, and so into the Idle. After this it proceedeth to
 Houghton, west Draiton, but yer it touch at Graunston or Gaunston, it
 [Sidenote: Wilie.]
 taketh in the Wilie, which commeth from Clowne, to Creswell, Holbecke,
 Woodhouse, Wilebecke, Normenton, Elsleie, Graunston, and so into the
 Idle. Being thus increased, the Idle runneth on to Idleton, Ordsall,
 Retford, Bollam, Tilneie, Matterseie abbeie, and so to Bawtrie, where it
 meeteth another from the shire Okes, that riseth aboue Geitford, passeth
 [Sidenote: Blith.]
 on to Worksop (or Radfurth) Osberton, Bilbie, and Blith, there vniting
 it selfe with three rilles in one bottome, whereof one commeth from
 Waldingwell to Careleton, and so thorough a parke to Blith towne,
 another from by west Furbecke three miles, and so to Blith: but the
 third out of the White water neere to Blith, and there being vnited they
 passe on to Scrobie, and so into the Idle.

 From hence it runneth on to Missen, to Sadlers bridge, and next of all
 [Sidenote: Sandbecke.]
 to Santoft, where it meeteth with the Sandbecke, which rising not farre
 from Sandbecke towne, passeth by Tickhill, Rosington bridge, Brampton,
 Rilholme, Lindholme, and one mile south of Santoft into the Idle water,
 which runneth from thence to Thorne, where it meeteth with the Doue, and
 so with it to Crowleie. Finallie, inuironing the Ile of Axeholme, it
 goeth vnto Garthorpe, Focorbie, & so into the Trent. Leland writing of
 the Wilie, Wile, or Gwilie (as some write it) saith thus therof. The
 Wile hath two heads, whereof one is not farre aboue the place where
 Wilbecke abbeie stood; the other riseth further off by west aboue
 Welbecke or Wilebecke towne: finallie ioining in one, they runne to
 Cuckeneie village, where crossing a becke that commeth in from by west,
 it holdeth on two miles further, there taking in the second rill, and so
 resort to Rufford. To this riuer likewise (saith he) doo two other
 waters repaire, whereof the one goeth hard by Maunsfield (rising foure
 miles from thence by west) and then commeth three miles lower to
 Rufford; the other (so far as I remember) goeth quite through the towne.




 OF SUCH FALLES OF WATERS AS IOINE WITH THE SEA, BETWEENE HUMBER AND THE
 THAMES.

 CHAP. XVI.


 Hauing in this maner described the Ouze, and such riuers as fall into
 the same: now it resteth that I proceed in my voiage toward the Thames,
 according to my former order. Being therefore come againe into the maine
 sea, I find no water of anie countenance or course (to my remembrance)
 [Sidenote: Ancolme.]
 till I come vnto the Ancolme a goodlie water, which riseth east of
 Mercate Rasing, and from thence goeth by middle Rasing. Then receiuing a
 short rill from by south, it runneth on vnder two bridges, by the waie,
 till it come to Wingall, northeast; where also it meeteth with another
 brooke, from Vsselbie that commeth thither by Vresbie, goeth by Cadneie
 (taking in the two rilles in one bottome, that descend from Howsham, and
 north Leiseie) and thence to Newsted, Glanford, Wardeleie, Thorneham,
 Applebie, Horslow, north Ferribie, and so into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Kilis.]
 Being past Ancolme, we go about the Nesse, and so to the fall of the
 water which commeth from Kelebie, by Cotham abbeie, Nersham abbeie,
 Thorneton, and leauing Coxhill by west, it falleth into the Ocean. The
 next is the fall of another brooke comming from Fleting, all alongst by
 Stallingburne. Then crossed we Grimsbie gullet, which issuing aboue
 Erebie commeth to Lasebie, the two Cotes, and then into the sea. After
 this we passed by another portlet, whose backwater descendeth from
 Balesbie by Ashbie, Briggesleie, Wath, and Towneie, and finallie to the
 next issue, before we come at Saltflete, which branching at the last,
 leaueth a prettie Iland wherein Comsholme village standeth. This water
 riseth short (as I heare) of Tathewell, from whence it goeth to Rathbie,
 Hallington, Essington, Lowth, Kidirington, Auingham, and then branching
 aboue north Somerton, one arme meeteth with the sea, by Grauethorpe, the
 other by north of Somercote.

 [Sidenote: Saltflete.]
 Saltflete water hath but a short course: for rising among the
 Cockeringtons, it commeth to the sea, at Saltflete hauen: howbeit the
 next vnto it is of a longer race, for it riseth (as I take it) at
 Cawthorpe paroch, and descendeth by Legburne, the Carletons, the west
 middle and east Saltfletes, and so into the Ocean. The water that riseth
 aboue Ormesbie and Dribie, goeth to Cawsbie, Swabie abbeie, Clathorpe,
 Belew, Tattle, Witherne, Stane, and northeast of Thetilthorpe into the
 maine sea.

 [Sidenote: Maplethorpe]
 Maplethorpe water riseth at Tharesthorpe, and going by Markeleie,
 Folethorpe, and Truthorpe, it is not long yer it meet with the Germane
 Ocean. Then come we to the issue that commeth from aboue the Hotoft, and
 thence to Mumbie chappell, whither the water comming from Claxbie,
 Willowbie, and Slouthbie (and whereinto another rill falleth) dooth
 runne, as there to doo homage vnto their lord and souereigne. As for
 Ingold mill creeke, I passe it ouer, and come straight to another water,
 descending from Burge by Skegnes. From hence I go to the issue of a
 faire brooke, which (as I heare) dooth rise at Tetford, and thence goeth
 by Somerbie, Bagenderbie, Ashwardbie, Sawsthorpe, Partneie, Ashbie, the
 Stepings, Thorpe croft, and so into the sea. As for Wainflete water, it
 commeth from the east sea, and goeth betweene S. Maries & Alhallowes by
 Wainflete towne, and treading the path of his predecessors, emptieth his
 chanell to the maintenance of the sea.

 Now come I to the course of the Witham, a famous riuer, whereof goeth
 the biword, frequented of old, and also of Ancolme, which I before
 described:


   Ancolme ele, and Witham pike,
   Search all England and find not the like.

 [Sidenote: Lindis, Witham, Rhe.]
 Leland calleth it Lindis, diuerse the Rhe, and I haue read all these
 names my selfe: and thereto that the Lincolneshire men were called in
 old time Coritani, and their head citie Lindus, Lindon, or Linodunum, in
 which region also Ptolomie placeth Rage, which some take to be
 Notingham, except my memorie doo faile me. It riseth among the Wickhams,
 in the edge of Lincolnshire, and (as I take it) in south-Wickham paroch,
 from whence it goeth to Colsterworth, Easton, Kirkestoke Paunton, and
 Paunton Houghton, and at Grantham taketh in a rill from by southwest, as
 I heare. From Grantham it runneth to Man, Thorpe, Bolton, and Barneston,
 where crossing a becke from northeast, it proceedeth further southwest
 ward by Mereston, toward Faston (there also taking in a brooke that
 riseth about Denton, and goeth by Sidbrooke) it hasteth to Dodington,
 Clapale, Barmebie, Beckingham, Stapleford, Bassingham, Thursbie, and
 beneath Amburgh crosseth a water that commeth from Stogilthorpe by
 Somerton castell.

 After this confluence also, our Witham goeth still foorth on his waie to
 the Hickhams, Boltham, Bracebridge, and Lincolne it selfe, for which the
 Normans write Nicholl by transposition of the letters, or (as I may
 better saie) corruption of the word. But yer it come there, it maketh
 certeine pooles (whereof one is called Swan poole) and soone after
 diuiding it selfe into armes, they run both thorough the lower part of
 Lincolne, each of them hauing a bridge of stone ouer it, thereby to
 passe through the principall street: and as the bigger arme is well able
 to beare their fisher botes, so the lesser is not without his seuerall
 [Sidenote: Fosse dike.]
 commodities. At Lincolne also this noble riuer meeteth with the Fosse
 dike, whereby in great floods vessels may come from the Trents side to
 Lincolne. For betweene Torkseie, where it beginneth, and Lincolne citie,
 where it endeth, are not aboue seuen miles, as Leland hath remembred.
 Bishop Atwater began to clense this ditch, thinking to bring great
 vessels from Trent to Lincolne in his time: but sith he died before it
 was performed, there hath no man beene since so well minded as to
 prosecute his purpose. The course moreouer of this our streame
 following, from Lincolne to Boston is fiftie miles by water: but if you
 mind to ferrie, you shall haue but 24. For there are foure common places
 where men are ferried ouer; as Short ferrie, fiue miles from Lincolne,
 Tatersall ferrie, eight miles from Short ferrie, Dogdike ferrie a mile,
 Langreth ferrie fiue miles, and so manie finallie to Boston.

 But to go forward with the course of Lindis (whereof the whole prouince
 hath beene called Lindeseie) when it is past Lincolne, it goeth by
 Shepewash, Wassingburg, Fiskerton, and soone after taketh in sundrie
 riuers in one chanell, whereby his greatnesse is verie much increased.
 From this confluence it goeth to Bardolfe, and there receiuing a rill
 (descending from betweene Sotbie and Randbie, and going by Harton) it
 slideth foorth by Tupham to Tatersall castell, taking vp there in like
 sort three small rills by the waie, whereof I haue small notice as yet:
 and therefore I referre them vnto a further consideration to be had of
 them hereafter, if it shall please God that I may liue to haue the
 filing of these rude pamphlets yet once againe, & somewhat more leasure
 to peruse them than at this time is granted. Finallie, being past
 Tatersall, and Dogdike ferrie, the Witham goeth toward Boston, & thence
 into the sea. Thus haue I brieflie dispatched this noble riuer Witham.
 But hauing another note deliuered me thereof from a freend, I will yeeld
 so farre vnto his gratification, that I will remember his trauell here,
 and set downe also what he hath written thereof, although the riuer be
 sufficientlie described alredie.

 [Sidenote: Witham.]
 Into Witham therefore from by north, and seuen miles beneath Lincolne,
 [Sidenote: Hake.]
 there falleth a faire water, the head whereof is at Hakethorne, from
 whence it goeth by Hanworth, Snarford, Resbie, Stainton, and at
 Bullington meeteth with a water on ech side, whereof one commeth from
 Haiton and Turrington, the other from Sudbrooke, and likewise beneath
 Birlings with the third comming from Barkeworth by Stansted, and ioining
 all in one, soone after it is not long yer it fall into the chanell of
 Witham, and so are neuer more heard of. There is also a brooke by
 southwest, that commeth from Kirbie to Cateleie, Billingams, and the
 [Sidenote: Bane.]
 Ferrie. At Tatersall it meeteth with the Bane, which riseth aboue Burgh,
 and neere vnto Ludford goeth downe to Dunnington, Stanigod, Hemmingsbie,
 Bamburgh, Fillington, Horne castell, (where it crosseth a rill from
 Belchworth) Thornton, Marton, Halton, Kirkebie, Comsbie, Tatersall, and
 so to Dogdike ferrie.

 Aboue Boston likewise it taketh in a water comming from Lusebie by
 Bolingbrooke, Stickeford, Stickneie, Sibbeseie and Hildrike. And to
 Boston towne it selfe doo finallie come sundrie brookes in one chanell,
 called Hammond becke, which rising at Donesbie, runneth on to
 Wrightbold, where it casteth one arme into Holiwell water. Thence it
 hasteth toward Dunnington, receiuing four brookes by the waie, whereof
 the first commeth from Milthorpe, the second from Fokingham, called
 [Sidenote: Bollingborow.]
 [Sidenote: Sempringham.]
 Bollingborow, or (after some, I wote not vpon what occasion) Sempringham
 water, the third from Bridge end, the fourth from Sempringham, and
 afterwards the maine streame is found to run by Kirton holme, and so
 into the Witham. Into the Wiland likewise falleth the Holiwell, which
 riseth of a spring that runneth toward the east from Haliwell to Onebie,
 Esonden, Gretford, and so to Catbridge, where it receiueth another
 rising at Witham and west of Manthorpe, and the second comming from Laund,
 and so run from thence togither to Willesthorpe and Catbridge, and then
 into the Haliwell, which after these confluences goeth to Tetford and
 Eastcote, where it meeteth with a draine, comming from Bourne, and so
 through the fennes to Pinchbecke, Surfleet, and Fosdike, where it
 meeteth with the Welland, in the mouth of the Wash, as I haue noted vnto
 you.

 [Sidenote: Wiland.]
 Hauing thus set foorth the riuers that fall into the Witham, now come we
 to the Wiland or Welland, wherevnto we repaire after we be past Boston,
 as drawing by litle and litle toward the Girwies, which inhabit in the
 fennes (for Gir in the old Saxon speach dooth signifie deepe fennes and
 marishes) and these beginning at Peterborow eastward, extend themselues
 by the space of three score miles & more, as Hugh of Peterborow writeth.
 This streame riseth about Sibbertoft, and running betweene Bosworth and
 Howthorpe, it goeth to Feedingworth, Merson, Bubberham, Trussell,
 [Sidenote: Braie.]
 Herborow (receiuing there the Braie, which commeth from Braiebrooke
 castell) to Bowton, Weston, Wiland, Ashleie, Medburne, Rokingham, and
 Cawcot, where a riueret called little Eie meeteth withall, comming from
 east Norton by Alexstone, Stocke, Fasten, and Drie stocke. From Cawcot
 it goeth to Gritto, Harringworth, Seton, Wauerlie, Duddington, Collie
 [Sidenote: Warke.]
 Weston, Eston, and there ioineth with the third called Warke, not far
 from Ketton, which commeth from Lie by Preston, Wing, Lindon, Luffenham,
 [Sidenote: Brooke water.]
 &c. Thence it goeth on by Tinwell, to Stanford (crossing the Brooke
 [Sidenote: Whitnell.]
 water, and Whitnelbecke, both in one bottome) and from Stanford by
 Talington, Mareie, to Mercate Deeping, Crowland (where it almost meeteth
 with the Auon) then to Spalding, Whapland, and so into the sea.

 Leland writing of this Wiland, addeth these words which I will not omit,
 sith in mine opinion they are worthie to be noted, for better
 consideration to be had in the said water and his course. The Wiland
 (saith he) going by Crowland, at Newdrene diuideth it selfe into two
 [Sidenote: Newdrene.]
 branches, of which one goeth vp to Spalding called Newdrene, and so into
 [Sidenote: South.]
 the sea at Fossedike Stow: the other named the South into Wisbech. This
 latter also parteth it selfe two miles from Crowland, & sendeth a rill
 [Sidenote: Writhlake.]
 called Writhlake by Thorneie, where it meeteth with an arme of the Nene,
 that commeth from Peterborow, and holdeth course with the broad streame,
 till it be come to Murho, six miles from Wisbech, where it falleth into
 the South.

 [Sidenote: Sheepees eie.]
 Out of the South in like sort falleth another arme called Sheepes eie
 and at Hopelode (which is foureteene miles from Lin) did fall into the
 sea. But now the course of that streame is ceased, wherevpon the
 inhabitants susteine manie grieuous flouds, bicause the mouth is
 stanched, by which it had accesse before into the sea. Hitherto Leland.
 Of the course of this riuer also from Stanford, I note this furthermore
 out of another writing in my time. Being past Stanton (saith he) it
 goeth by Burghleie, Vffington, Tallington, Mareie, Deeping, east
 Deeping, and comming to Waldram hall, it brancheth into two armes,
 whereof that which goeth to Singlesole, receiueth the Nene out of
 Cambridgeshire, and then going by Dowesdale, Trekenhole, and winding at
 last to Wisbech, it goeth by Liuerington, saint Maries, and so into the
 sea. The other arme hasteth to Crowland, Clowthouse, Bretherhouse,
 Pikale, Cowbecke and Spalding. Here also it receiueth the Baston dreane,
 Longtoft dreane, Deeping dreane, and thence goeth by Wickham into the
 sea, taking withall on the right hand sundrie other dreanes. And thus
 farre he.

 Next of all, when we are past these, we come to another fall of water
 into the Wash, which descendeth directlie from Whaplade dreane to
 Whaplade towne in Holland: but bicause it is a water of small
 importance, I passe from thence, as hasting to the Nene, of both the
 more noble riuer: and about the middest thereof in place is a certeine
 swallow, so deepe and so cold in the middest of summer, that no man dare
 diue to the bottome thereof for coldnesse, and yet for all that in
 winter neuer found to haue beene touched with frost, much lesse to be
 [Sidenote: Auon.]
 couered with ise. The next therefore to be described is the Auon,
 [Sidenote: Nene.]
 otherwise called Nene, which the said author describeth after this
 maner. The Nene beginneth foure miles aboue Northampton in Nene meere,
 where it riseth out of two heads, which ioine about Northampton. Of this
 riuer the citie and countrie beareth the name, although we now pronounce
 Hampton for Auondune, which errour is committed also in south Auondune,
 as we may easilie see. In another place Leland describeth the said riuer
 after this maner. The Auon riseth in Nene meere field, and going by
 Oundale and Peterborow, it diuideth it selfe into three armes, whereof
 one goeth to Horneie, another to Wisbech, the third to Ramseie: and
 afterward being vnited againe, they fall into the sea not verie farre
 from Lin. Finallie, the descent of these waters leaue here a great sort
 of Ilands, wherof Elie, Crowland, and Mersland, are the chiefe. Hitherto
 Leland.

 Howbeit, because neither of these descriptions touch the course of this
 riuer at the full, I will set downe the third, which shall supplie
 whatsoeuer the other doo want. The Auon therefore arising in Nenemere
 field, is increased with manie rilles, before it come at Northampton, &
 one aboue Kings thorpe, from whence it goeth to Dallington, and so to
 Northhampton, where it receiueth the Wedon. And here I will staie, till
 [Sidenote: Vedunus.]
 I haue described this riuer. The Wedon therefore riseth at Faulesse in
 master Knightlies pooles, and in Badbie plashes also are certeine
 springs that resort vnto this streame. Faulesse pooles are a mile from
 Chareton, where the head of Chare riuer is, that runneth to Banberie.
 There is but an hill called Alberie hill betweene the heads of these two
 riuers.

 From the said hill therefore the Wedon directeth his course to Badbie,
 Newenham, Euerton, Wedon, betwixt which and Floretowne, it receiueth the
 [Sidenote: Florus.]
 Florus (a pretie water rising of foure heads, whereof the one is at
 Dauentrie, another at Watford, the third at long Bucke, the fourth aboue
 Whilton) and then passeth on to Heiford, Kislingberie, Vpton, and so to
 Northhampton, where it falleth into the Auon, receiuing finallie by the
 [Sidenote: Bugius.]
 waie the Bugbrooke water at Heiford, Patshall water neere Kislingberie,
 and finallie Preston water beneath Vpton, which running from Preston by
 Wootton, meeteth at the last with Milton rill, and so fall into Auon.
 Now to resume the tractation of our Auon. From Northhampton therefore it
 runneth by Houghton, great Billing, Whitstone, Dodington, and
 Willingborow, where we must staie a while: for betweene Willingborow and
 [Sidenote: Kilis.]
 Higham ferries, it receiueth a pretie water comming from about Kilmarsh,
 which going by Ardingworth, Daisborow, Rusheton, Newton, Gaddington,
 Boughton, Warketon, Kettering, Berton, and Burton, meeteth there with
 [Sidenote: Rother.]
 Rothwell water, which runneth west of Kettering to Hisham, the greater
 Haridon, and then into the Auon.

 Being therfore past Burton, our maine streame goeth to Higham Ferries,
 Artleborow, Ringsted, Woodford, and (meeting thereby with Cranford rill)
 [Sidenote Ocleie.]
 to Thraxton, north whereof it ioineth also with the Ocleie water, that
 commeth from Sudborow and Lowicke, to old Vmkles, Waden ho, Pilketon,
 Toke (where it taketh in the Liueden becke) and so to Oundell,
 Cotterstocke, Tansoner, and betweene Tothering and Warmington receiueth
 [Sidenote: Corbie.]
 the Corbie water, which rising at Corbie, goeth by Weldon, Denethap,
 Bulwich, Bletherwijc, Fineshed, Axthorpe, Newton, Tothering, and so into
 the Auon. After this, the said Auon goeth to Elton, Massittgton,
 Yerwell, Sutton, Castor, Allerton, and so to Peterborow, where it
 diuideth it selfe into sundrie armes, and those into seuerall branches
 and draines, among the fennes and medowes, not possible almost to be
 numbred, before it meet with the sea on the one side of the countrie,
 and fall into the Ouze on the other.

 [Sidenote: Isis 3.]
 The Ouze, which Leland calleth the third Isis, falleth into the sea
 betweene Mersland & Downeham. The chiefe head of this riuer ariseth
 neere to Stanes, from whence it commeth to Brackleie (sometime a noble
 towne in Northampton shire, but now scarselie a good village) and there
 taking in on the left hand one water comming from the parke betweene
 [Sidenote: Sisa.]
 Sisam and Astwell (which runneth by Whitfield and Tinweston) and another
 [Sidenote: Imelus.]
 on the right from Imleie, it goeth on by Westbirie, Fulwell, water
 Stretford, Buckingham, and Berton, beneath which towne the Erin falleth
 into it, whereof I find this short description to be inserted here. The
 [Sidenote: Erin.]
 Erin riseth not farre from Hardwijc in Northamptonshire, from hence it
 goeth by Heth, Erinford, Godderington, Twiford, Steeple Cladon, & yer it
 [Sidenote: Garan.]
 come at Padbirie, meeteth with the Garan brooke descending from
 Garanburge, and so they go togither by Padbirie, till they fall into the
 Ouze, which carieth them after the confluence to Thorneton bridge (where
 they crosse another fall of water comming from Whitlewood forrest by
 Luffeld, Lecamsted and Foscot) and so to Beachampton, Culuerton, Stonie
 Stratford, and Woluerton.

 [Sidenote: Verus.]
 Here the Ouze meeteth with a water (called, as Leland coniectureth, the
 Vere or Were) on the left hand, as you go downewards, that commeth
 betweene Wedon and Wexenham in Northamptonshire, and goeth by Towcester,
 and Alderton, and not farre from Woluerton and Hauersham into the
 foresaid Ouze, which goeth also from hence to Newportpaganell, where in
 like sort I must staie a while till I haue described another water,
 [Sidenote: Cle alias Claius.]
 named the Clee, by whose issue the said streame is not a little
 increased. This riuer riseth in the verie confines betweene Buckingham
 and Bedfordshires, not farre from Whippesnade, and going on toward the
 northwest, by Eaton and Laiton, it commeth to Linchlade, where it
 entreth whollie into Buckinghamshire, and so goeth on by Hammond,
 Brickle, Fennie Stratford, Simpson, Walton and Middleton, beneath which
 [Sidenote: Saw.]
 it receiueth the Saw from aboue Halcot, and so goeth on till it meet
 with the Ouze neere vnto Newport, as I haue said. Being vnited
 therefore, we set forward from the said towne, and follow this noble
 riuer, to Lathbirie, Thuringham, Filgrane, Lawndon, Newington, Bradfield
 on the one side, and Turueie on the other, till it come at length to
 Bedford after manie windlesses, and then meeteth with another streame,
 which is increased with so manie waters, that I was inforced to make an
 imagined staie here also, and view their seuerall courses, supposing my
 selfe to looke downe from the highest steeple in Bedford, whence (as
 best meane to view anie countrie wheresoeuer) I note the same as
 followeth.

 Certes on the east side, where I began this speculation, I saw one that
 came from Potton, and met withall neere Becliswade: another that grew of
 two waters, wherof one descended from Baldocke, the other from Hitchin,
 which ioined beneth Arleseie, and thence went to Langford and Edworth.
 [Sidenote: These rise not far from Michelborow
 & one of them in Higham parke.]
 The third which I beheld had in like sort two heads, wherof one is not
 farre from Wood end, the other from Wooburne (or Howburne), and ioining
 about Flitwijc, they go to Flitton (where they receiue Antill brooke)
 and so by Chiphill, and Chicksand, they come to Shafford, from whence
 taking the aforsaid Langford water with them, they go foorth by
 Becliswade, Sandie, Blumham, and neere vnto Themisford are vnited with
 the Ouze. And now to our purpose againe.

 [Sidenote: Verus or the Were.]
 After this the Ouze goeth by Berkeford, to Winteringham (meeting there
 with the Wareslie becke) and so runneth to S. Neotes (or saint Nedes, in
 [Sidenote: Stoueus.]
 old time Goluesburg, as Capgraue saith In vita Neoti) to Paxston,
 Offordes, and so to Godmanchester, in old time called Gumicester, which
 (as it should seeme) hath beene a towne of farre greater countenance
 than at this present it is; for out of the ruines thereof much Romane
 coine is found, and sometimes with the image of C. Antius which hath
 long haire, as the Romans had before they receiued barbars into their
 citie, and therevnto the bones of diuerse men of farre greater stature
 than is credible to be spoken of in these daies. But what stand I vpon
 these things? From hence therfore our water goeth on to Huntingdon,
 Wilton, saint Iues, Holiwell, and Erith, receiueth in the meane time the
 [Sidenote: Stoueus.]
 [Sidenote: Helenus.]
 [Sidenote: Elmerus.]
 Stow (neere vnto little Paxton) and likewise the Ellen, and the Emmer,
 in one chanell a little by west of Huntingdon.

 Finallie, the maine streame spreading abroad into the Fennes, I cannot
 tell into how manie branches, neither how manie Ilets are inforced by
 the same; although of Iles, Marshland, Ancarig or Ancarie be the chiefe,
 and of which this later is called Crowland (as Crowland also hight
 thornie A cruda terra, or store of bushes saith Hugo le Blanc) sometime
 growing in the same, and Ancarijc because sundrie Ancres haue liued &
 borne great swaie therein. But howsoeuer this case standeth, this is
 certeine, that after it hath thus delited it selfe with ranging a while
 about the pleasant bottoms & lower grounds, it meeteth with the Granta,
 from whence it goeth with a swift course vnto Downeham. Betweene it also
 and the Auon, are sundrie large meeres or plashes, by southwest of
 Peterborow full of powts and carpes, whereof Whittleseie meere, and
 [Sidenote: Riuelus.]
 Ramseie meere (whereinto the Riuall falleth), that commeth from aboue
 Broughton, Wiston, and great Riuelleie) are said to be greatest. Of all
 [Sidenote: Granta.]
 the riuers that run into this streame, that called Granta (whereof the
 whole countie in old time was called Grantabrycshire, as appeereth by
 the register of Henrie prior of Canturburie) is the most noble and
 excellent, which I will describe euen in this place, notwithstanding
 that I had earst appointed it vnto my second booke. But for somuch as a
 description of Ouze and Granta were deliuered me togither, I will for
 his sake that gaue them me, not separate them now in sunder.

 The verie furthest head and originall of this riuer is in Henham, a
 large parke belonging to the earle of Sussex, wherein (as the townesmen
 saie) are foure springs that run foure sundrie waies into the maine sea.
 Leland sought not the course of this water aboue Newport pond, and
 therefore in his commentaries vpon the song of the swan, he writeth
 thereof after this maner insuing. Although doctor Iohn Caius the learned
 physician, and some other are of the opinion, that this riuer comming
 from Newport, is properlie to be called the Rhee: but I may not so
 easilie dissent from Leland, whose iudgement in my mind is by a great
 deale the more likelie. Harken therefore what he saith.

 The head of Grantha or Granta, is in the pond at Newport, a towne of the
 east Saxons, which going in a bottome beside the same, receiueth a
 pretie rill, which in the middest thereof dooth driue a mill, and
 descendeth from Wickin Bonhant, that standeth not farre from thence.
 Being past Newport, it goeth alongst in the lower ground, vntill it come
 to Broke Walden, west of Chipping Walden (now Saffron Walden) hard by
 the lord Awdleis place, where the right honorable Thomas Howard with his
 houshold doo soiourne, and sometime stood an abbeie of Benedictine
 moonks, before their generall suppression. From Awdleie end it goeth to
 Littleburie, the lesse and greater Chesterfords, Yealdune, Hincstone,
 [Sidenote: Babren.]
 Seoston or Sawson, and neere vnto Shaleford receiueth the Babren that
 commeth by Linton, Abbington, Babrenham, and Stapleford: and so going
 forward it commeth at the last to Trompington, which is a mile from
 Cambridge. But yer it come altogither to Trompington, it meeteth with
 [Sidenote: Rhee.]
 the Barrington water, as Leland calleth it, but some other the Rhee (a
 common name to all waters in the Saxon speech) whereof I find this
 description, to be touched by the waie. The Rhee riseth short of Ashwell
 in Hertfordshire, and passing under the bridge betweene Gilden Mordon
 and Downton, and leauing Tadlow on the west side (as I remember) it
 goeth toward Crawden, Malton, Barrington, Haselingfield, and so into
 Granta, taking sundrie rills with him from south and southwest, as
 Wendie water southwest of Crawden, Whaddon brooke southwest of Orwell,
 Mildred becke southwest of Malton, and finallie the Orme which commeth
 out of Armington or Ormendum well, and goeth by Fulmere and Foxton, and
 falleth into the same betweene Barrington and Harleston, or Harston; as
 they call it.

 Now to proceed with our Granta. From Trompington on the one side, and
 Grantcester, on the other, it hasteth to Cambridge ward, taking the
 Burne with it by the waie, which descendeth from a castell of the same
 denomination, wherein the Picotes and Peuerels sometime did inhabit.
 Thence it goeth by sundrie colleges in Cambridge, as the queenes
 college, the kings college, Clare hall, Trinitie college, S. Johns, &c:
 vnto the high bridge of Cambridge, and betweene the towne and the
 [Sidenote: Sturus.]
 castell to Chesterton, and receiuing by and by the Stoure, or Sture (at
 whose bridge the most famous mart in England is yearlie holden and kept)
 from Chesterton it goeth to Ditton, Milton, and yer long meeting with
 two rilles (from Bottesham and Wilberham, in one bottome) it runneth to
 [Sidenote: Bulbecke.]
 Horningseie, & Water Bech: and finallie here ioining with the Bulbecke
 water, it goeth by Dennie, and so forth into the Ouze, fifteene miles
 from Cambridge, as Leland hath set downe. And thus much of the third
 Isis or Ouze, out of the aforesaid author: wherevnto I haue not onelie
 added somewhat of mine owne experience, but also of other mens notes,
 whose diligent obseruation of the course of this riuer hath not a little
 helped me in the description of the same. Now it resteth that we come
 neerer to the coast of Northfolke, and set foorth such waters as we
 passe by vpon the same, wherein I will deale so preciselie as I may: and
 so farre will I trauell therein, as I hope shall content euen the curious
 reader: or if anie fault be made, it shall not be so great, but that
 after some trauell in the finding, it shall with ease be corrected.

 The first riuer that therefore we come vnto, after we be past the
 confluence of Granta, and the Ouze, and within the iurisdiction of
 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 Northfolke, is called the Burne. This streame riseth not verie farre
 from Burne Bradfield, aboue the greater Wheltham, and from thence it
 goeth on to Nawnton, Burie, Farneham Martin, Farneham Alhallowes,
 Farneham Genouefa, Hengraue, Flemton, Lackeford, Icklingham, and to
 [Sidenote: Dale.]
 Milden hall: a little beneath which, it meeteth with the Dale water,
 that springeth not farre from Catilege, and going by Asheleie, Moulton
 (a benefice as the report goeth not verie well prouided for) to Kenford,
 Kenet, Bradingham, Frekenham, it falleth at the last not farre from
 Iselham into the Burne, from whence they go togither as one into the
 Ouze. With the Burne also there ioineth a water comming from about
 Lidgate, a little beneath Iselham, and not verie far from Mildenhall.

 [Sidenote: Dunus.]
 The Dune head, and rising of Wauenheie, are not much in sunder: for as
 it is supposed, they are both not farre distant from the bridge betweene
 Loph[=a]m and Ford, wherby the one runneth east and the other west, as I
 haue beene informed. The Dune goeth first of all by Feltham, then to
 Hopton, & to Kinets hall, where it meeteth with a water c[=o]ming out of
 a lake short of Banham (going, by Quiddenham, Herling, Gasthorpe) and so
 on, both in one chanell, they run to Ewston. Here they meet in like
 sort, with another descending from two heads, wherof the one is neere
 vnto Pakenham, the other to Tauestocke, as I heare. Certes these heads
 ioine aboue Ilesworth, not farre from Stow Langtoft, from whence they go
 to Yxworth, Thorpe, Berdwell, Hunnington, Fakenham, and so into the Dune
 at Ewston; as I said. From hence also they hasten to Downeham, which of
 this riuer dooth seeme to borow his name. South Ree rill I passe ouer as
 not worthie the description, because it is so small.

 [Sidenote: Bradunus forte.]
 Next vnto this riuer on the south side is the Braden, or Bradunus, which
 riseth at Bradenham, and goeth by Necton, north Peckenham, south
 Peckenham, Kirsingham, Bedneie, Langford, Igbor, Munford, North Old,
 Stockebridge, Ferdham, Helgie, and so into the Ouze. The neerest vnto
 [Sidenote: Linus.]
 this is another which riseth about Lukeham, and from thence commeth to
 Lexham, Massingham, Newton, the castell Acre, Acres, Nerboe, Pentneie,
 Wrongeie, Rounghton (which at one time might haue beene my liuing if I
 would haue giuen sir Thomas Rugband money inough, but now it belongeth
 to Gundeuill and Caius college in Cambridge) Westchurch, and so to
 Linne. As so dooth also another by north of this, which commeth from the
 [Sidenote: Congunus.]
 east hilles by Congenham, Grimston, Bawseie, Gaiwood, whereof let this
 suffice. And now giue eare to the rest sith I am past the Ouze. Being
 [Sidenote: Rising.]
 past the mouth or fall of the Ouze, we meet next of all with the Rising
 chase water, which Ptolomie (as some thinke) doth call Metaris, and
 [Sidenote: Ingell.]
 descendeth from two heads, and also the Ingell that commeth from about
 Snetsham. From hence we go by the point of saint Edmund, and so hold on
 our course till we come vnto the Burne, which falleth into the sea by
 south from Waterden, and going betweene the Crakes to Burnham Thorpe,
 and Burnham Norton, it striketh at the last into the sea; east of
 Burnham Norton a mile at the least, except my coniecture doo faile me.
 [Sidenote: Glouius.]
 The Glow or Glowie riseth not far from Baconsthorpe, in the hundred of
 Tunsted; & going by and by into Holt hundred, it passeth by Hunworth,
 Thornage, Glawnsford, Blackneie, Clare, and so into the sea, receiuing
 there at hand also a rill by east, which descendeth from the hilles
 lieng betweene Killing towne and Waiburne.

 [Sidenote: Wantsume.]
 The Wantsume riseth in Northfolke at Galesend in Holt hundred, from
 whence it goeth to Watersend, Townton, Skelthorpe, Farneham, Pensthorpe,
 Rieburg, Ellingham, and Billingsford. And here it receiueth two waters
 in one bottome, of which the first goeth by Stanfield and Beteleie, the
 other by Wandling and Gressonhall, and so run on ech his owne waie, till
 they meet at Houndlington, southwest of Billingsford with the Wantsume.
 From hence they go all togither to Below, Ieng, Weston, and Moreton; but
 [Sidenote: Yocus.]
 yer it come to Moreton, it meeteth with the Yowke, which (issuing about
 Yexham) goeth by Matteshall and Barrow. After this the said Wantsume
 goeth on by Ringland, and so to Norwich the pontificall see of the bishop,
 to whome that iurisdiction apperteineth, which seemeth by this memoriall
 yet remaining in the corrupted name of the water, to be called in old
 time Venta, or (as Leland addeth) Venta Icenorum. But to proceed.
 Beneath Norwich also it receiueth two waters in one chanell, which I
 will seuerallie describe, according to their courses, noting their
 confluence to be at Bixleie, within two miles of Norwich, except my
 annotation deceiue me. The first of these hath two heads wherof one
 mounteth vp southwest of Whinborow, goeth by Gerneston, and is the verie
 [Sidenote: Hierus.]
 [Sidenote: Gerus.]
 Hiere or Yare that drowneth the name of Wantsume, so soone as he meeteth
 withall. The other head riseth at Wood in Mitford hundred, and after
 confluence with the Hiere at Caston, going by Brandon, Bixton, Berford,
 Erleham, Cringlefield (not farre from Bixleie as I said) doth meet with
 his companion, which is the second to be described as followeth. It hath
 two heads also that meet northwest of Therstane; and hereof the one
 commeth from Findon hall, by Wrenningham from about Wotton, by Hemnall,
 Fretton, Stretton, and Tasborow, till they ioine at Therston, as I gaue
 notice aforehand. From Therston therefore they go togither in one to
 Newton, Shotesham, Dunston, Castor, Arminghale, Bixleie, Lakenham, and
 Trowse, and then fall into the Wantsume beneath Norwich, which hereafter
 is named Hiere. The Hiere, Yare, or Gare therefore proceeding in his
 voiage, as it were to salute his grandame the Ocean, goeth from thence
 by Paswijc, Surlingham, Claxton, and Yardleie; and here it meeteth
 againe with another riueret descending from about Shotesham to
 Therstane, Shedgraue, Hockingham, and so into Gare or Yare, whereof
 Yardleie the towne receiueth denomination. After this it goeth to
 [Sidenote: Wauen.]
 Frethorpe, and aboue Burgh castell meeteth with the Waueneie, and so
 into the sea.

 [Sidenote: Bure.]
 Into this riuer also falleth the Bure, which rising at a towne of the
 same name, passeth by Milton, Buresdune, Corpesteie, Marington,
 Blekeling, Bure, Alesham, Brampton, Buxton, Horsted, Werxham bridge,
 [Sidenote: Thurinus.]
 Horning, Raneworth; and beneath Bastewijc receiueth the Thurine which
 riseth aboue Rolesbie; then to Obie, Clipsbie (there also receiuing
 another from Filbie) Rimham, Castor, and by Yarmouth into the Ocean. The
 Waueneie afore mentioned, riseth on the south side of Brisingham, and is
 a limit betweene Northfolke and Suffolke. Going therefore by Dis,
 Starton, not farre from Octe, it meeteth with the Eie, which riseth
 neere Ockold, or betweene it and Braisworth, & goeth on by Brome, Octe,
 [Sidenote: Wauen.]
 and so into the Waueneie. From thence our Waueneie runneth by Silam,
 Brodish, Nedam, Harleston, Rednam, Alborow, Flixton, Bungeie,
 Sheepemedow, Barsham, Beckles, Albie, & at Whiteacre (as I heare)
 parteth in twaine, or receiuing Milford water (which is most likelie) it
 [Sidenote: Einus.]
 goeth along by Somerleie, Hormingfleet, S. Olaues, (there receiuing the
 [Sidenote: Fritha.]
 Frithstane or Fristan brooke, out of low or litle England) Fristan &
 Burgh castell, where it meeteth with the Hiere, & from thencefoorth
 accompanieth it (as I said) vnto the sea. Willingham water commeth by
 Hensted, Einsted, or Enistate, and falleth into the sea by south of
 Kesland.

 [Sidenote: Cokelus.]
 The Cokell riseth south southwest of Cokeleie towne in Blithe hundred,
 and neere vnto Hastelworth it meeteth with the rill that commeth from
 Wisset, and so going on togither by Wenhaston, and Bliborow, it falleth
 into the sea at an hauen betweene Roidon and Walderswicke. A little rill
 runneth also thereinto from Eston by Sowold, and another from Dunwich,
 by Walderswijke: and hereby it wanteth little that Eston Nesse is not
 cut off and made a pretie Iland.

 [Sidenote: Ford.]
 The Ford riseth at Yoxford, and going by Forderleie, and Theberton, it
 [Sidenote: Orus.]
 falleth at last into Mismere creeke. Into the Oreford hauen runneth one
 water comming from Aldborow ward, by a narrow passage from the north
 [Sidenote: Fromus.]
 into the south. By west wherof (when we are past a little Ile) it
 receiueth the second, descending from betweene Talingston and Framingham
 in Plomes hundred; which c[=o]ming at last to Marleford, meeteth with a
 [Sidenote: Glema.]
 rill southwest of Farnham called the Gleme (that commeth by Rendlesham,
 the Gleinhams) and so passing foorth, it taketh another at Snapesbridge,
 comming from Carleton by Saxmundham, Sternefield & Snape. Then going to
 [Sidenote: Iken, or Ike.]
 Iken (where it meeteth with the third rill at the west side) it fetcheth
 a compasse by Sudburne east of Orford, and so into the hauen. Next vnto
 this by west of Orford, there runneth vp another creeke by Butleie,
 whereinto the waters comming from Cellesford, and from the Ike, doo run
 both in one bottome. And thus much of Orford hauen.

 [Sidenote: Deua.]
 The Deue riseth in Debenham, in the hundred of Hertesmeere, and from
 thence goeth to Mickford, Winston, Cretingham, Lethringham, Wickham,
 hitherto still creeping toward the south: but then going in maner full
 south, it runneth neere vnto Ash, Rendlesham, Vfford, Melton, and
 Woodbridge, beneath which it receiueth on the west side, a water comming
 of two heads, wherof one is by north from Oteleie, and the other by
 south from Henleie, which ioining west of Mertelsham, go vnto the said
 towne and so into the Deue, east of Mertelsham abouesaid. From thence
 the Deue goeth by Waldringfield and Henleie, and meeting soone after
 [Sidenote: Clarus fons.]
 with Brightwell brooke, it hasteth into the maine sea, leauing Bawdseie
 on the east, where the fall therof is called Bawdseie hauen.

 [Sidenote: Vrus.]
 Vre riseth not farre from Bacton, in Hertesmeere hundred, and thense
 descendeth into Stow hundred by Gipping Newton, Dagworth, Stow (beneath
 which it meeteth with a water comming from Rattlesden, by one house) and
 so going on to Nedeham (through Bosmeere and Claidon hundreds) to
 Blakenham, Bramford, Ypswich, receiuing beneath Stoke, which lieth ouer
 against Ypswich, the Chatsham water, that goeth by Belsted, and so into
 the Vre, at the mouth whereof is a maruellous deepe and large pit,
 whereof some marriners saie that they could neuer find the bottome, and
 therefore calling it a well, and ioining the name of the riuer withall,
 it commeth to passe that the hauen there is called Vrewell, for which in
 these daies we doo pronounce it Orwell. Into this hauen also the Sture
 or Stoure hath readie passage, which remaineth in this treatise next of
 all to be described.

 [Sidenote: Sturus.]
 The Sture or Stoure parteth Essex from Suffolke, as Houeden saith, and
 experience confirmeth. It ariseth in Suffolke, out of a lake neere vnto
 a towne called Stourmeere. For although there come two rilles vnto the
 same, whereof the one descendeth from Thirlo, the Wratings and Ketton,
 the other from Horshed parke, by Hauerill, &c: yet in summer time they
 are often drie, so that they cannot be said to be perpetuall heads vnto
 the aforesaid riuer. The Stoure therefore (being, as I take it, called
 by Ptolomie, Edomania, for thereon toward the mouth standeth a prettie
 towne named Manitree, which carieth some shadow of that ancient name
 thereof vnto this daie, if my coniecture be any thing) ariseth at
 Stouremeere, which is a poole conteining twentie acres of ground at the
 least, the one side whereof is full of alders, the other of reeds,
 wherin the great store of fish there bred, is not a little succoured.
 From this meere also it goeth to Bathorne bridge, to Stocke clare,
 Cawndish, Pentlo, Paules Beauchampe, Milford, Foxerth, Buresleie,
 Sudburie, Bures, Boxsted, Stoke, Nailand, Lanham, Dedham, Strotford,
 east Barfold, Brampton, Manitree, Catwade bridge, and so into the sea,
 where in the verie fall also it ioineth with Orwell hauen, so neere that
 of manie they are reputed as one, and parted but by a shingle that dooth
 run along betweene them: neither dooth it passe cleere in this voiage,
 but as it were often occupied by the waie, in receiuing sundrie brookes
 and rilles not heere to be omitted.

 For on Essex side it hath one from Hemsted, which goeth by Bumsted, and
 Birdbrooke: another rising short of Foxerth, that runneth by water
 Beauchampe, Brundon, and falleth into the same at Badlington, west of
 Sudburie: and the third that glideth by Horkesleie, and meeteth withall
 west of Boxsted. On the north, or vpon Suffolke side, it receiueth one
 descending from Catiledge, by Bradleie, Thurlow, Wratting, Kiddington,
 and at Hauerell falleth into this Sture. The second descendeth northward
 from Posling field, and ioineth therewith east of Clare. It was in old
 time called Cicux or Ceuxis, and it meeteth with the Stoure in such wise
 that they seeme to make a right angle, in the point almost wherof
 standeth a ruinous castell. Howbeit as sithence which time this water
 (in some mens iudgement) hath beene named Clarus (not so much for the
 greatnesse as clearnesse of the streame) even so the Stoure it selfe was
 also called Ens as they say, and after their confluence the whole
 Clarens, which giueth denomination to a duchie of this Iland of no small
 fame and honour. But these are but meere fables, sith the word Clare is
 deriued from the towne, wherein was an house of religion erected to one
 Clara, and Clarens brought from the same, because of an honour the
 prince had in those parties: which may suffice to know from whence the
 name proceedeth. The third ariseth of two heads, whereof one commeth
 from Wickham brooke, the other from Chedbar in Risbie hundred, and
 ioining about Stanfield, it goeth by Hawton, Somerton, Boxsted,
 Stansted, and north of Foxerth falleth into Stoure. The fourth issueth
 from betweene the Waldingfields, and goeth by Edwardstone, Boxsted,
 Alington, Polsted, Stoke, and so at south Boxsted falleth into the same.
 The fift riseth northwest of Cockefield, and goeth to Cockefield,
 [Sidenote: Kettle baston.]
 Laneham, Brimsleie, Midling, and receiuing Kettle Baston water southwest
 of Chelsworth (and likewise the Breton that commeth from Bretenham, by
 Hitcheham, and Bisseton street on the south east of the same towne) it
 goeth in by Nedging, Aldham, Hadleie, Lainham, Shellie, Higham, and so
 into the Stoure. The sixt is a little rill descending southwest from
 Chappell. The seuenth riseth betweene Chappell and Bentleie, and going
 betweene Tatingston, and Whetsted, Holbrooke, and Sutton, it falleth at
 length into Stoure, and from thence is neuer heard of.

 [Sidenote: Ocleie.]
 As for Ocleie Drill, that riseth betweene Ocleie, and Wikes parkes, and
 so goeth into the Stoure, on Essex side, west of Harwich, and east of
 Ree Ile; I passe it ouer, because it is of it selfe but a rill, and not
 of anie greatnesse, till it come to the mill aboue Ramseie bridge, where
 I was once almost drowned (by reason of the ruinous bridge which leadeth
 ouer the streame being there verie great) as an arme of the sea that
 continuallie ebbeth & floweth. Next vnto this, we came to another that
 [Sidenote: Mosa.]
 runneth south of Beaumont by Mosse, and falleth into the sea about the
 middest of the Baie, betwixt Harwich and the Naze. Betwixt the Naze also
 and the mouth of Colne, is another rill, which riseth at little Bentleie,
 [Sidenote: Claco.]
 and thence goeth to Tendring thorpe, through Clacton parke by great
 Holland, and east of little Holland, into the deepe sea.

 [Sidenote: Colunus.]
 The Colne hath three heads, whereof one is at Ouington that goeth by
 Tilberie, and east of Yeldam falleth into the chiefe head which riseth
 about Redgewell in Essex, from whence also it goeth to Yeldam and
 Hedingham, otherwise called Yngham: also Hedningham or Heuedingham, [*]
 [Sidenote: * Sic.]
 or Heuedingham of the superioritie which accrued therevnto, because the
 chiefe lords of the same from time to time kept residence in the towne.
 For Heued or Hed signifieth The chiefe, in the old English language,
 which in the name of this and manie other townes and villages yet
 standing in England cannot easilie be forgotten. The third falleth in
 south of Yeldam, and being once met all in one chanell, and called the
 Colne, it goeth (as I said) to Hedningham, Hawsted, Erles Colne, Wakes
 Colne, Fordon, Bardfold, Colchester, in old time Camalodunum, and so
 into the sea at Brickleseie. Some thinke that Colchester and Camalodunum
 are sundrie cities and situat in diuerse places, whereby Maldon (or
 Ithancester out of whose ruines the said towne of Maldon was erected)
 should rather be Camalodunum than Colchester, but hereof I cannot iudge.
 Indeed if (as Leland saith) Maldon should be written Malodunum, it were
 a likelihood that there assertions should be probable. Some reason also
 may be gathered for the same out of Dion, and such as make the Thames
 mouth to take his beginning at Colchester water. But I dare not presume
 to conclude any thing hereof, least I should seeme rashlie to take hold
 of euerie coniecture. This I relie vpon rather as a more certeintie,
 that in the first edition of this treatise I was persuaded, that the sea
 entring by the Colne made three seuerall passages fr[=o] thence into the
 land: but now I vnderstand that these are seuerall entrances and
 streames, of which the Colne is one, another is the Salcote water, which
 commeth in beneath the Stroud (a causeie that leadeth vnto Merseie Ile,
 ouer which the sea meeteth with a contrarie course) and the third the
 faire arme that floweth vnto Maldon, and all these three haue their
 falles either ouer against or neere vnto the aforesaid Ile, which at a
 low water is not halfe a mile from the shore. Into the Colne or Colunus
 also (whereof Leland thinketh Colchester to take his name, and not A
 colonia Romanorum, although I may not consent to him herein) doo run
 manie salt creekes beneath Fingering ho, of whose names sith I doo not
 know, nor whether they be serued with anie backewaters or not, I giue
 ouer to intreat anie further & likewise of their positions. Into that of
 Maldon runneth manie faire waters, whereof I will saie so much as I know
 to be true in maner by experience.

 [Sidenote: Gwin or Pant.]
 There is a pretie water that beginneth neere vnto Gwinbach or Winbeche
 church in Essex, a towne of old, and yet belonging to the Fitzwaters,
 taking name of Gwin, which is beautifull or faire, & Bache that
 signifieth a wood: and not without cause, sith not onelie the hilles on
 ech side of the said rillet, but all the whole paroch hath sometime
 abounded in woods; but now in manner they are vtterlie decaied, as the
 like commoditie is euerie where, not onelie thorough excessiue building
 for pleasure more than profit, which is contrarie to the ancient end of
 building; but also for more increase of pasture & commoditie to the
 lords of the soile, through their sales of that emolument, whereby the
 poore tenants are inforced to buie their fewell, and yet haue their
 rents in triple maner inhanced.) This said brooke runneth directlie from
 thence vnto Radwinter, now a parcell of your lordships possessions in
 those parts, descended from the Chamberleins, who were sometime cheefe
 owners of the same. By the waie also it is increased with sundrie pretie
 springs, of which Pantwell is the cheefe (whereof some thinke the whole
 brooke to be named Pant) and which (to saie the truth) hath manie a
 leasing fathered on the same. Certes by the report of common fame it
 hath beene a pretie water, and of such quantitie, that botes haue come
 in time past from Bilie abbeie beside Maldon vnto the moores in
 Radwinter for corne. I haue heard also that an anchor was found there
 neere to a red willow, when the water-courses by act of parlement were
 surueied and reformed throughout England, which maketh not a little with
 the aforesaid relation. But this is strangest of all, that a lord
 sometime of Winbech (surnamed the great eater, because he would breake
 his fast with a whole calfe, and find no bones therein as the fable
 goeth) falling at contention with the lord Iohn of Radwinter, could
 worke him none other iniurie, but by stopping vp the head of Pantwell,
 to put by the vse of a mill which stood by the church of Radwinter, and
 was serued by that brooke abundantlie. Certes I know the place where the
 mill stood, and some posts thereof doo yet remaine. But see the malice
 of mankind, whereby one becommeth a woolfe vnto the other in their
 mischeeuous moodes. For when the lord saw his mill to be so spoiled, he
 in reuenge of his losse, brake the necke of his aduersarie, when he was
 going to horsebacke, as the constant report affirmeth. For the lord of
 Radwinter holding a parcell of his manour of Radwinter hall of the
 Fitzwaters, his sonne was to hold his stirrop at certeine times when he
 should demand the same. Shewing himselfe therefore prest on a time to
 doo his said seruice, as the Fitzwater was readie to lift his leg ouer
 the saddle, he by putting backe his foot, gaue him such a thrust that he
 fell backward, and brake his necke: wherevpon insued great trouble, till
 the matter was taken vp by publike authoritie; and that seruile office
 conuerted into a pound of pepper, which is trulie paid to this daie. But
 to leaue these impertinent discourses, and returne againe to the springs
 whereby our Pant or Gwin is increased. There is likewise another in a
 pasture belonging to the Grange, now in possession of William Bird
 esquier, who holdeth the same in the right of his wife, but in time past
 belonging to Tilteie abbeie. The third commeth out of the yard of one of
 your lordships manors there called Radwinter hall. The fourth from Iohn
 Cockswets house, named the Rotherwell, which running vnder Rothers
 bridge, meeteth with the Gwin or Pant on the northwest end of Ferrants
 meade, southeast of Radwinter church, whereof I haue the charge by your
 honours fauourable preferment.

 I might take occasion to speake of another rill which falleth into the
 Rother from Bendish hall: but bicause it is for the most part drie in
 summer I passe it ouer. Yet I will not omit to speake also of the manor
 which was the chiefe lordship sometime of a parish or hamlet called
 Bendishes, now worne out of knowledge, and vnited partlie to Radwinter,
 and partlie to Ashdon. It belonged first to the Bendishes gentlemen of a
 verie ancient house yet extant, of which one laieng the said manour to
 morgage to the moonks of Feuersham, at such time as K. Edward the third
 went to the siege of Calis, thereby to furnish himselfe the better toward
 the seruice of his prince, it came to passe that he staied longer beyond
 the sea than he supposed. Wherevpon he came before his daie to confer
 with his creditors, who commending his care to come out of debt, willed
 him in friendlie maner not to suspect anie hard dealing on their
 behalfes, considering his businesse in seruice of the king was of it
 selfe cause sufficient, to excuse his delaie of paiment vpon the daie
 assigned. Herevpon he went ouer againe vnto the siege of Calis. But when
 the daie came, the moonks for all this made seisure of the manour, and
 held it continuallie without anie further recompense, maugre all the
 friendship that the aforesaid Bendish could make. The said gentleman
 also tooke this cousening part in such choler, that he wrote a note yet
 to be seene among his euidences, whereby he admonisheth his posteritie
 to beware how they trust either knaue moonke or knaue frier, as one of
 the name and descended from him by lineall descent hath more than once
 informed me. Now to resume our springs that meet and ioine with our
 Pant.

 [Sidenote: Froshwell.]
 The next is named Froshwell. And of this spring dooth the whole hundred
 beare the name, & after this confluence the riuer it selfe whervnto it
 falleth (from by north) so farre as I remember. Certes, all these,
 sauing the first and second, are within your lordships towne aforesaid.
 The streame therefore running from hence (& now, as I said, called
 Froshwell, of Frosh, which signifieth a frog) hasteth immediatlie vnto
 old Sandford, then through new Sandford parke, and afterward with full
 streame (receiuing by the waie, the Finch brooke that commeth thorough
 Finchingfield) to Shalford, Bocking, Stifted, Paswijc, and so to
 Blackewater, where the name of Froshwell ceaseth, the water being from
 hencefoorth (as I heare) commonlie called Blackwater, vntill it come to
 Maldon, where it falleth into the salt arme of the sea that beateth vpon
 the towne; and which of some (except I be deceiued) is called also Pant:
 and so much the rather I make this conjecture, for that Ithancester
 stood somewhere vpon the banks thereof, & in the hundred of Danseie,
 whose ruines (as they saie) also are swalowed vp by the said streame,
 which can not be verified in our riuer that runneth from Pantwell, which
 at the mouth and fall into the great current, exceedeth not (to my
 coniecture) aboue one hundred foot. But to returne to our Pant, alias
 the Gwin. From Blackwater it goeth to Coxall, Easterford, Braxsted and
 [Sidenote: Barus.]
 Wickham, where it meeteth with the Barus, and so going togither as one,
 they descend to Heiebridge, and finallie into the salt water aboue
 Maldon, and at hand as is aforesaid. As for the Barus, it riseth in a
 statelie parke of Essex called Bardfield, belonging to sir Thomas Wroth
 whilest he liued, who hath it to him and his heires males for euer, from
 the crowne. Being risen, it hasteth directlie to old Saling Brainetree,
 crossing a rillet by the waie comming from Raine, blacke Norleie, white
 Norleie, Falkeburne, Wittham, and falleth into the Blackewater beneath
 Braxsted on the south.

 [Sidenote: Chelmer.]
 Beside this, the said Pant or Gwin receiueth the Chelme or Chelmer,
 which ariseth also in Wimbech aforesaid, where it hath two heads: of
 which the one is not farre from Brodockes (where master Thomas Wiseman
 esquier dwelleth) the other nigh vnto a farme called Highams in the same
 paroch, and ioining yer long in one chanell, they hie them toward
 Thacsted vnder Prowds bridge, meeting in the waie with a rill comming
 from Boiton end, whereby it is somewhat increased. Being past Thacsted,
 it goeth by Tilteie, and soone after receiueth one rill which riseth on
 [Sidenote: Lindis.]
 the north side of Lindsell, & falleth into the Chelmer by northeast at
 Tilteie aforesaid, & another c[=o]ming from southwest, rising southeast
 from Lindsell at much Eiston. From thence then holding on still with the
 course, it goeth to Candfield the more, Dunmow, litle Dunmow, Falsted,
 Lies, both Walthams, Springfield, and so to Chelmeresford. Here vpon the
 south side I find the issue of a water that riseth fiue miles (or
 thereabouts) south and by west of the said towne, from whence it goeth
 to Munasing, Buttesburie (there receiuing a rill from by west, to
 Ingatstone, Marget Inge, Widford bridge, Writtle bridge, and so to
 Chelmeresford (crossing also the second water that descendeth from
 [Sidenote: Roxford.]
 Roxford southwest of Writtle by the waie) whereof let this suffice.

 From hence the Chelmer goeth directlie toward Maldon by Badow, Owting,
 Woodham water, Bilie, and so to Blackwater northwest of Maldon,
 receiuing neuerthelesse yer it come fullie thither, a becke also that
 [Sidenote: Lee.]
 goeth from Lee parke, to little Lees, great Lees, Hatfield, Peuerell,
 Owting, and so into Blackwater (whereof I spake before) as Maldon
 streame dooth a rill from by south ouer against saint Osithes, and also
 another by Bradwell. After which the said streame growing also to be
 verie great, passeth by the Tolshunts, Tollesbie, and so foorth into the
 maine sea neere vnto Marseie: betweene which fall and the place where
 Salute water entreth into the land, Plautus abode the comming of
 Claudius sometime into Britaine, when he being hardlie beeset, did send
 vnto him for aid and speedie succour, who also being come did not onelie
 rescue his legat, but in like manner wan Colchester, and put it to the
 spoile, if it be Camalodunum.

 [Sidenote: Burne.]
 The Burne riseth somewhere about Ronwell, and thence goeth to Hull
 bridge, south Fambridge, Kirkeshot ferrie, and so to Foulnesse. And as
 this is the short course of that riuer, so it brancheth, and the south
 arme thereof receiueth a water comming from Haukewell, to great
 Stanbridge, and beneath Pakesham dooth meet by south with the said arme,
 and so finish vp his course, as we doo our voiage also about the coast
 of England.

 Thus haue I finished the description of such riuers and streames as fall
 into the Ocean, according to my purpose, although not in so precise an
 order and manner of handling as I might, if information promised had
 been accordinglie performed; or others would, if they had taken the like
 in hand. But this will I saie of that which is here done, that from the
 Solueie by west, which parteth England & Scotland on that side; to the
 Twede, which separateth the said kingdoms on the east: if you go
 backeward, contrarie to the course of my description, you shall find it
 so exact, as beside a verie few by-riuers, you shall not need to vse
 anie further aduise for the finding and falles of the aforesaid streames.
 For such hath beene my helpe of maister Sackfords cardes, and conference
 with other men about these, that I dare pronounce them to be perfect and
 exact. Furthermore, this I haue also to remember, that in the courses of
 our streames, I regard not so much to name the verie towne or church, as
 the limits of the paroch. And therefore if I saie it goeth by such a
 towne, I thinke my dutie discharged, if I hit vpon anie part or parcell
 of the paroch. This also hath not a little troubled me, I meane the
 euill writing of the names of manie townes and villages: of which I haue
 noted some one man, in the description of a riuer, to write one towne
 two or three manner of waies, whereby I was inforced to choose one (at
 aduenture most commonlie) that seemed the likeliest to be sound in mine
 opinion and iudgement.

 Finallie, whereas I minded to set downe an especiall chapter of ports
 and creeks, lieng on ech coast of the English part of this Ile; and had
 prouided the same in such wise as I iudged most conuenient: it came to
 passe, that the greater part of my labour was taken from me by stealth,
 and therefore as discouraged to meddle with that argument, I would haue
 giuen ouer to set downe anie thing therefore at all: and so much the
 rather, for that I see it may prooue a spurre vnto further mischeefe, as
 things come to passe in these daies. Neuerthelesse, because a little
 thereof is passed in the beginning of the booke, I will set downe that
 parcell thereof which remaineth, leauing the supplie of the rest either
 to my selfe hereafter, (if I may come by it) or to some other that can
 better performe the same.




 OF SUCH PORTS AND CREEKS AS OUR SEAFARING-MEN DOO NOTE FOR THEIR BENEFIT
 UPON THE COASTS OF ENGLAND.

 CHAP. XVII.


 It maie be that I haue in these former chapters omitted sundrie hauens
 to be found vpon the shore of England, and some of them serued with
 backe waters, through want of sound and sufficient information from such
 as haue written vnto me of the same. In recompense whereof I haue
 thought good to adde this chapter of ports and creekes, whereby (so
 farre as to me is possible) I shall make satisfaction of mine
 ouersights. And albeit I cannot (being too too much abused by some that
 haue beereft me of my notes in this behalfe) bring my purpose to passe
 for all the whole coast of England round about, from Berwike to the
 Solue: yet I will not let to set downe so much as by good hap remaineth,
 whereby my countriemen shall not altogither want that benefit, hoping in
 time to recouer also the rest, if God grant life and good successe
 thereto.

 [Sidenote: Northumberland.]
 In Northumberland therefore we haue Berwike, Holie Iland, Bamborow,

 OF THE AIRE, SOILE, AND COMMODITIES OF THIS ILAND.

 CAP. XVIII.


 [Sidenote: The aire of Britaine.]
 The aire (for the most part) throughout the Iland is such, as by reason
 in maner of continuall clouds, is reputed to be grosse, and nothing so
 pleasant as that is of the maine. Howbeit, as they which affirme these
 things, haue onelie respect to the impediment or hinderance of the sunne
 beames, by the interposition of the clouds and oft ingrossed aire: so
 experience teacheth vs, that it is no lesse pure, wholesome, and
 commodious, than is that of other countries, and (as Caesar himselfe
 hereto addeth) much more temperate in summer than that of the Galles,
 from whom he aduentured hither. Neither is there anie thing found in the
 aire of our region, that is not vsuallie seene amongst other nations
 lieng beyond the seas. Wherefore, we must needs confesse, that the
 situation of our Iland (for benefit of the heauens) is nothing inferiour
 to that of anie countrie of the maine, where so euer it lie vnder the
 open firmament. And this Plutarch knew full well, who affirmeth a part
 of the Elisian fields to be found in Britaine, and the Iles that are
 situate about it in the Ocean.

 [Sidenote: The soile.]
 The soile of Britaine is such, as by the testimonies and reports both of
 the old and new writers, and experience also of such as now inhabit the
 same, is verie fruitfull; and such in deed as bringeth foorth manie
 commodities, whereof other countries haue need, and yet it selfe (if fond
 nicenesse were abolished) needlesse of those that are dailie brought from
 other places. Neuerthelesse it is more inclined to feeding and grasing,
 than profitable for tillage, and bearing of corne; by reason whereof the
 countrie is wonderfullie replenished with neat, and all kind of cattell:
 and such store is there also of the same in euerie place, that the fourth
 part of the land is scarselie manured for the prouision and maintenance
 of graine. Certes this fruitfulnesse was not vnknowne vnto the Britons
 long before Caesars time, which was the cause wherefore our predecessors
 liuing in those daies in maner neglected tillage, and liued by feeding
 and grasing onelie. The grasiers themselues also then dwelled in
 mooueable villages by companies, whose custome was to diuide the ground
 amongst them, and each one not to depart from the place where his lot
 [Sidenote: Criacht.]
 laie (a thing much like to the Irish Criacht) till by eating vp of the
 countrie about him, he was inforced to remooue further, and seeke for
 better pasture. And this was the British custome (as I learne) at first.
 It hath beene commonlie reported, that the ground of Wales is neither so
 fruitfull as that of England, neither the soile of Scotland so
 bountifull as that of Wales: which is true, for corne and for the most
 part: otherwise, there is so good ground in some parts of Wales, as is
 in England, albeit the best of Scotland be scarselie comparable to the
 meane of either of both. Howbeit, as the bountie of the Scotish dooth
 faile in some respect, so dooth it surmount in other; God and nature
 hauing not appointed all countries to yeeld foorth like commodities.

 But where our ground is not so good as we would wish, we haue (if need
 be) sufficient help to cherish our ground withall, and to make it more
 fruitfull. For beside the compest that is carried out of the husbandmens
 yards, ditches, ponds, doouehouses, or cities and great townes: we haue
 with vs a kind of white marle, which is of so great force, that if it be
 cast ouer a peece of land but once in three score years, it shall not
 need of anie further compesting. Hereof also dooth Plinie speake, lib.
 [Sidenote: Marle.]
 17, cap. 6, 7, 8, where he affirmeth that our marle indureth vpon the
 earth by the space of fourescore yeares: insomuch that it is laid vpon
 the same but once in a mans life, whereby the owner shall not need to
 trauell twise in procuring to commend and better his soile. He calleth
 it Marga, and making diuerse kinds thereof, he finallie commendeth ours,
 and that of France, aboue all other, which lieth sometime a hundred foot
 deepe, and farre better than the scattering of chalke vpon the same, as
 the Hedni and Pictones did in his time, or as some of our daies also doo
 practise: albeit diuerse doo like better to cast on lime, but it will
 not so long indure, as I haue heard reported.

 [Sidenote: Plentie of riuers.]
 There are also in this Iland great plentie of fresh riuers and streams,
 as you haue heard alreadie, and these throughlie fraught with all kinds
 of delicate fish accustomed to be found in riuers. The whole Ile
 [Sidenote: Hilles.]
 likewise is verie full of hilles, of which some (though not verie manie)
 are of exceeding heigth, and diuerse extending themselues verie far from
 the beginning; as we may see by Shooters hill, which rising east of
 London, and not farre from the Thames, runneth along the south side of
 the Iland westward, vntill it come to Cornewall. Like vnto these also
 are the Crowdon hils, which though vnder diuers names (as also the other
 from the Peke) doo run into the borders of Scotland. What should I
 speake of the Cheuiot hilles, which reach twentie miles in length? of
 [Sidenote: (*) Here lacks.]
 the blacke mounteines in Wales, which go from (*) to (*) miles at the
 least in length? of the Cle hilles in Shropshire, which come within
 foure miles of Ludlow, and are diuided from some part of Worcester by
 the Teme? of the Grames in Scotland, and of our Chiltren, which are
 eighteene miles at the least from one end of them, which reach from
 Henlie in Oxfordshire to Dunstable in Bedfordshire, and are verie well
 replenished with wood and corne? notwithstanding that the most part
 yeeld a sweet short grasse, profitable for sheepe. Wherein albeit they
 of Scotland doo somewhat come behind vs, yet their outward defect is
 inwardlie recompensed, not onelie with plentie of quarries (and those of
 sundrie kinds of marble, hard stone, and fine alabaster) but also rich
 mines of mettall, as shall be shewed hereafter.

 [Sidenote: Winds.]
 In this Iland likewise the winds are commonlie more strong and fierce,
 than in anie other places of the maine, which Cardane also espied: and
 that is often seene vpon the naked hilles, not garded with trees to
 beare and keepe it off. That grieuous inconuenience also inforceth our
 [Sidenote: Building.]
 nobilitie, gentrie, and communaltie, to build their houses in the
 vallies, leauing the high grounds vnto their corne and cattell, least
 the cold and stormie blasts of winter should breed them greater
 annoiance: whereas in other regions each one desireth to set his house
 aloft on the hill, not onlie to be seene a farre off, and cast forth his
 beames of statelie and curious workemanship into euerie quarter of the
 countrie; but also (in hot habitations) for coldnesse sake of the aire,
 sith the heat is neuer so vehement on the hill top as in the vallie,
 because the reuerberation of the sunne beames either reacheth not so
 farre as the highest, or else becommeth not so strong as when it is
 reflected upon the lower soile.

 [Sidenote: Husbandrie amended.]
 But to leaue our buildings vnto the purposed place (which
 notwithstanding haue verie much increased, I meane for curiositie and
 cost, in England, Wales, and Scotland, within these few yeares) and to
 returne to the soile againe. Certeinelie it is euen now in these our
 daies growne to be much more fruitfull, than it hath beene in times
 past. The cause is for that our countriemen are growne to be more
 painefull, skilfull, and carefull through recompense of gaine, than
 heretofore they haue beene: insomuch that my Synchroni or time fellows
 can reape at this present great commoditie in a little roome; whereas of
 late yeares, a great compasse hath yeelded but small profit, and this
 onelie through the idle and negligent occupation of such, as dailie
 manured and had the same in occupieng. I might set downe examples of
 these things out of all the parts of this Iland, that is to saie, manie
 of England, more out of Scotland, but most of all out of Wales: in which
 two last rehearsed, verie little other food and liuelihood was wont to
 be looked for (beside flesh) more than the soile of it selfe, and the
 cow gaue; the people in the meane time liuing idelie, dissolutelie, and
 by picking and stealing one from another. All which vices are now (for
 the most part) relinquished, so that each nation manureth hir owne with
 triple commoditie, to that it was before time.

 [Sidenote: Pasture.]
 The pasture of this Iland is according to the nature and bountie of the
 soile, whereby in most places it is plentifull, verie fine, batable, and
 such as either fatteth our cattell with speed, or yeeldeth great
 abundance of milke and creame: whereof the yellowest butter and finest
 cheese are made. But where the blue claie aboundeth (which hardlie
 drinketh vp the winters water in long season) there the grasse is
 spearie, rough, and verie apt for brushes: by which occasion it commeth
 nothing so profitable vnto the owner as the other. The best pasture
 ground of all England is in Wales, & of all the pasture in Wales that of
 Cardigan is the cheefe. I speake of the same which is to be found in the
 mounteines there, where the hundred part of the grasse growing is not
 eaten, but suffered to rot on the ground, whereby the soile becommeth
 matted, and diuerse bogges and quicke moores made withall in long
 continuance: because all the cattell in the countrie are not able to eat
 it downe. If it be to be accompted good soile, on which a man may laie a
 wand ouer night, and on the morrow find it hidden and ouergrowen with
 grasse: it is not hard to find plentie thereof in manie places of this
 land. Neuertheless, such is the fruitfulnes of the aforsaid countie that
 it farre surmounteth this proportion, whereby it may be compared for
 batablenesse with Italie, which in my time is called the paradise of the
 world, although by reason of the wickednesse of such as dwell therein it
 may be called the sinke and draine of hell: so that whereas they were
 woont to saie of vs that our land is good but our people euill, they did
 but onlie speake it; whereas we know by experience that the soile of
 Italie is a noble soile, but the dwellers therein farre off from anie
 vertue or goodnesse.

 [Sidenote: Medowes.]
 Our medowes, are either bottomes (whereof we haue great store, and those
 verie large, bicause our soile is hillie) or else such as we call land
 meads, and borowed from the best & fattest pasturages. The first of them
 are yearelie & often ouerflowen by the rising of such streames as passe
 through the same, or violent falles of land-waters, that descend from
 the hils about them. The other are seldome or neuer ouerflowen, and that
 is the cause wherefore their grasse is shorter than that of the
 bottomes, and yet is it farre more fine, wholesome, and batable, sith
 the haie of our low medowes is not onelie full of sandie cinder, which
 breedeth sundrie diseases in our cattell, but also more rowtie, foggie,
 and full of flags, and therefore not so profitable for stouer and
 forrage as the higher meads be. The difference furthermore in their
 commodities is great, for whereas in our land meadowes we haue not often
 aboue one good load of haie, or peraduenture a little more in an acre of
 ground (I vse the word Carrucata or Carruca which is a waine load, and,
 as I remember, vsed by Plinie lib. 33. cap. 11.) in low meadowes we haue
 sometimes three, but commonlie two or vpward, as experience hath oft
 confirmed.

 Of such as are twise mowed I speake not, sith their later math is not so
 wholesome for cattell as the first; although in the mouth more pleasant
 for the time: for thereby they become oftentimes to be rotten, or to
 increase so fast in bloud, that the garget and other diseases doo
 consume manie of them before the owners can seeke out any remedie, by
 Phlebotomie or otherwise. Some superstitious fooles suppose that they
 which die of the garget are ridden with the night mare, and therefore
 they hang vp stones which naturallie haue holes in them, and must be
 found vnlooked for; as if such a stone were an apt cockeshot for the
 diuell to run through and solace himselfe withall, whilest the cattell
 go scot free and are not molested by him. But if I should set downe but
 halfe the toies that superstition hath brought into our husbandmens
 heads in this and other behalfes, it would aske a greater volume than is
 conuenient for such a purpose, wherefore it shall suffice to haue said
 thus much of these things.

 [Sidenote: Corne.]
 The yeeld of our corne-ground is also much after this rate folowing.
 Through out the land (if you please to make an estimat thereof by the
 acre) in meane and indifferent yeares, wherein each acre of rie or
 wheat, well tilled and dressed, will yeeld commonlie sixteene or twentie
 bushels, an acre of barlie six and thirtie bushels, of otes and such
 like foure or fiue quarters, which proportion is notwithstanding oft
 abated toward the north, as it is oftentimes surmounted in the south. Of
 mixed corne, as peason and beanes, sowen togither, tares and otes (which
 they call bulmong) rie and wheat named miscelin here is no place to
 speake, yet their yeeld is neuerthelesse much after this proportion, as
 I haue often marked. And yet is not this our great foison comparable to
 that of hoter countries of the maine. But of all that euer I read, the
 increase which Eldred Danus writeth of in his De imperio Iudaeorum in
 Aethiopia surmounteth, where he saith that in the field neere to the
 Sabbatike riuer, called in old time Gosan, the ground is so fertile,
 that euerie graine of barleie growing dooth yeeld an hundred kernels at
 the least vnto the owner.

 Of late yeares also we haue found and taken vp a great trade in planting
 of hops, whereof our moorie hitherto and vnprofitable grounds doo yeeld
 such plentie & increase, that their are few farmers or occupiers in the
 countrie, which haue not gardens and hops growing of their owne, and
 those farre better than doo come from Flanders vnto us. Certes the
 corruptions vsed by the Flemings, and forgerie dailie practised in this
 kind of ware, gaue vs occasion to plant them here at home: so that now
 we may spare and send manie ouer vnto them. And this I know by
 experience, that some one man by conuersion of his moorie grounds into
 hopyards, wherof before he had no commoditie, dooth raise yearelie by so
 little as twelue acres in compasse two hundred markes; all charges borne
 toward the maintenance of his familie. Which industrie God continue!
 though some secret freends of Flemings let not to exclaime against this
 commoditie, as a spoile of wood, by reason of the poles, which
 neuerthelesse after three yeares doo also come to the fire, and spare
 their other fewell.

 [Sidenote: Cattell.]
 The cattell which we breed are commonlie such, as for greatnesse of
 bone, sweetnesse of flesh, and other benefits to be reaped by the same,
 giue place vnto none other: as may appeare first by our oxen, whose
 largenesse, height, weight, tallow, hides, and hornes are such, as none
 of anie other nation doo commonlie or may easilie exceed them. Our
 sheepe likewise for good tast of flesh, quantitie of lims, finesse of
 fleece caused by their hardnesse of pasturage, and abundance of increase
 (for in manie places they bring foorth two or three at an eaning) giue
 no place vnto anie, more than doo our goates, who in like sort doo
 follow the same order, and our deere come not behind. As for our conies,
 [Sidenote: Meall and Disnege.]
 I haue seene them so fat in some soiles, especiallie about Meall and
 Disnege, that the grease of one being weighed, hath peised verie neere
 six or seuen ounces. All which benefits we first refer to the grace and
 goodnesse of God, and next of all vnto the bountie of our soile, which
 he hath indued with so notable and commodious fruitfulnesse.

 But as I meane to intreat of these things more largelie hereafter, so
 will I touch in this place one benefit which our nation wanteth, and
 [Sidenote: Wine.]
 that is wine; the fault whereof is not in our soile, but the negligence
 of our countriemen (especiallie of the south partes) who doo not inure
 the same to this commoditie, and which by reason of long discontinuance,
 is now become vnapt to beare anie grapes almost for pleasure & shadow,
 much lesse then the plaine fields or seuerall vineyards for aduantage
 and commoditie. Yet of late time some haue assaied to deale for wine, as
 to your lordship also is right well knowen. But sith that liquor when it
 commeth to the drinking hath bin found more hard, than that which is
 brought from beyond the sea, and the cost of planting and keeping
 thereof so chargeable, that they may buie it far better cheape from
 other countries: they haue giuen ouer their enterprises without anie
 consideration, that as in all other things, so neither the ground it
 selfe in the beginning, nor successe of their trauell can answer their
 expectation at the first, vntill such time as the soile be brought as it
 were into acquaintance with this commoditie, and that prouision may be
 made for the more easinesse of charge, to be imploied vpon the same.

 If it be true, that where wine dooth last and indure well, there it will
 grow no worse: I muse not a little wherefore the planting of vines
 should be neglected in England. That this liquor might haue growne in
 this Iland heretofore, first the charter that Probus the emperour gaue
 equallie to vs, the Galles, and Spaniards, is one sufficient testimonie.
 And that it did grow here, beside the testimonie of Beda lib. 1. cap. 1.
 the old notes of tithes for wine that yet remaine in the accompts of
 some parsons and vicars in Kent, & elsewhere, besides the records of
 sundrie sutes, commensed in diuerse ecclesiasticall courts, both in
 Kent, Surrie, &c: also the inclosed parcels almost in euerie abbeie yet
 called the vineyardes, may be a notable witnesse, as also the plot which
 we now call east Smithfield in London giuen by Canutus sometime king of
 this land, with other soile there about vnto certeine of his knights,
 with the libertie of a Guild which therof was called Knighten Guild. The
 truth is (saith Iohn Stow our countrie man, and diligent traueller in
 the old estate of this my natiue citie) that it is now named Port soken
 ward, and giuen in time past to the religious house within Algate.
 Howbeit first Otwell, the Archouell, Otto, & finallie Geffrie erle of
 Essex constables of the Tower of London, withheld that portion fr[=o]
 the said house, vntill the reigne of king Stephan, and thereof made a
 vineyard to their great commoditie and lucre. The Ile of Elie also was
 in the first times of the Normans called Le Ile des vignes. And good
 record appeereth, that the bishop there had yearelie three or foure
 tunne at the least giuen him Nomine decimae, beside whatsoeuer ouer-summe
 of the liquor did accrue to him by leases and other excheats, whereof
 also I haue seene mention. Wherefore our soile is not to be blamed, as
 though our nights were so exceeding short, that in August and September
 the moone which is ladie of moisture, & chiefe ripener of this liquor,
 cannot in anie wise shine long inough vpon the same: a verie meere toie
 and fable right worthie to be suppressed, because experience conuinceth
 the vpholders thereof euen in the Rhenish wines.

 [Sidenote: Wad.]
 The time hath beene also that wad, wherwith our countrie men died their
 faces (as Caesar saith) that they might seeme terrible to their enimies
 in the field, and also women & their daughters in law did staine their
 bodies & go naked, in that pickle to the sacrifices of their gods,
 coueting to resemble therin the Ethiopians, as Plinie saith li. 22. cap.
 [Sidenote: Madder.]
 1. and also madder haue beene (next vnto our tin and woolles) the chiefe
 [Sidenote: Rape.]
 commodities, and merchandize of this realme. I find also that rape oile
 hath beene made within this land. But now our soile either will not or
 at the leastwise may not beare either wad or madder: I saie not that the
 ground is not able so to doo, but that we are negligent, afraid of the
 pilling of our grounds, and carelesse of our owne profit, as men rather
 willing to buie the same of others than take anie paine to plant them
 [Sidenote: Flax.]
 here at home. The like I may saie of flax, which by law ought to be
 sowen in euerie countrie-towne in England, more or lesse: but I see no
 successe of that good and wholesome law, sith it is rather
 contemptuouslie reiected than otherwise dutifullie kept in anie place of
 England.

 Some saie that our great number of lawes doo breed a generall negligence
 and contempt of all good order; bicause we haue so manie, that no
 subiect can liue without the transgression of some of them, and that the
 often alteration of our ordinances dooth much harme in this respect,
 which (after Aristotle) doth seeme to carie some reason withall, for (as
 Cornelius Gallus hath:)

 [Sidenote: Eleg. 2.]

   Euentus varios res noua semper habet.

 But verie manie let not to affirme, that the greedie corruption of the
 promoters on the one side, facilitie in dispensing with good lawes, and
 first breach of the same in the lawmakers & superiors, & priuat respects
 of their establishment on the other, are the greatest causes whie the
 inferiours regard no good order, being alwaies so redie to offend
 without anie facultie one waie, as they are otherwise to presume, vpon
 [Sidenote: Principis longe magis exemplo quion culpa peccare solent.]
 the examples of their betters when anie hold is to be taken. But as in
 these things I haue no skill, so I wish that fewer licences for the
 priuat commoditie but of a few were granted (not that thereby I denie
 the maintenance of the prerogatiue roiall, but rather would with all my
 hart that it might be yet more honorablie increased) & that euerie one
 which by feeed friendship (or otherwise) dooth attempt to procure oughts
 from the prince, that may profit but few and proue hurtfull to manie,
 might be at open assizes and sessions denounced enimie to his countrie
 and commonwealth of the land.

 Glasse also hath beene made here in great plentie before, and in the
 time of the Romans; and the said stuffe also, beside fine scissers,
 sheeres, collars of gold and siluer for womens necks, cruses and cups of
 amber, were a parcell of the tribute which Augustus in his daies laid
 vpon this Iland. In like sort he charged the Britons with certeine
 implements and vessels of iuorie (as Strabo saith.) Wherby it appeereth
 that in old time our countriemen were farre more industrious and
 painefull in the vse and application of the benefits of their countrie,
 than either after the comming of the Saxons or Normans, in which they
 gaue themselues more to idlenesse and following of the warres.

 [Sidenote: Earth.]
 If it were requisit that I should speake of the sundrie kinds of moold,
 as the cledgie or claie, whereof are diuerse sorts (red, blue, blacke
 and white) also the red or white sandie, the lomie, rosellie, grauellie,
 chalkie or blacke, I could saie that there are so manie diuerse veines
 in Britaine, as else where in anie quarter of like quantitie in the
 world. Howbeit this I must needs confesse, that the sandie and cledgie
 doo beare great swaie: but the claie most of all, as hath beene, and yet
 is alwaies seene & felt through plentie and dearth of corne. For if this
 latter (I meane the claie) doo yeeld hir full increase (which it dooth
 commonlie in drie yeares for wheat) then is there generall plentie:
 wheras if it faile, then haue we scarsitie, according to the old rude
 verse set downe of England, but to be vnderstood of the whole Iland, as
 experience dooth confirme:

   When the sand dooth serue the claie,
   Then may we sing well awaie,
   But when the claie dooth serue the sand,
   Then is it merie with England.

 [Sidenote: Vallies.]
 I might here intreat of the famous vallies in England, of which one is
 called the vale of White horsse, another of Eouesham, commonlie taken
 for the granarie of Worcestershire, the third of Ailesbirie that goeth
 by Tame, the rootes of Chilterne hils, to Donstable, Newport panell,
 Stonie Stratford, Buckhingham, Birstane parke, &c. Likewise of the
 fourth of Whitehart or Blackemoore in Dorsetshire. The fift of Ringdale
 or Renidale, corruptlie called Ringtaile, that lieth (as mine author
 saith) vpon the edge of Essex and Cambridgeshire, and also the Marshwood
 vale: but for somuch as I know not well their seuerall limits, I giue
 ouer to go anie further in their description. In like sort it should not
 [Sidenote: Fennes.]
 be amisse to speake of our fennes, although our countrie be not so full
 of this kind of soile as the parties beyond the seas, to wit, Narbon,
 &c: and thereto of other pleasant botoms, the which are not onelie
 indued with excellent riuers and great store of corne and fine fodder
 for neat and horsses in time of the yeare (whereby they are exceeding
 beneficiall vnto their owners) but also of no small compasse and
 quantitie in ground. For some of our fens are well knowen to be either
 of ten, twelue, sixteene, twentie, or thirtie miles in length, that of
 the Girwies yet passing all the rest, which is full 60 (as I haue often
 read.) Wherein also Elie the famous Ile standeth, which is seuen miles
 euerie waie, and wherevnto there is no accesse but by three causies,
 whose inhabitants in like sort by an old priuilege may take wood, sedge,
 turfe, &c; to burne: likewise haie for their cattell, and thatch for
 their houses of custome, and each occupier in his appointed quantitie
 through out the Ile; albeit that couetousnesse hath now begun somewhat
 to abridge this large beneuolence and commoditie, aswell in the said Ile
 as most other places of this land.

 [Sidenote: Commons.]
 Finallie, I might discourse in like order of the large commons, laid out
 heretofore by the lords of the soiles for the benefit of such poore, as
 inhabit within the compasse of their manors. But as the true intent of
 the giuers is now in most places defrauded, in so much that not the
 poore tenants inhabiting vpon the same, but their landlords haue all the
 commoditie and gaine, so the tractation of them belongeth rather to the
 second booke. Wherfore I meane not at this present to deale withall, but
 reserue the same wholie vnto the due place whilest I go forward with the
 rest; setting downe neuerthelesse by the waie a generall commendation of
 the whole Iland, which I find in an ancient monument, much vnto this
 effect.

 OF THE FOURE HIGH WAIES SOMETIME MADE IN BRITAINE BY THE PRINCES OF THIS
 ILAND.

 CAP. XIX.


 There are, which indeuoring to bring all things to their Saxon
 originall, doo affirme, that this diuision of waies, (whereof we now
 intreat) should apperteine vnto such princes of that nation as reigned
 here, since the Romanes gaue vs ouer: and herevpon they inferre, that
 Wattling street was builded by one Wattle from the east vnto the west.
 But how weake their coniectures are in this behalfe, the antiquitie of
 these streets it selfe shall easilie declare, whereof some parcelles,
 after a sort, are also set downe by Antoninus; and those that haue
 written of the seuerall iournies from hence to Rome: although
 peraduenture not in so direct an order as they were at the first
 established. For my part, if it were not that I desire to be short in
 this behalfe, I could with such notes as I haue alreadie collected for
 that purpose, make a large confutation of diuerse of their opinions
 concerning these passages, and thereby rather ascribe the originall of
 these waies to the Romans than either the British or Saxon princes. But
 sith I haue spent more time in the tractation of the riuers than was
 allotted vnto me, and that I see great cause (notwithstanding my late
 alledged scruple) wherfore I should hold with our Galfride before anie
 other; I will omit at this time to discourse of these things as I would,
 and saie what I maie for the better knowledge of their courses,
 proceeding therein as followeth.

 First of all I find, that Dunwallon king of Britaine, about 483 yeares
 before the birth of our sauiour Iesus Christ, seeing the subiects of his
 realme to be in sundrie wise oppressed by theeues and robbers as they
 trauelled to and fro; and being willing (so much as in him laie) to
 redresse these inconueniences, caused his whole kingdome to be surueied;
 and then commanding foure principall waies to be made, which should
 leade such as trauelled into all parts thereof, from sea to sea, he gaue
 sundrie large priuileges vnto the same, whereby they became safe, and
 verie much frequented. And as he had regard herein to the securitie of
 his subiects, so he made sharpe lawes grounded vpon iustice, for the
 suppression of such wicked members as did offer violence to anie
 traueler that should be met withall or found within the limits of those
 passages. How and by what parts of this Iland these waies were conueied
 at the first, it is not so wholie left in memorie: but that some
 question is mooued among the learned, concerning their ancient courses.
 Howbeit such is the shadow remaining hitherto of their extensions, that
 if not at this present perfectlie, yet hereafter it is not vnpossible,
 but that they may be found out, & left certeine vnto posteritie. It
 seemeth by Galfride, that the said Dunwallon did limit out those waies
 by dooles and markes, which being in short time altered by the auarice
 of such irreligious persons as dwelt neere, and incroched vpon the same
 (a fault yet iustlie to be found almost in euerie place, euen in the
 time of our most gratious and souereigne Ladie Elizabeth, wherein the
 lords of the soiles doo vnite their small occupieng, onelie to increase
 a greater proportion of rent; and therefore they either remooue, or giue
 licence to erect small tenements vpon the high waies sides and commons;
 wherevnto, in truth, they haue no right: and yet out of them also doo
 raise a new commoditie) and question mooued for their bounds before
 Belinus his sonne, he to auoid all further controuersie that might from
 thencefoorth insue, caused the same to be paued with hard stone of
 eighteene foot in breadth, ten foot in depth, and in the bottome thereof
 huge flint stones also to be pitched, least the earth in time should
 swallow vp his workemanship, and the higher ground ouer-grow their
 rising crests. He indued them also with larger priuileges than before,
 protesting that if anie man whosoeuer should presume to infringe his
 peace, and violate the lawes of his kingdome in anie maner of wise,
 neere vnto or vpon those waies, he should suffer such punishment without
 all hope to escape (by freendship or mercie) as by the statutes of this
 realme latelie prouided in those cases were due vnto the offendors. The
 names of these foure waies are the Fosse, the Gwethelin or Watling, the
 Erming, and the Ikenild.

 [Sidenote: Fosse.]
 The Fosse goeth not directlie but slopewise ouer the greatest part of
 this Iland, beginning at Dotnesse or Totnesse in Deuonshire, where Brute
 somtime landed, or (as Ranulphus saith, which is more likelie) at the
 point of Cornwall, though the eldest writers doo seeme to note the
 contrarie. From hence it goeth thorough the middle of Deuonshire &
 Summersetshire, and commeth to Bristow, from whence it runneth
 manifestlie to Sudberie market, Tetburie, and so foorth holdeth on as
 you go almost to the midde waie betweene Glocester and Cirnecester,
 (where the wood faileth, and the champeigne countrie appeareth toward
 Cotteswald) streight as a line vntill you come to Cirnecester it selfe.
 Some hold opinion that the waie, which lieth from Cirnecester to Bath,
 should be the verie Fosse; and that betwixt Cirnecester and Glocester to
 be another of the foure waies, made by the Britons. But ancient report
 grounded vpon great likelihood, and confirmed also by some experience,
 iudgeth that most of the waies crossed ech other in this part of the
 realme. And of this mind is Leland also, who learned it of an abbat of
 Cirnecester that shewed great likelihood by some records thereof. But to
 proceed. From Cirnecester, it goeth by Chepingnorton to Couentrie,
 Leircester, Newarke, and so to Lincolne ouerthwart the Watlingstreet:
 where, by generall consent of all the writers (except Alfred of
 Beuerleie, who extendeth it vnto Cathnesse in Scotland) it is said to
 haue an end.

 [Sidenote: Watling street.]
 The Watlingstreete begun (as I said) by Dunwallo, but finished by
 Gutheline, of whome it is directlie to be called Gutheline street,
 though now corrupted into Watlingstreet, beginneth at Douer in Kent, and
 so stretcheth through the middest of Kent vnto London, and so foorth
 (peraduenture by the middest of the citie) vnto Verolamium or
 Verlamcester, now saint Albons, where, in the yeare of grace, one
 thousand fiue hundred thirtie & one, the course thereof was found by a
 man that digged for grauell wherwith to mend the high waie. It was in
 this place eighteene foot broad, and about ten foot deepe, and stoned in
 the bottome in such wise as I haue noted afore, and peraduenture also on
 the top: but these are gone, and the rest remaine equall in most places,
 and leuell with the fields. The yelow grauell also that was brought
 thither in carts two thousand yeeres passed, remained there so fresh and
 so strong, as if it had beene digged out of the naturall place where it
 grew not manie yeeres before. From hence it goeth hard by Margate,
 leauing it on the west side. And a little by south of this place, where
 the priorie stood, is a long thorough fare vpon the said street, meetly
 well builded (for low housing) on both sides. After this it proceedeth
 (as the chronicle of Barnwell saith) to Caxton, and so to Huntingdon, &
 then forward, still winding in and out till it not onelie becommeth a
 bound vnto Leicestershire toward Lugbie, but also passeth from
 Castleford to Stamford, and so foorth by west of Marton, which is but a
 mile from Torkeseie.

 Here by the waie I must touch the opinion of a traueller of my time, who
 noteth the said street to go another waie, insomuch that he would haue
 it to crosse the third Auon, betwixt Newton and Dowbridge, and so go on
 to Binford bridge, Wibtoft, the High crosse, and thence to Atherston
 vpon Ancre. Certes it may be, that the Fosse had his course by the
 countrie in such sort as he describeth; but that the Watlingstreet
 should passe by Atherston, I cannot as yet be persuaded. Neuerthelesse
 his coniecture is not to be misliked, sith it is not vnlikelie that
 three seuerall waies might meet at Alderwaie (a towne vpon Tame, beneath
 Salters bridge) for I doo not doubt that the said towne did take his
 name of all three waies, as Aldermarie church in London did of all three
 Maries, vnto whom it hath beene dedicated: but that the Watlingstreet
 should be one of them, the compasse of his passage will in no wise
 permit. And thus much haue I thought good to note by the waie. Now to
 returne againe to Leland, and other mens collections.

 The next tidings that we heare of the Watlingstreet, are that it goeth
 thorough or neere by the parke at Pomfret, as the common voice also of
 the countrie confirmeth. Thence it passeth hastilie ouer Castelford
 bridge to Aberford, which is fiue miles from thence, and where are most
 manifest tokens of this street and his broad crest by a great waie
 togither, also to Yorke, to Witherbie, and then to Borowbridge, where on
 the left hand thereof stood certeine monuments, or pyramides of stone,
 sometimes placed there by the ancient Romanes. These stones (saith
 Leland) stand eight miles west from Bowis, and almost west from Richmond
 is a little thorough fare called Maiden castell, situate apparantlie
 vpon the side of this street. And here is one of those pyramides or
 great round heapes, which is three score foot compasse in the bottome.
 There are other also of lesse quantities, and on the verie top of ech of
 them are sharpe stones of a yard in length; but the greatest of all is
 eighteene foot high at the least, from the ground to the verie head. He
 addeth moreouer, how they stand on an hill in the edge of Stanes moore,
 and are as bounds betweene Richmondshire, and Westmerland. But to
 proceed. This street lieng a mile from Gilling, and two miles from
 Richmond commeth on from Borowbridge to Catericke, eighteene miles; that
 is, twelue to Leuing, & six to Catericke; then eleuen miles to Greteie
 or Gritto, fiue miles to Bottles, eight miles to Burgh on Stanes moore,
 foure miles from Applebie, and fiue to Browham, where the said street
 commeth thorough Winfoll parke, and ouer the bridge on Eiemouth and
 Loder, and leauing Perith a quarter of a mile or more on the west side
 of it, goeth to Carleill seuenteene miles from Browham, which hath beene
 some notable thing. Hitherto it appeareth euidentlie, but going from
 hence into Scotland, I heare no more of it, vntill I come to Cathnesse,
 which is two hundred and thirtie miles or thereabouts out of England.

 [Sidenote: Erming street.]
 The Erming street, which some call the Lelme, stretcheth out of the
 east, as they saie, into the southeast, that is, from Meneuia or S.
 Dauids in Wales vnto Southampton, whereby it is somewhat likelie indeed
 that these two waies, I meane the Fosse and the Erming, should meet
 about Cirnecester, as it commeth from Glocester, according to the
 opinion conceiued of them in that countrie. Of this waie I find no more
 written, and therefore I can saie no more of it, except I should indeuor
 to driue awaie the time, in alleging what other men say thereof, whose
 minds doo so farre disagree one from another, as they doo all from a
 truth, and therefore I giue them ouer as not delighting in such dealing.

 [Sidenote: Ikenild.]
 The Ikenild or Rikenild began somewhere in the south, and so held on
 toward Cirnecester, then to Worcester, Wicombe, Brimcham, Lichfield,
 Darbie, Chesterfield; and crossing the Watlingstreet somewhere in
 Yorkeshire, stretched foorth in the end vnto the mouth of the Tine,
 where it ended at the maine sea, as most men doo confesse. I take it to
 be called the Ikenild, because it passed thorough the kingdome of the
 Icenes. For albeit that Leland & other following him doo seeme to place
 the Icenes in Norffolke and Suffolke; yet in mine opinion that can not
 well be doone, sith it is manifest by Tacitus, that they laie neere vnto
 the Silures, and (as I gesse) either in Stafford and Worcester shires,
 or in both, except my coniecture doo faile me. The author of the booke,
 intituled Eulogium historiarum, doth call this street the Lelme. But as
 herein he is deceiued, so haue I dealt withall so faithfullie as I may
 among such diuersitie of opinions; yet not denieng but that there is
 much confusion in the names and courses of these two latter, the
 discussing whereof I must leaue to other men that are better learned
 than I.

 Now to speake generallie of our common high waies through the English
 part of the Ile (for of the rest I can saie nothing) you shall
 vnderstand that in the claie or cledgie soile they are often verie deepe
 and troublesome in the winter halfe. Wherfore by authoritie of parlement
 an order is taken for their yearelie amendment, whereby all sorts of the
 common people doo imploie their trauell for six daies in summer vpon the
 same. And albeit that the intent of the statute is verie profitable for
 the reparations of the decaied places, yet the rich doo so cancell their
 portions, and the poore so loiter in their labours, that of all the six,
 scarcelie two good days works are well performed and accomplished in a
 parish on these so necessarie affaires. Besides this, such as haue land
 lieng vpon the sides of the waies, doo vtterlie neglect to dich and
 scowre their draines and watercourses, for better auoidance of the
 winter waters (except it may be set off or cut from the meaning of the
 statute) whereby the streets doo grow to be much more gulled than
 before, and thereby verie noisome for such as trauell by the same.
 Sometimes also, and that verie often, these daies works are not imploied
 vpon those waies that lead from market to market, but ech surueior
 amendeth such by-plots & lanes as seeme best for his owne commoditie,
 and more easie passage vnto his fields and pastures. And whereas in some
 places there is such want of stones, as thereby the inhabitants are
 driuen to seeke them farre off in other soiles: the owners of the lands
 wherein those stones are to be had, and which hitherto haue giuen monie
 to haue them borne awaie, doo now reape no small commoditie by raising
 the same to excessiue prices, whereby their neighbours are driuen to
 grieuous charges, which is another cause wherefore the meaning of that
 good law is verie much defrauded. Finallie, this is another thing
 likewise to be considered of, that the trees and bushes growing by the
 streets sides; doo not a little keepe off the force of the sunne in
 summer for drieng vp of the lanes. Wherefore if order were taken that
 their boughs should continuallie be kept short, and the bushes not
 suffered to spread so far into the narrow paths, that inconuenience
 would also be remedied, and manie a slough proue hard ground that yet is
 deepe and hollow. Of the dailie incroaching of the couetous vpon the hie
 waies I speake not. But this I know by experience, that wheras some
 streets within these fiue and twentie yeares haue beene in most places
 fiftie foot broad according to the law, whereby the traueller might
 either escape the theefe or shift the mier, or passe by the loaden cart
 without danger of himselfe and his horsse; now they are brought vnto
 twelue, or twentie, or six and twentie at the most, which is another
 cause also whereby the waies be the worse, and manie an honest man
 encombred in his iourneie. But what speake I of these things whereof I
 doo not thinke to heare a iust redresse, because the error is so common,
 and the benefit thereby so sweet and profitable to manie, by such houses
 and cotages as are raised vpon the same.




 OF THE GENERALL CONSTITUTION OF THE BODIES OF THE BRITONS.

 CHAP. XX.


 Such as are bred in this Iland are men for the most part of a good
 complexion, tall of stature, strong in bodie, white of colour, and
 thereto of great boldnesse and courage in the warres. As for their
 generall comelinesse of person, the testimonie of Gregorie the great, at
 such time as he saw English capteins sold at Rome, shall easilie
 confirme what it is, which yet dooth differ in sundrie shires and
 soiles, as also their proportion of members, as we may perceiue betweene
 Herefordshire and Essex men, or Cambridgeshire and the Londoners for the
 one, and Pokington and Sedberrie for the other; these latter being
 distinguished by their noses and heads, which commonlie are greater
 there than in other places of the land. As concerning the stomachs also
 of our nation in the field, they haue alwaies beene in souereigne
 admiration among forren princes: for such hath beene the estimation of
 our souldiers from time to time, since our Ile hath beene knowne vnto
 the Romans, that wheresoeuer they haue serued in forren countries, the
 cheefe brunts of seruice haue beene reserued vnto them. Of their
 conquests and bloudie battels woone in France, Germanie, and Scotland,
 our histories are full: & where they haue beene ouercome, the victorers
 themselues confessed their victories to haue beene so deerelie bought,
 that they would not gladlie couet to ouercome often, after such
 difficult maner. In martiall prowesse, there is little or no difference
 betweene Englishmen and Scots: for albeit that the Scots haue beene
 often and verie greeuouslie ouercome by the force of our nation, it hath
 not beene for want of manhood on their parts, but through the mercie of
 God shewed on vs, and his iustice vpon them, sith they alwaies haue
 begun the quarels, and offered vs meere iniurie with great despite and
 crueltie.

 Leland noting somewhat of the constitution of our bodies, saith these
 words grounding (I thinke vpon Aristotle, who writeth that such as dwell
 neere the north, are of more courage and strength of bodie than
 skilfulnesse or wisdome.) The Britons are white in colour, strong of
 bodie, and full of bloud, as people inhabiting neere the north, and
 farre from the equinoctiall line, where the soile is not so fruitfull,
 and therefore the people not so feeble: whereas contrariwise such as
 dwell toward the course of the sunne, are lesse of stature, weaker of
 bodie, more nice, delicate, fearefull by nature, blacker in colour, &
 some so blacke in deed as anie crow or rauen. Thus saith he. Howbeit, as
 those which are bred in sundrie places of the maine, doo come behind vs
 in constitution of bodie, so I grant, that in pregnancie of wit,
 nimblenesse of limmes, and politike inuentions, they generallie exceed
 vs: notwithstanding that otherwise these gifts of theirs doo often
 degenerate into meere subtiltie, instabilitie, vnfaithfulnesse, &
 crueltie. Yet Alexander ab Alexandro is of the opinion, that the
 fertilest region dooth bring foorth the dullest wits, and contrariwise
 the harder soile the finest heads. But in mine opinion, the most fertile
 soile dooth bring foorth the proudest nature, as we may see by the
 Campanians, who (as Cicero also saith) had "Penes eos ipsum domicilium
 superbiae." But nether of these opinions do iustlie take hold of vs, yet
 hath it pleased the writers to saie their pleasures of vs. And for that
 we dwell northward, we are commonlie taken by the forren
 historiographers, to be men of great strength and little policie, much
 courage and small shift, bicause of the weake abode of the sunne with
 vs, whereby our braines are not made hot and warmed, as Pachymerus
 noteth lib. 3: affirming further, that the people inhabiting in the
 north parts are white of colour, blockish, vnciuill, fierce and warlike,
 which qualities increase, as they come neerer vnto the pole; whereas the
 contrarie pole giueth contrarie gifts, blacknesse, wisdome, ciuilitie,
 weakenesse, and cowardise, thus saith he. But alas, how farre from
 probabilitie or as if there were not one and the same conclusion to be
 made of the constitutions of their bodies, which dwell vnder both the
 poles. For in truth his assertion holdeth onelie in their persons that
 inhabit neere vnto and vnder the equinoctiall. As for the small tariance
 of the sunne with vs, it is also confuted by the length of our daies.
 [Sidenote: Non vi sed virtute, non armis sed ingenio vincuntur Angli.]
 Wherefore his reason seemeth better to vphold that of Alexander ab
 Alexandro afore alledged, than to prooue that we want wit, bicause our
 brains are not warmed by the tariance of the sunne. And thus also dooth
 Comineus burden vs after a sort in his historie, and after him, Bodinus.
 But thanked be God, that all the wit of his countriemen, if it may be
 called wit, could neuer compasse to doo so much in Britaine, as the
 strength and courage of our Englishmen (not without great wisedome and
 forecast) haue brought to passe in France. The Galles in time past
 contemned the Romans (saith Caesar) bicause of the smalnesse of their
 stature: howbeit, for all their greatnesse (saith he) and at the first
 brunt in the warres, they shew themselues to be but feeble, neither is
 their courage of any force to stand in great calamities. Certes in
 accusing our wisedome in this sort, he dooth (in mine opinion) increase
 our commendation. For if it be a vertue to deale vprightlie with
 singlenesse of mind, sincerelie and plainlie, without anie such
 suspicious fetches in all our dealing, as they commonlie practise in
 their affaires, then are our countrimen to be accompted wise and
 vertuous. But if it be a vice to colour craftinesse, subtile practises,
 doublenesse, and hollow behauiour, with a cloake of policie, amitie and
 wisedome: then are Comineus and his countrimen to be reputed vicious, of
 whome this prouerbe hath of old time beene vsed as an eare marke of
 their dissimulation,

   Galli ridendo fidem frangunt. &c.

 How these latter points take hold in Italie, I meane not to discusse.
 How they are dailie practised in manie places of the maine, & he
 accompted most wise and politike, that can most of all dissemble; here
 is no place iustlie to determine (neither would I wish my countrimen to
 learne anie such wisedome) but that a king of France could saie; "Qui
 nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare, _or_ viuere," their owne histories
 are testimonies sufficient. Galen, the noble physician, transferring the
 forces of our naturall humors from the bodie to the mind, attributeth to
 the yellow colour, prudence; to the blacke, constancie; to bloud, mirth;
 to phlegme, courtesie: which being mixed more or lesse among themselues,
 doo yeeld an infinit varietie. By this meanes therefore it commeth to
 passe, that he whose nature inclineth generallie to phlegme, cannot but
 be courteous: which joined with strength of bodie, and sinceritie of
 behauiour (qualities vniuersallie granted to remaine so well in our
 nation, as other inhabitants of the north) I cannot see what may be an
 hinderance whie I should not rather conclude, that the Britons doo
 excell such as dwell in the hoter countries, than for want of craft and
 subtilties to come anie whit behind them. It is but vanitie also for
 some to note vs (as I haue often heard in common table talke) as
 barbarous, bicause we so little regard the shedding of our bloud, and
 rather tremble not when we see the liquor of life to go from vs (I vse
 their owne words.) Certes if we be barbarous in their eies, bicause we
 be rather inflamed than appalled at our wounds, then are those obiectors
 flat cowards in our iudgement: sith we thinke it a great peece of
 manhood to stand to our tackling, vntill the last drop, as men that may
 spare much bicause we haue much: whereas they hauing lesse are afraid to
 lose that little which they haue: as Frontinus also noteth. As for that
 which the French write of their owne manhood in their histories, I make
 little accompt of it: for I am of the opinion, that as an Italian
 writing of his credit; A papist intreating of religion, a Spaniard of
 his meekenesse, or a Scot of his manhood, is not to be builded on; no
 more is a Frenchman to be trusted in the report of his owne affaires,
 wherein he dooth either dissemble or exceed, which is a foule vice in
 such as professe to deale vprightlie. Neither are we so hard to
 strangers as Horace wold seeme to make vs, sith we loue them so long as
 they abuse vs not, & make accompt of them so far foorth as they despise
 vs not. And this is generallie to be verified, in that they vse our
 priuileges and commodities for diet, apparell and trade of gaine, in so
 ample manner as we our selues enioy them: which is not lawfull for vs to
 doo in their countries, where no stranger is suffered to haue worke, if
 an home-borne be without. But to proceed with our purpose.


 With vs (although our good men care not to liue long, but to liue well)
 some doo liue an hundred yeers, verie manie vnto foure score: as for
 three score, it is taken but for our entrance into age, so that in
 Britaine no man is said to wax old till he draw vnto three score, at
 which time God speed you well commeth in place; as Epaminondas sometime
 [Sidenote: Salutations according to our ages.]
 said in mirth, affirming that vntill thirtie yeares of age, You are
 welcome is the best salutation; and from thence to threescore, God keepe
 you; but after threescore, it is best to saie, God speed you well: for
 at that time we begin to grow toward our iournies end, whereon manie a
 one haue verie good leaue to go. These two are also noted in vs (as
 things apperteining to the firme constitutions of our bodies) that there
 hath not beene seene in anie region so manie carcasses of the dead to
 remaine from time to time without corruption as in Britaine: and that
 after death by slaughter or otherwise, such as remaine vnburied by foure
 or fiue daies togither, are easie to be knowne and discerned by their
 freends and kindred; whereas Tacitus and other complaine of sundrie
 nations, saieng, that their bodies are "Tam fluidae substantiae," that
 within certeine houres the wife shall hardlie know hir husband, the
 mother hir sonne, or one freend another after their liues be ended. In
 like sort the comelinesse of our liuing bodies doo continue from midle
 age (for the most) euen to the last gaspe, speciallie in mankind. And
 albeit that our women through bearing of children doo after fortie begin
 to wrinkle apace, yet are they not commonlie so wretched and hard
 fauoured to looke vpon in their age, as the French women, and diuerse of
 other countries with whom their men also doo much participate; and
 thereto be so often waiward and peeuish, that nothing in maner may
 content them.

 I might here adde somewhat also of the meane stature generallie of our
 women, whose beautie commonlie exceedeth the fairest of those of the
 maine, their comlinesse of person and good proportion of limmes, most of
 theirs that come ouer vnto vs from beyond the seas. This neuerthelesse I
 vtterlie mislike in the poorer sort of them, for the wealthier doo
 sildome offend herein: that being of themselues without gouernement,
 they are so carelesse in the education of their children (wherein their
 husbands are also to be blamed) by means whereof verie manie of them
 neither fearing God, neither regarding either maners or obedience, doo
 oftentimes come to confusion, which (if anie correction or discipline
 had beene vsed toward them in youth) might haue prooued good members of
 their common-wealth & countrie, by their good seruice and industrie. I
 could make report likewise of the naturall vices and vertues of all
 those that are borne within this Iland, but as the full tractation herof
 craueth a better head than mine to set foorth the same, so will I giue
 place to other men that list to take it in hand. Thus much therefore of
 the constitutions of our bodies: and so much may suffice.




 HOW BRITAINE AT THE FIRST GREW TO BE DIUIDED INTO THREE PORTIONS.

 CAP. XXI.


 After the comming of Brutus into this Iland (which was, as you haue read
 in the foresaid treatise, about the yeare of the world, 2850, or 1217
 before the incarnation of Christ, although Goropius after his maner doo
 vtterlie denie our historie in this behalfe) he made a generall surueie
 of the whole Iland from side to side, by such means to view and search
 out not onelie the limits and bounds of his dominions, but also what
 commodities this new atchiued conquest might yeeld vnto his people.
 Furthermore, finding out at the last also a conuenable place wherin to
 erect a citie, he began there euen the verie same which at this daie is
 called London, naming it Trenouanton, in remembrance of old Troie, from
 whence his ancestors proceeded, and for which the Romans pronounced
 afterward Trinobantum, although the Welshmen doo call it still
 Trenewith. This citie was builded (as some write) much about the tenth
 yeare of his reigne, so that he liued not aboue fifteene yeares after he
 had finished the same. But of the rest of his other acts attempted and
 doone, before or after the erection of this citie, I find no certeine
 report, more than that when he had reigned in this Iland after his
 arriuall by the space of foure and twentie yeares, he finished his daies
 at Trenouanton aforesaid, being in his yoong and florishing age, where
 his carcase was honourablie interred. As for the maner of his death, I
 find as yet no mention thereof among such writers as are extant; I meane
 whether it grew vnto him by defect of nature, or force of greeuous
 wounds receiued in his warres against such as withstood him from time to
 time in this Iland, and therefore I can saie nothing of that matter.
 Herein onelie all agree, that during the time of his languishing paines,
 he made a disposition of his whole kingdome, diuiding it into three
 parts or portions, according to the number of his sonnes then liuing,
 whereof the eldest exceeded not eight and twentie yeares of age, as my
 coniecture giueth me.

 [Sidenote: Locrine.]
 To the eldest therefore, whose name was Locrine, he gaue the greatest
 and best region of all the rest, which of him to this daie is called
 [Sidenote: Lhoegria.]
 Lhoegres among the Britons, but in our language England: of such English
 Saxons as made conquest of the same. This portion also is included on
 the south with the British sea, on the est with the Germane Ocean, on
 the north with the Humber, and on the west with the Irish sea, and the
 riuers Dee and Sauerne, whereof in the generall description of this
 [Sidenote: Camber.]
 [Sidenote: Cambri.]
 Iland I haue spoken more at large. To Camber his second sonne he
 assigned all that lieth beyond the Sauerne and Dee, toward the west
 (which parcell in these daies conteineth Southwales and Northwales) with
 sundrie Ilands adiacent to the same, the whole being in maner cut off
 and separated from England or Lhoegria by the said streams, wherby it
 seemeth also a peninsula or by-land, if you respect the small hillie
 portion of ground that lieth indifferentlie betweene their maine
 courses, or such branches (at the least) as run and fall into them. The
 Welshmen or Britons call it by the ancient name still vnto this day, but
 we Englishmen terme it Wales: which denomination we haue from the
 Saxons, who in time past did vse the word Walsh in such sort as we doo
 Strange: for as we call all those strangers that are not of our nation,
 so did they name them Walsh which were not of their countrie.

 [Sidenote: Albanact.]
 The third and last part of the Iland he allotted vnto Albanact his
 youngest sonne (for he had but three in all, as I haue said before)
 whose portion seemed for circuit to be more large than that of Camber,
 and in maner equall in greatnesse with the dominions of Locrinus. But if
 you haue regard to the seuerall commodities that are to be reaped by
 each, you shall find them to be not much discrepant or differing one
 from another: for whatsoeuer the first & second haue in plentie of
 corne, fine grasse, and large cattell, this latter wanteth not in
 exceeding store of fish, rich mettall, quarries of stone, and abundance
 of wild foule: so that in mine opinion, there could not be a more equall
 partition than this made by Brute, and after the aforesaid maner. This
 later parcell at the first, tooke the name of Albanactus, who called it
 Albania. But now a small portion onelie of the region (being vnder the
 regiment of a duke) reteineth the said denomination, the rest being
 called Scotland, of certeine Scots that came ouer from Ireland to
 inhabit in those quarters. It is diuided from Lhoegres also by the Solue
 [Sidenote: Albania.]
 and the Firth, yet some doo note the Humber; so that Albania (as Brute
 left it) conteined all the north part of the Iland that is to be found
 beyond the aforesaid streame, vnto the point of Cathnesse.

 To conclude, Brute hauing diuided his kingdome after this maner, and
 therein contenting himselfe as it were with the generall title of the
 whole, it was not long after yer he ended his life; and being solemnelie
 interred at his new citie by his three children, they parted each from
 other, and tooke possession of their prouinces. But Scotland after two
 [Sidenote: Locrine king also of Scotland.]
 yeares fell againe into the hands of Locrinus as to the chiefe lord,
 by the death of his brother Albanact, who was slaine by Humber king of
 the Scithians, and left none issue behind him to succeed him in that
 kingdome.




 AFTER WHAT MANER THE SOUEREIGNTIE OF THIS ILE DOOTH REMAINE TO THE
 PRINCES OF LHOEGRES OR KINGS OF ENGLAND.

 CHAP. XXII.


 [Sidenote: The Scots alwaies desirous to shake off the English
 subiection, have often made cruell & odious attempts so to doo, but in
 vaine.]
 It is possible that some of the Scotish nation, reading the former
 chapter, will take offence with me for meaning that the principalitie of
 the north parts of this Ile hath alwais belonged to the kings of
 Lhoegres. For whose more ample satisfaction in this behalfe, I will here
 set downe a discourse thereof at large, written by diuerse, and now
 finallie brought into one treatise, sufficient (as I thinke) to satisfie
 the reasonable, although not halfe enough peraduenture to content a
 wrangling mind, sith there is (or at the leastwise hath beene) nothing
 more odious among some, than to heare that the king of England hath
 ought to doo in Scotland.

 How their historiographers haue attempted to shape manie coloured
 excuses to auoid so manifest a title, all men may see that read their
 bookes indifferentlie, wherevnto I referre them. For my part there is
 little or nothing of mine herein, more than onelie the collection and
 abridgement of a number of fragments togither, wherein cheeflie I haue
 vsed the helpe of Nicholas Adams a lawier, who wrote thereof (of set
 purpose) to king Edward the sixt, as Leland did the like to king Henrie
 the eight, Iohn Harding vnto Edward the fourth; beside three other,
 whereof the first dedicated his treatise to Henrie the fourth, the
 second to Edward the third, and the third to Edward the first, as their
 writings yet extant doo abundantlie beare witnesse. The title also that
 Leland giueth his booke, which I haue had written with his owne hand,
 beginneth in this maner: "These remembrances following are found in
 chronicles authorised, remaining in diuerse monasteries both in England
 and Scotland, by which it is euidentlie knowne and shewed, that the
 kings of England haue had, and now ought to haue the souereigntie ouer
 all Scotland, with the homage and fealtie of the kings there reigning
 from time to time, &c." Herevnto you haue heard alreadie, what diuision
 Brute made of this Iland not long before his death, wherof ech of his
 children, so soone as he was interred, tooke seisure and possession.
 Howbeit, after two yeares it happened that Albanact was slaine,
 wherevpon Locrinus and Camber raising their powers, reuenged his death:
 and finallie the said Locrinus made an entrance vpon Albania, seized it
 into his owne hands (as excheated wholie vnto himselfe) without yeelding
 anie part thereof vnto his brother Camber, who made no claime nor title
 vnto anie portion of the same. Hereby then (saith Adams) it euidentlie
 appeareth, that the entire seigniorie ouer Albania consisted in
 Locrinus, according to which example like law among brethren euer since
 hath continued, in preferring the eldest brother to the onelie benefit
 of the collaterall ascension from the yongest, as well in Scotland as in
 England vnto this daie.

 Ebranke the lineall heire from the bodie of this Locrine, that is to
 saie, the sonne of Mempris, sonne of Madan, sonne of the same Locrine
 builded in Albania the castell of Maidens, now called Edenborough (so
 called of Aidan somtime king of Scotland, but at the first named Cair
 Minid Agnes. 1. the castell on mount Agnes, and the castell of virgins)
 and the castell of Alcluith or Alclude, now called Dunbriton, as the
 Scotish Hector Boetius confesseth: whereby it most euidentlie appeareth,
 that our Ebranke was then thereof seized. This Ebranke reigned in the
 said state ouer them a long time; after whose death Albania (as annexed
 to the empire of Britaine) descended to the onelie king of Britons,
 vntill the time of the two sisters sonnes, Morgan and Conedage, lineall
 heires from the said Ebranke, who brotherlie at the first diuided the
 realme between them; so that Morgan had Lhoegres, and Conedage had
 Albania. But shortlie after Morgan the elder brother, pondering in his
 head the loue of his brother with the affection to a kingdome, excluded
 nature, and gaue place to ambition, and therevpon denouncing warre,
 death miserablie ended his life (as the reward of his vntruth) whereby
 Conedage obteined the whole empire of all Britaine: in which state he
 remained during his naturall life.

 From him the same lineallie descended to the onelie king of Britons,
 vntill (and after) the reigne of Gorbodian, who had issue two sonnes,
 Ferrex, and Porrex. This Porrex, requiring like diuision of the land,
 affirming the former partitions to be rather of law than fauor, was by
 the hands of his elder brother (best loued of queene mother) both of his
 life and hoped kingdome beereaued at once. Wherevpon their vnnaturall
 mother, vsing hir naturall malice for the death of hir one sonne
 (without regard of the loosing of both) miserablie slue the other in his
 bed mistrusting no such treason.

 Cloten, by all writers, as well Scotish as other, was the next
 inheritour to the whole empire: but lacking power (the onelie meane in
 those daies to obteine right) he was contented to diuide the same among
 foure of his kinsmen; so that Scater had Albania. But after the death of
 this Cloten, his sonne Dunwallo Mulmutius made warre vpon these foure
 kings, and at last ouercame them, and so recouered the whole dominion.
 In token of which victorie, he caused himselfe to be crowned with a
 crowne of gold, the verie first of that mettall (if anie at all were
 before in vse) that was worne among the kings of this nation. This
 Dunwallo erected temples, wherein the people should assemble for praier;
 to which temples he gaue benefit of sanctuarie. He made the law for
 wager of battell, in cases of murder and felonie, whereby a theefe that
 liued and made his art of fighting, should for his purgation fight with
 the true man whom he had robbed, beleeuing assuredlie, that the gods
 (for then they supposed manie) would by miracle assigne victorie to none
 but the innocent partie. Certes the priuileges of this law, and benefit
 of the latter, as well in Scotland as in England, be inioied to this
 daie, few causes by late positiue laws among vs excepted, wherin the
 benefit of wager of battell is restreined. By which obedience to his
 lawes, it dooth manifestlie appeere, that this Dunwallo was then seized
 of Albania, now called Scotland. This Dunwallo reigned in this estate
 ouer them manie yeares.

 Beline and Brenne the sonnes also of Dunwallo, did after their fathers
 death fauourablie diuide the land betweene them; so that Beline had
 Lhoegres, & Brenne had Albania: but for that this Brenne (a subiect)
 without the consent of his elder brother and lord, aduentured to marrie
 with the daughter of the king of Denmarke; Beline seized Albania into
 his owne hands, and thervpon caused the notable waies priuileged by
 Dunwallons lawes to be newlie wrought by mens hands, which for the
 length extended from the further part of Cornewall, vnto the sea by
 north Cathnesse in Scotland. In like sort to and for the better
 maintenance of religion in those daies, he constituted ministers called
 archflamines, in sundrie places of this Iland (who in their seuerall
 functions resembled the bishops of our times) the one of which remained
 at Ebranke now called Yorke, and the whole region Caerbrantonica
 (whereof Ptolomie also speaketh but not without wresting of the name)
 whose power extended to the vttermost bounds of Albania, wherby likewise
 appeareth that it was then within his owne dominion. After his death the
 whole Ile was inioied by the onelie kings of Britaine, vntill the time
 of Vigenius & Peridurus lineall heires from the said Beline, who
 fauourablie made partition, so that Vigenius had all the land from
 Humber by south, and Peridurus from thence northwards all Albania, &c.
 This Vigenius died, and Peridurus suruiued, and thereby obteined the
 whole, from whom the same quietlie descended, and was by his posteritie
 accordinglie inioied, vntill the reigne of Coell the first of that name.
 In his time an obscure nation (by most writers supposed Scithians)
 passed by seas from Ireland, and arriued in that part of Britaine called
 Albania: against whome this Coell assembled his power, and being entred
 Albania to expell them, one Fergus in the night disguised, entered the
 tent of this Coell, and in his bed traitorouslie slue him.

 This Fergus was therfore, in reward of his great prowesse, made there
 king, whervpon they sat downe in that part, with their wiues and
 children, and called it Scotland, and themselues Scots: from the
 beginning of the world, foure thousand six hundred and seauenteene
 yeares after the Scotish accompt, which by iust computation and
 confession of all their owne writers, is six hundred yeares lacking ten,
 after that Brutus had reigned ouer the whole Iland, the same land being
 inioied by him and his posteritie before their comming, during two and
 fiftie descents of the kings of Britaine, which is a large prescription.
 Certes this intrusion into a land so manie hundred yeares before
 inhabited, and by so manie descents of kings quietlie inioied, is the
 best title that all their owne writers can alledge for them. But to
 proceed. Fergus herevpon immediatlie did diuide Albania also among his
 capteins and their souldiers: whereby it most euidentlie appeareth, that
 there were no people of that nation inhabiting there before, in proofe
 whereof the same partition shall follow.

 The lands of Cathnes lieng against Orkneie, betweene Dummesbeie and the
 [Sidenote: Out of Hector Boecius lib. 1.]
 water of Thane, was giuen vnto one Cornath, a capteine and his people.
 The lands betweene the water of Thane & Nes, now called Rosse, being in
 bredth from Cromart to the mouth of the water of Locht, were giuen to
 Lutorke, another capteine and his people. The lands betweene Spaie and
 Nes, from the Almane seas to the Ireland seas, now called Murraie land,
 were giuen to one Warroch and his people. The land of Thalia, now called
 Boin Ainze, Bogewall, Gariot, Formartine, and Bowguhan, were giuen to
 one Thalis and his people. The lands of Mar Badezenoch, and Lochquhaber,
 were giuen to Martach and his people. The lands of Lorne and Kintier,
 with the hilles and mounteins thereof, lieng from Mar to the Ireland
 seas, were giuen to capteine Nanance and his people. The lands of Athole
 were giuen to Atholus, another capteine and his people. The lands of
 Strabraun, & Brawdawane lieng west from Dunkell, were giuen to Creones &
 Epidithes two capteins. The lands of Argile, were giuen to Argathelus a
 capteine. The lands of Linnox & Clidisdale were allotted to Lolgona a
 capteine. The lands of Siluria now called Kile, Carrike & Cuningham,
 were giuen to Silurth another capteine. The lands of Brigance now called
 Gallowaie, were giuen to the companie called Brigandes, which (as their
 best men) were appointed to dwell next the Britons, who afterward
 expelled the Britons from Annandale in Albania, whereby it is confessed
 to be before inhabited by Britons. The residue of the land now called
 Scotland, that is to saie: Meirnis, Angus, Steremond, Gowrie, Strahern,
 Pirth, Fiffe, Striueling, Callender, Calderwood, Lougthian, Mers,
 Teuedale, with other the Rement Dales, & the Sherifdome, of Berwicke,
 were then enioied by a nation mingled in marriage with the Britons, and
 [Sidenote: Berouicum potius a Berubio promontorio.]
 in their obedience, whose capteine called Beringer builded the castell
 and towne of Berwicke vpon Twede, & these people were called Picts, vpon
 whome by the death of this Coell, these Scots had opportunitie to vse
 wars, whereof they ceased not, vntill such time as it pleased God to
 appoint another Coell king of Britons, against whose name, albeit they
 hoped for a like victorie to the first, yet he preuailed and ceased not
 his warre, vntill these Scots were vtterlie expelled out of all the
 bounds of Britaine, in which they neuer dared to reenter, vntill the
 troublesome reigne of Sisilt king of Britons, which was the twelft king
 after this Coell. During all which time the countrie was reinhabited by
 the Britons. But then the Scots turning the ciuill discord of this
 realme, betweene this Sisilt and his brother Blede to their best
 aduantage, arriued againe in Albania, & there made one Reuther their
 king.

 Vpon this their new arriuall, new warre was made vpon them by this
 Sisilt king of Britons, in which warre Reuther their new king died, and
 Thereus succeeded, against whome the warre of Britons ceased not, vntill
 he freelie submitted himselfe to the said Sicill king of Britons at
 Ebranke, that is Yorke, where shortlie after the tenth yeare of his
 reigne he died. Finnane brother of Josine succeeded by their election to
 the kingdome of Scots, who shortlie after (compelled by the warres of
 the same Sicill) declared himselfe subiect, and for the better assurance
 of his faith and obeisance to the king of Britons, deliuered his sonne
 Durstus into the hands of this Sicill: who fantasieng the child, and
 hoping by his owne succession to alter their subtiltie (I will not saie
 duplicitie saith Adams) married him in the end to Agasia his owne
 daughter.

 [Sidenote: Durstus.]
 This Durstus was their next king; but for that he had married a Briton
 woman, (though indeed she was a kings daughter) the Scots hated him for
 the same cause, for which they ought rather to haue liked him the
 better, and therefore not onelie traitorouslie slue him; but further to
 declare the end of their malice, disinherited (as much as in them was)
 the issues of the same Durstus and Agasia. Herevpon new warre sproong
 betweene them and vs, which ceased not vntill they were contented to
 receiue Edeir to their king, the next in bloud then liuing, descended
 from Durstus and Agasia, and thereby the bloud of the Britons, of the
 part of the mother, was restored to the crowne of Albania: so that
 nature, whose law is immutable, caused this bond of loue to hold. For
 shortlie after this Edeir attended vpon Cassibelane king of Britons, for
 the repulse of Iulius Caesar, as their owne author Boetius confesseth,
 who commanded the same as his subiect. But Iulius Caesar, after his
 second arriuall, by treason of Androgeus preuailed against the Britons,
 and therevpon pursued this Edeir into Scotland; and (as himselfe saith
 in his commentaries) subdued all the Ile of Britaine. Which though the
 liuing Scots denie it, their dead writers confesse that he came beyond
 Calender wood, and cast downe Camelon, the principall citie of the
 Picts. And in token of this victorie, not farre from Carron, builded a
 round temple of stone, which remained in some perfection vntill the
 reigne of our king Edward called the first after the conquest, by whome
 it was subuerted: but the monument thereof remaineth to this daie.

 [Sidenote: Marius.]
 Marius the sonne of Aruiragus, being king of all Britaine, in his time
 one Roderike a Scithian, with a great rabble of needie souldiours, came
 to the water of Frith in Scotland, which is an arme of the sea, diuiding
 Pentland from Fiffe: against whome this Marius assembled a power, by
 which he slue this Rodericke, and discomfited his people in Westmerland:
 but to those that remained aliue, he gaue the countrie of Cathnesse in
 Scotland, which prooueth it to be within his owne dominion.

 [Sidenote: Coelus.]
 Coell the sonne of this Marius had issue Lucius, counted the first
 Christian king of this nation: he conuerted the three archflamines of
 this land into bishopriks, and ordeined bishops vnto ech of them. The
 first remained at London, and his power extended from the furthest part
 of Cornewall to Humber water. The second dwelled at Yorke, and his power
 stretched from Humber to the furthest part of all Scotland. The third
 aboded at Caerleon vpon the riuer of Wiske in Glamorgan in Wales, & his
 power extended from Seuerne through all Wales. Some write that he made
 but two, and turned their names to archbishops, the one to remaine at
 Canturburie, the other at Yorke: yet they confesse that he of Yorke had
 iurisdiction through all Scotland: either of which is sufficient to
 prooue Scotland to be then vnder his dominion.

 [Sidenote: Seuerus.]
 Seuerus, by birth a Romane, but in bloud a Briton (as some thinke) and
 the lineall heire of the bodie of Androgeus sonne of Lud, & nephue of
 Cassibelane, was shortlie after emperour & king of Britons, in whose
 time the people to whom his ancestor Marius gaue the land of Cathnesse
 in Scotland, conspired with the Scots, & receiued them from the Iles
 into Scotland. But herevpon this Seuerus came into Scotland, and meeting
 with their faith and false harts togither, droue them all out of the
 maine land into Iles, the vttermost bounds of all great Britaine. But
 notwithstanding this glorious victorie, the Britons considering their
 seruitude to the Romans, imposed by treason of Androgeus, ancestor to
 this Seuerus, began to hate him, whome yet they had no time to loue, and
 who in their defense and suertie had slaine of the Scots and their
 confederats in one battell thirtie thousand: but such was the
 consideration of the common sort in those daies, whose malice no time
 could diminish, nor iust desert appease.

 [Sidenote: Bassianus.]
 Antoninus Bassianus borne of a Briton woman, and Geta borne by a Romane
 woman, were the sonnes of this Seuerus, who after the death of their
 father, by the contrarie voices of their people, contended for the
 crowne. Few Britons held with Bassianus, fewer Romans with Geta: but the
 greater number with neither of both. In the end Geta was slaine, and
 Bassianus remained emperour, against whom Carautius rebelled, who gaue
 vnto the Scots, Picts, and Scithians, the countrie of Cathnesse in
 Scotland, which they afterward inhabited, whereby his seison thereof
 appeareth.

 [Sidenote: Coill.]
 Coill, descended of the bloud of the ancient kings of this land, was
 shortlie after king of the Britons, whose onelie daughter and heire
 called Helen, was married vnto Constantius a Romane, who daunted the
 rebellion of all parts of great Britaine; and after the death of this
 Coill was in the right of his wife king thereof, and reigned in his
 state ouer them thirteene or fourteene yeares.

 [Sidenote: Constantine.]
 Constantine the sonne of this Constance, and Helen, was next king of
 Britons, by the right of his mother, who passing to Rome to receiue the
 empire thereof, deputed one Octauius king of Wales, and duke of the
 Gewisses (which some expound to be afterward called west Saxons) to haue
 the gouernment of this dominion. But abusing the kings innocent
 goodnesse, this Octauius defrauded this trust, and tooke vpon him the
 crowne. For which traitorie albeit he was once vanquished by Leonine
 Traheron, great vncle to Constantine: yet after the death of this
 Traheron, he preuailed againe, and vsurped ouer all Britaine.
 Constantine being now emperor sent Maximius his kinsman hither (in
 processe of time) to destroie the same Octauius, who in singular battell
 discomfited him. Wherevpon this Maximius, as well by the consent of
 great Constantine, as by the election of all the Britons, for that he
 was a Briton in bloud, was made king or rather vicegerent of Britaine.
 This Maximius made warre vpon the Scots and Scithians within Britaine,
 and ceassed not vntill he had slaine Eugenius their king, and expelled
 and driuen them out of the whole limits and bounds of Britaine. Finallie
 he inhabited all Scotland with Britons, no man, woman, nor child of the
 Scotish nation suffered to remaine within it, which (as their Hector
 Boetius saith) was for their rebellion; and rebellion properlie could it
 not be, except they had beene subiects. He suffered the Picts also to
 remaine his subiects, who made solemne othes to him, neuer after to
 erect anie peculiar king of their owne nation, but to remaine vnder the
 old empire of the onelie king of Britaine. I had once an epistle by
 Leland exemplified (as he saith) out of a verie ancient record which
 beareth title of Helena vnto hir sonne Constantine, and entreth after
 this manner; "Domino semper Augusto filio Constantino, mater Helena
 semper Augusta, &c." And now it repenteth me that I did not exemplifie
 and conueigh it into this treatise whilest I had his books. For thereby
 I might haue had great light for the estate of this present discourse:
 but as then I had no mind to haue trauelled in this matter;
 neuerthelesse, if hereafter it come againe to light I would wish it were
 reserued. It followeth on also in this maner (as it is translated out of
 the Greeke) "Veritatem sapientis animus non recusat, nec fides recta
 aliquando patitur quamcunque iacturam, &c."

 About fiue and fourtie yeares after this (which was long time after the
 death of this Maximius) with the helpe of Gouan or Gonan and Melga, the
 Scots newlie arriued in Albania, and there created one Fergus the second
 of that name to be there king. But bicause they were before banished the
 continent land, they crowned him king on their aduenture in Argile, in
 the fatall chaire of marble, the yeere of our Lord, foure hundred and
 two and twentie, as they themselues doo write.

 [Sidenote: Maximian.]
 Maximian sonne of Leonine Traheron, brother to king Coill, and vncle to
 Helene, was by lineall succession next king of Britons: but to appease
 the malice of Dionothus king of Wales, who also claimed the kingdome, he
 married Othilia eldest daughter of Dionothus, and afterwards assembled a
 great power of Britons, and entered Albania, inuading Gallowaie, Mers,
 Annandale, Pentland, Carrike, Kill, and Cuningham, and in battell slue
 both this Fergus then king of Scots, and Durstus the king of Picts, and
 exiled all their people out of the continent land: wherevpon the few
 number of Scots then remaining a liue, went to Argile, and there made
 Eugenius their king. When this Maximian had thus obteined quietnesse in
 Britaine, he departed with his cousine Conan Meridocke into Armorica,
 where they subdued the king, and depopulated the countrie, which he gaue
 to Conan his cousine, to be afterward inhabited by Britons, by the name
 of Britaine the lesse: and hereof this realme tooke name of Britaine the
 great, which name by consent of forren writers it keepeth vnto this
 daie.

 After the death of Maximian, dissention being mooued betweene the nobles
 of Britaine, the Scots swarmed togither againe, and came to the wall of
 Adrian, where (this realme being diuided in manie factions) they
 ouercame one. And herevpon their Hector Boetius (as an hen that for
 laieng of one eg, will make a great cakeling) solemnlie triumphing for a
 conquest before the victorie, alledgeth that hereby the Britons were
 made tributaries to the Scots, and yet he confesseth that they won no
 more land, by that supposed conquest, but the same portion betweene them
 and Humber, which in the old partitions before was annexed to Albania.
 It is hard to be beleeued, that such a broken nation as the Scots at
 that time were, returning from banishment within foure yeares before,
 and since in battell loosing both their kings, and the great number of
 their best men, to be thus able to make a conquest of great Britaine;
 and verie vnlikelie if they had conquered it, they would haue left the
 hot sunne of the south parts, to dwell in the cold snow in Scotland.
 Incredible it is, that if they had conquered it, they would not haue
 deputed officers in it, as in cases of conquest behooueth. And it is
 beyond all beliefe, that great Britaine, or any other countrie, should
 be woon without the comming of anie enimie into it: as they did not, but
 taried finallie at the same wall of Adrian, whereof I spake before.

 But what need I speake of these defenses, when the same Boecius scantlie
 trusteth his owne beliefe in this tale. For he saieth that Galfride, and
 sundrie other authentike writers, diuerslie varie from this part of his
 storie, wherein his owne thought accuseth his conscience of vntruth:
 herein also he further forgetting how it behooueth a lier to be mindfull
 of his assertion, in the fourth chapter next following, wholie bewraieth
 himselfe, saieng that the confederat kings of Scots and Picts, vpon
 ciuill warres betweene the Britons (which then followed) hoped shortlie
 to inioie all the land of great Britaine, from beyond Humber vnto the
 fresh sea, which hope had bene vaine, and not lesse than void, if it had
 beene their owne by anie conquest before.

 Constantine of Britaine, descended from Conan king thereof, cousine of
 Brutes bloud to this Maximian, and his neerest heire was next king of
 Britaine; he immediatlie pursued the Scots with wars, and shortlie in
 battell slue their king Dongard, in the first yeare of his reigne,
 whereby he recouered Scotland out of their hands, and tooke all the
 holdes thereof into his owne possessions. Vortiger shortlie after
 obteined the crowne of Britaine, against whom the Scots newlie rebelled:
 for the repressing whereof (mistrusting the Britons to hate him for
 sundrie causes, as one that to auoid the smoke dooth oft fall into the
 fire) receiued Hengest a Saxon, and a great number of his countriemen,
 with whom and a few Britons he entred Scotland & ouercame them,
 wherevpon they tooke the Iles, which are their common refuge. He gaue
 also much of Scotland, as Gallowaie, Pentland, Mers and Annandale, with
 sundrie other lands to this Hengest and his people to inhabit, which
 they did accordinglie inioie. But when this Hengest in processe of time
 thirsted after the whole kingdome of the south, he was banished, and yet
 afterward being restored, he conspired with the Scots against
 Aurilambrose the sonne of Constantine, the iust inheritor of this whole
 dominion. But his vntruth and theirs were both recompensed togither, for
 [Sidenote: Some thinke the Seimors to come from this man by lineall
 descent and I suppose no lesse.]
 he was taken prisoner by Eldulph de Samor a noble man of Britaine, and
 his head for his traitorie striken off at the commandement of
 Aurilambrose. In the field the Scots were vanquished: but Octa the sonne
 of Hengest was receiued to mercie, to whome and his people this
 Aurilambrose gaue the countrie of Gallowaie in Scotland, for which they
 became his subiects. And hereby appeareth that Scotland was then againe
 reduced into his hands.

 Vter called also Pendragon, brother to Aurilambrose was next king of the
 Britons, against whome, these sworne Saxons now foresworne subiects
 (confederate with the Scots) newlie rebelled: but by his power assembled
 against them in Gallowaie in Scotland, they were discomfited, & Albania
 againe recouered vnto his subiection. Arthur the sonne of this Vter,
 begotten before the mariage, but lawfullie borne in matrimonie,
 succeeded next to the crowne of great Britaine; whose noble acts, though
 manie vulgar fables haue rather stained than commended: yet all the
 Scotish writers confesse, that he subdued great Britaine, and made it
 tributarie to him, and ouercame the Saxons then scattered as far as
 Cathnesse in Scotland: and in all these wars against them, he had the
 seruice and obeisance of Scots and Picts. But at the last setting their
 feet in the guilefull paths of their predecessors, they rebelled and
 besieged the citie of Yorke, Howell king of the lesse Britaine cousine
 to king Arthur being therein. But he with an host came thither and
 discomfited the Scots, chased them into a marsh, and besieged them there
 so long, that they were almost famished: vntill the bishops, abbats, and
 men of religion (for as much as they were christened people) besought
 him to take them to his mercie and grace, and to grant them a portion of
 the same countrie to dwell in vnder euerlasting subiection. Vpon this he
 tooke them to his grace, homage and fealtie: and when they were sworne
 his subiects and liegemen, he ordeined his kinsman Anguisan to be their
 king and gouernour, Vrian king of Iland, and Murefrence king of
 Orkeneie. He made an archbishop of Yorke also, whose authoritie extended
 through all Scotland.

 Finallie, the said Arthur holding his roiall feast at Cairleon, had
 there all the kings that were subiects vnto him, among which, Angusian
 the said king of Scots did his due seruice and homage, so long as he was
 with him for the realme of Scotland, & bare king Arthurs sword afore
 him. Malgo shortlie after succeeded in the whole kingdome of great
 Britaine, who vpon new resistance made, subdued Ireland, Iland, the
 Orchads, Norwaie and Denmarke, and made Ethelfred a Saxon king of
 Bernicia, that is, Northumberland, Louthian, and much other land of
 Scotland, which Ethelfred by the sword obteined at the hands of the
 wilfull inhabitants, and continued true subiect to this Malgo.

 Cadwan succeeded in the kingdome of great Britaine, who in defense of
 his subiects the Scots, made warre vpon this Ethelfred, but at the last
 they agreed, and Cadwan vpon their rebellion gaue all Scotland vnto this
 Ethelfred, which he therevpon subdued and inioied: but afterward in the
 reigne of Cadwallo that next succeeded in great Britaine, he rebelled.
 Whervpon the same Cadwallo came into Scotland, and vpon his treason
 reseised the countrie into his owne hands, and hauing with him all the
 vicerois of the Saxons, which then inhabited here as his subiects, in
 singular battell he slue the same Ethelfred with his owne hands.

 Oswald was shortlie after by Cadwallos gift made king of Bernicia, and
 he as subiect to Cadwallo, and by his commandement discomfited the Scots
 and Picts, and subdued all Scotland. Oswie the brother of this Oswald,
 was by the like gift of Cadwallo, made next king of Bernicia, and he by
 like commandement newlie subdued the Scots and Picts, and held them in
 that obeisance to this Cadwallow, during eight and twentie yeares. Thus
 Cadwallo reigned in the whole monarchie of great Britaine, hauing all
 the seuen kings thereof, as well Saxons as others his subiects: for
 albeit the number of Saxons from time to time greatlie increased, yet
 were they alwaies either at the first expelled, or else made tributarie
 to the onelie kings of Britons for the time being, as all their owne
 writers doo confesse.

 Cadwallader was next king of the whole great Britaine, he reigned twelue
 yeares ouer all the kings thereof, in great peace and tranquillitie: and
 then vpon the lamentable death of his subiects, which died of sundrie
 diseases innumerablie, he departed into little Britaine. His sonne and
 cousine Iuor and Iue, being expelled out of England also by the Saxons,
 went into Wales, where among the Britons they and their posteritie
 remained princes. Vpon this great alteration, and warres being through
 the whole dominion betweene the Britons and Saxons, the Scots thought
 time to slip the collar of obedience, and therevpon entred in league
 with Charles then king of France, establishing it in this wise.

 1 "The iniurie of Englishmen doone to anie of these people, shall be
 perpetuallie holden common to them both.

 2 "When Frenchmen be inuaded by Englishmen, the Scots shall send their
 armie in defense of France, so that they be supported with monie and
 vittels by the French.

 3 "When Scots be inuaded by Englishmen, the Frenchmen shall come vpon
 their owne expenses, to their support and succour.

 4 "None of the people shall take peace or truce with Englishmen, without
 the aduise of other, &c."

 [Sidenote: _Nicholas Adams._]
 Manie disputable opinions may be had of warre without the praising of
 it, as onelie admittable by inforced necessitie, and to be vsed for
 peace sake onelie, where here the Scots sought warre for the loue of
 warre onelie. For their league giueth no benefit to themselues, either
 in free traffike of their owne commodities, or benefit of the French, or
 other priuilege to the people of both. What discommoditie riseth by
 loosing the intercourse and exchange of our commodities (being in
 necessaries more aboundant than France) the Scots feele, and we
 perfectlie know. What ruine of their townes, destruction of countries,
 slaughter of both peoples, haue by reason of this bloudie league
 chanced, the histories be lamentable to read, and horrible among
 Christian men to be remembred: but God gaue the increase according to
 their seed, for as they did hereby sowe dissention, so did they shortlie
 after reape a bloudie slaughter and confusion. For Alpine their king,
 possessing a light mind that would be lost with a little wind, hoped by
 this league shortlie to subdue all great Britaine, and to that end not
 onelie rebelled in his owne kingdome, but also vsurped vpon the kingdome
 of Picts. Whervpon Edwine king of England, made one Brudeus king of
 Picts, whom he sent into Scotland with a great power, where in battell
 he tooke this Alpine king of Scots prisoner, and discomfited his people.
 And this Alpine being their king found subiect and rebell, his head was
 striken off at a place in Scotland, which thereof is to this daie called
 Pasalpine, that is to saie, the head of Alpine. And this was the first
 effect of their French league.

 Osbright king of England, with Ella his subiect, and a great number of
 Britons and Saxons shortlie after, for that the Scots had of themselues
 elected a new king, entered Scotland, and ceassed not his war against
 them, vntill their king and people fled into the Iles, with whome at the
 last vpon their submission, peace was made in this wise.

 The water of Frith shall be march betweene Scots and Englishmen in the
 east parts, and shall be named the Scotish sea.

 The water of Cluide to Dunbriton, shall be march in the west parts
 betweene the Scots and Britons. This castell was before called Alcluide,
 but now Dunbriton, that is to say, the castle of Britons, and sometimes
 it was destroied by the Danes. So the Britons had all the lands from
 Sterling to the Ireland seas, and from the water of Frith & Cluide to
 Cumber, with all the strengths and commodities thereof: and the
 Englishmen had the lands betweene Sterling and Northumberland. Thus was
 Cluide march betweene the Scots and the Britons on the one side, and the
 water of Frith named the Scotish sea, march betweene them and Englishmen
 on the other side, and Sterling common march to three people, Britons,
 Englishmen, and Scots, howbeit king Osbright had the castle of Stirling,
 where first he caused to be coined Sterling monie. The Englishmen also
 builded a bridge of stone, for passage ouer the water of Frith, in the
 middest whereof they made a crosse, vnder which were written these
 verses:

   I am free march, as passengers may ken,
   To Scots, to Britons, and Englishmen.

 Not manie yeares after this, Hinguar and Hubba, two Danes, with a great
 number of people, arriued in Scotland, and slue Constantine, whom
 Osbright had before made king: wherevpon Edulfe or Ethelwulfe, then king
 of England, assembled his power against Hinguar and Hubba, and in one
 battell slue them both; but such of their people as would remaine and
 become christians, he suffered to tarie: the rest he banished or put to
 death, &c.

 This Ethelwulfe granted the Peter pence, of which albeit Peter & Paule
 had little need and lesse right: yet the paiment thereof continued in
 this realme euer after vntill now of late yeares. But the Scots euer
 since vnto this daie haue, and yet doo paie it, by reason of that grant,
 which prooueth them to be then vnder his obeisance.

 Alured or Alfred succeeded in the kingdome of England, and reigned
 noblie ouer the whole monarchie of great Britaine: he made lawes, that
 persons excommunicated should be disabled to sue or claime anie
 propertie; which law Gregour, whome this Alured had made king of Scots,
 obeied; and the same law as well in Scotland as in England is holden to
 this daie, which also prooueth him to be high lord of Scotland.

 This Alured constreined Gregour king of Scots also to breake the league
 with France, for generallie he concluded with him, and serued him in all
 his warres, as well against Danes as others, not reseruing or making
 anie exception of the former league with France.

 The said Alured, after the death of Gregour, had the like seruice and
 obeisance of Donald king of Scots with fiue thousand horssemen, against
 one Gurmond a Dane that then infested the realme, and this Donald died
 in this faith and obeisance with Alured.

 Edward the first of that name called Chifod sonne of this Alured
 succeeded his father, and was the next king of England: against whome
 Sithrijc a Dane and the Scots conspired; but they were subdued, and
 Constantine their king brought to obeisance. He held the realme of
 Scotland also of king Edward, and this dooth Marian their owne
 countrieman a Scot confesse: beside Roger Houeden, and William of
 Malmesberie.

 In the yeare of our Lord 923, the same king Edward was president and
 gouernour of all the people of England, Cumberland, Scots, Danes, and
 Britons.

 King Athelstane in like sort conquered Scotland, and as he laie in his
 tents beside Yorke, whilest the warres lasted, the king of Scots feined
 himselfe to be a minstrell, and harped before him onelie to espie his
 ordinance and his people. But being (as their writers confesse)
 corrupted with monie, he sold his faith and false heart together to the
 Danes, and aided them against king Athelstane at sundrie times. Howbeit
 he met with all their vntruthes at Broningfield in the west countrie, as
 is mentioned in the ninth chapter of the first booke of this
 description, where he discomfited the Danes, and slue Malcolme deputie
 in that behalfe to the king of Scots: in which battell the Scots
 confesse themselues to haue lost more people than were remembred in anie
 age before. Then Athelstane following his good lucke, went throughout
 all Scotland and wholie subdued it, and being in possession thereof,
 gaue land there lieng in Annandale by his deed, the copie wherof dooth
 follow:

 "I king Athelstane, giues vnto Paulam, Oddam and Roddam, als good and
 als faire, as euer they mine were, and thereto witnesse Mauld my wife."

 By which course words, not onelie appeareth the plaine simplicitie of
 mens dooings in those daies: but also a full proofe that he was then
 seized of Scotland. At the last also he receiued homage of Malcolme king
 of Scots: but for that he could not be restored to his whole kingdome,
 he entered into religion, and there shortlie after died.

 Then Athelstane, for his better assurance of that countrie there after,
 thought it best to haue two stringes to the bowe of their obedience, and
 therefore not onelie constituted one Malcolme to be their king, but also
 appointed one Indulph sonne of Constantine the third, to be called
 prince of Scotland, to whome he gaue much of Scotland: and for this
 Malcolme did homage to Athelstane.

 Edmund brother of Athelstane succeeded next king of England, to whome
 this Indulph then king of Scots not onelie did homage, but also serued
 him with ten thousand Scots, for the expulsion of the Danes out of the
 realme of England.

 [Sidenote: Some referre this to an Edward.]
 Edred or Eldred brother to this Edmund succeeded next king of England:
 he not onelie receiued the homage of Irise then king of Scots, but also
 the homage of all the barons of Scotland.

 Edgar the sonne of Edmund, brother of Athelstane, being now of full age,
 was next king of England: he reigned onelie ouer the whole monarchie of
 Britaine, and receiued homage of Keneth king of Scots for the kingdome
 of Scotland, and made Malcolme prince thereof.

 This Edgar gaue vnto the same Keneth the countrie of Louthian in
 Scotland, which was before seized into the hands of Osbright king of
 England for their rebellion, as is before declared. He inioined Keneth
 their said king also once in euerie yeere at certeine principall feasts
 (whereat the king did vse to weare his crowne) to repaire vnto him into
 England for the making of lawes: which in those daies was doone by the
 noble men or peeres according to the order of France at this daie. He
 allowed also sundrie lodgings in England, to him and his successours,
 whereat to lie, and refresh themselues in their iourneies, whensoeuer
 they should come vp to doo their homages: and finallie a peece of ground
 lieng beside the new palace of Westminster, vpon which this Keneth
 builded a house, that by him and his posteritie was inioied vntill the
 reigne of king Henrie the second. In whose time, vpon the rebellion of
 William king of Scots, it was resumed into the king of Englands hand.
 The house is decaied, but the ground where it stood is called Scotland
 to this daie.

 [Sidenote: Lawfull age and wardship of heires.]
 Moreouer, Edgar made this law, that no man should succeed to his
 patrimonie or inheritance holden by knights seruice, vntill he
 accomplished the age of one and twentie yeeres: because by intendment
 vnder that age, he should not be able in person to serue his king and
 countrie according to the tenor of his deed, and the condition of his
 purchase. This law was receiued by the same Keneth in Scotland; and as
 well there as in England is obserued to this daie: which prooueth also
 that Scotland was then vnder his obeisance.

 In the yeere of our Lord 974, Kinald king of Scots, and Malcolme king of
 Cumberland, Macon king of Man and the Iles, Duuenall king of Southwales,
 Siferth and Howell kings of the rest of Wales, Jacob or James of
 Gallowaie, & Jukill of Westmerland did homage to king Edgar at Chester.
 And on the morrow going by water to the monasterie of saint Iohns to
 seruice, and returning home againe: the said Edgar sitting in a barge,
 and stirring the same vpon the water of Dee, made the said kings to row
 the barge, saieng that his successors might well be ioifull to haue the
 prerogatiue of so great honour, and the superioritie of so manie mightie
 princes to be subiect vnto their monarchie.

 Edward, the sonne of this Edgar, was next king of England, in whose time
 this Keneth king of Scots caused Malcolme king of Scotland to be
 poisoned. Wherevpon king Edward made warre against him, which ceased not
 vntill this Keneth submitted himselfe, and offered to receiue him for
 prince of Scotland, whome king Edward would appoint. Herevpon king
 Edward proclamed one Malcolme to be prince of Scotland, who immediatlie
 came into England, and there did homage vnto the same king Edward.

 Etheldred, brother of this Edward succeeded next ouer England, against
 whome Swaine king of Denmarke conspired with this last Malcolme then
 king of Scots. But shortlie after, this Malcolme sorrowfullie submitted
 himselfe into the defense of Etheldred: who considering how that which
 could not be amended, must onelie be repented, benignlie receiued him.
 By helpe of whose seruice at last Etheldred recouered his realme againe
 out of the hands of Swaine, and reigned ouer the whole monarchie eight
 and thirtie yeeres.

 Edmund surnamed Ironside, sonne of this Etheldred, was next king of
 England, in whose time Canutus a Dane inuaded the realme with much
 crueltie. But at the last he married with Emme sometime wife vnto
 Etheldred and mother of this Edmund. Which Emme, as arbitratrix betweene
 hir naturall loue to the one, and matrimoniall dutie to the other,
 procured such amitie betweene them in the end, that Edmund was contented
 to diuide the realme with Canutus: and keeping to himselfe all England
 on this side Humber, gaue all the rest beyond Humber, with the
 seigniorie of Scotland to this Canutus. Wherevpon Malcolme then king of
 Scots (after a little accustomable resistance) did homage to the same
 Canutus for the kingdome of Scotland. Thus the said Canutus held the
 same ouer of this Edmund king of England by the like seruices, so long
 as they liued togither. This Canutus in memorie of this victorie, and
 glorie of his seigniorie ouer the Scots, commanded Malcolme their king
 to build a church in Buchquhan in Scotland, (where a field betweene him
 and them was fought) to be dedicated to Olauus patrone of Norwaie and
 Denmarke, which church was by the same Malcolme accordinglie performed.

 Edward called the Confessour, sonne of Etheldred, and brother to Edmund
 Ironside, was afterward king of England: he tooke from Malcolme king of
 Scots his life and his kingdome, and made Malcolme sonne to the king of
 Cumberland and Northumberland king of Scots, who did him homage and
 fealtie.

 This Edward perused the old lawes of the realme, and somewhat added to
 some of them: as to the law of Edgar for the wardship of the lands
 vntill the heire should accomplish the age of one and twentie yeeres. He
 added, that the marriage of such heire should also belong to the lord of
 [Sidenote: To whome the marriage of the ward perteineth.]
 whom the same land was holden. Also, that euerie woman marrieng a
 freeman, should (notwithstanding she had no children by that husband)
 enioie the third part of his inheritance during hir life: with manie
 other lawes which the same Malcolme king of Scots obeied, and which as
 well by them in Scotland, as by vs in England be obserued to this day,
 and directlie prooueth the whole to be then vnder his obeisance.

 By reason of this law, Malcolme the sonne of Duncane next inheritor to
 the crowne of Scotland, being within age, was by the nobles of Scotland
 deliuered as ward to the custodie also of king Edward. During whose
 minoritie, one Makebeth a Scot traitorouslie vsurped the crowne of
 Scotland. Against whome the said Edward made warre, in which the said
 Mackbeth was ouercome and slaine. Wherevpon the said Malcolme was
 crowned king of Scots at Scone, in the eight yeere of the reigne of king
 Edward aforesaid. This Malcolme also by tenor of the said new law of
 wardship, was married vnto Margaret the daughter of Edward sonne of
 Edmund Ironside and Agatha, by the disposition of the same king Edward,
 and at his full age did homage to this king Edward the Confessour for
 the kingdome of Scotland.

 [Sidenote: Edward the Confessour.]
 Moreouer, Edward of England, hauing no issue of his bodie, and
 mistrusting that Harald the son of Goodwine, descended of the daughter
 of Harald Harefoot the Dane, would vsurpe the crowne, if he should leaue
 it to his cousine Edgar Eatling (being then within age) and partlie by
 the petition of his subiects, who before had sworne neuer to receiue
 anie kings ouer them of the Danish nation, did by his substantiall will
 in writing (as all our clergie writers affirme) demise the crowne of
 great Britaine vnto William Bastard, then duke of Normandie, and to his
 heires, constituting him his heire testamentarie. Also there was
 proximitie in bloud betweene them: for Emme daughter of Richard duke of
 Normandie was wife vnto Etheldred, on whom he begat Alured and this
 Edward: and this William was son of Robert sonne of Richard, brother of
 the whole bloud to the same Emme. Whereby appeareth that this William
 was heire by title, and not by conquest, albeit that partlie to
 extinguish the mistrust of other titles, and partlie for the glorie of
 his victorie, he chalenged in the end, the name of a conquerour, and
 hath beene so written euer since the time of his arriuall.

 [Sidenote: William Bastard.]
 Furthermore, this William, called the Bastard and the Conquerour,
 supposed not his conquest perfect till he had likewise subdued the
 Scots. Wherfore to bring the Scots to iust obeisance after his
 coronation, as heire testamentarie to Edward the Confessour; he entred
 Scotland, where after a little resistance made by the inhabitants, the
 said Malcolme then their king did homage to him at Abirnethie in
 Scotland for the kingdome of Scotland, as to his superiour also by meane
 of his late conquest.

 [Sidenote: William Rufus.]
 William surnamed Rufus, sonne to this William called the Conquerour,
 succeeded next in the throne of England, to whome the said Malcolme king
 of Scots did like homage for the whole kingdome of Scotland. But
 afterward he rebelled, and was by this William Rufus slaine in plaine
 field. Wherevpon the Scotishmen did choose one Donald or Dunwall to be
 their king. But this William Rufus deposed him, and created Dunkane
 sonne of Malcolme to be their king, who did like homage to him.
 Finallie, this Dunkane was slaine by the Scots, and Dunwall restored,
 who once againe by this William Rufus was deposed; and Edgar son of
 Malcolme, and brother to the last Malcolme, was by him made their king,
 who did like homage for Scotland to this William Rufus.

 [Sidenote: Henrie I.]
 Henrie called Beauclerke the sonne of William called the Conquerour,
 after the death of his brother William Rufus, succeeded to the crowne of
 England, to whome the same Edgar king of Scots did homage for Scotland:
 this Henrie Beauclerke maried Mawd the daughter of Malcolme K. of Scots,
 and by hir had issue Mawd afterward empresse.

 Alexander the sonne of Malcolme brother to this Mawd was next king of
 Scots, he did like homage for the kingdome of Scotland to this Henrie
 the first, as Edgar had doone before him.

 [Sidenote: Mawd.]
 Mawd called the empresse, daughter and heire to Henrie Beauclerke and
 Mawd his wife, receiued homage of Dauid, brother to hir and to this
 Alexander next king of Scots, before all the temporall men of England
 for the kingdome of Scotland. This Mawd the empresse gaue vnto Dauid in
 the marriage, Mawd the daughter and heire of Voldosius earle of
 Huntingdon & Northumberland. And herein their euasion appeareth, by
 which they allege that their kings homages were made for the earledome
 of Huntingdon. For this Dauid was the first that of their kings was
 earle of Huntingdon, which was since all the homages of their kings
 before recited, and at the time of this mariage, & long after the said
 Alexander his brother was king of Scots, doing the homage aforesaid to
 Henrie Beauclerke son to the aforesaid ladie, of whome I find this
 epitaph worthie to be remembred:

   Ortu magna, viro maior, sed maxima partu,
     Hic iacet Henrici filia, sponsa, parens.

 In the yeere of our Lord 1136, and first yeere of the reigne of king
 Stephan, the said Dauid king of Scots being required to doo his homage,
 refused it: for so much as he had doone homage to Mawd the empresse
 before time; notwithstanding the sonne of the said Dauid did homage to
 king Stephan.

 [Sidenote: Henrie 2.]
 Henrie called Fitz empresse, the sonne of Mawd the empresse daughter of
 Mawd, daughter of Malcolme king of Scots, was next king of England. He
 receiued homage for Scotland of Malcolme sonne of Henrie, sonne of the
 said Dauid their last king. Which Malcolme after this homage attended
 vpon the same king Henrie in his warres against Lewis then king of
 France. Whereby appeareth that their French league was neuer renewed
 after the last diuision of their countrie by Osbright king of England.
 But after these warres finished with the French king, this Malcolme
 being againe in Scotland rebelled: wherevpon king Henrie immediatlie
 seized Huntingdon and Northumberland into his owne hands by confiscation,
 and made warres vpon him in Scotland: during which the same Malcolme
 died without issue of his bodie.

 William brother of this Malcolme was next king of Scots, he with all the
 [Sidenote: Because they were taken from him before.]
 nobles of Scotland (which could not be now for anie earledome) did
 homage to the sonne of Henrie the second, his father. Also the earledome
 of Huntingdon was (as ye haue heard) before this forfeited by Malcolme
 his brother, and neuer after restored to the crowne of Scotland.

 This William did afterward attend vpon the same Henrie the second, in
 his warres in Normandie against the French king (notwithstanding their
 French league) and then being licenced to depart home in the tenth of
 this prince, and vpon the fifteenth of Februarie he returned, and vpon
 the sixteenth of October did homage to him for the realme of Scotland.
 In token also of his perpetuall subjection to the crowne of England, he
 offered vp his cloake, his saddle, and his speare at the high altar in
 Yorke: wherevpon he was permitted to depart home into Scotland, where
 immediatlie he mooued cruell warre in Northumberland against the same
 king Henrie, being as yet in Normandie. But God tooke the defense of
 king Henries part, and deliuered the same William king of Scots into the
 hands of a few Englishmen, who brought him prisoner to king Henrie into
 Normandie in the twentith yeere of his reigne. But at the last, at the
 sute of Dauid his brother, Richard bishop of saint Andrews, and other
 bishops and lords, he was put to this fine for the amendment of his
 trespasse; to wit, to paie ten thousand pounds sterling, and to
 surrender all his title to the earldome of Huntingdon, Cumberland, &
 Northumberland into the hands of king Henrie, which he did in all things
 accordinglie, sealing his charters thereof with the great scale of
 Scotland, and signets of his nobilitie yet to be seene: wherein it was
 also comprised, that he and his successours should hold the realme of
 Scotland of the king of England and his successours for euer. And
 herevpon he once againe did homage to the same king Henrie, which now
 could not be for the earledome of Huntingdon, the right whereof was
 alreadie by him surrendered. And for the better assurance of this faith
 also, the strengths of Berwike, Edenborough, Roxborough, and Striueling
 were deliuered into the hands of our king Henrie of England, which their
 owne writers confesse. But Hector Boetius saith, that this trespasse was
 amended by fine of twentie thousand pounds sterling, and that the
 erledome of Huntingdon, Cumberland, and Northumberland were deliuered as
 morgage into the hands of king Henrie, vntill other ten thousand pounds
 sterling should be to him paid, which is so farre from truth, as Hector
 was (while he liued) from well meaning to our countrie. But if we grant
 that it is true, yet prooueth he not that the monie was paid, nor the
 land otherwise redeemed, or euer after came to anie Scotish kings hands.
 And thus it appeareth that the earledome of Huntingdon was neuer
 occasion of the homages of the Scotish kings to the kings of England,
 either before this time or after.

 This was doone 1175. Moreouer I read this note hereof gathered out of
 Robertus Montanus or Montensis that liued in those daies, and was (as I
 take it) "confessor to king Henrie. The king of Scots dooth homage to
 king Henrie for the kingdome of Scotland, and is sent home againe, his
 bishops also did promise to doo the like to the archbishop of Yorke, and
 to acknowledge themselues to be of his prouince and iurisdiction. By
 vertue also of this composition the said Robert saith, that Rex Angliae
 dabat honores, episcopatus, abbatias, & alias dignitates in Scotia, vel
 saltem eius consilio dabantur, that is, The king of England gaue honors,
 bishopriks, abbatships, and other dignities in Scotland, or at the
 leastwise they were not giuen without his aduise and counsell."

 At this time Alexander bishop of Rome (supposed to haue generall
 iurisdiction ecclesiasticall through christendome) established the whole
 cleargie of Scotland (according to the old lawes) vnder the iurisdiction
 of the archbishop of Yorke.

 In the yeare of our Lord 1185, in the moneth of August, at Cairleill,
 Rouland Talmant lord of Galwaie, did homage and fealtie to the said king
 Henrie with all that held of him.

 In the two and twentith yeare of the reigne of king Henrie the second,
 Gilbert sonne of Ferguse prince of Galwaie, did homage and fealtie to
 the said king Henrie, and left Dunecan his sonne in hostage for
 conseruation of his peace.

 Richard surnamed C[oe]ur de Lion, because of his stoutnesse, and sonne
 of this Henrie was next king of England, to whome the same William king
 of Scots did homage at Canturburie for the whole kingdome of Scotland.

 This king Richard was taken prisoner by the duke of Ostrich, for whose
 redemption the whole realme was taxed at great summes of monie vnto the
 which this William king of Scots (as a subject) was contributorie, and
 paied two thousand markes sterling.

 In the yeare of our Lord 1199, Iohn king of England sent to William king
 of Scots, to come and doo his homage, which William came to Lincolne in
 the moneth of December the same yeare, and did his homage vpon an hill
 in the presence of Hubert archbishop of Canturburie, and of all the
 people there assembled, and therevnto tooke his oth and was sworne vpon
 the crosse of the said Hubert: also he granted by his charter confirmed,
 that he should haue the mariage of Alexander his sonne, as his liegeman,
 alwaies to hold of the king of England: promising moreouer that he the
 said king William and his sonne Alexander, should keepe and hold faith
 and allegiance to Henrie sonne of the said king Iohn, as to their chiefe
 lord against all maner of men that might liue and die.

 Also whereas William king of Scots had put Iohn bishop of saint Andrew
 out of his bishoprike, pope Clement wrote to Henrie king of England,
 that he should mooue and induce the same William; and if need required
 by his roiall power and prerogatiue ouer that nation, to compell him to
 leaue his rancor against the said bishop, and suffer him to haue and
 occupie his said bishoprike againe.

 In the yeare of our Lord 1216, and fiue & twentith of the reigne of
 Henrie, sonne to king Iohn, the same Henrie and the queene were at Yorke
 at the feast of Christmasse, for the solemnization of a marriage made in
 the feast of saint Stephan the martyr the same yeare, betweene Alexander
 king of Scots, and Margaret the kings daughter, and there the said
 Alexander did homage to Henrie king of England for all the realme of
 Scotland.

 In buls of diuerse popes were admonitions giuen to the kings of Scots,
 as appeareth by that of Gregorie the fift and Clement his successor,
 that they should obserue and trulie keepe all such appointments, as had
 beene made betweene the kings of England and Scotland. And that the
 kings of Scotland should still hold the realme of Scotland of the kings
 of England, vpon paine of cursse and interdiction.

 After the death of Alexander king of Scots, Alexander his sonne, being
 nine yeares of age, was by the lawes of Edgar, in ward to king Henrie
 the third, & by the nobles of Scotland brought to Yorke, and there
 deliuered vnto him. During whose minoritie king Henrie gouerned
 Scotland, and to subdue a commotion in this realme, vsed the aid of fiue
 thousand Scotishmen. But king Henrie died during the nonage of this
 Alexander, whereby he receiued not his homage, which by reason and law
 was respited vntill his full age of one and twentie yeares.

 Edward the first after the conquest, sonne of this Henrie was next king
 of England; immediatlie after whose coronation, Alexander king of Scots,
 being then of full age, did homage to him for Scotland at Westminster,
 swearing (as all the rest did) after this maner.

 "I. D. N. king of Scots shall be true and faithfull vnto you lord E. by
 the grace of God king of England, the noble and superior lord of the
 kingdome of Scotland, and vnto you I make my fidelitie for the same
 kingdome, the which I hold and claime to hold of you. And I shall beare
 you my faith and fidelitie of life and lim, and worldlie honour against
 all men, faithfullie I shall knowlege and shall doo you seruice due vnto
 you of the kingdome of Scotland aforesaid, as God me so helpe and these
 holie euangelies."

 This Alexander king of Scots died, leauing one onelie daughter called
 Margaret for his heire, who before had maried Hanigo, sonne to Magnus
 king of Norwaie, which daughter also shortlie after died, leauing one
 onelie daughter hir heire, of the age of two yeares, whose custodie and
 mariage by the lawes of king Edgar, and Edward the confessor, belonged
 to Edward the first: whervpon the nobles of Scotland were commanded by
 our king Edward to send into Norwaie, to conueie this yoong queene into
 England to him, whome he intended to haue maried to his sonne Edward:
 and so to haue made a perfect vnion long wished for betweene both
 realmes. Herevpon their nobles at that time considering the same
 tranquillitie that manie of them haue since refused, stood not vpon
 shifts and delaies of minoritie nor contempt, but most gladlie
 consented, and therevpon sent two noble men of Scotland into Norwaie,
 for hir to be brought to this king Edward, but she died before their
 comming thither, and therefore they required nothing but to inioie the
 lawfull liberties that they had quietlie possessed in the last king
 Alexanders time.

 After the death of this Margaret, the Scots were destitute of anie heire
 to the crowne from this Alexander their last king, at which time this
 Edward descended from the bodie of Mawd daughter of Malcolme sometime
 king of Scots, being then in the greatest broile of his warres with
 France, minded not to take the possession of that kingdome in his owne
 right, but was contented to establish Balioll to be king thereof, the
 weake title betweene him, Bruse, & Hastings, being by the humble
 petition of all the realme of Scotland c[=o]mitted to the determination
 of king Edward, wherein by autentike writing they confessed the
 superioritie of the realme to remaine in king Edward, sealed with the
 seales of foure bishops, seuen earles, and twelue barons of Scotland,
 and which shortlie after was by the whole assent of the three estates of
 Scotland, in their solemne parlement confessed and enacted accordinglie,
 as most euidentlie dooth appeare.

 The Balioll in this wise made king of Scotland, did immediatlie make his
 homage and fealtie at Newcastell vpon saint Steeuens daie (as did
 likewise all the lords of Scotland, each one setting his hand to the
 composition in writing) to king Edward of England for the kingdome of
 Scotland: but shortlie after defrauding the benigne goodnesse of his
 superiour, he rebelled, and did verie much hurt in England. Herevpon
 king Edward inuaded Scotland, seized into his hands the greater part of
 the countrie, and tooke all the strengths thereof. Whervpon Balioll king
 of Scots came vnto him to Mauntrosse in Scotland with a white wand in
 his hand, and there resigned the crowne of Scotland, with all his right,
 title, and interest to the same, into the hands of king Edward, and
 thereof made his charter in writing, dated and sealed the fourth yeare
 of his reigne. All the nobles and gentlemen of Scotland also repaired to
 Berwike, and did homage and fealtie to king Edward, there becomming his
 subiects. For the better assurance of whose oths also, king Edward kept
 all the strengths and holdes of Scotland in his owne hands; and herevpon
 all their lawes, processes, all iudgements, gifts of assises and others,
 passed vnder the name and authoritie of king Edward. Leland touching the
 same rehearsall, writeth thereof in this maner.

 "In the yeare of our Lord 1295, the same Iohn king of Scots, contrarie
 to his faith and allegiance rebelled against king Edward, and came into
 England, and burnt and slue without all modestie and mercie. Wherevpon
 king Edward with a great host went to Newcastell vpon Tine, passed the
 water of Tweed, besieged Berwike, and got it. Also he wan the castell of
 Dunbar, and there were slaine at this brunt 15700 Scots. Then he
 proceeded further, and gat the castell of Rokesborow, and the castell of
 Edenborow, Striuelin and Gedworth, and his people harried all the land.
 In the meane season, the said king Iohn of Scots, considering that he
 was not of power to withstand king Edward, sent his letters and besought
 him of treatie and peace, which our prince benignlie granted, and sent
 to him againe that he should come to the towre of Brechin, and bring
 thither the great lords of Scotland with him. The king of England sent
 thither Antonie Becke bishop of Durham, with his roiall power, to
 conclude the said treatise. And there it was agreed that the said Iohn
 and all the Scots should vtterlie submit themselues to the kings will.
 And to the end the submission should be performed accordinglie, the king
 of Scots laid his sonne in hostage and pledge vnto him. There also he
 made his letters sealed with the common seale of Scotland, by the which
 he knowledging his simplenes and great offense doone to his lord king
 Edward of England, by his full power and free will yeelded vp all the
 land of Scotland, with all the people and homage of the same. Then our
 king went foorth to see the mounteins, and vnderstanding that all was in
 quiet and peace, he turned to the abbeie of Scone, which was of chanons
 [Sidenote: The Scots dreame that this was the stone whereon Jacob slept
 when he fled into Mesopotamia.]
 regular, where he tooke the stone called the Regall of Scotland, vpon
 which the kings of that nation were woont to sit, at the time of their
 coronations for a throne, & sent it to the abbeie of Westminster,
 commanding to make a chaire therof for the priests that should sing masse
 at the high altar: which chaire was made, and standeth yet there at this
 daie to be seene."

 In the yeare of our Lord 1296, the king held his parlement at Berwike:
 and there he tooke homage singularlie of diuerse of the lords & nobles
 of Scotland. And for a perpetuall memorie of the same, they made their
 letters patents sealed with their seales, and then the king of England
 made William Warreine earle of Surrie and Southsax lord Warden of
 Scotland, Hugh of Cressingham treasurer, and William Ormesbie iustice of
 Scotland, and foorthwith sent king Iohn to the Tower of London, and Iohn
 Comin, and the earle Badenauth, the earle of Bohan and other lords into
 England to diuerse places on this side of the Trent.

 And after that, in the yeare of our Lord 1297, at the feast of
 Christmas, the king called before him the said Iohn king of Scots,
 although he had committed him to ward: and said that he would burne or
 destroie their castels, townes, and lands, if he were not recompensed
 for his costs and damages susteined in the warres; but king Iohn and the
 other that were in ward, answered that they had nothing, sith their
 liues, their deaths, and goods were in his hands. The king vpon that
 answer mooued with pitie, granted them their liues; so that they would
 doo their homage, and make their oth solenmelie at the high altar (in
 the church of the abbeie of Westminster) vpon the eucharist, that they
 and euerie of them should hold and keepe true faith, obedience, and
 allegiance to the said king Edward and his heires kings of England for
 euer. And where the said king of Scots saw the kings banner of England
 displaied, he and all his power should draw therevnto. And that neither
 he or anie of his from thencefoorth should beare armes against the king
 of England or anie of his bloud. Finallie, the king rewarding with great
 gifts the said king Iohn and his lords, suffered them to depart. But
 they went into Scotland alwaie imagining (notwithstanding this their
 submission) how they might oppresse king Edward, and disturbe his
 realme. The Scots sent also to the king of France for succour and helpe,
 who sent them ships to Berwike furnished with men of armes, the king of
 England then being in Flanders.

 In the yeare of our Lord 1298, the king went into Scotland with a great
 host, and the Scots also assembled in great number, but the king fought
 with them at Fawkirke on S. Marie Magdalens daie, where were slaine
 threescore thousand Scots, & William Walleis that was their capteine
 fled, who being taken afterward, was hanged, drawen, & quartered at
 London, for his trespasses.

 After this the Scots rebelled againe, and all the lords of Scotland
 [Sidenote: This was doone upon the nine & twentith of Ianuarie, 1306.]
 chose Robert Bruse to be king, except onelie Iohn Commin earle of
 Carrike, who would not consent thereto bicause of his oth made to the
 king of England. Wherefore Robert Bruse slue him at Dumfrise, and then
 was crowned at Schone abbeie. Herevpon the king of England assembled a
 great hoast, and rode through all Scotland, discomfited Robert Bruse,
 slue eight thousand Scots, & tooke the most part of all the lords of
 Scotland, putting the temporall lords to deth bicause they were
 forsworne.

 Edward borne at Carnaruan sonne of this Edward, was next king of
 England, who from the beginning of his reigne enioied Scotland
 peaceablie, dooing in all things as is aboue said of king Edward his
 father, vntill toward the later end of his reigne, about which time this
 Robert Bruse conspired against him, and with the helpe of a few
 forsworne Scots, forswore himselfe king of Scots. Herevpon this Edward
 with Thomas earle of Lancaster and manie other lords made warre vpon
 him, about the feast of Marie Magdalene, the said Bruse and his
 partakers being alreadie accurssed by the pope for breaking the truce
 that he had established betwixt them. But being infortunate in his first
 warres against him, he suffered Edward the sonne of Balioll to proclame
 himselfe king of Scots; and neuerthelesse held foorth his warres against
 Bruse, before the ending of which he died, as I read.

 Edward borne at Windsore sonne of Edward the second was next king of
 England, at the age of fifteene yeares, in whose minoritie the Scots
 practised with Isabell mother to this Edward, and with Roger Mortimer
 earle of the March to haue their homages released: whose good will
 therein they obteined, so that for the same release they should paie to
 this king Edward thirtie thousand pounds starling, in three yeares next
 following, that is to saie, ten thousand pounds starling yeerelie. But
 bicause the nobilitie and commons of this realme would not by parlement
 consent vnto it, their king being within age, the same release proceeded
 not, albeit the Scots ceased not their practises with this queene and
 earle. But before those three yeares, in which their monie (if the
 bargaine had taken place) should haue beene paied, were expired, our
 king Edward inuaded Scotland, and ceassed not the warre, vntill Dauid
 the sonne of Robert le Bruse (then by their election king of Scotland)
 absolutelie submitted himselfe vnto him. But for that the said Dauid
 Bruse had before by practise of the queene and the earle of March,
 married Iane the sister of this king Edward: he mooued by naturall zeale
 to his sister, was contented to giue the realme of Scotland to this
 Dauid Bruse, and to the heires that should be begotten of the bodie of
 the said Iane (sauing the reuersion and meane homages to this king
 Edward and to his owne children) wherewith the same Dauid Bruse was
 right well contented, and therevpon immediatlie made his homage for all
 the realme of Scotland to him.

 Howbeit, shortlie after causelesse conceiuing cause of displeasure, this
 Dauid procured to dissolue this same estate tailee, and therevpon not
 onelie rebelled in Scotland, but also inuaded England, whilest king
 Edward was occupied about his wars in France. But this Dauid was not
 onelie expelled England in the end, but also thinking no place a
 sufficient defense to his vntruth, of his owne accord fled out of
 Scotland: whereby the countries of Annandale, Gallowaie, Mars, Teuidale,
 Twedale, and Ethrike were seized into the king of Englands hands, and
 new marches set betweene England and Scotland at Cockburnes path &
 Sowtrie hedge. Which when this Dauid went about to recouer againe, his
 power was discomfited, and himselfe by a few Englishmen taken & brought
 into England, where he remained prisoner eleuen yeares after his said
 apprehension.

 During this time, king Edward enioied Scotland peaceablie, and then at
 the contemplation and wearie suit of his sorowfull sister, wife of this
 Dauid, he was contented once againe to restore him to the kingdome of
 Scotland. Wherevpon it was concluded, that for this rebellion Dauid
 should paie to king Edward, the summe of one hundred thousand markes
 starling, and thereto destroie all his holdes and fortresses standing
 against the English borders, and further assure the crowne of Scotland
 to the children of this king Edward for lacke of heire of his owne
 bodie, all which things he did accordinglie. And for the better
 assurance of his obeisance also, he afterward deliuered into the hands
 of king Edward sundrie noble men of Scotland in this behalfe as his
 pledges. This is the effect of the historie of Dauid, touching his
 delings. Now let vs see what was doone by Edward Balioll, wherof our
 chronicles doo report, that in the yeere of our Lord 1326, Edward the
 third, king of England, was crowned at Westminster, and in the fift
 yeare of his reigne Edward Balioll right heire to the kingdome of
 Scotland came in, and claimed it as due to him. Sundrie lords and
 gentlemen also, which had title to diuerse lands there, either by
 themselues, or by their wiues, did the like. Wherevpon the said Balioll
 and they went into Scotland by sea, and landing at Kinghorne with 3000
 Englishmen, discomfited 10000 Scots, and slue 1200, and then went foorth
 to Dunfermeline, where the Scots assembled against them with 40000 men,
 and in the feast of saint Laurence, at a place called Gastmore (or
 otherwise Gladmore) were slaine fiue earls, thirteene barons, a hundred
 and three score knights, two thousand men of armes, and manie other; in
 all fortie thousand: and there were slaine on the English part but
 thirteene persons onelie, if the number be not corrupted.

 In the eight yeare of the reigne of king Edward, he assembled a great
 hoast, and came to Berwike vpon Tweed, and laid siege therto. To him
 also came Edward Balioll king of Scots, with a great power to strengthen
 & aid him against the Scots, who came out of Scotland in foure batels
 well armed & araied.

 Edward king of England, and Edward king of Scots, apparrelled their
 people either of them in foure battels: and vpon Halidon hill, beside
 Berwike, met these two hoasts, and there were discomfited of the Scots
 fiue and twentie thousand and seauen hundred, whereof were slaine eight
 earles, a thousand and three hundred knights and gentlemen. This
 victorie doone, the king returned to Berwike, & then the towne with the
 castell were yeelded vp vnto him. In the eight yeare of the reigne of
 king Edward of England, Edward Balioll king of Scots came to Newcastell
 vpon Tine, and did homage for all the realme of Scotland.

 In the yeare of our Lord 1346, Dauid Bruse by the prouocation of the
 king of France rebelled, and came into England with a great hoast vnto
 Neuils crosse: but the archbishop of Yorke, with diuerse temporall men,
 fought with him; and the said king of Scots was taken, and William earle
 of Duglas with Morrise earle of Strathorne were brought to London, and
 manie other lords slaine, which with Dauid did homage to Edward king of
 England.

 And in the thirtith yeare of the kings reigne, and the yeare of our Lord
 1355, the Scots woone the towne of Berwicke, but not the castell.
 Herevpon the king came thither with a great hoast, and anon the towne
 was yeelded vp without anie resistance.

 Edward Balioll, considering that God did so manie maruellous and
 gratious things for king Edward, at his owne will gaue vp the crowne and
 the realme of Scotland to king Edward of England at Rokesborough, by his
 letters patents. And anon after the king of England, in presence of all
 his lords spirituall and temporall, let crowne himselfe king there of
 the realme of Scotland, & ordeined all things to his intent, and so came
 ouer into England.

 Richard the sonne of Edward, called the Blacke prince, sonne of this
 king Edward, was next king of England, who for that the said Iane, the
 wife of the said king Dauid of Scotland was deceassed without issue, and
 being informed how the Scots deuised to their vttermost power to breake
 the limitation of this inheritance touching the crowne of Scotland, made
 foorthwith war against them, wherein he burnt Edenbrough, spoiled all
 their countrie, tooke all their holds, & held continuallie war against
 them vntill his death, which was Anno Dom. 1389.

 Henrie the fourth of that name was next king of England, he continued
 these warres begun against them by king Richard, and ceassed not vntill
 Robert king of Scots (the third of that name) resigned his crowne by
 appointment of this king Henrie, and deliuered his sonne Iames, being
 then of the age of nine yeares, into his hands to remaine at his
 custodie, wardship and disposition, as of his superiour lord, according
 to the old lawes of king Edward the confessor. All this was doone Anno
 Dom. 1404, which was within fiue yeares after the death of king Richard.
 This Henrie the fourth reigned in this estate ouer them foureteene
 yeares.

 Henrie the fift of that name, sonne to this king Henrie the fourth, was
 next king of England. He made warres against the French king, in all
 which this Iames then king of Scots attended vpon him, as vpon his
 superiour lord, with a conuenient number of Scots, notwithstanding their
 league with France. But this Henrie reigned but nine yeares, whereby the
 homage of this Iames their king (hauing not fullie accomplished the age
 of one & twentie yeares) was by reason and law respited. Finallie the
 said Iames with diuerse other lords attended vpon the corps of the said
 Henrie vnto Westminster, as to his dutie apperteined.

 Henrie the sixt, the sonne of this Henrie the fift, was next king of
 England, to whome the seigniorie of Scotland & custodie of this Iames by
 right, law, and reason descended, married the same Iames king of Scots
 to Iane daughter of Iohn earle of Summerset, at saint Marie ouer Ise in
 Southwarke, and tooke for the value of this mariage, the summe of one
 hundred thousand markes starling.

 This Iames king of Scots at his full age, did homage to the same king
 Henrie the sixt, for the kingdome of Scotland at Windsore, in the moneth
 of Ianuarie.

 Since which time, vntill the daies of king Henrie the seuenth,
 grandfather to our souereigne ladie that now is, albeit this realme hath
 beene molested with diuersitie of titles, in which vnmeet time neither
 law nor reason admit prescription to the prejudice of anie right: yet
 did king Edward the fourth next king of England, by preparation of war
 against the Scots in the latter end of his reigne, sufficientlie by all
 lawes induce to the continuance of his claime to the same superioritie
 ouer them.

 After whose death, vnto the beginning of the reigne of our souereigne
 lord king Henrie the eight, exceeded not the number of seauen and
 twentie yeares, about which time the impediment of our claime of the
 Scots part, chanced by the nonage of Iames their last king which so
 continued the space of one and twentie yeares. And like as his minoritie
 was by all law and reason an impediment to himselfe to make homage; so
 was the same by like reason an impediment to the king of this realme to
 demand anie, so that the whole time of intermission of our claime in the
 time of the said king Henrie the eight, is deduced vnto the number of
 thirteene yeares. And thus much for this matter.




 OF THE WALL SOMETIME BUILDED FOR A PARTITION BETWEENE ENGLAND AND THE
 PICTS AND SCOTS.

 CHAP. XXIII.


 Hauing hitherto discoursed vpon the title of the kings of England, vnto
 the Scotish kingdome: I haue now thought good to adde herevnto the
 description of two walles that were (in times past) limits vnto both the
 said regions, and therefore to be touched in this first booke, as
 generallie appertinent vnto the estate of the whole Iland; and no lesse
 famous than that which Anastasius Dicorus made afterward from the Euxine
 vnto the Thracian sea, conteining 420 furlongs in length, and twelue
 foot in bredth, & distant from Constantinople 280 furlongs, albeit that
 of Hadrian was made of turffe and timber. The author therefore of the
 [Sidenote: The first beginner of the Picts wall.]
 first wall was Hadrian the emperour, who (as AElius Spartianus saith)
 erected the same of foure score miles in length, twelue foot in heigth,
 and eight in bredth, to diuide the barbarous Britons from the more
 ciuill sort, which then were generallie called by the name of Romans
 ouer all.

 [Sidenote: The finisher of the wall.]
 After his time Seuerus the emperour comming againe into this Ile (where
 he had serued before in repression of the tumults here begun, after the
 death of Lucius) amongst other things he made another wall (but of
 stone) betweene eightie and a hundred miles from the first, & of thirtie
 two miles in length, reaching on both sides also to the sea, of whome
 the Britons called it S. Murseueri, or Gwall Seueri, that is, The wall
 of Seuerus, or Seuerus dale, which later indureth vntill these daies in
 fresh memorie, by reason of the ruines & square stones there oft found,
 whose inscriptions declare the authors of that worke. It is worthie the
 noting also, how that in this voiage he lost 50000 men in the Scotish
 side, by one occasion and other, which hinderance so incensed him, that
 he determined vtterlie to extinguish their memorie from vnder heauen,
 and had so doone in deed, if his life had indured but vntill another
 [Sidenote: The wall goeth not streict by a line,
 but in and out in manie places.]
 yeare. Sextus Aurelius writing of Seuerus, addeth, how that the wall
 made by this prince conteined two and thirtie miles, whereby the bredth
 of this Iland there, and length of the wall conteineth onelie so manie
 miles, as may be gathered by his words. But cheeflie for the length of
 the wall, Spartianus who touching it among other things saith of Seuerus
 as followeth: "Britanniam (quod maximum eius imperij decus est) muro per
 transuersam insulam ducto, vtrinq; ad finem oceani muniuit," that is, He
 fortified Britaine (which is one of the cheefe acts recorded of his
 time) with a wall made ouerthwart the Ile, that reached on both sides
 euen to the verie Ocean.

 [Sidenote: The stuffe of the wall.]
 That this wall was of stone also, the ruines therof (which haue
 ministred much matter to such as dwell neere therevnto in their
 buildings) is triall sufficient. Heereby in like sort it commeth to
 passe, that where the soile about it is least inhabited, there is most
 mention of the said wall, which was wrought of squared stone, as vntill
 this daie maie euidentlie be confirmed. Howbeit, these two walles were
 not the onelie partitions betweene these two kingdoms, sith Iulius
 [Sidenote: Two other wals.]
 Capitolinus in vita Antonini Pij dooth write of another that Lollius
 Vrbicus made beyond the same, of turffe, in the time of the said prince,
 who (for his victories in Britaine) was also called Britannicus, which
 neuerthelesse was often throwne downe by the Scots, and eftsoones
 repared againe, vntill it was giuen ouer and relinquished altogither. It
 runneth (as I take it) also within the wall about an arrow shot from
 that of stone: but how farre it went, as yet I cannot find. This onlie
 remaineth certeine, that the walles made by Hadrian & Seuerus, were
 [Sidenote: A rampire.]
 ditched with notable ditches and rampires made in such wise, that the
 Scotish aduersarie had much a doo to enter and scale the same in his
 assaults. And yet for all this, I read that the Scots oftentimes pulled
 downe great parcels of the same, to make their accesse more easie into
 the south parts: but as it was eftsoons repared againe, so the last time
 of all it was amended by the Romane soldiors, which came ouer verie
 little before the time of Vortiger, at which season the land was in
 maner left void of soldiors and munition. Betwixt Thirlewall and the
 north Tine, are also in the waste grounds, manie parcels of that wall of
 Seuerus yet standing, whereof the common people doo babble manie things.

 [Sidenote: The course of the wall from west to east.]
 Beginning therefore with the course thereof, from the west sea, I find
 that it runneth from Bolnesse to Burgh, about foure miles, and likewise
 from thence within halfe a mile of Carleill, and lesse on the north
 side, and beneath the confluence of the Peder and the Eden. From hence
 it goeth to Terrebie, a village about a mile from Caerleill, then
 through the baronie of Linstocke, and Gillesland, on the north side of
 the riuer Irding or Arding, and a quarter of a mile from the abbeie of
 Leuercost. Thence three miles aboue Leuercost, and aboue the confluence
 of Arding, and the Pultrose becke (which diuideth Gillesland in
 Cumberland, from south Tindale in Northumberland) it goeth to Thirlwall
 castell, then to the wall towne, next of all ouer the riuer to Swensheld,
 Carraw (peraduenture Cairuoren tower) to Walwijc, and so ouer south
 Tine, to Cockelie tower, Portgate, Halton sheles, Winchester, Rutchester,
 Heddon, Walhottle, Denton, and to Newcastell, where it is thought that
 saint Nicholas church standeth on the same. Howbeit Leland saith, that
 it goeth within a mile of Newcastell, and then crooketh vp toward
 Tinmouth vnto Wallesend, three miles from the mouth of the said riuer,
 so called bicause the aforesaid wall did end at the same place. And thus
 much I read of the Pictish wall. As for the Romane coine that is often
 found in the course thereof, the curious bricks about the same neere
 vnto Caerleill, beside the excellent cornellines and other costlie
 stones alreadie intailed for seales oftentimes taken vp in those
 quarters, I passe them ouer as not incident to my purpose.

 In like maner I would gladlie also haue set downe the course of Offaes
 ditch, which was march betweene the Mercian dominions, and the Welshmen
 in his time: but for so much as the tractation thereof is not to be
 referred to this place, bicause it is not a thing generall to the whole
 Iland, I omit to speake of that also. Yet thus much will I note here, as
 well by the report of one (who saith how he did tread it out) that he
 followed it from the Dee to Kirnaburgh hill through Treuelach forrest,
 by est of Crekith Cauchhill, Montgomerie castell, the New castell and
 Discoid, and hauing brought it hitherto, either lost it, or sought after
 it no further: as by the testimonie of another, who writing thereof,
 saith, that it stretched from the south side by Bristow, along vnder the
 mounteins of Wales northwards, ouer the riuer of Sauerne, and to the
 verie mouth also of the Dee, where it falleth into the sea. And so much
 of such things as concerne the generall estate of the whole Iland, which
 labour herein I could verie well haue spared, and would, if Quintus had
 performed the request of Cicero his brother, who promised to send him
 ouer a sound aduertisement of the condition of Britaine in those daies:
 as appeareth in the second booke of his familiar epistles, where he
 saith; "Modo mihi date Britanniam, quam pingam coloribus tuis penicillo
 meo, &c." But sithence that was not performed, and the treatise of
 Demetrius and other of the same argument are perished, which were of
 some value, let this trifle (I beseech you) not be reiected, till some
 other man of better skill shall haue drawne a more absolute peece of
 workemanship, wherevnto my vnskilfulnesse (I hope) shall prooue no
 hinderance.




 OF THE MARUELS OF ENGLAND.

 CHAP. XXIV.


 Such as haue written of the woonders of our countrie in old time, haue
 spoken (no doubt) of manie things, which deserue no credit at all: and
 therefore in seeking thankes of their posteritie by their trauell in
 this behalfe; they haue reaped the reward of iust reproch, and in steed
 of fame purchased vnto themselues nought else but meere discredit in
 their better and more learned treatises. The like commonlie happeneth
 also to such, as in respect of lucre doo publish vnprofitable and
 pernicious volumes, wherby they doo consume their times in vaine, and in
 manifold wise become preiudiciall vnto their common wealths. For my part
 I will not touch anie man herein particularlie, no not our Demetrius, of
 whom Plutarch speaketh in his oracles (if those bookes were written by
 him, for some thinke that Plutarch neuer wrote them, although Eusebius
 lib. 4. cap. 8. dooth acknowledge them to be his) which Demetrius left
 sundrie treatises behind him, conteining woonderfull things collected of
 our Iland. But sith that in my time they are found to be false, it
 should be far vnmeet to remember them anie more: for who is he which
 will beleeue, that infernall spirits can die and giue vp their ghosts
 like mortall men? though Saxo seeme to consent vnto him in this behalfe.
 In speaking also of the out Iles, he saith thus: Beyond Britaine are
 manie desolate Ilands, whereof some are dedicated to the Gods, some to
 the noble Heroes. I sailed (saith he) by the helpe of the king vnto one
 that laie neere hand, onelie to see and view the same, in which I found
 few inhabitants, and yet such as were there, were reputed and taken for
 men of great pietie and holinesse. During the time also that I remained
 in the same, it was vexed with great storme and tempest, which caused me
 not a little to doubt of my safe returne. In the end, demanding of the
 inhabitants what the cause should be of this so great and sudden
 mutation of the aire? they answered, that either some of the Gods, or at
 the least of the Heroes were latelie deceased: for as a candle (said
 they) hurteth none whilest it burneth, but being slenderlie put out
 annoieth manie with the filthie sauour: so these Gods, whilest they
 liued, were either not hurtfull, or verie beneficiall to mankind; but
 being once deceassed, they so mooue the heauens and aire, that much
 mischeefe dooth insue eftsoones vpon the same.

 Being also inquisitiue of the state of other Iles not farre off, they
 told him further, how there was one hard by, wherein Saturne being
 ouertaken with a dead sleepe, was watched by Briareus as he laie, which
 Saturne also had manie spirits attending vpon him in sundrie functions
 and offices. By which reports it is easie to conceiue, with what vaine
 stuffe that volume of Demetrius is interlaced. But of such writers as we
 haue too too manie, so among the said rable Geruase of Tilberie is not
 the least famous, a man as it were euen sold to vtter matters of more
 admiration than credit to the world. For what a tale telleth he in his
 De otio imperiali, of Wandleburie hilles, that lie within sight & by
 south of Cambridge (where the Vandals incamped sometime, when they
 entered into this Iland) and of a spirit that would of custome in a
 moone shine night (if he were chalenged and called therevnto) run at
 tilt and turneie in complet armor with anie knight or gentleman
 whomsoeuer, in that place: and how one Osbert of Barnewell, hearing the
 report thereof, armed himselfe, and being well mounted, rode thither
 alone with one esquier, and called for him, who foorthwith appeared in
 rich armour, and answered his chalenge, so that running togither verie
 fiercelie, they met with such rigor, that the answerer was ouerthrowne
 and borne downe to the ground. After this they bickered on foot so long,
 till Osbert ouercame and draue him to flight, who departed, leauing his
 horsse behind him, which was of huge stature, blacke (as he saith) of
 colour, with his furniture of the same hue, and wherevpon he seized,
 giuing him vnto his page, who caried him home, and there kept him till
 it was neere daie, during which space he was seene of manie. But when
 the daie light began to shew it selfe somewhat cleere, the beast stamped
 and snorted, and foorthwith breaking his raine, he ran awaie, and was no
 more heard of to his knowledge in that countrie. In the meane season
 Osbert being verie faint, and waxing wearie (for he was sore wounded in
 the thigh, which either he knew not of, or at the leastwise dissembled
 to know it) caused his leg-harnesse or steele bootes to be pulled off,
 which his freends saw to be full of bloud spilled in the voiage. But let
 who so list beleeue it, sith it is either a fable deuised, or some
 diuelish illusion, if anie such thing were doone. And on mine owne
 behalfe, hauing (I hope) the feare of God before my eies, I purpose here
 to set downe no more than either I know my selfe to be true, or am
 crediblie informed to be so, by such godly men, as to whom nothing is
 more deare than to speake the truth, and not anie thing more odious than
 to discredit themselues by lieng. In writing therefore of the woonders
 [Sidenote: Foure woonders of England.]
 of England, I find that there are foure notable things, which for their
 rarenesse amongst the common sort, are taken for the foure miracles and
 woonders of the land.

 The first of these is a vehement and strong wind, which issueth out of
 the hilles called the Peke, so violent and strong, that at certeine
 times if a man doo cast his cote or cloake into the caue from whence it
 issueth, it driueth the same backe againe, hoising it aloft into the
 open aire with great force and vehemencie. Of this also Giraldus
 speaketh.

 The second is the miraculous standing or rather hanging of certeine
 stones vpon the plaine of Salisburie, whereof the place is called
 Stonehenge. And to saie the truth, they may well be woondered at, not
 onelie for the manner of position, whereby they become verie difficult
 to be numbred, but also for their greatnesse & strange maner of lieng of
 some of them one vpon another, which seemeth to be with so tickle hold,
 that few men go vnder them without feare of their present ruine. How and
 when these stones were brought thither, as yet I can not read; howbeit
 it is most likelie, that they were raised there by the Britons, after
 the slaughter of their nobilitie at the deadlie banket, which Hengist
 and his Saxons prouided for them, where they were also buried, and
 Vortigerne their king apprehended and led awaie as captiue. I haue heard
 that the like are to be seene in Ireland; but how true it is as yet I
 can not learne. The report goeth also, that these were broght from
 thence, but by what ship on the sea, and cariage by land, I thinke few
 men can safelie imagine.

 The third is an ample and large hole vnder the ground, which some call
 Carcer Acoli, but in English Chedderhole, whereinto manie men haue
 entred & walked verie farre. Howbeit, as the passage is large and
 nothing noisome: so diuerse that haue aduentured to go into the same,
 could neuer as yet find the end of that waie, neither see anie other
 thing than pretie riuerets and streames, which they often crossed as
 they went from place to place. This Chedderhole or Chedder rocke is in
 Summersetshire, and thence the said waters run till they meet with the
 second Ax that riseth in Owkie hole.

 The fourth is no lesse notable than anie of the other. For westward vpon
 certeine hilles a man shall see the clouds gather togither in faire
 weather vnto a certeine thicknesse, and by and by to spread themselues
 abroad and water their fields about them, as it were vpon the sudden.
 The causes of which dispersion, as they are utterlie vnknowne: so manie
 men coniecture great store of water to be in those hilles, & verie neere
 at hand, if it were needfull to be sought for.

 Besides these foure maruelles, there is a little rockie Ile in Aber
 Barrie (a riueret that falleth into the Sauerne sea) called Barrie,
 which hath a rift or clift next the first shore; wherevnto if a man doo
 laie his eare, he shall heare such noises as are commonlie made in
 smiths forges, to wit, clinking of iron barres, beating with hammers,
 blowing of bellowses, and such like: whereof the superstitious sort doo
 gather manie toies, as the gentiles did in old time of their lame god
 Vulcans pot. The riuer that runneth by Chester changeth hir chanell
 euerie moneth: the cause whereof as yet I can not learne; neither dooth
 it swell by force of anie land-floud, but by some vehement wind it oft
 ouer-runneth hir banks. In Snowdonie are two lakes, whereof one beareth
 a moouable Iland, which is carried to and fro as the wind bloweth. The
 other hath three kinds of fishes in it, as eeles, trowts, and perches:
 but herein resteth the woonder, that all those haue but one eie a peece
 onelie, and the same situate in the right side of their heads. And this
 I find to be confirmed also by authors: There is a well in the forrest
 of Gnaresborow, whereof the said forrest dooth take the name; which
 water, beside that it is cold as Stix, in a certeine period of time
 knowne, conuerteth wood, flesh, leaues of trees, and mosse into hard
 stone, without alteration or changing of shape. The like also is seene
 there in frogs, wormes, and such like liuing creatures as fall into the
 same, and find no readie issue. Of this spring also Leland writeth thus;
 A little aboue March (but at the further banke of Nide riuer as I came)
 I saw a well of wonderfull nature called Dropping well, because the
 water thereof distilleth out of great rockes hard by into it
 continuallie, which is so cold, and thereto of such nature, that what
 thing soeuer falleth out of those rocks into this pit, or groweth neere
 thereto, or be cast into it by mans hand, it turneth into stone. It may
 be (saith he) that some sand or other fine ground issueth out with this
 water from these hard rocks, which cleauing vnto those things, giueth
 them in time the forme of stones &c. Neere vnto the place where Winburne
 monasterie sometimes stood, also not farre from Bath there is a faire
 wood, whereof if you take anie peece, and pitch it into the ground
 thereabouts, or throw it into the water, within twelue moneths it will
 turne into hard stone. In part of the hilles east southeast of
 Alderleie, a mile from Kingswood, are stones dailie found, perfectlie
 fashioned like cockles and mightie oisters, which some dreame haue lien
 there euer since the floud. In the clifts betweene the Blacke head and
 Trewardeth baie in Cornwall, is a certeine caue, where things appeare
 like images guilded, on the sides of the same, which I take to be
 nothing but the shining of the bright ore of coppar and other mettals
 readie at hand to be found there, if anie diligence were vsed. Howbeit,
 because it is much maruelled at as a rare thing, I doo not thinke it to
 be vnmeet to be placed amongst our woonders. Maister Guise had of late,
 and still hath (for aught that I know) a manor in Glocestershire, where
 certeine okes doo grow, whose rootes are verie hard stone. And beside
 this, the ground is so fertile there (as they saie) that if a man hew a
 stake of anie wood, and pitch it into the earth, it will grow and take
 rooting beyond all expectation. Siluecester towne also is said to
 conteine fourescore acres of land within the walles, whereof some is
 corne-ground (as Leland saith) and the graine which is growing therein
 dooth come to verie good perfection till it be readie to be cut downe:
 but euen then, or about that time it vanisheth away & becommeth
 altogither vnprofitable. Is it any woonder (thinke you) to tell of
 sundrie caues neere to Browham, on the west side of the riuer Aimote,
 wherein are halles, chambers, and all offices of houshold cut out of the
 hard rocke? If it be, then may we increase the number of maruels verie
 much by a rehearsall of other also. For we haue manie of the like, as
 one neere saint Assaphs vpon the banke of Elwie, and about the head of
 Vendrath Vehan in Wales, whereinto men haue often entred and walked, and
 yet found nothing but large roomes, and sandie ground vnder their feet,
 and other else-where. But sith these things are not strange, I let them
 alone, and go forward with the rest.

 In the parish of Landsarnam in Wales, and in the side of a stonie hill,
 is a place wherein are foure and twentie seats hewen out of the hard
 rockes; but who did cut them, and to what end, as yet it is not learned.
 As for the huge stone that lieth at Pember in Guitherie parish, and of
 the notable carcasse that is affirmed to lie vnder the same, there is no
 cause to touch it here: yet were it well doone to haue it remoued,
 though it were but onlie to see what it is, which the people haue in so
 great estimation & reuerence. There is also a poole in Logh Taw, among
 the blacke mounteins in Brecknockshire, where (as is said) is the head
 of Taw that commeth to Swanseie, which hath such a propertie, that it
 will breed no fish at all, & if anie be cast into it, they die without
 recouerie: but this peraduenture may grow throgh the accidentall
 corruption of the water, rather than the naturall force of the element
 it selfe. There is also a lin in Wales, which in the one side beareth
 trowts so red as samons, and in the other, which is the westerlie side,
 verie white and delicate. I heare also of two welles not far from
 Landien, which stand verie neere togither, and yet are of such
 diuersitie of nature, that the one beareth sope, and is a maruellous
 fine water; the other altogither of contrarie qualities. Which is not a
 litle to be mused at, considering (I saie) that they participate of one
 soile, and rise so nigh one to another. I haue notice giuen me moreouer
 of a stone not farre from saint Dauids, which is verie great, as a bed,
 or such like thing: and being raised vp, a man may stirre it with his
 thumbe; but not with his shoulder or force of his whole bodie.

 There is a well not farre from stonie Stratford, which conuerteth manie
 things into stone; and an other in Wales, which is said to double or
 triple the force of anie edge toole that is quenched in the same. In
 Tegenia, a parcell of Wales, there is a noble well (I meane in the
 parish of Kilken) which is of maruellous nature, and much like to
 another well at Seuill in Spaine: for although it be six miles from the
 sea, it ebbeth and floweth twise in one daie; alwaies ebbing when the
 sea dooth vse to flow, and in flowing likewise when the sea dooth vse to
 ebbe; wherof some doo fable, that this well is ladie and mistresse of
 the ocean. Not farre from thence also is a medicinable spring called
 Schinant of old time, but now Wenefrides well, in the edges whereof
 dooth breed a verie odoriferous and delectable mosse, wherewith the head
 of the smeller is maruellouslie refreshed. Other welles and
 water-courses we haue likewise, which at some times burst out into huge
 streames, though at other seasons they run but verie softlie, whereby
 the people gather some alteration of estate to be at hand. And such a
 one there is at Henleie, & an other at Croidon; & such a one also in the
 golden dale beside Anderne in Picardie, whereof the common sort imagine
 manie things. Some of the greater sort also giue ouer to run at all in
 such times, wherof they conceiue the like opinion. And of the same
 nature, though of no great quantitie, is a pit or well at Langleie parke
 in Kent, whereof (by good hap) it was my lucke to read a notable
 historie in an ancient chronicle that I saw of late. What the foolish
 people dreame of the hell Kettles, it is not worthie the rehearsall; yet
 to the end the lewd opinion conceiued of them may grow into contempt, I
 will saie thus much also of those pits. There are certeine pits, or
 rather three little pooles, a mile from Darlington, and a quarter of a
 mile distant from the These banks which the people call the Kettles of
 hell, or the diuels Kettles, as if he should seeth soules of sinfull men
 and women in them. They adde also, that the spirits haue oft beene heard
 to crie and yell about them, with other like talke sauoring altogether
 of pagan infidelitie. The truth is, and of this opinion also was Cutbert
 Tunstall late bishop of Durham, a man (notwithstanding the basenesse of
 his birth, being begotten by one Tunstall vpon a daughter of the house
 of the Commers, as Leland saith) of great learning and iudgement, that
 the cole-mines in those places are kindled, or if there be no coles,
 there may a mine of some other vnctuous matter be set on fire, which
 being here and there consumed, the earth falleth in, and so dooth leaue
 a pit. Indeed the water is now and then warme (as they saie) and beside
 that it is not cleere: the people suppose them to be an hundred fadam
 deepe. The biggest of them also hath an issue into the These, as
 experience hath confirmed. For doctor Bellowes alias Belzis made report,
 how a ducke marked after the fashion of the duckes of the bishoprike of
 Durham, was put into the same betwixt Darlington and These banke, and
 afterward seene at a bridge not farre from master Clereuax house. If it
 were woorth the noting, I would also make relation of manie wooden
 crosses found verie often about Halidon, whereof the old inhabitants
 conceiued an opinion that they were fallen from heauen; whereas in
 truth, they were made and borne by king Oswald; and his men in the
 battell wherein they preuailed sometimes against the British infidels,
 vpon a superstitious imagination, that those crosses should be their
 defense and shield against their aduersaries. Beda calleth the place
 where the said field was fought, Heauen field; it lieth not far from the
 Pictish wall, and the famous monasterie of Hagulstad. But more of this
 elsewhere. Neither will I speak of the little hillets seene in manie
 places of our Ile, whereof though the vnskilfull people babble manie
 things: yet are they nothing else but Tumuli or graues of former times,
 as appeareth by such tooms & carcasses as be daily found in the same,
 when they be digged downe. The like fond imagination haue they of a kind
 of lunarie, which is to be found in manie places, although not so well
 knowen by the forme vnto them, as by the effect thereof, because it now
 and then openeth the lockes hanging on the horses feet as hit vpon it
 where it groweth in their feeding. Roger Bacon our countrieman noteth it
 to grow plentiouslie in Tuthill fields about London. I haue heard of it
 to be within compasse of the parish where I dwell, and doo take it for
 none other than the Sfera Cauallo, whereof Mathiolus and the herbarists
 doo write, albeit that it hath not beene my lucke at anie time to behold
 it. Plinie calleth it Aethiopis: and Aelianus, Oppianus, Kyramis, and
 Trebius haue written manie superstitious things thereof, but especiallie
 our Chymists, who make it of farre more vertue than our smiths doo their
 ferne seed, whereof they babble manie woonders, and prate of such
 effects as may well be performed indeed when the ferne beareth seed,
 which is commonly Ad calendas Graecas, for before it will not be found.
 But to proceed. There is a well in Darbieshire called Tideswell (so
 named of the word tide, or to ebbe and flow) whose water often seemeth
 to rise and fall, as the sea which is fortie miles from it dooth
 vsuallie accustome to ebbe and flow. And hereof an opinion is growen
 that it keepeth an ordinarie course as the sea dooth. Howbeit, sith
 diuerse are knowne to haue watched the same, it may be that at sometimes
 it riseth, but not continuallie; and that it so dooth I am fullie
 persuaded to beleeue. But euen inough of the woonders of our countrie,
 least I doo seeme by talking longer of them, woonderouslie to ouershoot
 my selfe, and forget how much dooth rest behind of the description of my
 countrie. As for those that are to be touched of Scotland, the
 description of that part shall in some part remember them.

 OF THE ANCIENT AND PRESENT ESTATE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.

 CHAP. I.


 There are now two prouinces onelie in England, of which the first and
 greatest is subiect to the see of Canturburie, comprehending a parte of
 Lhoegres, whole Cambria, & also Ireland, which in time past were
 seuerall, & brought into one by the archbishop of the said see &
 assistance of the pope; who in respect of meed, did yeeld vnto the
 ambitious desires of sundrie archbishops of Canturburie, as I haue
 elsewhere declared. The second prouince is vnder the see of Yorke, and
 of these; either hath hir archbishop resident commonlie within hir owne
 limits, who hath not onelie the cheefe dealing in matters apperteining
 to the hierarchie and iurisdiction of the church; but also great
 authoritie in ciuill affaires touching the gouernement of the common
 wealth: so far foorth as their commissions and seuerall circuits doo
 extend.

 In old time there were three archbishops, and so manie prouinces in
 this Ile; of which one kept at London, another at Yorke, and the third
 at Caerlheon vpon Uske. But as that of London was translated to
 Canturburie by Augustine, and that of Yorke remaineth (notwithstanding
 that the greatest part of his iurisdiction is now bereft him and giuen
 to the Scotish archbishop) so that of Caerlheon is vtterlie
 extinguished, and the gouernement of the countrie vnited to that of
 Canturburie in spirituall cases: after it was once before remoued to S.
 Dauids in Wales by Dauid successor to Dubritius, and vncle to king
 Arthur, in the 519 of Grace, to the end that he and his clearkes might
 be further off from the crueltie of the Saxons, where it remained till
 the time of the Bastard, and for a season after, before it was annexed
 vnto the see of Canturburie.

 The archbishop of Canturburie is commonlie called primat of all
 England; and in the coronations of the kings of this land, and all
 other times, wherein it shall please the prince to weare and put on
 his crowne, his office is to set it vpon their heads. They beare also
 the name of their high chapleins continuallie, although not a few of
 them haue presumed (in time past) to be their equals, and void of
 subiection vnto them. That this is true, it may easilie appeere by
 their owne acts yet kept in record; beside their epistles & answers
 written or in print; wherein they haue sought not onelie to match but
 also to mate them with great rigor and more than open tyrannie. Our
 aduersaries will peraduenture denie this absolutelie, as they doo
 manie other things apparant, though not without shamelesse impudencie,
 or at the leastwise defend it as iust and not swaruing from common
 equitie; bicause they imagine euerie archbishop to be the kings equall
 in his owne prouince. But how well their dooing herein agreeth with
 the saieng of Peter, & examples of the primitiue church, it may
 easilie appeere. Some examples also of their demeanor (I meane in the
 time of poperie) I will not let to remember, least they should saie I
 speake of malice, and without all ground of likelihood.

 Of their practises with meane persons I speake not, neither will I
 begin at Dunstane the author of all their pride and presumption here
 in England. But for somuch as the dealing of Robert the Norman against
 earle Goodwine is a rare historie, and deserueth to be remembred, I
 will touch it in this place; protesting to deale withall in more
 faithfull maner than it hath heretofore beene deliuered vnto vs by the
 Norman writers, or French English, who (of set purpose) haue so
 defaced earle Goodwine, that were it not for the testimonie of one or
 two meere Englishmen liuing in those daies, it should be impossible
 for me (or anie other) at this present to declare the truth of that
 matter according to hir circumstances. Marke therefore what I saie.
 For the truth is, that such Normans as came in with Emma in the time
 of Ethelred, and Canutus, and the Confessor, did fall by sundrie means
 into such fauor with those princes, that the gentlemen did grow to
 beare great rule in the court, and their clearkes to be possessors of
 the best benefices in the land. Hervpon therefore one Robert, a iolie
 ambitious preest, gat first to be bishop of London, and after the
 death of Eadsius, to be archbishop of Canturburie by the gift of king
 Edward; leauing his former see to William his countrieman. Ulfo also a
 Norman was preferred to Lincolne, and other to other places, as the
 king did thinke conuenient.

 These Norman clerkes, and their freends, being thus exalted, it was
 not long yer they began to mocke, abuse, and despise the English: and
 so much the more, as they dailie saw themselues to increase in fauour
 with king Edward, who also called diuerse of them to be of his secret
 councell, which did not a litle incense the harts of the English
 against them. A fraie also was made at Douer, betweene the seruants of
 earle Goodwine and the French, whose maisters came ouer to see and
 salute the king: whereof I haue spoken in my Chronologie, which so
 inflamed the minds of the French cleargie and courtiers against the
 English nobilitie, that each part sought for opportunitie of reuenge,
 which yer long tooke hold betweene them. For the said Robert, being
 called to be archbishop of Canturburie, was no sooner in possession of
 his see, than he began to quarrell with earle Goodwine (the kings
 father in law by the mariage of his daughter) who also was readie to
 acquit his demeanor with like malice; and so the mischiefe begun.
 Herevpon therefore the archbishop charged the earle with the murther
 of Alfred the kings brother, whom not he but Harald the sonne of
 Canutus and the Danes had cruellie made awaie. For Alfred and his
 brother comming into the land with fiue and twentie saile, vpon the
 death of Canutus, and being landed; the Normans that arriued with them
 giuing out how they came to recouer their right, to wit, the crowne of
 England; & therevnto the vnskilfull yoong gentlemen, shewing
 themselues to like of the rumour that was spred in this behalfe, the
 report of their demeanor was quicklie brought to Harald, who caused a
 companie foorthwith of Danes priuilie to laie wait for them, as they
 roade toward Gilford, where Alfred was slaine, and whence Edward with
 much difficultie escaped to his ships, and so returned into Normandie.

 But to proceed. This affirmation of the archbishop being greatlie
 soothed out with his craftie vtterance (for he was lerned) confirmed
 by his French freends, (for they had all conspired against the erle)
 and therevnto the king being desirous to reuenge the death of his
 brother, bred such a grudge in his mind against Goodwine, that he
 banished him and his sons cleane out of the land. He sent also his
 wife the erles daughter prisoner to Wilton, with one onelie maiden
 attending vpon hir, where she laie almost a yeare before she was
 released. In the meane season, the rest of the peeres, as Siward earle
 of Northumberland surnamed Digara or Fortis, Leofrijc earle of
 Chester, and other went to the king, before the departure of Goodwine,
 indeuouring to persuade him vnto the reuocation of his sentence; and
 desiring that his cause might be heard and discussed by order of law.
 But the king incensed by the archbishop and his Normans would not
 heare on that side, saieng plainelie, and swearing by saint Iohn the
 euangelist (for that was his common oth) that earle Goodwine should
 not haue his peace till he restored his brother Alfred aliue againe
 vnto his presence. With which answer the peeres departed in choler
 from the court, and Goodwine toward the coast.

 Comming also vnto the shore and readie to take shipping, he kneeled
 downe in presence of his conduct (to wit at Bosenham in the moneth of
 September, from whence he intended to saile into Flanders vnto
 Baldwine the earle) and there praied openlie before them all, that if
 euer he attempted anie thing against the kings person of England, or
 his roiall estate, that he might neuer come safe vnto his cousine, nor
 see his countrie any more, but perish in this voiage. And herewith he
 went aboord the ship that was prouided for him, and so from the coast
 into the open sea. But see what followed. He was not yet gone a mile
 waie from the land, before he saw the shore full of armed souldiers,
 sent after by the archbishop and his freends to kill him yer he should
 depart and go out of the countrie: which yet more incensed the harts
 of the English against them.

 Being come also to Flanders, he caused the earle, the French king, and
 other of his freends, among whome also the emperour was one, to write
 vnto the king in his behalfe; but all in vaine: for nothing could be
 obteined from him, of which the Normans had no liking, wherevpon the
 earle and his sonnes changed their minds, obteined aid, and inuaded
 the land in sundry places. Finallie ioining their powers they came by
 the Thames into Southwarke neere London where they lodged, and looked
 for the king to incounter with them in the field. The king seeing what
 was doone, commanded the Londoners not to aid nor vittell them. But
 the citizens made answer, how the quarrell of Goodwine was the cause
 of the whole realme, which he had in maner giuen ouer vnto the spoile
 of the French: and therevpon they not onelie vittelled them
 aboundantlie, but also receiued the earle and his chiefe freends into
 the citie, where they lodged them at their ease, till the kings power
 was readie to ioine with them in battell.

 Great resort also was made vnto them from all places of the realme, so
 that the earles armie was woonderfullie increased, and the daie and
 place chosen wherein the battell should be fought. But when the armies
 met, the kings side began some to flee to the earle, other to laie
 downe their weapons, and not a few to run awaie out right; the rest
 telling him plainelie that they would neuer fight against their owne
 countriemen, to mainteine Frenchmens quarrels. The Normans also seeing
 the sequele, fled awaie so fast as they might gallop, leauing the king
 in the field to shift for himselfe (as he best might) whilest they did
 saue themselues elsewhere.

 In the meane season the earles power would haue set vpon the king,
 either to his slaughter, or apprehension; but he staied them, saieng
 after this maner: The king is my sonne (as you all know) and it is not
 for a father to deale so hardlie with his child, neither a subiect
 with his souereigne; it is not he that hath hurt or doone me this
 iniurie, but the proud Normans that are about him: wherfore to gaine a
 kingdome, I will doo him no violence. And therewithall casting aside
 his battell ax he ran to the king, that stood altogither amazed, and
 falling at his feet he craued his peace, accused the archbishop,
 required that his cause might be heard in open assemblie of his
 peeres; and finallie determined as truth and equitie should deserue.

 The king (after he had paused a pretie while) seeing his old father in
 law to lie groueling at his feet, and conceiuing with himselfe that
 his sute was not vnreasonable; seeing also his children, and the rest
 of the greatest barons of the land to kneele before him, and make the
 like request: he lifted vp the earle by the hand, bad him be of good
 comfort, pardoned all that was past, and freendlie hauing kissed him
 and his sonnes vpon the cheekes, he lead them to his palace, called
 home the queene, and summoned all his lords vnto a councell.

 Wherein it is much to read, how manie billes were presented against
 the bishop & his Normans; some conteining matter of rape, other of
 robberie, extortion, murder, manslaughter, high treason, adulterie;
 and not a few of batterie. Wherwith the king (as a man now awaked out
 of sleepe) was so offended, that vpon consultation had of these
 things, he banished all the Normans out of the land, onelie three or
 foure excepted, whome he reteined for sundrie necessarie causes,
 albeit they came neuer more so neere him afterward as to be of his
 priuie councell.

 After this also the earle liued almost two yeares, and then falling
 into an apoplexie, as he sat with the king at the table, he was taken
 vp and carried into the kings bedchamber, where (after a few daies) he
 made an end of his life. And thus much of our first broile raised by
 the cleargie, and practise of the archbishop. I would intreat of all
 the like examples of tyrannie, practised by the prelats of this see,
 against their lords and souereignes: but then I should rather write an
 historie than a description of this Iland.

 [Sidenote: Anselme.]
 Wherefore I refer you to those reports of Anselme and Becket,
 sufficientlie penned by other, the which Anselme also making a shew,
 as if he had bin verie vnwilling to be placed in the see of
 Canturburie, gaue this answer to the letters of such his freends, as
 did make request vnto him to take the charge vpon him. "Secularia
 negotia nescio, quia scire nolo, eorum namque occupationes horreo,
 liberum affectans animum. Voluntati sacrarum intendo scripturarum, vos
 dissonantiam facitis, verendumque est ne aratrum sanctae ecclesiae, quod
 in Anglia duo boues validi & pari fortitudine, ad bonum certantes, id
 est rex & archiepiscopus, debeant trahere, nunc oue vetula cum tauro
 indomito iugata, distorqueatur a recto. Ego ouis vetula, qui si
 quietus essem, verbi Dei lacte, & operimento lanae, aliquibus possem
 fortassis non ingratus esse, sed si me cum hoc tauro coniungitis,
 videbitis pro disparilitate trahentium, aratrum non recte procedere,
 &c." Which is in English thus: Of secular affaires I haue no skill,
 bicause I will not know them, for I euen abhor the troubles that rise
 about them, as one that desireth to haue his mind at libertie. I
 applie my whole indeuor to the rule of the scriptures, you lead me to
 the contrarie. And it is to be feared least the plough of holie
 church, which two strong oxen of equall force, and both like earnest
 to contend vnto that which is good (that is the king and the
 archbishop) ought to draw, should thereby now swarue from the right
 forrow, by matching of an old sheepe with a wild vntamed bull. I am
 that old sheepe, who if I might be quiet, could peraduenture shew my
 selfe not altogither vngratfull to some, by feeding them with the
 milke of the word of God, and couering them with wooll: but if you
 match me with this bull, you shall see that thorough want of equalitie
 in draught the plough will not go to right, &c: as foloweth in the
 [Sidenote: Thomas Becket.]
 processe of his letters. The said Thomas Becket was so proud, that he
 wrote to king Henrie the second, as to his lord, to his king, and to
 his sonne, offering him his counsell, his reuerence, and due
 correction, &c. Others in like sort haue protested, that they owght
 nothing to the kings of this land, but their counsell onelie,
 reseruing all obedience vnto the see of Rome.

 And as the old cocke of Canturburie did crow in this behalfe, so the
 yoong cockerels of other sees did imitate his demeanor, as may be
 seene by this one example also in king Stephans time, worthie to be
 remembred; vnto whome the bishop of London would not so much as sweare
 to be true subiect: wherein also he was mainteined by the pope, as
 appeareth by these letters.

 "Eugenius episcopus seruus seruorum Dei, dilecto in Christo filio
 Stephano illustri regi Anglor[=u] salut[=e], & apostolic[=a]
 benediction[=e]. Ad haec superna prouid[=e]tia in ecclesia pontifices
 ordinauit, vt Christianus populus ab eis pascua vitae reciperet, & tam
 principes seculares, quam inferioris conditionis homines, ipsis
 pontificibus tanquam Christi vicarijs reuerentiam exhiberent.
 Venerabilis siquidem frater noster Robertus London episcopus, tanquam
 vir sapiens & honestus, & relligionis amator, a nobilitate tua benigne
 tractandus est, & pro collata a Deo prudentia propensius honorandus.
 Quia ergo, sicut in veritate comperimus cum animae suae salute, ac suae
 ordinis periculo, fidelitate quae ab eo requiritur astringi non potest:
 volumus, & ex paterno tibi affectu consulimus, quatenus praedictum
 fratrem nostrum super hoc nullatenus inquietes, immo pro beati Petri &
 nostra reuerentia, eum in amorem & gratiam tuam recipias. Cum autem
 illud iuramentum praestare non possit, sufficiat discretioni tuae, vt
 simplici & veraci verbo promittat, quod laesionem tibi vel terrae tuae
 non inferat: Vale. Dat. Meldis 6. cal. Iulij."

 Thus we see, that kings were to rule no further than it pleased the
 pope to like of; neither to chalenge more obedience of their subiects
 than stood also with their good will and pleasure. He wrote in like
 sort vnto queene Mawd about the same matter, making hir Samsons calfe
 (the better to bring his purpose to passe) as appeareth by the same
 letter here insuing.

 "Solomone attestante, didicimus quod mulier sapiens aedificat domum;
 insipiens autem constructam destruet manibus. Gaudemus pro te, &
 deuotionis studium in Domino collaudamus; quoniam sicut relligiosorum
 relatione accepimus, timorem Dei prae oculis habens, operibus pietatis
 int[=e]dis, & personas ecclesiasticas & diligis & honoras. Vt ergo de
 bono in melius (inspirante Domino) proficere valeas, nobilitat[=e]
 tuam in Domino rogamus, & rogando monemus, & exhortamur in Domino,
 quatenus bonis initijs exitus meliores iniungas, & venerabilem fratrem
 nostrum Robertum London episcop[=u], pro illius reuerentia, qui cum
 olim diues esset, pro nobis pauper fieri voluit, attentius diligas, &
 honores. Apud virum tuum & dilectum filium nostrum Stephanum, insignem
 regem Anglorum efficere studeas, vt monitis, hortatu, & c[=o]silio
 tuo, ipsum in benignitatem & dilectionem suam suscipiat, & pro beati
 Petri, & nostra reuerentia propensius habeat commendatum. Et quia
 sicut (veritate teste) attendimus eum sine salute, & sui ordinis
 periculo, praefato filio nostro astringi non posse; volumus, & paterno
 sibi & tibi affectu consulimus, vt vobis sufficiat, veraci & simplici
 verbo promission[=e] ab eo suscipere, quod laesionem vel detrimentum
 ei, vel terrae suae n[=o] inferat. Dat. vt supra."

 Is it not strange, that a peeuish order of religion (deuised by man)
 should breake the expresse law of God, who commandeth all men to
 honour and obeie their kings and princes, in whome some part of the
 power of God is manifest and laid open vnto vs? And euen vnto this end
 the cardinall of Hostia also wrote to the canons of Paules, after this
 maner; couertlie incoraging them to stand to their election of the
 said Robert, who was no more willing to giue ouer his new bishoprike,
 than they carefull to offend the king; but rather imagined which waie
 to keepe it still maugre his displeasure: & yet not to sweare
 obedience vnto him, for all that he should be able to do or performe
 vnto the contrarie.

 "Humilis Dei gratia Hostiensis episcopus, Londinensis ecclesiae
 canonicis spirit[=u] consilij in Domino. Sicut rationi contraria
 prorsus est abjicienda petitio, ita in hijs, quae iuste desyderantur,
 effectum negare omnino non conuenit. Sane nuper accepimus, quod
 [Sidenote: Forsitan naturalem.]
 Londinensis ecclesia, diu proprio destituta pastore, communi voto, &
 pari assensu cleri & populi, venerabilem filium nostrum Robertum,
 eiusdem ecclesiae archidiaconum, in pastorem & episcopum animarum
 suarum susceperit & elegerit. Nouimus quidem eum esse personam, quam
 sapientia desuper ei attributa, & honestas conuersationis, & morum
 reuerentia plurimum commedabilem reddidit. Inde est quod fraternitati
 vestrae mandando consulimus, vt proposito vestro bono (quod vt credimus
 ex Deo est) & vt ex literis domini papae cognoscetis, non tepide, non
 lente debitum finem imponatis: ne tam nobilis ecclesia, sub occasione
 huiusmodi, spiritualium, quod absit, & temporalium detrimentum
 patiatur. Ipsius namque industria credimus, quod antiqua relligio, &
 forma disciplinae, & grauitas habitus, in ecclesia vestra reparari: &
 si quae fuerint ipsius contentiones, ex pastoris absentia, Dei gratia
 cooperante, & eodem praesente, poterint reformari. Dat. &c."

 Hereby you see how king Stephan was dealt withall. And albeit the
 archbishop of Canturburie is not openlie to be touched herewith, yet
 it is not to be doubted, but he was a dooer in it, so far as might
 tend to the maintenance of the right and prerogatiue of holie church.
 And euen no lesse vnquietnesse had another of our princes with Iohn of
 Arundell, who fled to Rome for feare of his head, and caused the pope
 to write an ambitious and contumelious letter vnto his souereigne
 about his restitution. But when (by the kings letters yet extant) &
 beginning thus; "Thomas proditionis non expers nostrae regiae maiestati
 insidias fabricauit," the pope vnderstood the botom of the matter, he
 was contented that Thomas should be depriued, and another archbishop
 chosen in his sted.

 Neither did this pride staie at archbishops and bishops, but descended
 lower, euen to the rake-helles of the clergie and puddels of all
 vngodlinesse. For beside the iniurie receiued of their superiors, how
 was K. Iohn dealt withall by the vile Cistertians at Lincolne in the
 second of his reigne? Certes, when he had (vpon iust occasion)
 conceiued some grudge against them for their ambitious demeanor; and
 vpon deniall to paie such summes of moneie as were allotted vnto them,
 he had caused seizure to be made of such horsses, swine, neate, and
 other things of theirs, as were mainteined in his forrests. They
 denounced him as fast amongst themselues with bell, booke and candle,
 to be accurssed and excommunicated. Therevnto they so handled the
 matter with the pope and their friends, that the king was faine to
 yeeld to their good graces: insomuch that a meeting for pacification
 was appointed betweene them at Lincolne, by meanes of the present
 archbishop of Canturburie, who went oft betweene him and the
 Cistertian commissioners before the matter could be finished. In the
 end, the king himselfe came also vnto the said commissioners as they
 sat in their chapiter house, and there with teares fell downe at their
 feet, crauing pardon for his trespasses against them, and heartilie
 requiring that they would (from thencefoorth) commend him and his
 realme in their praiers vnto the protection of the almightie, and
 receiue him into their fraternitie: promising moreouer full
 satisfaction of their damages susteined; and to build an house of
 their order in whatsoeuer place of England it should please them to
 assigne. And this he confirmed by charter, bearing date the seauen and
 twentith of Nouember, after the Scotish king was returned into
 Scotland, & departed from the king. Whereby (and by other the like, as
 betweene Iohn Stratford and Edward the third, &c:) a man may easilie
 conceiue how proud the cleargie-men haue beene in former times, as
 wholie presuming vpon the primassie of their pope. More matter could I
 alledge of these and the like broiles, not to be found among our
 common historiographers: howbeit reseruing the same vnto places more
 conuenient, I will ceasse to speake of them at this time, and go
 forward with such other things as my purpose is to speake of. At the
 first therefore there was like and equall authoritie in both our
 archbishops: but as he of Canturburie hath long since obteined the
 prerogatiue aboue Yorke (although I saie not without great trouble,
 sute, some bloudshed & contention) so the archbishop of Yorke is
 neuerthelesse written primate of England, as one contenting himselfe
 with a peece of a title at the least, when (all) could not be gotten.
 And as he of Canturburie crowneth the king, so this of Yorke dooth the
 like to the queene, whose perpetuall chapleine he is, & hath beene
 from time to time, since the determination of this controuersie, as
 writers doo report. The first also hath vnder his iurisdiction to the
 [Sidenote: Twentie one bishoprikes vnder the see of Canturburie.
 Onelie foure sees vnder the archbishop of Yorke.]
 number of one and twentie inferiour bishops, the other hath onlie
 foure, by reason that the churches of Scotland are now remooued from
 his obedience vnto an archbishop of their owne, whereby the greatnesse
 and circuit of the iurisdiction of Yorke is not a little diminished.
 In like sort each of these seauen and twentie sees haue their
 [Sidenote: Deanes.]
 cathedrall churches, wherein the deanes (a calling not knowne in
 England before the conquest) doo beare the cheefe rule, being men
 especiallie chosen to that vocation, both for their learning and
 godlinesse so neere as can be possible. These cathedrall churches haue
 [Sidenote: Canonries.]
 in like maner other dignities and canonries still remaining vnto them,
 as heeretofore vnder the popish regiment. Howbeit those that are
 chosen to the same are no idle and vnprofitable persons (as in times
 past they haue beene when most of these liuings were either furnished
 with strangers, especiallie out of Italie, boies, or such idiots as
 had least skill of all in discharging of those functions, wherevnto
 they were called by vertue of these stipends) but such as by preaching
 and teaching can and doo learnedlie set foorth the glorie of God, and
 further the ouerthrow of antichrist to the vttermost of their powers.

 These churches are called cathedrall, bicause the bishops dwell or lie
 neere vnto the same, as bound to keepe continuall residence within
 their iurisdictions, for the better ouersight and gouernance of the
 same: the word being deriued a cathedra, that is to saie a chaire or
 seat where he resteth, and for the most part abideth. At the first
 there was but one church in euerie iurisdiction, wherinto no man
 entred to praie, but with some oblation or other toward the
 maintenance of the pastor. For as it was reputed an infamie to passe
 by anie of them without visitation: so it was a no lesse reproch to
 appeare emptie before the Lord. And for this occasion also they were
 builded verie huge and great, for otherwise they were not capable of
 such multitudes as came dailie vnto them, to heare the word and
 receive the sacraments.

 But as the number of christians increased, so first monasteries, then
 finallie parish churches were builded in euerie iurisdiction: from
 whence I take our deanerie churches to haue their originall, now
 called mother churches, and their incumbents archpreests; the rest
 being added since the conquest, either by the lords of euerie towne,
 or zealous men, loth to trauell farre, and willing to haue some ease
 by building them neere hand. Vnto these deanerie churches also the
 cleargie in old time of the same deanrie were appointed to repaire at
 sundrie seasons, there to receiue wholesome ordinances, and to consult
 vpon the necessarie affaires of the whole iurisdiction; if necessitie
 so required: and some image hereof is yet to be seene in the north
 parts. But as the number of churches increased, so the repaire of the
 faithfull vnto the cathedrals did diminish: whereby they now become
 especiallie in their nether parts rather markets and shops for
 merchandize, than solemn places of praier, wherevnto they were first
 erected. Moreouer in the said cathedrall churches vpon sundaies and
 [Sidenote: Ordinarie sermons.]
 festiuall daies, the canons doo make certeine ordinarie sermons by
 course, wherevnto great numbers of all estates doo orderlie resort:
 and vpon the working daies thrise in the weeke, one of the said
 canons, or some other in his steed, dooth read and expound some peece
 [Sidenote: Ordinarie expositions of the scriptures.]
 of holie scripture, wherevnto the people doo verie reuerentlie
 repaire. The bishops themselues in like sort are not idle in their
 callings, for being now exempt from court and councell, which is one
 (and a no small) peece of their felicitie (although Richard archbishop
 of Canturburie thought otherwise, as yet appeareth by his letters to
 pope Alexander, Epistola 44. Petri Blesensis, where he saith; Bicause
 the cleargie of his time were somewhat narrowlie looked vnto, "Supra
 [Sidenote: The bishops preach diligentlie, whose predecessors
 heretofore haue beene occupied in temporall affairs.]
 dorsum ecclesiae fabricant peccatores, &c:") they so applie their minds
 to the setting foorth of the word, that there are verie few of them,
 which doo not euerie sundaie or oftener resort to some place or other,
 within their iurisdictions, where they expound the scriptures with
 much grauitie and skill; and yet not without the great misliking and
 contempt of such as hate the word. Of their manifold translations from
 one see to another I will saie nothing, which is not now doone for the
 benefit of the flocke, as the preferment of the partie fauoured, and
 aduantage vnto the prince, a matter in time past much doubted of, to
 wit, whether a bishop or pastor might be translated from one see to
 another; & left vndecided, till prescription by roiall authoritie made
 it good. For among princes a thing once doone, is well doone, and to
 be doone oftentimes, though no warrant be to be found therefore.

 [Sidenote: Archdecons.]
 They haue vnder them also their archdeacons, some one, diuerse two,
 and manie foure or mo, as their circuits are in quantitie, which
 archdeacons are termed in law the bishops eies: and these (beside
 their ordinarie courts, which are holden within so manie or more of
 their seuerall deanries by themselues or their officials once in a
 moneth at the least) doo keepe yearelie two visitations or synods (as
 the bishop dooth in euerie third yeare, wherein he confirmeth some
 children, though most care but a little for that ceremonie) in which
 they make diligent inquisition and search, as well for the doctrine
 and behauiour of the ministers, as the orderlie dealing of the
 parishioners in resorting to their parish churches and conformitie
 vnto religion. They punish also with great seueritie all such
 trespassers, either in person or by the pursse (where permutation of
 penance is thought more greeuous to the offender) as are presented
 vnto them: or if the cause be of the more weight, as in cases of
 heresie, pertinacie, contempt, and such like, they referre them either
 to the bishop of the diocesse, or his chancellor, or else to sundrie
 [Sidenote: High commissioners.]
 graue persons set in authoritie, by vertue of an high commission
 directed vnto them from the prince to that end, who in verie courteous
 maner doo see the offendors gently reformed, or else seuerlie
 punished, if necessitie so inforce.

 [Sidenote: A prophesie or conference.]
 Beside this, in manie of our archdeaconries we haue an exercise
 latelie begun, which for the most part is called a prophesie or
 conference, and erected onelie for the examination or triall of the
 diligence of the cleargie in their studie of holie scriptures.
 Howbeit, such is the thirstie desire of the people in these daies to
 heare the word of God, that they also haue as it were with zealous
 violence intruded themselues among them (but as hearers onelie) to
 come by more knowledge through their presence at the same. Herein also
 (for the most part) two of the yoonger sort of ministers doo expound
 ech after other some peece of the scriptures ordinarilie appointed
 vnto them in their courses (wherein they orderlie go through with some
 one of the euangelists, or of the epistles, as it pleaseth the whole
 assemblie to choose at the first in euerie of these conferences) and
 when they haue spent an houre or a little more betweene them, then
 commeth one of the better learned sort, who being a graduat for the
 most part, or knowne to be a preacher sufficientlie authorised, & of a
 sound iudgement, supplieth the roome of a moderator, making first a
 breefe rehearsall of their discourses, and then adding what him
 thinketh good of his owne knowledge, wherby two houres are thus
 commonlie spent at this most profitable meeting. When all is doone, if
 the first speakers haue shewed anie peece of diligence, they are
 commended for their trauell, and incouraged to go forward. If they
 haue beene found to be slacke, or not sound in deliuerie of their
 doctrine, their negligence and error is openlie reprooued before all
 their brethren, who go aside of purpose from the laitie, after the
 exercise ended, to iudge of these matters, and consult of the next
 speakers and quantitie of the text to be handled in that place. The
 laitie neuer speake of course (except some vaine and busie head will
 now and then intrude themselues with offense) but are onelie hearers;
 and as it is vsed in some places weekelie, in other once in foureteene
 daies, in diuerse monethlie, and elsewhere twise in a yeare, so is it
 a notable spurre vnto all the ministers, thereby to applie their
 bookes, which otherwise (as in times past) would giue themselues to
 hawking, hunting, tables, cards, dice, tipling at the alehouse,
 shooting of matches, and other like vanities, nothing commendable in
 such as should be godlie and zealous stewards of the good gifts of
 God, faithfull distributors of his word vnto the people, and diligent
 pastors according to their calling.

 But alas! as sathan the author of all mischeefe hath in sundrie
 manners heretofore hindered the erection and maintenance of manie good
 things: so in this he hath stirred vp aduersaries of late vnto this
 most profitable exercise, who not regarding the commoditie that riseth
 thereby so well to the hearers as spekers; but either stumbling (I
 cannot tell how) at words and termes, or at the least wise not liking
 to here of the reprehension of vice, or peraduenture taking a
 misliking at the slender demeanours of such negligent ministers, as
 now and then in their courses doo occupie the roomes, haue either by
 their owne practise, their sinister information, or suggestions made
 vpon surmises vnto other procured the suppression of these
 conferences, condemning them as hurtfull, pernicious, and dailie
 breeders of no small hurt & inconuenience. But hereof let God be
 iudge, vnto whome the cause belongeth.

 [Sidenote: Ministers & deacons.]
 Our elders or ministers and deacons (for subdeacons and the other
 inferiour orders, sometime vsed in popish church we haue not) are made
 according to a certeine forme of consecration concluded vpon in the
 time of king Edward the sixt, by the cleargie of England, and soone
 after confirmed by the three estates of the realme, in the high court
 of parlement. And out of the first sort, that is to saie, of such as
 are called to the ministerie (without respect whether they be married
 or not) are bishops, deanes, archdeacons, & such as haue the higher
 places in the hierarchie of the church elected; and these also as all
 the rest, at the first comming vnto anie spirituall promotion, doo
 yeeld vnto the prince the entire taxe of that their liuing for one
 whole yeare, if it amount in value vnto ten pounds and vpwards, and
 this vnder the name and title of first fruits.

 With vs also it is permitted, that a sufficient man may (by
 dispensation from the prince) hold two liuings, not distant either
 from other aboue thirtie miles; whereby it commeth to passe, that as
 hir maiestie dooth reape some commoditie by the facultie, so the
 vnition of two in one man dooth bring oftentimes more benefit to one
 of them in a moneth (I meane for doctrine) than they haue had before
 peraduenture in manie yeares.

 Manie exclame against such faculties, as if there were mo good
 preachers that want maintenance, than liuings to mainteine them. In
 deed when a liuing is void, there are so manie sutors for it, that a
 man would thinke the report to be true and most certeine: but when it
 commeth to the triall, who are sufficient, and who not, who are staied
 men in conuersation, iudgement, and learning; of that great number you
 shall hardlie find one or two, such as they ought to be: and yet none
 more earnest to make sure, to promise largelie, beare a better shew,
 or find fault with the state of things than they. Neuerthelesse, I doo
 not thinke that their exclamations if they were wiselie handled, are
 altogither grounded vpon rumours or ambitious minds, if you respect
 the state of the thing it selfe, and not the necessitie growing
 through want of able men, to furnish out all the cures in England,
 which both our vniuersities are neuer able to performe. For if you
 obserue what numbers of preachers Cambridge and Oxford doo yearelie
 send foorth; and how manie new compositions are made in the court of
 first fruits, by the deaths of the last incumbents: you shall soone
 see a difference. Wherefore, if in countrie townes & cities, yea euen
 in London it selfe, foure or fiue of the litle churches were brought
 into one, the inconuenience would in great part be redressed.

 And to saie truth, one most commonlie of these small liuings is of so
 little value, that it is not able to mainteine a meane scholar; much
 lesse a learned man, as not being aboue ten, twelue, sixteene,
 seuenteene, twentie, or thirtie pounds at the most, toward their
 charges, which now (more than before time) doo go out of the same. I
 saie more than before, bicause euerie small trifle, noble mans
 request, or courtesie craued by the bishop, dooth impose and command a
 twentith part, a three score part, or two pence in the pound, &c: out
 of our liuings, which hitherto hath not beene vsuallie granted, but by
 consent of a synod, wherein things were decided according to equitie,
 and the poorer sort considered of, which now are equallie burdened.

 We paie also the tenths of our liuings to the prince yearelie,
 according to such valuation of ech of them, as hath beene latelie
 made: which neuerthelesse in time past were not annuall but
 voluntarie, & paid at request of king or pope. Herevpon also hangeth a
 pleasant storie though doone of late yeares, to wit 1452, at which
 time the cleargie seeing the continuall losses that the king of
 England susteined in France, vpon some motion of releefe made, granted
 in an open conuocation to giue him two tenths toward the recouerie of
 Burdeaux, which his grace verie thankefullie receiued. It fortuned
 also at the same time that Vincentius Clemens the popes factor was
 here in England, who hearing what the clergie had doone, came into the
 conuocation house also in great hast and lesse speed, where, in a
 solemne oration he earnestlie required them to be no lesse fauourable
 to their spirituall father the pope, and mother the see of Rome, than
 they had shewed themselues vnto his vassall and inferiour, meaning
 their souereigne lord in temporall iurisdiction, &c. In deliuering
 also the cause of his sute, he shewed how greeuouslie the pope was
 disturbed by cutthrotes, varlots, and harlots, which doo now so abound
 in Rome, that his holinesse is in dailie danger to be made awaie
 amongst them. To be short when this fine tale was told, one of the
 companie stood vp and said vnto him; My lord we haue heard your
 request, and as we thinke, it deserueth litle consideration and lesse
 eare, for how would you haue vs to contribute to his aid in
 suppression of such, as he and such as you are doo continuall vphold,
 it is not vnknowen in this house what rule is kept in Rome.

 I grant (quoth Vincent) that there wanteth iust reformation of manie
 things in that citie, which would haue beene made sooner, but now it
 is too late: neuerthelesse I beseech you to write vnto his holinesse,
 with request that he would leaue and abandon that Babylon, which is
 but a sinke of mischiefe, and keepe his court elsewhere in place of
 better fame. And this he shall be the better able also to performe, if
 by your liberalitie extended towards him, vnto whome you are most
 bound, he be incouraged thereto. Manie other words passed to and fro
 amongst them, howbeit in the end Vincent ouercame not, but was
 dismissed without anie penie obteined. But to returne to our tenths, a
 paiement first as deuised by the pope, and afterward taken vp as by
 the prescription of the king, wherevnto we may ioine also our first
 fruits, which is one whole yeares commoditie of our liuing, due at our
 entrance into the same, the tenths abated vnto the princes cofers, and
 paid commonlie in two yeares. For the receipt also of these two
 paiments, an especiall office or court is erected, which beareth name
 of first fruits and tenths, wherevnto if the partie to be preferred,
 doo not make his dutifull repaire by an appointed time after
 possession taken, there to compound for the paiment of his said
 fruits, he incurreth the danger of a great penaltie, limited by a
 certeine statute prouided in that behalfe, against such as doo intrude
 into the ecclesiasticall function, and refuse to paie the accustomed
 duties belonging to the same.

 They paie likewise subsidies with the temporaltie, but in such sort,
 that if these paie after foure shillings for land, the cleargie
 contribute commonlie after six shillings of the pound, so that of a
 benefice of twentie pounds by the yeare, the incumbent thinketh
 himself well acquited, if all ordinarie paiments being discharged he
 may reserue thirteene pounds six shillings eight pence towards his
 owne sustentation, and maintenance of his familie. Seldome also are
 they without the compasse of a subsidie, for if they be one yeare
 cleare from this paiement, a thing not often seene of late yeares,
 they are like in the next to heare of another grant: so that I saie
 againe they are seldome without the limit of a subsidie. Herein also
 they somewhat find themselues grieued, that the laitie may at euerie
 taxation helpe themselues, and so they doo through consideration had
 of their decaie and hinderance, and yet their impouerishment cannot
 but touch also the parson or vicar, vnto whom such libertie is denied,
 as is dailie to be seene in their accompts and tithings.

 Some of them also, after the mariages of their children, will haue
 their proportions qualified, or by freendship get themselues quite out
 of the booke. But what stand I vpon these things, who haue rather to
 complaine of the iniurie offered by some of our neighbors of the
 laitie, which dailie endeuor to bring vs also within the compasse of
 their fifteens or taxes for their owne ease, whereas the taxe of the
 whole realme, which is commonlie greater in the champeigne than
 woodland soile, amounteth onelie to 37930 pounds nine pence
 halfepenie, is a burden easie inough to be borne vpon so manie
 shoulders, without the helpe of the cleargie, whose tenths and
 subsidies make vp commonlie a double, if not troublesome vnto their
 aforesaid paiments. Sometimes also we are threatned with a Melius
 inquirendum, as if our liuings were not racked high inough alreadie.
 But if a man should seeke out where all those church lands were, which
 in time past did contribute vnto the old summe required or to be made
 vp, no doubt no small number of the laitie of all states should be
 contributors also with vs, the prince not defrauded of his expectation
 and right. We are also charged with armor & munitions from thirtie
 pounds vpwards, a thing more needfull than diuerse other charges
 imposed vpon vs are conuenient, by which & other burdens our case
 groweth to be more heauie by a great deale (notwithstanding our
 immunitie from temporall seruices) than that of the laitie, and for
 ought that I see not likelie to be diminished, as if the church were
 now become the asse whereon euerie market man is to ride and cast his
 wallet.

 The other paiments due vnto the archbishop and bishop at their
 seuerall visitations (of which the first is double to the latter) and
 such also as the archdeacon receiueth at his synods, &c: remaine still
 as they did without anie alteration, onelie this I thinke be added
 within memorie of man, that at the comming of euerie prince, his
 appointed officers doo commonlie visit the whole realme vnder the
 forme of an ecclesiasticall inquisition, in which the clergie doo
 vsuallie paie double fees, as vnto the archbishop. Hereby then, and by
 those alreadie remembred, it is found that the church of England, is
 no lesse commodious to the princes coffers than the state of the
 laitie, if it doo not farre exceed the same, since their paiments are
 certeine, continuall, and seldome abated, howsoeuer they gather vp
 their owne duties with grudging, murmuring, sute, and slanderous
 speeches of the paiers, or haue their liuings otherwise hardlie valued
 vnto the vttermost farding, or shrewdlie cancelled by the
 couetousnesse of the patrones, of whome some doo bestow aduousons of
 benefices vpon their bakers, butlers, cookes, good archers, falconers,
 and horssekeepers, in sted of other recompense, for their long and
 faithfull seruice, which they imploie afterward vnto their most
 aduantage.

 Certes here they resemble the pope verie much, for as he sendeth out
 his idols, so doo they their parasites, pages, chamberleins, stewards,
 groomes, & lackies; and yet these be the men that first exclame of the
 insufficiencie of the ministers, as hoping thereby in due time to get
 also their glebes and grounds into their hands. In times past
 bishopriks went almost after the same maner vnder the laie princes,
 and then vnder the pope, so that he which helped a clerke vnto a see,
 was sure to haue a present or purse fine, if not an annuall pension,
 besides that which went to the popes coffers, and was thought to be
 verie good merchandize. Hereof one example may be touched, as of a
 thing doone in my yoonger daies, whilest queene Marie bare the swaie
 and gouerned in this land. After the death of Stephan Gardiner, the
 see of Winchester was void for a season, during which time cardinall
 Poole made seizure vpon the reuenues and commodities of the same,
 pretending authoritie therevnto Sede vacante, by vertue of his place.
 With this act of his the bishop of Lincolne called White tooke such
 displeasure, that he stepped in like a mate, with full purpose (as he
 said) to keepe that see from ruine. He wrote also to Paulus the fourth
 pope, requiring that he might be preferred therevnto, promising so as
 he might be Compos voti, to paie to the popes coffers 1600 pounds
 yearlie during his naturall life, and for one yeere after. But the
 pope nothing liking of his motion, and yet desirous to reape a further
 benefit, first shewed himselfe to stomach his simonicall practise
 verie grieuouslie, considering the dangerousnesse of the time and
 present estate of the church of England, which hoong as yet in balance
 readie to yeeld anie waie, sauing foorth right, as he alledged in his
 letters. By which replie he so terrified the poore bishop, that he was
 driuen vnto another issue, I meane to recouer the popes good will,
 with a further summe than stood with his ease to part withall. In the
 end when the pope had gotten this fleece, a new deuise was found, and
 meanes made to and by the prince, that White might be bishop of
 Winchester, which at the last he obteined, but in such wise as that
 the pope and his neerest friends did lose but a little by it. I could
 if need were set downe a report of diuerse other the like practises,
 but this shall suffice in steed of all the rest, least in reprehending
 of vice I might shew my selfe to be a teacher of vngodlinesse, or to
 scatter more vngratious seed in lewd ground alreadie choked with
 wickednesse.

 To proceed therefore with the rest, I thinke it good also to remember,
 that the names vsuallie giuen vnto such as feed the flocke remaine in
 like sort as in times past, so that these words, parson, vicar, curat,
 and such are not yet abolished more than the canon law it selfe, which
 is dailie pleaded, as I haue said elsewhere; although the statutes of
 the realme haue greatlie infringed the large scope, and brought the
 exercise of the same into some narrower limits. There is nothing read in
 our churches but the canonicall scriptures, whereby it commeth to passe
 that the psalter is said ouer once in thirtie daies, the new testament
 foure times, and the old testament once in the yeare. And herevnto if
 the curat be adiudged by the bishop or his deputies, sufficientlie
 instructed in the holie scriptures, and therewithall able to teach, he
 permitteth him to make some exposition or exhortation in his parish,
 vnto amendment of life. And for so much as our churches and vniuersities
 haue beene so spoiled in time of errour, as there cannot yet be had such
 number of able pastours as may suffice for euerie parish to haue one:
 there are (beside foure sermons appointed by publike order in the yeare)
 certeine sermons or homilies (deuised by sundrie learned men, confirmed
 for sound doctrine by consent of the diuines, and publike authoritie of
 the prince) and those appointed to be read by the curats of meane
 vnderstanding (which homilies doo comprehend the principall parts of
 christian doctrine, as of originall sinne, of iustification by faith, of
 charitie, and such like) vpon the sabbaoth daies, vnto the congregation.
 And after a certeine number of psalmes read, which are limited according
 to the daies of the month, for morning and euening praier, we haue two
 lessons, wherof the first is taken out of the old testament, the second
 out of the new, and of these latter that in the morning is out of the
 gospels, the other in the after noone out of some one of the epistles.
 After morning praier also we haue the letanie and suffrages, an
 inuocation in mine opinion not deuised without the great assistance of
 the spirit of God, although manie curious mindsicke persons vtterlie
 condemne it as superstitious and sauoring of coniuration and sorcerie.

 This being doone, we proceed vnto the communion, if anie communicants be
 to receiue the eucharist, if not we read the decalog, epistle and
 gospell with the Nicene creed (of some in derision called the drie
 communion) and then proceed vnto an homilie or sermon, which hath a
 psalme before and after it, and finallie vnto the baptisme of such
 infants as on euerie sabaoth daie (if occasion so require) are brought
 vnto the churches: and thus is the forenoone bestowed. In the after
 noone likewise we meet againe, and after the psalmes and lessons ended
 we haue commonlie a sermon, or at the leastwise our youth catechised by
 the space of an houre. And thus doo we spend the sabaoth daie in good
 and godlie exercises, all doone in our vulgar toong, that each one
 present may heare and vnderstand the same, which also in cathedrall and
 collegiat churches is so ordered, that the psalmes onelie are soong by
 note, the rest being read (as in common parish churches) by the minister
 with a lowd voice, sauing that in the administration of the communion
 the quier singeth the answers, the creed, and sundrie other things
 appointed, but in so plaine, I saie, and distinct maner, that each one
 present may vnderstand what they sing, euerie word hauing but one note,
 though the whole harmonie consist of manie parts, and those verie
 cunninglie set by the skilfull in that science.

 Certes this translation of the seruice of the church into the vulgar
 toong, hath not a litle offended the pope almost in euerie age, as a
 thing verie often attempted by diuers princes, but neuer generallie
 obteined, for feare least the consenting thervnto might breed the
 ouerthrow (as it would in deed) of all his religion and hierarchie:
 neuerthelesse in some places where the kings and princes dwelled not
 vnder his nose, it was performed maugre his resistance. Vratislaus duke
 of Bohemia, would long since haue doone the like also in his kingdome,
 but not daring to venter so farre without the consent of the pope, he
 wrote vnto him thereof, and receiued his answer inhibitorie vnto all his
 proceeding in the same.

 "Gregorius septimus Vratislao Bohemorum duci, &c. Quia nobilitas tua
 postulat, quod secund[=u] Sclauonic[=a] lingu[=a] apud vos diuinum
 celebrari annueremus officium, scias nos huic petitioni tuae nequaquam
 posse fauere, ex hoc nempe se voluentibus liquet, non immerito sacram
 scripturam optimo Deo placuisse quibusdam locis esse occultam; ne si
 ad liquidum cunctis pateret, forte vilesceret, & subiaceret despectui,
 aut praue intellecta a mediocribus in errorem induceret. Neque enim ad
 excusationem iuuat, quod quidam viri hoc, quod simplex populus quaerit
 patienter tulerunt, seu incorrectum dimiserunt: cum primitiua ecclesia
 multa dissimulauerit, quae a sanctis patribus postmodum, firmata
 christianitate & religione crescente, subtili examinatione correcta
 sunt: vnde id ne fiat, quod a vestris imprudenter exposcitur,
 authoritate beatri Petri inhibemus; teque ad honorem optimi Dei huic
 vanae temeritati viribus totis resistere praecipimus, &c. Datum Romae,
 &c."

 I would set downe two or three more of the like instruments passed
 from that see vnto the like end, but this shall suffice, being lesse
 common than the other, which are to be had more plentifullie.

 As for our churches themselues, belles, and times of morning and
 euening praier, remaine as in times past, sauing that all images,
 shrines, tabernacles, roodlofts, and monuments of idolatrie are
 remooued, taken downe, and defaced; onelie the stories in glasse
 windowes excepted, which for want of sufficient store of new stuffe,
 and by reason of extreame charge that should grow by the alteration of
 the same into white panes throughout the realme, are not altogither
 abolished in most places at once, but by little and little suffered to
 decaie, that white glasse may be prouided and set vp in their roomes.
 Finallie, whereas there was woont to be a great partition betweene the
 quire and the bodie of the church; now it is either verie small or
 none at all: and to saie the truth altogither needlesse, sith the
 minister saith his seruice commonlie in the bodie of the church, with
 his face toward the people, in a little tabernacle of wainscot
 prouided for the purpose: by which means the ignorant doo not onelie
 learne diuerse of the psalmes and vsuall praiers by heart, but also
 such as can read, doo praie togither with him: so that the whole
 congregation at one instant powre out their petitions vnto the liuing
 God, for the whole estate of his church in most earnest and feruent
 manner. Our holie and festiuall daies are verie well reduced also vnto
 a lesse number; for whereas (not long since) we had vnder the pope
 foure score and fifteene, called festiuall, and thirtie Profesti,
 beside the sundaies, they are all brought vnto seauen and twentie: and
 with them the superfluous numbers of idle waks, guilds, fraternities,
 church-ales, helpe-ales, and soule-ales, called also dirge-ales, with
 the heathnish rioting at bride-ales, are well diminished and laid
 aside. And no great matter were it if the feasts of all our apostles,
 euangelists, and martyrs, with that of all saincts, were brought to
 the holie daies that follow vpon Christmasse, Easter, and Whitsuntide;
 and those of the virgine Marie, with the rest vtterlie remooued from
 the calendars, as neither necessarie nor commendable in a reformed
 church.

 [Sidenote: Apparell.]
 The apparell in like sort of our clergie men is comlie, & in truth,
 more decent than euer it was in the popish church: before the
 vniuersities bound their graduats vnto a stable attire, afterward
 vsurped also euen by the blind sir Johns. For if you peruse well my
 chronologie insuing, you shall find, that they went either in diuerse
 colors like plaiers, or in garments of light hew, as yellow, red,
 greene, &c: with their shooes piked, their haire crisped, their
 girdles armed with siluer; their shooes, spurres, bridles, &c: buckled
 with like mettall: their apparell (for the most part) of silke, and
 richlie furred; their cappes laced and butned with gold: so that to
 meet a priest in those daies, was to behold a peacocke that spreadeth
 his taile when he danseth before the henne: which now (I saie) is well
 [Sidenote: Hospitalitie.]
 reformed. Touching hospitalitie, there was neuer anie greater vsed in
 England, sith by reason that mariage is permitted to him that will
 choose that kind of life, their meat and drinke is more orderlie and
 frugallie dressed; their furniture of houshold more conuenient, and
 better looked vnto; and the poore oftener fed generallie than
 heretofore they haue beene, when onlie a few bishops, and double or
 treble beneficed men did make good cheere at Christmasse onelie, or
 otherwise kept great houses for the interteinment of the rich, which
 did often see and visit them. It is thought much peraduenture, that
 some bishops, &c: in our time doo come short of the ancient gluttonie
 and prodigalitie of their predecessors: but to such as doo consider of
 the curtailing of their liuings, or excessiue prices whervnto things
 are growen, and how their course is limited by law, and estate looked
 into on euery side, the cause of their so dooing is well inough
 perceiued. This also offendeth manie, that they should after their
 deaths leaue their substances to their wiues and children: wheras they
 consider not, that in old time such as had no lemans nor bastards
 (verie few were there God wot of this sort) did leaue their goods and
 possessions to their brethren and kinsfolks, whereby (as I can shew by
 good record) manie houses of gentilitie haue growen and beene erected.
 If in anie age some one of them did found a college, almeshouse, or
 schoole, if you looke vnto these our times, you shall see no fewer
 deeds of charitie doone, nor better grounded vpon the right stub of
 [Sidenote: Mariage.]
 pietie than before. If you saie that their wiues be fond, after the
 deceasse of their husbands, and bestow themselues not so aduisedlie as
 their calling requireth, which God knoweth these curious surueiors
 make small accompt of in truth, further than thereby to gather matter
 of reprehension: I beseech you then to looke into all states of the
 laitie, & tell me whether some duchesses, countesses, barons, or
 knights wiues, doo not fullie so often offend in the like as they: for
 Eue will be Eue though Adam would saie naie. Not a few also find fault
 [Sidenote: Thred-bare gownes from whence they come.]
 with our thred-bare gowns, as if not our patrones but our wiues were
 causes of our wo. But if it were knowne to all, that I know to haue
 beene performed of late in Essex, where a minister taking a benefice
 (of lesse than twentie pounds in the Queenes bookes so farre as I
 remember) was inforced to paie to his patrone, twentie quarters of
 otes, ten quarters of wheat, and sixteene yeerelie of barleie, which
 he called hawkes meat; and another left the like in farme to his
 patrone for ten pounds by the yeere, which is well woorth fortie at
 the least, the cause of our thred-bare gownes would easilie appeere,
 for such patrons doo scrape the wooll from our clokes. Wherfore I may
 well saie, that such a thred-bare minister is either an ill man, or
 hath an ill patrone, or both: and when such cookes & cobling shifters
 shall be remooued and weeded out of the ministerie, I doubt not but
 our patrons will prooue better men, and be reformed whether they will
 or not, or else the single minded bishops shall see the liuing
 bestowed vpon such as doo deserue it. When the Pragmatike sanction
 tooke place first in France, it was supposed that these enormities
 should vtterlie haue ceased: but when the elections of bishops came
 once into the hands of the canons and spirituall men, it grew to be
 farre worse. For they also within a while waxing couetous, by their
 owne experience learned aforehand, raised the markets, and sought
 after new gaines by the gifts of the greatest liuings in that
 [Sidenote: Number of churches in France.]
 countrie, wherein (as Machiauell writeth) are eighteene
 archbishoprikes, one hundred fortie and sixe bishoprikes, 740 abbies,
 eleuen vniuersities, 1000700 steeples (if his report be sound.) Some
 are of the opinion, that if sufficient men in euerie towne might be
 sent for from the vniuersities, this mischiefe would soone be
 remedied; but I am cleane of another mind. For when I consider
 wherevnto the gifts of felowships in some places are growen: the
 profit that ariseth at sundrie elections of scholars out of grammar
 [Sidenote: Pretie packing.]
 schooles, to the posers, schoolemasters, and preferrers of them to our
 vniuersities, the gifts of a great number of almeshouses builded for
 the maimed and impotent souldiors, by princes and good men heretofore
 mooued with a pittifull consideration of the poore distressed: how
 rewards, pensions, and annuities also doo reigne in other cases,
 wherby the giuer is brought somtimes into extreame miserie, & that not
 so much as the roome of a common souldior is not obteined oftentimes,
 without a What will you giue me? I am brought into such a mistrust of
 the sequele of this deuise, that I dare pronounce (almost for
 certeine) that if Homer were now aliue, it should be said to him:

   "Tuque licet venias musis comitatus Homere,
     Si nihil attuleris ibis Homere foras."

 More I could saie, and more I would saie of these and other things,
 were it not that in mine owne iudgement I haue said inough alreadie
 for the aduertisement of such as be wise. Neuerthelesse, before I
 finish this chapter, I will adde a word or two (so brieflie as I can)
 of the old estate of cathedrall churches, which I haue collected
 togither here and there among the writers, and whereby it shall
 easilie be seene what they were, and how neere the gouernment of ours
 doo in these daies approch vnto them, for that there is an
 irreconciliable ods betweene them and those of the papists, I hope
 there is no learned man indeed, but will acknowlege and yeeld vnto it.

 [Sidenote: Old estate of cathedrall churches.]
 We find therefore in the time of the primitiue church, that there was
 in euerie see or iurisdiction one schoole at the least, whereinto such
 as were catechistes in christian religion did resort. And hereof as we
 may find great testimonie for Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, and
 Hierusalem; so no small notice is left of the like in the inferior
 sort, if the names of such as taught in them be called to mind, & the
 histories well read which make report of the same. These schooles were
 vnder the iurisdiction of the bishops, and from thence did they & the
 rest of the elders choose out such as were the ripest scholars, and
 willing to serue in the ministerie, whome they placed also in their
 cathedrall churches, there not onelie to be further instructed in the
 knowledge of the word, but also to invre them to the deliuerie of the
 same vnto the people in sound maner, to minister the sacraments, to
 visit the sicke and brethren imprisoned, and to performe such other
 duties as then belonged to their charges. The bishop himselfe and
 elders of the church were also hearers and examiners of their
 doctrine, and being in processe of time found meet workmen for the
 lords haruest, they were forthwith sent abrode (after imposition of
 hands, and praier generallie made for their good proceeding) to some
 place or other then destitute of hir pastor, and other taken from the
 schoole also placed in their roomes. What number of such clerks
 belonged now and then to some one see, the chronologie following shall
 easilie declare: and in like sort what officers, widowes, and other
 persons were dailie mainteined in those seasons by the offerings and
 oblations of the faithfull, it is incredible to be reported, if we
 compare the same with the decaies and ablations seene and practised at
 this present. But what is that in all the world which auarice and
 negligence will not corrupt and impaire? And as this is a paterne of
 the estate of the cathedrall churches in those times, so I wish that
 the like order of gouernment might once againe be restored vnto the
 same, which may be doone with ease, sith the schooles are alreadie
 builded in euerie diocesse, the vniuersities, places of their
 preferment vnto further knowledge, and the cathedrall churches great
 inough to receiue so manie as shall come from thence to be instructed
 vnto doctrine. But one hinderance of this is alreadie and more & more
 to be looked for (beside the plucking and snatching commonlie seene
 from such houses and the church) and that is, the generall contempt of
 the ministerie, and small consideration of their former paines taken,
 whereby lesse and lesse hope of competent maintenance by preaching the
 word is likelie to insue. Wherefore the greatest part of the more
 excellent wits choose rather to imploy their studies vnto physike and
 the lawes, vtterlie giuing ouer the studie of the scriptures, for
 feare least they should in time not get their bread by the same. By
 this meanes also the stalles in their queeres would be better filled,
 which now (for the most part) are emptie, and prebends should be
 prebends indeed, there to liue till they were preferred to some
 ecclesiasticall function, and then other men chosen to succeed them in
 their roomes, whereas now prebends are but superfluous additaments
 vnto former excesses, & perpetuall commodities vnto the owners, which
 before time were but temporall (as I haue said before.) But as I haue
 good leisure to wish for these things: so it shall be a longer time
 before it will be brought to passe. Neuerthelesse, as I will praie for
 a reformation in this behalfe, so will I here conclude this my
 discourse of the estate of our churches, and go in hand with the
 limits and bounds of our seuerall sees, in such order as they shall
 come vnto my present remembrance.




 OF THE NUMBER OF BISHOPRIKES AND THEIR SEUERALL CIRCUITS.

 CHAP. II.


 Hauing alreadie spoken generally of the state of our church, now will
 I touch the sees seuerallie, saieng so much of ech of them as shall be
 conuenient for the time, and not onelie out of the ancient, but also
 the later writers, and somewhat of mine owne experience, beginning
 first with the see of Canturburie, as the most notable, whose
 archbishop is the primat of all this land for ecclesiasticall
 iurisdiction, and most accompted of commonlie, bicause he is neerer to
 the prince, and readie at euerie call.

 [Sidenote: Canturburie.]
 The iurisdiction of Canturburie therefore, erected first by Augustine
 the moonke, in the time of Ethelbert king of Kent, if you haue respect
 to hir prouinciall regiment, extendeth it selfe ouer all the south and
 west parts of this Iland, and Ireland, as I haue noted in the chapter
 precedent, and few shires there are wherein the archbishop hath not
 some peculiars. But if you regard the same onelie that was and is
 proper vnto his see, from the beginning, it reacheth but ouer one
 parcell of Kent, which Rudburne calleth Cantwarland, the iurisdiction
 of Rochester including the rest: so that in this one countie the
 greatest archbishoprike and the least bishoprike of all are linked in
 togither. That of Canturburie hath vnder it one archdeaconrie, who
 hath iurisdiction ouer eleauen deanries or a hundred sixtie one parish
 churches; & in the popish time in sted of the 3093 pounds, eighteene
 shillings, halfepenie, farthing, which it now paieth vnto hir
 maiestie, vnder the name of first frutes, there went out of this see
 to Rome, at euerie alienation 10000 ducates or florens, beside 5000
 that the new elect did vsuallie paie for his pall, each ducat being
 then worth an English crowne or thereabout, as I haue beene informed.

 [Sidenote: Rochester.]
 The see of Rochester is also included within the limits of Kent, being
 erected by Augustine in the 604 of Grace, and reigne of Ceolrijc ouer
 the west-Saxons. The bishop of this see hath one archdeacon, vnder
 whose gouernment in causes ecclesiasticall are three deanries, or 132
 parish churches: so that hereby it is to be gathered, that there are
 393 parish churches in Kent, ouer which the said two archdeacons haue
 especiall cure & charge. He was woont to paie also vnto the court of
 Rome at his admission to that see 1300 ducats or florens, as I read,
 which was an hard valuation, considering the smalnesse of circuit
 belonging to his see. Howbeit, in my time it is so farre from ease by
 diminution, that it is raised to 1432 crownes, &c: or as we resolue
 them into our pounds, 358 pounds, three shillings, six pence,
 halfepennie, farthing, a reckoning a great deale more preciselie made
 than anie bishop of that see dooth take any great delight in. He was
 crosse-bearer in times past vnto the archbishop of Canturburie. And
 there are and haue beene few sees in England, which at one time or
 other haue not fetched their bishops for the most part from this see:
 for as it is of it selfe but a small thing in deed, so it is commonlie
 a preparatiue to an higher place. But of all that euer possessed it,
 Thomas Kempe had the best lucke, who being but a poore mans sonne of
 Wie (vnto which towne he was a great benefactor) grew first to be
 doctor of both lawes, then of diuinitie; and afterward being promoted
 to this see, he was translated from thence to Chichester, thirdlie to
 London, next of all to Yorke, and finallie after seauen and twentie
 yeares to Canturburie, where he became also cardinall, deacon, and
 then preest in the court of Rome, according to this verse, "Bis
 primas, ter praeses, bis cardine functus." Certes I note this man,
 bicause he bare some fauour to the furtherance of the gospell, and to
 that end he either builded or repared the pulpit in Paules churchyard,
 and tooke order for the continuall maintenance of a sermon there vpon
 the sabaoth, which dooth continue vnto my time, as a place from whence
 the soundest doctrine is alwaies to be looked for, and for such
 strangers to resort vnto as haue no habitation in anie parish within
 the citie where it standeth.

 [Sidenote: London.]
 The see of London was erected at the first by Lucius, who made it of
 an archeflamine and temple of Iupiter an archbishops see, and temple
 vnto the liuing God, and so it continued, vntill Augustine translated
 the title thereof to Canturburie. The names of the archbishops of
 London are these; Theon, Eluan, Cadoc, Owen, Conan, Palladius,
 Stephan, Iltutus restitutus, anno 350, Theodromus, Theodredus,
 Hilarius, Fastidius, anno 420, Guittelinus, Vodinus slaine by the
 Saxons, and Theonus Iunior. But for their iust order of succession as
 yet I am not resolued, neuerthelesse the first bishop there was
 ordeined by Augustine the moonke, in the yeare of Christ 604, in the
 time of Ceolrijc, after he had remooued his see further off into Kent:
 I wote not vpon what secret occasion, if not the speedie hearing of
 newes from Rome, and readinesse to flee out of the land, if any
 trouble should betide him. For iurisdiction it included Essex,
 Middlesex, and part of Herefordshire, which is neither more nor lesse
 in quantitie than the ancient kingdome of the east Angles, before it
 was vnited to the west Saxons. The cathedrall church belonging to this
 see, was first begun by Ethelbert of Kent, Indic. 1. 598 of Inuber as
 I find, whilest he held that part of the said kingdome vnder his
 gouernement. Afterward when the Danes had sundrie times defaced it, it
 was repared and made vp with hard stone, but in the end it was taken
 downe, and wholie reedified by Mawrice bishop of that see, and
 sometimes chapleine to the bastard Henrie the first, allowing him
 stone and stuffe from Bainards castell neere vnto Ludgate, then
 ruinous for the furtherance of his works. Howbeit the moold of the
 quire was not statelie inough in the eies of some of his successors;
 wherefore in the yeare of Grace 1256, it was taken downe and brought
 into another forme, and called the new worke, at which time also the
 bodies of diuerse kings and bishops were taken vp and bestowed in the
 walles, to the end their memories should be of longer continuance. The
 iurisdiction of this see also vnder the bishop, is committed to foure
 archdeacons, to wit, of London, Essex, Middlesex, and Colchester, who
 haue amongst them to the number of 363 parish churches, or
 thereabouts, beside the peculiars belonging to the archbishop and
 chapiter of that house, and at euerie alienation the bishop paieth for
 his owne part 1119 pounds, eight shillings and foure pence (but in old
 time 3000 florens) which diuerse suppose to be more, than (as it now
 standeth) the bishop is able to make of it. Of the archdeconrie, of S.
 Albons added therevnto by king Henrie the eight (whereby the bishop
 hath fiue eies) I speake not, for although it be vnder the bishop of
 London for visitations and synods, yet is it otherwise reputed as
 member of the see of Lincolne, and therefore worthilie called an
 exempt, it hath also fiue and twentie parishes, of which foure are in
 Buckingham, the rest in Herefordshire.

 [Sidenote: Chichester.]
 The first beginning of the see of Chichester was in the Ile of Seales
 or Seolseie, and from thence translated to Chichester, in the time of
 William the bastard, and generall remoouing of sees from small
 villages vnto the greater townes. It conteineth Sussex onelie vnder
 hir iurisdiction, wherein are sixteene deanries, and 551 parish
 churches, it paid at euerie alienation to the see of Rome 333 ducats:
 and after Edbert the first bishop, one Cella succeeded, after whome
 the pontificall chaire (not then worth 677 pounds by the yeere as now
 it is) was void by many yeares. It was erected in Seoleseie also 711,
 by the decree of a synod holden in Sussex, which borowed it from the
 iurisdiction of Winchester, whereof before it was reputed a parcell.
 Of all the bishops that haue beene in this see, Thomas Kempe alwaies
 excepted, I read not of anie one that hath beene of more estimation
 than William Read, sometime fellow of Merteine college in Oxford,
 doctor of diuinitie, and the most profound astronomer that liued in
 his time, as appeareth by his collection which sometime I did
 possesse; his image is yet in the librarie there, and manie
 instruments of astronomie reserued in that house (a college erected
 sometime by Walter Merton bishop of Rochester, and lord chancellor of
 England) he builded also the castell of Amberleie from the verie
 foundation, as Edward Scorie or Storie his successor did the new
 crosse in the market place of Chichester.

 [Sidenote: Winchester.]
 The bishop of Winchester was sometime called bishop of the west
 Saxons, and of Dorchester, which towne was giuen to Birinus and his
 successors, by Kinigils and Oswald of the Northumbers, in whose time
 it was erected by Birinus and his fellowes. In my time it hath
 iurisdiction onelie ouer Hamshire, Surrie, Iardeseie, Gardeseie, and
 the Wight, conteining eight deaneries, two hundred seuentie and six
 parish churches, and beside all this he is perpetuall prelate to the
 honorable order of the Garter, deuised by Edward the third: he paid in
 old time to Rome 12000 ducates or florens, but now his first fruits
 are 2491 pounds nine shillings eight pence halfe penie. Canturburie
 was said to be the higher racke, but Winchester hath borne the name to
 be the better mangier. There are also which make Lucius to be the
 first founder of an house of praier in Winchester, as Kinigils did
 build the second, and Kinwaldus his sonne the third; but you shall see
 the truth herof in the chronologie insuing. And herevnto if the old
 catalog of the bishops of this see be well considered of, and the acts
 of the greatest part of them indifferentlie weighed, as they are to be
 read in our histories, you shall find the most egregious hypocrites,
 the stoutest warriours, the cruellest tyrants, the richest
 monimoongers, and politike counsellors in temporall affaires to haue,
 I wote not by what secret working of the diuine prouidence, beene
 placed here in Winchester, since the foundation of that see, which was
 erected by Birinus 639 (whome pope Honorius sent hither out of Italie)
 and first planted at Dorchester, in the time of Kinigils, then
 translated to Winchester, where it dooth yet continue.

 [Sidenote: Salisburie.]
 Salisburie was made the cheefe see of Shirburne by bishop Harman
 (predecessor to Osmond) who brought it from Shirburne to that citie;
 it hath now Barkeshire, Wilshire, and Dorsetshire vnder hir
 iurisdiction. For after the death of Hedda, which was 704, Winchester
 was diuided in two, so that onelie Hamshire and Surrie were left vnto
 it, and Wilton, Dorset, Barkeshire, Summerset, Deuon & Cornewill
 assigned vnto Shirburne till other order was taken. Bishop Adeline did
 first sit in that bishoprike (704 as I said) and placed his chaire at
 Shirburne vpon the said diuision. And as manie lerned bishops did
 succeed him in that roome, before and after it was remooued to Sarum;
 so there was neuer a more noble ornament to that see than bishop
 Iuell, of whose great learning and iudgement the world it selfe
 beareth witnesse, notwithstanding that the papists prefer S. Osmond
 (as they call him) because he builded the minster there, and made the
 portesse called Ordinale ecclesiastici officij, which old preests were
 woont to vse. The bishops also of this see were sometimes called
 bishops of Sunning, of their old mansion house neere vnto Reading (as
 it should seeme) and among those that liued before the said Iuell, one
 Roger builded the castell of the Vies in the time of Henrie the first,
 taken in those daies for the strongest hold in England, as vnto whose
 gate there were regals and gripes for six or seuen port cullises.
 Finallie this see paid vnto Rome 4000 florens, but vnto hir maiestie
 in my time 1367 pounds twelue shillings eight pence, as I did find of
 late.

 [Sidenote: Excester.]
 Excester hath, Deuonshire and Cornewall, sometime two seuerall
 bishopriks, but in the end brought into one of Cornewall, and from
 thence to Excester in the time of the Bastard or soone after. It began
 vpon this occasion, Anno Gratiae 905, in a prouinciall councell holden
 by the elder Edward & Plegimond archbishop of Canturburie, among the
 Gewises, wherein it was found, that the see of Winchester had not
 onelie beene without hir pastor by the space of seuen yeeres, but also
 that hir iurisdiction was farre greater than two men were able well to
 gouerne; therefore from the former two, to wit, Winchester and
 Shirburne, three other were taken, whereby that see was now diuided
 into fiue parts; the latter three being Welles, Kirton, and Cornwall:
 this of Cornwall hauing hir see then at saint Patroks, not farre from
 north-Wales vpon the riuer Helmouth: he of Deuon holding his
 iurisdiction in Deuonshire, Kirton, or Cridioc. And the bishop of
 Welles being allowed Dorset and Barkshires for his part, to gouerne
 and looke vnto according to his charge. Finallie, these two of Deuon
 and Cornwall being vnited, the valuation thereof was taxed by the see
 of Rome at six thousand ducats or florens, which were trulie paid at
 euerie alienation; but verie hardlie (as I gesse) sith that in my
 time, wherein all things are racked to the verie vttermost, I find
 that it is litle worth aboue fiue hundred pounds by the yeere, bicause
 hir tenths are but fiftie.

 [Sidenote: Bath.]
 Bath, whose see was sometime at Welles, before Iohn the bishop there
 annexed the church of Bath vnto it, which was 1094, hath
 Summersetshire onlie, and the valuation thereof in the court of Rome
 was foure hundred & thirtie florens: but in hir maiesties books I find
 it fiue hundred thirtie and three pounds, and about one od shilling:
 which declareth a precise examination of the estate of that see. Of
 the erection of this bishoprike, mentioned in the discourse of
 Excester, I find the former assertion confirmed by another author, and
 in somewhat more large maner, which I will also remember, onelie
 because it pleaseth me somewhat better than the words before alleged
 out of the former writer. This bishoprike (saith he) was erected 905,
 in a councell holden among the Gewises, whereat king Edward of the
 west-Saxons, and Plegimond archbishop of Canturburie were present. For
 that part of the countrie had beene seuen yeeres without anie
 pastorall cure. And therfore in this councell it was agreed, that for
 [Sidenote: The bishoprike of Shirburne diuided into three.]
 the two bishoprikes (whereof one was at Winchester, another at
 Shireburne) there should be fiue ordeined, whereby the people there
 might be the better instructed. By this meanes Frithstan was placed at
 Winchester, and Ethelme at Shireburne, both of them being then void.
 Shireburne also susteined the subdiuision; so that Werstane was made
 bishop of Cridioc or Deuonshire (whose see was at Kirton), Herstan of
 Cornwall, and Eadulfe of Welles, vnto whome Barkshire and Dorsetshire
 were appointed. But now you see what alteration is made, by
 consideration of the limits of their present iurisdictions.

 [Sidenote: Worcester.]
 Worcester sometime called Episcopatus Wicciorum (that is, the
 bishoprike of the Wiccies or Huiccies) hath Worcester, & part of
 Warwikeshires. And before the bishoprike of Glocester was taken out of
 the same, it paid to the pope two thousand ducats of gold at euerie
 change of prelat: but now the valuation thereof is one thousand fortie
 nine pounds, seauen pence halfe penie farthing (except my remembrance
 doo deceiue me.) This see was begunne either in, or not long before
 the time of Offa king of the east-Angles, and Boselus was the first
 bishop there; after whome succeeded Ostfort, then Egwine who went in
 pilgrimage to Rome, with Kinredus of Mercia and the said Offa, and
 there gat a monasterie (which he builded in Worcester) confirmed by
 Constantine the pope. In this see was one of your lordships ancestors
 sometime bishop, whose name was Cobham, and doctor both of diuinitie
 and of the canon law, who, during the time of his pontificalitie
 there, builded the vault of the north side of the bodie of the church,
 and there lieth buried in the same (as I haue beene informed.) Certes
 this man was once elected, and should haue beene archbishop of
 Canturburie in the roome of Reginald that died 1313 vnder Edward the
 second: but the pope frustrated his election, fearing least he would
 haue shewed himselfe more affectionate towards his prince than to his
 court of Rome; wherefore he gaue Canturburie to the bishop of
 Worcester then being. And furthermore, least he should seeme
 altogither to reiect the said Thomas and displease the king, he gaue
 him in the end the bishoprike of Worcester, whereinto he entred 1317,
 Martij 31, being thursdaie (as appeereth by the register of that
 house) after long plee holden for the aforesaid see of Canturburie in
 the court of Rome, wherein most monie did oftenest preuaile. This is
 also notable of that see, that fiue Italians succeeded ech other in
 the same, by the popes prouision; as Egidius, Syluester, Egidius his
 nephue (for nephues might say in those daies; Father shall I call you
 vncle? And vncles also; Son I must call thee nephue) Iulius de
 Medices, afterward pope Clement, and Hieronymus de Nugutijs, men verie
 likelie, no doubt, to benefit the common people by their doctrine.
 Some of these being at the first but poore men in Rome, and yet able
 by selling all they had to make a round summe against a rainie daie,
 came first into fauor with the pope, then into familiaritie, finallie
 into orders; and from thence into the best liuings of the church,
 farre off where their parentage could not easilie be heard of, nor
 made knowne vnto their neighbours.

 [Sidenote: Glocester.]
 Glocester hath Glocestershire onelie, wherein are nine deanries, and
 to the number of 294 parish churches, as I find by good record. But it
 neuer paid anie thing to Rome, bicause it was erected by king Henrie
 the eight, after he had abolished the vsurped authoritie of the pope,
 except in queene Maries, if anie such thing were demanded, as I doubt
 not but it was: yet is it woorth yeerelie 315 pounds, seauen shillings
 three pence, as the booke of first fruits declareth.

 [Sidenote: Hereford.]
 Hereford hath Herefordshire and part of Shropshire, and it paid to
 Rome at euerie alienation 1800 ducats at the least, but in my time it
 paieth vnto hir maiesties cofers 768 pounds, ten shillings, ten pence,
 halfe penie, farthing. In this see there was a bishop sometime called
 Iohn Bruton, vpon whome the king then reigning, by likelihood for want
 of competent maintenance, bestowed the keeping of his wardrobe, which
 he held long time with great honour, as his register saith. A
 woonderfull preferment that bishops should be preferred from the
 pulpit, to the custodie of wardrobes: but such was the time.
 Neuerthelesse his honorable custodie of that charge is more solemnlie
 remembred, than anie good sermon that euer he made, which function
 peraduenture he committed to his suffragane, sith bishops in those
 daies had so much businesse in the court, that they could not attend
 to doctrine and exhortation.

 [Sidenote: Lichfield.]
 Lichefield, wherevnto Couentrie was added, in the time of Henrie the
 first, at the earnest sute of Robert bishop of that see, hath
 Staffordshire, Darbishire, part of Shropshire, and the rest of
 Warwikeshire, that is void of subiection to the see of Worcestershire.
 It was erected in the time of Peada king of the south Mercians, which
 laie on this side the Trent, and therein one Dinas was installed,
 about the yeare of Grace 656, after whom Kellac first, then Tunher an
 Englishman succeeded, this later being well learned, and consecrated
 by the Scots. In the time of the bastard, I wot not vpon what
 occasion, one Peter bishop of this see translated his chaire to
 Chester, and there held it for a season, whereby it came to passe that
 the bishops of Lichfield were for a while called bishops of Chester.
 But Robert his successor not likeing of this president, remooued his
 chaire from Chester to Couentrie, and there held it whilest he liued,
 whereby the originall diuision of the bishoprike of Lichfield into
 Lichefield, Chester, and Couentrie, dooth easilie appeare, although in
 my time Lichfield and Couentrie be vnited, and Chester remaineth a
 bishoprike by it selfe. It paid the pope at euerie alienation 1733
 florens, or (as some old bookes haue) 3000, a good round summe, but
 not without a iust punishment, as one saith, sith that anno 765,
 Edulfe bishop there vnder Offa king of Mercia, would by his helpe haue
 bereaued the archbishop of Canturburie of his pall, & so did in deed
 vnder pope Hadrian, holding the same vntill things were reduced vnto
 their ancient forme. Before the time also of bishop Langton, the
 prebends of this see laie here and there abroad in the citie, where
 the vicars also had an house, of which this honest bishop misliked not
 a little for sundrie causes; wherefore he began their close, and
 bestowed so much in building the same, and pauing the streets, that
 his hungrie kinsmen did not a little grudge at his expenses, thinking
 that his emptie cofers would neuer make them gentlemen, for which
 preferment the freends of most bishops gaped earnestlie in those
 daies. King Iohn was the greatest benefactor vnto this see, next vnto
 Offa; and it is called Lichfield, Quasi mortuorum campus, bicause of
 the great slaughter of christians made there (as some write) vnder
 Dioclesian. Howbeit in my time the valuation thereof is 703 pounds,
 fiue shillings two pence, halfepenie, farthing, a summe verie
 narrowlie cast by that auditor which tooke it first in hand.

 Oxford hath Oxfordshire onelie, a verie yoong iurisdiction, erected by
 king Henrie the eight, & where in the time of queene Marie, one
 Goldwell was bishop, who (as I remember) was a Iesuit, dwelling in
 Rome, and more conuersant (as the constant fame went) in the blacke
 art, than skilfull in the scriptures, and yet he was of great
 countenance amongst the Romane monarchs. It is said that obseruing the
 canons of his order, he regarded not the temporalities of that see:
 but I haue heard since that he wist well inough what became of those
 commodities, for by one meane and other he found the sweetnesse of 354
 pounds sixteene shillings three pence halfe penie, yearelie growing to
 him, which was euen inough (if not too much) for the maintenance of a
 frier toward the drawing out of circles, characters, & lineaments of
 imagerie, wherein he was passing skilfull, as the fame then went in
 Rome, and not vnheard of in Oxford.

 [Sidenote: Elie.]
 Elie hath Cambridgshire, and the Ile of Elie. It was erected 1109 by
 Henrie the first, being before a rich and wealthie abbeie. One Heruie
 also was made bishop there, as I haue found in a register, belonging
 sometime to that house being translated from Bangor. Finallie it paid
 to the pope at euerie alienation 7000 ducats, as the registers there
 do testifie at large. Albeit that in my time I find a note of 2134
 pounds sixteene shillings three pence halfe penie farthing, whose
 disme ioined to those of all the bishopriks in England, doo yeeld
 yearelie to hir maiesties coffers 23370 pounds sixteene shillings
 three pence halfe penie farthing: whereby also the huge sums of monie
 going out of this land to the court of Rome dooth in some measure
 appeere. Ethelwold afterward bishop of Winchester builded the first
 monasterie of Elie vpon the ruines of a nunrie then in the kings
 hands, howbeit the same house, whereof he himselfe was abbat, was yer
 long destroied by enimies, and he in lieu of his old preferment
 rewarded by king Edgar, with the aforesaid bishoprike, from whence
 with more than lionlike boldnesse he expelled the secular preests, and
 stored with moonkes prouided from Abandune neere Oxford, by the helpe
 of Edgar and Dunstane then metropolitane of England. There was
 sometime a greeuous contention betweene Thomas Lild bishop of this
 see, and the king of England, about the yeare of Grace 1355, which I
 will here deliuer out of an old record, because the matter is so
 parciallie penned by some of the brethren of that house, in fauour of
 the bishop; & for that I was also abused with the same in the entrance
 thereof at the first into my chronologie. The blacke prince fauoring
 one Robert Stretton his chapleine, a man vnlearned and not worthie the
 name of a clearke, the matter went on so farre, that what for loue,
 and somewhat else, of a canon of Lichfield he was chosen bishop of
 that see. Herevpon the pope vnderstanding what he was by his Nuncio
 here in England, staied his consecration by his letters for a time,
 and in the meane season committed his examination to the archbishop of
 Canturburie, and the bishop of Rochester, who felt and dealt so
 fauourablie with him in golden reasoning, that his worthinesse was
 commended to the popes holinesse, & to Rome he goeth. Being come to
 Rome the pope himselfe apposed him, and after secret conference
 vtterlie disableth his election, till he had prooued by substantiall
 argument and of great weight before him also, that he was not so
 lightlie to be reiected. Which kind of reasoning so well pleased his
 holinesse, that Ex mera plenitudine potestatis, he was made capable of
 the benefice and so returneth into England; when he came home, this
 bishop being in the kings presence told him how he had doone he wist
 not what in preferring so vnmeet a man vnto so high a calling. With
 which speach the king was so offended, that he commanded him out of
 hand to auoid out of his presence. In like sort the ladie Wake then
 duchesse of Lancaster, standing by, and hearing the king hir cousine
 to gather vp the bishop so roundlie, and thereto an old grudge against
 him for some other matter, dooth presentlie picke a quarrell against
 him about certeine lands then in his possession, which he defended &
 in the end obteined against hir by plee and course of law: yer long
 [Sidenote: * sic. qu. _a fire_]
 also [*]afore hapned in a part of hir house, for which she accused the
 bishop, and in the end by verdict of twelue men found that he was
 priuie vnto the fact of his men in the said fact, wherfore he was
 condemned in nine hundred pounds damages, which he paid euerie penie.

 Neuerthelesse, being sore grieued, that she had (as he said) wrested
 out such a verdict against him, and therein packed vp a quest at hir
 owne choise: he taketh his horsse, goeth to the court, and there
 complaineth to the king of his great iniurie receiued at hir hands.
 But in the deliuerie of his tale, his speech was so blockish, & termes
 so euill fauoredlie (though maliciouslie) placed, that the king tooke
 yet more offense with him than before; insomuch that he led him with
 him into the parlement house, for then was that court holden, and
 there before the lords accused him of no small misdemeanor toward his
 person by his rude and threatening speeches. But the bishop egerlie
 denieth the kings obiections, which he still auoucheth vpon his honor;
 and in the end confirmeth his allegations by witnesse: wherevpon he is
 banished from the kings presence during his naturall life by verdict
 of that house. In the meane time the duchesse hearing what was doone,
 she beginneth a new to be dealing with him: and in a brabling fraie
 betweene their seruants one of hir men was slaine, for which he was
 called before the magistrat, as chiefe accessarie vnto the fact. But
 he fearing the sequele of his third cause by his successe had in the
 two first, hideth himselfe after he had sold all his moouables, and
 committed the monie vnto his trustie friends. And being found giltie
 by the inquest, the king seizeth vpon his possessions, and calleth vp
 the bishop to answer vnto the trespasse. To be short, vpon
 safe-conduct the bishop commeth to the kings presence, where he
 denieth that he was accessarie to the fact, either before, at, or
 after the deed committed, and therevpon craueth to be tried by his
 peeres. But this petition was in vaine: for sentence passeth against
 him also by the kings owne mouth. Wherevpon he craueth helpe of the
 archbishop of Canturburie and priuileges of the church, hoping by such
 meanes to be solemnlie rescued. But they fearing the kings
 displeasure, who bare small fauour to the clergie of his time, gaue
 ouer to vse anie such meanes; but rather willed him to submit himselfe
 vnto the kings mercie which he refused, standing vpon his innocencie
 from the first vnto the last. Finallie, growing into choler, that the
 malice of a woman should so preuaile against him, he writeth to Rome,
 requiring that his case might be heard there, as a place wherein
 greater iustice (saith he) is to be looked for than to be found in
 England. Vpon the perusall of these his letters also, his accusers
 were called thither. But for so much as they appeered not at their
 peremptorie times, they were excommunicated. Such of them also as died
 before their reconciliations were taken out of the churchyards, and
 buried in the fields and doong-hilles, "Vnde timor & turba (saith my
 note) in Anglia." For the king inhibited the bringing in and receipt
 of all processes, billes, and whatsoeuer instruments should come from
 Rome: such also as aduentured contrarie to this prohibition to bring
 them in, were either dismembred of some ioint, or hanged by the necks.
 Which rage so incensed the pope, that he wrote in verie vehement maner
 to the king of England, threatening far greater cursses, except he did
 the sooner staie the furie of the lady, reconcile himself vnto the
 bishop, and finallie, making him amends for all his losses susteined
 in these broiles. Long it was yer the king would be brought to peace.
 Neuerthelesse, in the end he wrote to Rome about a reconciliation to
 be had betweene them: but yer all things were concluded, God himselfe
 did end the quarrell, by taking awaie the bishop. And thus much out of
 an old pamphlet in effect word for word: but I haue somewhat framed
 the forme of the report after the order that Stephan Birchington dooth
 deliuer it, who also hath the same in manner as I deliuer it.

 [Sidenote: Norwich.]
 The see of Norwich called in old time Episcopatus Donnicensis,
 Dononiae, or Eastanglorum, was erected at Felstow or Felixstow, where
 Felix of Burgundie (sometime schoolemaster to Sigebert of the
 east-Angles, by whose persuasion also the said Sigebert erected the
 vniuersitie at Cambridge) being made bishop of the east-Angles first
 placed his see, afterward it was remooued from thence to Donwich, &
 thence to Helmham, Anno 870, about the death of Celnothus of
 Canturburie; thirdlie, to Theodford, or Thetford; & finallie, after
 the time of the Bastard, to Norwich. For iurisdiction it conteineth in
 our daies Norffolke and Suffolke onelie, whereas at the first it
 included Cambridgeshire also, and so much as laie within the kingdome
 of the east-Angles. It began about the yeere 632, vnder Cerpenwald
 king of the east-Saxons, who bestowed it vpon Felix, whome pope
 Honorius also confirmed, and after which he held it by the space of
 seauenteene yeeres. It paid sometimes at euerie alienation 5000 ducats
 to Rome. But in my time hir maiestie hath 899 pounds, 8 shillings 7
 pence farthing, as I haue been informed. In the same iurisdiction also
 there were once 1563 parish churches, and 88 religious houses: but in
 our daies I can not heare of more churches than 1200: and yet of these
 I know one conuerted into a barne, whilest the people heare seruice
 further off vpon a greene: their bell also when I heard a sermon there
 preached in the greene, hanged in an oke for want of a steeple. But
 now I vnderstand that the oke likewise is gone. There is neuerthelesse
 a litle chappellet hard by on that common, but nothing capable of the
 multitude of Ashlie towne that should come to the same in such wise,
 if they did repaire thither as they ought.

 [Sidenote: Peterborow.]
 Peterborow, sometimes a notable monasterie, hath Northampton and
 Rutland shires vnder hir iurisdiction, a diocesse erected also by king
 Henrie the eight. It neuer paid first fruits to the pope before queene
 Maries daies (if it were then deliuered) wherof I doubt, because it
 was not recorded in his ancient register of tenths and fruits,
 although peraduenture the collectors left it not vngathered, I wot not
 for what purpose; it yeeldeth now foure hundred and fiftie pounds, one
 penie abated. I haue seene and had an ancient iarror of the lands of
 this monasterie, which agreeth verie well with the historie of Hugo le
 Blanc monke of that house. In the charter also of donation annexed to
 the same, I saw one of Wulfhere king of Mercia, signed with his owne,
 & the marks of Sigher king of Sussex, Sebbie of Essex, with the
 additions of their names: the rest of the witnesses also insued in
 this order:

   Ethelred brother to Wulfehere,
   Kindburg and Kindswith sisters to Wulfhere,
   Deusdedit archbishop,
   Ithamar bishop of Rochester,
   Wina bishop of London,
   Iarnman bishop of Mearc,
   Wilfride and Eoppa preests,
   Saxulfe the abbat.

 Then all the earles and eldermen of England in order; and after all
 these, the name of pope Agatho, who confirmed the instrument at the
 sute of Wilfride archbishop of Yorke, in a councell holden at Rome
 680, of a hundred & fiue and twentie bishops, wherein also these
 churches were appropriated to the said monasterie, to wit, Breding,
 Reping, Cedenac, Swinesheued, Lusgerd, Edelminglond, and Barchaing:
 whereby we haue in part an euident testimonie how long the practise of
 appropriation of benefices hath beene vsed to the hinderance of the
 gospell, and maintenance of idle moonks, an humane inuention grounded
 vpon hypocrisie.

 [Sidenote: Bristow.]
 Bristow hath Dorsetshire sometime belonging to Salisburie, a see also
 latelie erected by king Henrie the eight, who tooke no small care for
 the church of Christ, and therefore eased a number of ancient sees of
 some part of their huge and ouer-large circuits, and bestowed those
 portions deducted, vpon such other erections as he had appointed for
 the better regiment and feeding of the flocke: the value thereof is
 three hundred foure score and three pounds, eight shillings, and foure
 pence (as I haue beene informed.)

 [Sidenote: Lincolne.]
 Lincolne of all other of late times was the greatest; and albeit that
 out of it were taken the sees of Oxford and Peterborow, yet it still
 reteineth Lincolne, Leicester, Huntingdon, Bedford, Buckingham shires,
 and the rest of Hertford; so that it extendeth from the Thames vnto
 the Humber, and paid vnto the pope fiue thousand ducats (as appeereth
 by his note) at euerie alienation. In my time, and by reason of hir
 diminution it yeeldeth a tribute to whom tribute belongeth, of the
 valuation of eight hundred ninetie and nine pounds, eight shillings,
 seauen pence farthing. It began since the conquest, about the
 beginning of William Rufus, by one Remigius, who remooued his see from
 Dorchester to Lincolne (not without licence well paid for vnto the
 king.) And thus much of the bishopriks which lie within Lhoegres or
 England, as it was left vnto Locrinus. Now it followeth that I proceed
 with Wales.

 [Sidenote: Landaffe.]
 Landaffe, or the church of Taw hath ecclesiasticall iurisdiction in
 Glamorgan, Monmouth, Brechnoch, and Radnor shires. And although it
 paid seuen hundred ducats at euerie exchange of prelat; yet is it
 scarselie worth one hundred fiftie and fiue pounds by the yeare (as I
 haue heard reported.) Certes it is a poore bishoprike, & (as I haue
 heard) the late incumbent thereof being called for not long since by
 the lord president in open court made answer. The daffe is here, but
 the land is gone. What he meant by it I can not well tell; but I hope,
 that in the seed time and the free planting of the gospell, the meate
 of the labourer shall not be diminished and withdrawen.

 [Sidenote: S. Dauids.]
 S. Dauids hath Penbroke and Caermardine shires, whose liuerie or first
 fruits to the see of Rome was one thousand and fiue hundred ducats, at
 the hardest (as I thinke.) For if record be of anie sufficient credit,
 it is little aboue the value of foure hundred fiftie and seauen
 pounds, one shilling, and ten pence farthing, in our time, and so it
 paieth vnto hir maiesties coffers; but in time past I thinke it was
 farre better. The present bishop misliketh verie much of the cold
 situation of his cathedrall church; and therfore he would gladlie pull
 it downe, and set it in a warmer place: but it would first be learned
 what suertie he would put in to see it well performed: of the rest I
 speake not.

 [Sidenote: Bangor.]
 Bangor is in north-Wales, and hath Caernaruon, Angleseie, and
 Merioneth shires vnder hir iurisdiction. It paid to Rome 126 ducats,
 which is verie much. For of all the bishoprikes in England it is now
 the least for reuenues, and not woorth aboue one hundred and one and
 thirtie pounds, and sixteene pence to hir maiesties coffers at euerie
 alienation (as appeereth by the tenths, which amount to much lesse
 than those of some good benefice) for it yeeldeth not yeerelie aboue
 thirteene pounds, three shillings, and seauen pence halfe penie, as by
 that court is manifest.

 [Sidenote: S. Asaphes.]
 S. Asaphes hath Prestholme and part of Denbigh and Flintshires vnder
 hir iurisdiction in causes ecclesiasticall, which being laid togither
 doo amount to little more than one good countie, and therefore in
 respect of circuit the least that is to be found in Wales,
 neuerthelesse it paid to Rome 470 ducates at euerie alienation. In my
 time the first fruits of this bishoprike came vnto 187 pounds eleuen
 shillings six pence; wherby it seemeth to be somewhat better than
 Landaffe or Bangor last remembred. There is one Howell a gentleman of
 Flintshire in the compasse of this iurisdiction, who is bound to giue
 an harpe of siluer yearelie to the best harper in Wales, but did anie
 bishop thinke you deserue that in the popish time? Howell or Aphowell
 in English is all one (as I haue heard) and signifie so much as Hugo
 or Hugh. Hitherto of the prouince of Canturburie, for so much therof
 as now lieth within the compasse of this Iland. Now it resteth that I
 proceed with the curtailed archbishoprike of Yorke, I saie curtailed
 because all Scotland is cut from his iurisdiction and obedience.

 [Sidenote: Yorke.]
 The see of Yorke was restored about the yeare of Grace 625, which
 after the comming of the Saxons laie desolate and neglected, howbeit
 at the said time Iustus archbishop of Canturburie ordeined Paulinus to
 be first bishop there, in the time of Gadwijn king of Northumberland.
 This Paulinus sate six yeares yer he was driuen from thence, & after
 whose expulsion that seat was void long time, wherby Lindesfarne grew
 into credit, and so remained vntill the daies of Oswie of
 Northumberland, who sent Wilfred the priest ouer into France, there to
 be consecrated archbishop of Yorke: but whilest he taried ouer long in
 those parts, Oswie impatient of delaie preferred Ceadda or Chad to
 that roome, who held it three yeares, which being expired Wilfred
 recouered his roome, and held it as he might, vntill it was seuered in
 two, to wit, Yorke, Hagulstade, or Lindesfarne, where Eata was placed,
 at which time also Egfride was made bishop of Lincolne or Lindsie in
 that part of Mercia which he had goten from Woolfhere. Of it selfe it
 hath now iurisdiction ouer Yorkeshire, Notinghamshire (whose shire
 towne I meane the new part thereof with the bridge was builded by king
 Edward the first surnamed the elder before the conquest) and the rest
 of Lancastershire onelie not subiect to the see of Chester; and when
 the pope bare authoritie in this realme, it paid vnto his see 1000
 ducates, beside 5000 for the pall of the new elect, which was more
 than he could well spare of late, considering the curtailing &
 diminution of his see, thorough the erection of a new metropolitane in
 Scotland, but in my time it yeeldeth 1609 pounds nineteene shillings
 two pence to hir maiestie, whom God long preserue vnto vs to his
 glorie, hir comfort, and our welfares.

 [Sidenote: Chester.]
 Chester vpon Dee, otherwise called Westchester, hath vnder hir
 iurisdiction in causes ecclesiasticall, Chestershire, Darbishire, the
 most part of Lancastershire (to wit vnto the Ribell) Richmond and a
 part of Flint and Denbigh shires in Wales, was made a bishoprike by
 king H. 8. anno regni 33. Iulij 16, and so hath continued since that
 time, being valued 420 pounds by the yeare beside od twentie pence (a
 streict reckoning) as the record declareth.

 [Sidenote: Durham.]
 Durham hath the countie of Durham and Northumberland with the Dales
 onelie vnder hir iurisdiction, and hereof the bishops haue sometimes
 beene earles palantines & ruled the rost vnder the name of the
 bishoprike and succession of S. Cuthbert. It was a see (in mine
 opinion) more profitable of late vnto hir maiesties coffers by 221
 pounds eighteene shillings ten pence farthing, and yet of lesse
 countenance than hir prouinciall, neuertheles the sunneshine thereof
 (as I heare) is now somewhat eclipsed and not likelie to recouer the
 light, for this is not a time wherein the church may looke to increase
 in hir estate. I heare also that some other flitches haue forgone the
 like collops, but let such matters be scanned by men of more
 discretion. Capgraue saith how that the first bishop of this see was
 called bishop of Lindseie (or Lincolne) & that Ceadda laie in
 Liechfield of the Mercians in a mansion house neere the church. But
 this is more worthie to be remembred, that Cuthred of the Northumbers,
 and Alfred of the West-saxons bestowed all the land betweene the These
 & the Tine now called the bishoprike vpon S. Cuthbert, beside
 whatsoeuer belonged to the see of Hagulstade. Edgar of Scotland also
 in the time of the Bastard gaue Coldingham and Berwike withall their
 appurtenances to that house; but whether these donations be extant or
 no as yet I cannot tell. Yet I thinke not but that Leland had a sight
 of them, from whome I had this ground. But whatsoeuer this bishoprike
 be now, in externall & outward apparance, sure it is that it paid in
 old time 9000 ducates at euerie alienation to Rome, as the record
 expresseth. Aidan a Scot or Irishman was the first bishop of this see,
 who held himselfe (as did manie of his successors) at Colchester and
 in Lindesfarne Ile, till one came that remooued it to Durham. And now
 iudge you whether the allegation of Capgraue be of anie accompt or
 not.

 [Sidenote: Caerleill.]
 Caerleill was erected 1132 by Henrie the first, and hereof one
 Ethelwoolfe confessor to Osmond bishop of Sarum was made the first
 bishop, hauing Cumberland & Westmerland assigned to his share; of the
 deaneries and number of parish churches conteined in the same as yet I
 haue no knowledge, more than of manie other. Howbeit hereof I am sure,
 that notwithstanding the present valuation be risen to 531 pounds
 foureteene shillings eleuen pence halfe penie, the pope receiued out
 of it but 1000 florens, and might haue spared much more, as an
 aduersarie thereto confessed sometime euen before the pope himselfe,
 supposing no lesse than to haue gained by his tale, and so
 peraduenture should haue doone, if his platforme had taken place. But
 as wise men oft espie the practises of flatteries, so the pope saw to
 what end this profitable speach was vttered. As touching Caerleill it
 selfe it was sometime sacked by the Danes, and eftsoones repared by
 William Rufus, & planted with a colonie of southerne men. I suppose
 that in old time it was called Cairdoill. For in an ancient booke
 which I haue seene, and yet haue, intituled, Liber formularum
 literarum curiae Romanae, octo capitulorum, episcopatus Cardocensis. And
 thus much generallie of the names and numbers of our bishoprikes of
 England, whose tenths in old time yearelie amounting vnto 21111
 pounds, twelue shillings one penie halfe penie farthing, of currant
 monie in those daies, doo euidentlie declare, what store of coine was
 transported out of the land vnto the papall vses, in that behalfe
 onelie.

 Certes I take this not to be one quarter of his gaines gotten by
 England in those daies, for such commodities were raised by his courts
 holden here, so plentifullie gat he by his perquisits, as elections,
 procurations, appeales, preuentions, pluralities, tot quots,
 trialities, tollerations, legitimations, bulles, seales, preests,
 concubines, eating of flesh and white meats, dispensations for
 mariages, & times of celebration, Peter pence, and such like
 faculties, that not so little as 1200000 pounds went yearelie from
 hence to Rome. And therefore no maruell though he seeke much in these
 daies to reduce vs to his obedience. But what are the tenths of
 England (you will saie) in comparison of all those of Europe. For
 notwithstanding that manie good bishoprikes latelie erected be left
 out of his old bookes of record, which I also haue seene, yet I find
 neuertheles that the whole sum of them amounted to not aboue 61521
 pounds as monie went 200 yeares before my time, of which portion poore
 saint Peter did neuer heare, of so much as one graie grote. Marke
 therfore I praie you whether England were not fullie answerable to a
 third part of the rest of his tenths ouer all Europe, and therevpon
 tell me whether our Iland was one of the best paire of bellowes or
 not, that blue the fire in his kitchen, wherewith to make his pot
 seeth, beside all other commodities.

 [Sidenote: Man.]
 Beside all these, we haue another bishoprike yet in England almost
 slipped out of my remembrance, because it is verie obscure, for that
 the bishop thereof hath not wherewith to mainteine his countenance
 sufficientlie, and that is the see of Mona or Man, somtime named
 Episcopatus Sodorensis, whereof one Wimundus was ordeined the first
 bishop, and Iohn the second, in the troublesome time of king Stephan.
 The gift of this prelacie resteth in the earles of Darbie, who
 nominate such a one from time to time therto as to them dooth seeme
 conuenient. Howbeit if that see did know and might reape hir owne
 commodities, and discerne them from other mens possessions (for it is
 supposed that the mother hath deuoured the daughter) I doubt not but
 the state of hir bishop would quicklie be amended. Hauing therefore
 called this later see after this maner vnto mind, I suppose that I
 haue sufficientlie discharged my dutie concerning the state of our
 bishoprike, and maner how the ecclesiasticall iurisdiction of the
 church of England is diuided among the shires and counties of this
 realme. Whose bishops as they haue beene heretofore of lesse learning,
 and yet of greater port & dooings in the common-wealth, than at this
 present, so are they now for the most part the best learned that are
 to be found in anie countrie of Europe, sith neither high parentage,
 nor great riches (as in other countries) but onelie learning and
 vertue, commended somewhat by freendship, doo bring them to this
 honour.

 I might here haue spoken more at large of diuerse other bishopriks,
 sometime in this part of the Iland, as of that of Caerlheon tofore
 ouerthrowen by Edelfred in the behalfe of Augustine the moonke (as
 Malmesburie saith) where Dubritius gouerned, which was afterward
 translated to S. Dauids, and taken for an archbishoprike: secondlie of
 the bishoprike of Leircester called Legerensis, whose fourth bishop
 (Vnwon) went to Rome with Offa king of Mercia: thirdlie of Ramsbirie
 [Sidenote: Gloucester's verie ancient bishoprike.]
 or Wiltun, and of Glocester (of which you shall read in Matth. Westm.
 489) where the bishop was called Eldad: also of Hagulstade, one of the
 members whereinto the see of Yorke was diuided after the expulsion of
 Wilfrid. For (as I read) when Egfrid the king had driuen him awaie, he
 diuided his see into two parts, making Bosa ouer the Deiranes that
 held his see at Hagulstade, or Lindfarne: and Eatta ouer the
 Bernicians, who sate at Yorke: and thereto placing Edhedus ouer
 Lindseie (as is afore noted) whose successors were Ethelwine, Edgar,
 and Kinibert, notwithstanding that one Sexulfus was ouer Lindseie
 before Edhedus, who was bishop of the Mercians and middle England,
 till he was banished from Lindseie, and came into those quarters to
 seeke his refuge and succour.

 I could likewise intreat of the bishops of Whiteherne, or Ad Candidam
 Casam, an house with the countrie wherein it stood belonging to the
 prouince of Northumberland, but now a parcell of Scotland; also of the
 erection of the late see at Westminster by Henrie the eight. But as
 the one so the other is ceased, and the lands of this later either so
 diuided or exchanged for worse tenures, that except a man should see
 it with his eies, & point out with his finger where euerie parcell of
 them is bestowed, but a few men would beleeue what is become of the
 same. I might likewise and with like ease also haue added the
 successors of the bishops of euerie see to this discourse of their
 cathedrall churches and places of abode, but it would haue extended
 this treatise to an vnprofitable length. Neuerthelesse I will remember
 the fame of London my natiue citie, after I haue added one word more
 of the house called Ad Candidam Casam, in English Whiteherne, which
 taketh denomination of the white stone wherwith it was builded, and
 was seene far off as standing vpon an hill to such as did behold it.

 the most troublesome seat in England, not onelie for that it is neere
 vnto checke, but also the prelats thereof are much troubled with
 sutors, and no lesse subiect to the reproches of the common sort,
 whose mouthes are alwaies wide open vnto reprehension, and eies readie
 to espie anie thing that they may reprooue and carpe at. I would haue
 doone so much for euerie see in England, if I had not had
 consideration of the greatnesse of the volume, and small benefit
 rising by the same, vnto the commoditie of the readers: neuerthelesse
 I haue reserued them vnto the publication of my great chronologie, if
 (while I liue) it happen to come abrode.




 OF VNIUERSITIES.

 CHAP. III.


 [Sidenote: Manie vniuersities somtime in England.]
 There haue beene heretofore, and at sundrie times, diuerse famous
 vniuersities in this Iland, and those euen in my daies not altogither
 forgotten, as one at Bangor, erected by Lucius, and afterward
 conuerted into a monasterie, not by Congellus (as some write) but by
 Pelagius the monke. The second at Carlheon vpon Vske, neere to the
 place where the riuer dooth fall into the Seuerne, founded by king
 Arthur. The third at Theodford, wherein were 600 students, in the time
 of one Rond sometime king of that region. The fourth at Stanford,
 suppressed by Augustine the monke, and likewise other in other places,
 as Salisburie, Eridon or Criclade, Lachlade, Reading, and Northampton;
 albeit that the two last rehearsed were not authorised, but onelie
 arose to that name by the departure of the students from Oxford in
 time of ciuill dissention vnto the said townes, where also they
 continued but for a little season. When that of Salisburie began, I
 can not tell; but that it flourished most vnder Henrie the third, and
 Edward the first, I find good testimonie by the writers, as also by
 the discord which fell 1278, betweene the chancellor for the scholers
 there on the one part, and William the archdeacon on the other,
 whereof you shall see more in the chronologie here following. In my
 [Sidenote: Three vniuersities in England.]
 time there are three noble vniuersities in England, to wit, one at
 Oxford, the second at Cambridge, and the third in London; of which,
 the first two are the most famous, I meane Cambridge and Oxford, for
 that in them the vse of the toongs, philosophie, and the liberall
 sciences, besides the profound studies of the ciuill law, physicke,
 and theologie, are dailie taught and had: whereas in the later, the
 laws of the realme are onelie read and learned, by such as giue their
 minds vnto the knowledge of the same. In the first there are not
 onelie diuerse goodlie houses builded foure square for the most part
 of hard freestone or bricke, with great numbers of lodgings and
 chambers in the same for students, after a sumptuous sort, through the
 exceeding liberalitie of kings, queenes, bishops, noblemen and ladies
 of the land: but also large liuings and great reuenues bestowed vpon
 them (the like whereof is not to be seene in anie other region, as
 Peter Martyr did oft affirme) to the maintenance onelie of such
 conuenient numbers of poore mens sonnes as the seuerall stipends
 bestowed vpon the said houses are able to support.

 [Sidenote: When the vniuersities were builded vncerteine.]
 When these two schooles should be first builded, & who were their
 originall founders, as yet it is vncerteine: neuerthelesse, as there
 is great likelihood that Cambridge was begun by one Cantaber a
 Spaniard (as I haue noted in my chronologie) so Alfred is said to be
 the first beginner of the vniuersitie at Oxford, albeit that I cannot
 warrant the same to be so yong, sith I find by good authoritie, that
 Iohn of Beuerleie studied in the vniuersitie hall at Oxford, which was
 long before Alfred was either borne or gotten. Some are of the opinion
 that Cantabrigia was not so called of Cantaber, but Cair Grant of the
 finisher of the worke, or at the leastwise of the riuer that runneth
 by the same, and afterward by the Saxons Grantcester. An other sort
 affirme that the riuer is better written Canta than Granta, &c: but
 whie then is not the towne called Canta, Cantium, or Cantodunum,
 according to the same? All this is said onlie (as I thinke) to deface
 the memorie of Cantaber, who comming from the Brigants, or out of
 Biscaie, called the said towne after his owne and the name of the
 region from whence he came. Neither hath it beene a rare thing for the
 Spaniards heretofore to come first into Ireland, and from thense ouer
 into England, sith the chronologie shall declare that it hath beene
 often seene, and that out of Britaine, they haue gotten ouer also into
 Scithia, and contrariwise: coasting still through Yorkeshire, which of
 them also was called Brigantium, as by good testimonie appeareth.

 [Sidenote: Oxford fiftie miles from London.]
 Of these two, that of Oxford (which lieth west and by north from
 London) standeth most pleasantlie, being inuironed in maner round
 about with woods on the hilles aloft, and goodlie riuers in the
 bottoms and vallies beneath, whose courses would breed no small
 commoditie to that citie and countrie about, if such impediments were
 remooued as greatlie annoie the same, and hinder the cariage which
 might be made thither also from London.

 [Sidenote: Cambridge six and fortie miles from London.]
 That of Cambridge is distant from London about fortie and six miles
 north and by east, and standeth verie well, sauing that it is somewhat
 neere vnto the fens, whereby the wholesomenesse of the aire there is
 not a little corrupted. It is excellentlie well serued with all kinds
 of prouision, but especiallie of freshwater fish and wildfoule, by
 reason of the riuer that passeth thereby; and thereto the Ile of Elie,
 which is so neere at hand. Onlie wood is the cheefe want to such as
 studie there, wherefore this kind of prouision is brought them either
 from Essex, and other places thereabouts, as is also their cole; or
 otherwise the necessitie thereof is supplied with gall (a bastard kind
 of Mirtus as I take it) and seacole, whereof they haue great plentie
 led thither by the Grant. Moreouer it hath not such store of medow
 ground as may suffice for the ordinarie expenses of the towne and
 vniuersitie, wherefore the inhabitants are inforced in like sort to
 prouide their haie from other villages about, which minister the same
 vnto them in verie great aboundance.

 [Sidenote: Longitude & latitude of both.]
 Oxford is supposed to conteine in longitude eighteene degrees and
 eight and twentie minuts, and in latitude one and fiftie degrees and
 fiftie minuts; whereas that of Cambridge standing more northerlie,
 hath twentie degrees and twentie minuts in longitude, and therevnto
 fiftie and two degrees and fifteene minuts in latitude, as by exact
 supputation is easie to be found.

 The colleges of Oxford, for curious workemanship and priuat
 commodities, are much more statelie, magnificent, & commodious than
 those of Cambridge: and therevnto the streets of the towne for the
 most part more large and comelie. But for vniformitie of building,
 [Sidenote: Cambridge burned not long since.]
 orderlie compaction, and politike regiment, the towne of Cambridge, as
 the newer workmanship, exceedeth that of Oxford (which otherwise is
 and hath beene the greater of the two) by manie a fold (as I gesse)
 although I know diuerse that are of the contrarie opinion. This also
 is certeine, that whatsoeuer the difference be in building of the
 towne streets, the townesmen of both are glad when they may match and
 annoie the students, by incroching vpon their liberties, and keepe
 them bare by extreame sale of their wares, whereby manie of them
 become rich for a time, but afterward fall againe into pouertie,
 bicause that goods euill gotten doo seldome long indure.

 Castels also they haue both, and in my iudgement is hard to be said,
 whether of them would be the stronger, if ech were accordinglie
 repared: howbeit that of Cambridge is the higher, both for maner of
 building and situation of ground, sith Oxford castell standeth low and
 is not so apparant to our sight. That of Cambridge was builded (as
 they saie) by Gurguintus, sometime king of Britaine, but the other by
 the lord Robert de Oilie, a noble man which came in with the
 conqueror, whose wife Editha, a woman giuen to no lesse superstition
 than credulitie, began also the abbeie of Oseneie neere vnto the same,
 vpon a fond (but yet a rare) occasion, which we will heere remember,
 though it be beside my purpose, to the end that the reader may see how
 readie the simple people of that time were to be abused by the
 practise of the cleargie. It happened on a time as this ladie walked
 about the fields, neere vnto the aforesaid castell, to recreate hir
 selfe with certeine of hir maidens, that a number of pies sat
 chattering vpon the elmes, which had beene planted in the hedgerowes,
 and in fine so troubled hir with their noise, that she wished them all
 further off, or else hir selfe at home againe, and this happened
 diuerse times. In the end being wearie of hir walke, she demanded of
 hir chapleine the cause wherefore these pies did so molest & vexe hir.
 Oh madam (saith he) the wiliest pie of all, these are no pies but
 soules in purgatorie that craue releefe. And is it so in deed quoth
 she? Now De pardieux, if old Robert will giue me leaue, I will doo
 what I can to bring these soules to rest. Herevpon she consulted,
 craued, wept, and became so importunate with hir husband, that he
 ioined with hir, and they both began that synagog 1120, which
 afterward prooued to be a notable den. In that church also lieth this
 ladie buried with hir image, hauing an heart in hir hand couched vpon
 the same, in the habit of a vowesse, and yet to be seene, except the
 weather haue worne out the memoriall. But to proceed with my purpose.

 In each of these vniuersities also is likewise a church dedicated to
 the virgin Marie, wherein once in the yeare, to wit, in Iulie, the
 scholers are holden, and in which such as haue beene called to anie
 degree in the yeare precedent, doo there receiue the accomplishment of
 the same, in solemne and sumptuous maner. In Oxford this solemnitie is
 called an Act, but in Cambridge they vse the French word Commensement;
 and such resort is made yearelie vnto the same from all parts of the
 land, by the freends of those which doo proceed, that all the towne is
 hardlie able to receiue and lodge those gests. When and by whome the
 churches aforesaid were builded, I haue elsewhere made relation. That
 of Oxford also was repared in the time of Edward the fourth, and
 Henrie the seuenth, when doctor Fitz Iames a great helper in that
 worke was warden of Merton college, but yer long after it was
 finished, one tempest in a night so defaced the same, that it left few
 pinacles standing about the church and steeple, which since that time
 haue neuer beene repared. There were sometime foure and twentie parish
 churches in the towne and suburbes, but now there are scarselie
 sixteene. There haue beene also 1200 burgesses, of which 400 dwelled
 in the suburbes, and so manie students were there in the time of
 Henrie the third, that he allowed them twentie miles compasse about
 the towne, for their prouision of vittels.

 The common schooles of Cambridge also are farre more beautifull than
 those of Oxford, onelie the diuinitie schoole at Oxford excepted,
 which for fine and excellent workemanship, commeth next the moold of
 the kings chappell in Cambridge, than the which two with the chappell
 that king Henrie the seauenth did build at Westminster, there are not
 (in mine opinion) made of lime & stone three more notable piles within
 the compasse of Europe.

 In all other things there is so great equalitie betweene these two
 vniuersities, as no man can imagin how to set downe any greater; so
 that they seeme to be the bodie of one well ordered common wealth,
 onlie diuided by distance of place, and not in freendlie consent and
 orders. In speaking therefore of the one, I can not but describe the
 other; and in commendation of the first, I can not but extoll the
 latter; and so much the rather, for that they are both so deere vnto
 me, as that I can not readilie tell vnto whether of them I owe the
 most good will. Would to God my knowledge were such, as that neither
 of them might haue cause to be ashamed of their pupill; or my power so
 great, that I might woorthilie requite them both for those manifold
 kindnesses that I haue receiued of them. But to leaue these things,
 and proceed with other more conuenient for my purpose. The manner to
 liue in these vniuersities, is not as in some other of forren
 countries we see dailie to happen, where the students are inforced for
 want of such houses, to dwell in common innes, and tauerns, without
 all order or discipline. But in these our colleges we liue in such
 exact order, and vnder so precise rules of gouernement, as that the
 famous learned man Erasmus of Roterodame being here among vs 50 yeres
 passed, did not let to compare the trades in liuing of students in
 these two places, euen with the verie rules and orders of the ancient
 moonks: affirming moreouer in flat words, our orders to be such as not
 onlie came neere vnto, but rather far exceeded all the monastical
 instituti[=o]s that euer were deuised.

 In most of our colleges there are also great numbers of students, of
 which manie are found by the reuenues of the houses, and other by the
 purueiances and helpe of their rich freends; whereby in some one
 college you shall haue two hundred scholers, in others an hundred and
 fiftie, in diuerse a hundred and fortie, and in the rest lesse
 numbers; as the capacitie of the said houses is able to receiue: so
 that at this present, of one sort and other, there are about three
 thousand students nourished in them both (as by a late surueie it
 manifestlie appeared.) They were erected by their founders at the
 first, onelie for poore mens sons, whose parents were not able to
 bring them vp vnto learning: but now they haue the least benefit of
 them, by reason the rich doo so incroch vpon them. And so farre hath
 this inconuenience spread it selfe, that it is in my time an hard
 matter for a poore mans child to come by a felowship (though he be
 neuer so good a scholar & woorthie of that roome.) Such packing also
 is vsed at elections, that not he which best deserueth, but he that
 hath most friends, though he be the woorst scholer, is alwaies surest
 to speed; which will turne in the end to the ouerthrow of learning.
 That some gentlemen also, whose friends haue beene in times past
 benefactors to certeine of those houses, doo intrude into the
 disposition of their estates, without all respect of order or
 estatutes deuised by the founders, onelie thereby to place whome they
 thinke good (and not without some hope of gaine) the case is too too
 euident: and their attempt would soone take place, if their superiors
 did not prouide to bridle their indeuors. In some grammar schooles
 likewise, which send scholers to these vniuersities, it is lamentable
 to see what briberie is vsed; for yer the scholer can be preferred,
 such bribage is made, that poore mens children are commonlie shut out,
 and the richer sort receiued (who in time past thought it dishonor to
 liue as it were vpon almes) and yet being placed, most of them studie
 little other than histories, tables, dice, and trifles, as men that
 make not the liuing by their studie the end of their purposes, which
 is a lamentable hearing. Beside this, being for the most part either
 gentlemen, or rich mens sonnes, they oft bring the vniuersities into
 much slander. For standing vpon their reputation and libertie, they
 ruffle and roist it out, exceeding in apparell, and hanting riotous
 companie (which draweth them from their bookes vnto an other trade.)
 And for excuse when they are charged with breach of all good order,
 thinke it sufficient to saie, that they be gentlemen, which greeueth
 manie not a litle. But to proceed with the rest.

 [Sidenote: Readers in priuat houses.]
 Euerie one of these colleges haue in like maner their professors or
 readers of the toongs and seuerall sciences, as they call them, which
 dailie trade vp the youth there abiding priuatlie in their halles, to
 the end they may be able afterward (when their turne commeth about,
 which is after twelue termes) to shew themselues abroad, by going from
 thence into the common schooles and publike disputations (as it were
 "In aream") there to trie their skilles, and declare how they haue
 profited since their comming thither.

 [Sidenote: Publike readers mainteined by the prince.]
 Moreouer, in the publike schooles of both the vniuersities, there are
 found at the princes charge (and that verie largelie) fiue professors
 and readers, that is to saie, of diuinitie, of the ciuill law,
 physicke, the Hebrue, and the Greeke toongs. And for the other
 [Sidenote: Studie of the quadriuials and perspectiues neglected.]
 lectures, as of philosophie, logike, rhetorike, and the quadriuials,
 although the latter (I meane arythmetike, musike, geometrie, and
 astronomie, and with them all skill in the perspectiues are now
 smallie regarded in either of them) the vniuersities themselues doo
 allow competent stipends to such as reade the same, whereby they are
 sufficientlie prouided for, touching the maintenance of their estates,
 and no lesse incoraged to be diligent in their functions.

 These professors in like sort haue all the rule of disputations and
 other schoole exercises, which are dailie vsed in common schooles
 seuerallie assigned to ech of them, and such of their hearers, as by
 their skill shewed in the said disputations, are thought to haue
 atteined to anie conuenient ripenesse of knowledge, according to the
 custome of other vniuersities, although not in like order, are
 permitted solemnlie to take their deserued degrees of schoole in the
 same science and facultie wherein they haue spent their trauell. From
 that time forward also, they vse such difference in apparell as
 becommeth their callings, tendeth vnto grauitie, and maketh them
 knowne to be called to some countenance.

 [Sidenote: Sophisters.]
 The first degree, is that of the generall sophisters, from whence when
 they haue learned more sufficientlie the rules of logike, rhetorike,
 and obteined thereto competent skill in philosophie, and in the
 [Sidenote: Batchelers of Art.]
 mathematicals, they ascend higher vnto the estate of batchelers of
 art, after foure yeares of their entrance into their sophistrie. From
 thence also giuing their minds to more perfect knowledge in some or
 all the other liberall sciences, & the toongs, they rise at the last
 [Sidenote: Masters of art.]
 (to wit, after other three or foure yeeres) to be called masters of
 art, ech of them being at that time reputed for a doctor in his
 facultie, if he professe but one of the said sciences (beside
 philosophie) or for his generall skill, if he be exercised in them
 all. After this they are permitted to choose what other of the higher
 studies them liketh to follow, whether it be diuinitie, law, or,
 physike; so that being once masters of art, the next degree if they
 follow physike, is the doctorship belonging to that profession; and
 likewise in the studie of the law, if they bend their minds to the
 knowledge of the same. But if they meane to go forward with diuinitie,
 this is the order vsed in that profession. First, after they haue
 necessarilie proceeded masters of art, they preach one sermon to the
 people in English, and another to the vniuersitie in Latine. They
 answer all commers also in their owne persons vnto two seuerall
 questions of diuinitie in the open schooles, at one time, for the
 space of two hours; and afterward replie twise against some other man
 vpon a like number, and on two seuerall daies in the same place: which
 being doone with commendation, he receiueth the fourth degree, that
 [Sidenote: Batcheler of diuinitie.]
 is, batcheler of diuinitie, but not before he hath beene master of art
 by the space of seauen yeeres, according to their statutes.

 [Sidenote: Doctor.]
 The next and last degree of all is the doctorship after other three
 yeares, for the which he must once againe performe all such exercises
 and acts as are afore remembred, and then is he reputed able to
 gouerne and teach others, & likewise taken for a doctor. I haue read
 that Iohn of Beuerleie was the first doctor that euer was in Oxford,
 as Beda was in Cambridge. But I suppose herein that the word doctor is
 not so strictlie to be taken in this report as it is now vsed, sith
 euerie teacher is in Latine called by that name, as also such in the
 primitiue church as kept schooles of catechists, wherein they were
 trained vp in the rudiments and principles of religion, either before
 they were admitted vnto baptisme, or anie office in the church.

 Thus we see, that from our entrance into the vniuersitie vnto the last
 degree receiued, is commonlie eighteene or peraduenture twentie
 yeeres, in which time if a student hath not obteined sufficient
 learning, thereby to serue his owne turne, and benefit his common
 wealth, let him neuer looke by tarieng longer to come by anie more.
 For after this time & 40 yeeres of age, the most part of students doo
 commonlie giue ouer their woonted diligence, & liue like drone bees on
 the fat of colleges, withholding better wits from the possession of
 their places, & yet dooing litle good in their own vocation & calling.
 I could rehearse a number (if I listed) of this sort, aswell in the
 one vniuersitie as the other. But this shall suffice in sted of a
 larger report, that long continuance in those places is either a signe
 of lacke of friends, or of learning, or of good and vpright life, as
 [Sidenote: This Fox builded Corpus Christi college in Oxford.]
 bishop Fox sometime noted, who thought it sacrilege for a man to
 tarrie anie longer at Oxford than he had a desire to profit.

 A man may (if he will) begin his studie with the lawe, or physike (of
 which this giueth wealth, the other honor) so soone as he commeth to
 the vniuersitie, if his knowledge in the toongs and ripenesse of
 iudgement serue therefore: which if he doo, then his first degree is
 bacheler of law, or physicke, and for the same he must performe such
 acts in his owne science, as the bachelers or doctors of diuinitie,
 doo for their parts, the onelie sermons except, which belong not to
 his calling. Finallie, this will I saie, that the professors of either
 of those faculties come to such perfection in both vniuersities, as
 the best students beyond the sea doo in their owne or else where. One
 thing onlie I mislike in them, and that is their vsuall going into
 Italie, from whense verie few without speciall grace doo returne good
 [Sidenote: So much also may be inferred of lawiers.]
 men, whatsoeuer they pretend of conference or practise, chiefelie the
 physicians who vnder pretense of seeking of forreine simples doo
 oftentimes learne the framing of such compositions as were better
 vnknowen than practised, as I haue heard oft alledged, and therefore
 it is most true that doctor Turner said; Italie is not to be seene
 without a guide, that is, without speciall grace giuen from God,
 bicause of the licentious and corrupt behauiour of the people.

 There is moreouer in euerie house a maister or prouost, who hath vnder
 him a president, & certeine censors or deanes, appointed to looke to
 the behauior and maners of the students there, whom they punish verie
 seuerelie if they make anie default, according to the quantitie and
 qualitie of their trespasses. And these are the vsual names of
 gouernours in Cambridge. Howbeit in Oxford the heads of houses are now
 and then called presidents in respect of such bishops as are their
 visitors & founders. In ech of these also they haue one or moe
 thresurers whom they call Bursarios or Bursers beside other officers,
 whose charge is to see vnto the welfare and maintenance of these
 houses. Ouer each vniuersitie also there is a seuerall chancelor,
 whose offices are perpetuall, howbeit their substitutes, whom we call
 vicechancelors, are changed euerie yeare, as are also the proctors,
 taskers, maisters of the streates and other officers, for the better
 maintenance of their policie and estate.

 And thus much at this time of our two vniuersities in each of which I
 haue receiued such degree as they haue vouchsafed rather of their
 fauour than my desert to yeeld and bestow vpon me, and vnto whose
 students I wish one thing, the execution whereof cannot be
 preiudiciall to anie that meaneth well, as I am resolutelie persuaded,
 and the case now standeth in these our daies. When anie benefice
 therefore becommeth void, it were good that the patrone did signifie
 the vacation therof to the bishop, and the bishop the act of the
 patrone to one of the vniuersities, with request that the
 vicechancellor with his assistents might prouide some such able man to
 succeed in the place, as should by their iudgement be meet to take the
 charge vpon him. Certes if this order were taken then should the
 church be prouided of good pastors, by whome God should be glorified,
 the vniuersities better stored, the simoniacall practises of a number
 of patrons vtterlie abolished and the people better trained to liue in
 obedience toward God and their prince, which were an happie estate.

 [Sidenote: London.]
 To these two also we may in like sort ad the third, which is at London
 (seruing onelie for such as studie the lawes of the realme) where
 there are sundrie famous houses, of which three are called by the name
 of Ins of the court, the rest of the chancerie, and all builded before
 time for the furtherance and commoditie of such as applie their minds
 to our common lawes. Out of these also come manie scholers of great
 fame, whereof the most part haue heretofore beene brought vp in one of
 the aforesaid vniuersities, and prooue such commonlie as in processe
 of time, rise vp (onelie through their profound skill) to great honor
 in the common-wealth of England. They haue also degrees of learning
 among themselues, and rules of discipline, vnder which they liue most
 ciuilie in their houses, albeit that the yoonger sort of them abroad
 in the streats are scarse able to be bridled by anie good order at
 all. Certes this errour was woont also greatlie to reigne in Cambridge
 and Oxford, betweene the students and the burgesses: but as it is well
 left in these two places, so in forreine counteies it cannot yet be
 suppressed. Besides these vniuersities, also there are great number of
 [Sidenote: Grammar schooles.]
 Grammer schooles through out the realme, and those verie liberallie
 indued, for the better reliefe of poore scholers, so that there are
 not manie corporat townes now vnder the queenes dominion, that haue
 not one Gramar schoole at the least, with a sufficient liuing for a
 maister and vsher appointed to the same.

 [Sidenote: Windsor, Winchester, Eaton, Westminster.]
 There are in like maner diuerse collegiat churches as Windsor,
 Wincester, Eaton, Westminster (in which I was sometime an vnprofitable
 Grammarian vnder the reuerend father master Nowell now deane of
 Paules) and in those a great number of poore scholers dailie
 mainteened by the liberalitie of the founders, with meat, bookes, and
 apparell, from whence after they haue beene well entered in the
 knowledge of the Latine and Greeke toongs, and rules of versifieng
 (the triall whereof is made by certeine apposers yearelie appointed to
 examine them) they are sent to certeine especiall houses in each
 [Sidenote: * [_and_?]]
 vniuersitie, where they are receiued [*] the trained vp, in the points
 of higher knowledge in their priuat hals, till they be adiudged meet
 to shew their faces in the schooles, as I haue said alreadie. And thus
 much haue I thought good to note of our vniuersities, and likewise of
 colleges in the same, whose names I will also set downe here, with
 those of their founders, to the end the zeale which they bare vnto
 learning may appeare, and their remembrance neuer perish from among
 the wise and learned.

 There are also in Oxford certeine hostels or hals, which may rightwell
 be called by the names of colleges, if it were not that there is more
 libertie in them, than is to be seen in the other. In mine opinion the
 liuers in these are verie like to those that are of Ins in the
 chancerie, their names also are these so farre as I now remember.

   Brodegates.
   Hart hall.
   Magdalen hall.
   Alburne hall.
   Postminster hall.
   S. Marie hall.
   White hall.
   New In.
   Edmond hall.

 The students also that remaine in them, are called hostelers or
 halliers. Hereof it came of late to passe, that the right reuerend
 father in God Thomas late archbishop of Canturburie being brought vp
 in such an house at Cambridge, was of the ignorant sort of Londoners
 called an hosteler, supposing that he had serued with some inholder in
 the stable, and therfore in despite diuerse hanged vp bottles of haie
 at his gate, when he began to preach the gospell, whereas in deed he
 was a gentleman borne of an ancient house & in the end a faithfull
 witnesse of Iesus Christ, in whose quarrell he refused not to shed his
 bloud and yeeld vp his life vnto the furie of his aduersaries.

 Besides these there is mention and record of diuerse other hals or
 hostels, that haue beene there in times past, as Beefe hall, Mutton
 hall, &c: whose ruines yet appeere: so that if antiquitie be to be
 iudged by the shew of ancient buildings, which is verie plentifull in
 Oxford to be seene, it should be an easie matter to conclude that
 Oxford is the elder vniuersitie. Therin are also manie dwelling houses
 [Sidenote: Erection of colleges in Oxford the overthrow of hals.]
 of stone yet standing, that haue beene hals for students of verie
 antike workemanship, beside the old wals of sundrie other, whose plots
 haue beene conuerted into gardens, since colleges were erected.

 _In London also the houses of students at the Common law are these_.

   Sergeants In.
   Graies In.
   The Temple.
   Lincolnes In.

 And thus much in generall of our noble vniuersities, whose lands some
 greedie gripers doo gape wide for, and of late haue (as I heare)
 propounded sundrie reasons, whereby they supposed to haue preuailed in
 their purposes. But who are those that haue attempted this sute, other
 than such as either hate learning, pietie, and wisedome; or else haue
 spent all their owne, and know not otherwise than by incroching vpon
 other men how to mainteine themselues? When such a motion was made by
 some vnto king Henrie the eight, he could answer them in this maner;
 Ah sirha, I perceiue the abbeie lands haue fleshed you and set your
 teeth on edge, to aske also those colleges. And whereas we had a
 regard onelie to pull downe sinne by defacing the monasteries, you
 haue a desire also to ouerthrow all goodnesse by subuersion of
 colleges. I tell you sirs that I iudge no land in England better
 bestowed than that which is giuen to our vniuersities, for by their
 maintenance our realme shall be well gouerned when we be dead and
 rotten. As you loue your welfares therfore, follow no more this veine,
 but content your selues with that you haue alreadie, or else seeke
 [Sidenote: Now abbeies be gone, our dingthrifts prie
 after church and college possessions.]
 honest meanes whereby to increase your liuelods, for I loue not
 learning so ill, that I will impaire the reuenues of anie one house by
 a pennie, whereby it may be vpholden. In king Edwards daies likewise
 the same was once againe attempted [as I haue heard] but in vaine, for
 saith the duke of Summerset among other speeches tending to that end,
 who also made answer therevnto in the kings presence by his
 assignation; If lerning decaie, which of wild men maketh ciuill, of
 blockish and rash persons wise and godlie counsellors, of obstinat
 rebels obedient subiects, and of euill men good and godlie christians;
 what shall we looke for else but barbarisme and tumult? For when the
 lands of colleges be gone, it shall be hard to saie, whose staffe
 shall stand next the doore, for then I doubt not but the state of
 bishops, rich farmers, merchants, and the nobilitie shall be assailed,
 by such as liue to spend all, and thinke that what so euer another man
 hath is more meet for them, and to be at their commandement, than for
 the proper owner that hath sweat and laboured for it. In queene Maries
 daies the weather was too warme for anie such course to be taken in
 hand, but in the time of our gratious queene Elizabeth, I heare that
 it was after a sort in talke the third time, but without successe as
 mooued also out of season, and so I hope it shall continue for euer.
 For what comfort should it be for anie good man to see his countrie
 brought into the estate of the old Gothes & Vandals, who made lawes
 against learning, and would not suffer anie skilfull man to come into
 their councell house, by meanes whereof those people became sauage,
 tyrants, and mercilesse helhounds, till they restored learning againe,
 and thereby fell to ciuilitie.




 OF THE PARTITION OF ENGLAND INTO SHIRES AND COUNTIES.

 CHAP. IV.


 In reding of ancient writers, as Caesar, Tacitus, and others, we find
 mention of sundrie regions to haue beene sometime in this Iland, as
 the Nouantae, Selgouae, Dannonij, Gadeni, Oradeni, Epdij, Cerones,
 Carnonacae, Careni, Cornabij, Caledonij, Decantae, Logi, Mertae,
 Vacomagi, Venicontes, Texali or Polij, Denani, Elgoui, Brigantes

 Simeni, Trinouantes, Demetae, Cangi, Silures, Dobuni, Atterbatij,

 Seueriani, Iceni, Tegenes, Casij, Caenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites,
 Bibroci, and Kentishmen, and such like. But sith the seuerall places
 where most of them laie, are not yet verie perfectlie knowne vnto the
 learned of these daies, I doo not meane to pronounce my iudgement vpon
 such doubtfull cases, least that in so dooing I should but increase
 coniectures, and leading peraduenture the reader from the more
 probable, intangle his mind in the end with such as are of lesse
 value, and things nothing so likelie to be true, as those which other
 men haue remembred and set downe before me. Neither will I speake
 oughts of the Romane partitions, & limits of their legions, whose
 number and place of abode, except of the Victorian and Augustane, is
 to me vtterlie vnknowne.

 [Sidenote: Alfred brought England into shires, which the Britons
 diuided by cantreds, and the first Saxons by families.] It shall
 suffice therfore to begin with such a ground as from whence some
 better certeintie of things may be deriued, and that is with the
 estate of our Iland in the time of Alfred, who first diuided England
 into shires, which before his daies, and since the comming of the
 Saxons, was limited out by families and hidelands, as the Britons did
 the same in their time, by hundreds of townes, which then were called
 cantreds; as old records doo witness.

 Into how manie shires the said Alfred did first make this partition of
 the Iland, it is not yet found out; howbeit if my coniecture be anie
 thing at all, I suppose that he left not vnder eight and thirtie, sith
 we find by no good author, that aboue fifteene haue beene added by
 anie of his successours, since the time of his decease. This prince
 [Sidenote: Shire and share all one.]
 therefore hauing made the generall partition of his kingdome into
 shires, or shares, he diuided againe the same into lathes, as lathes
 into hundreds, and hundreds into tithings, or denaries, as diuers haue
 written; and maister Lambert following their authorities, hath also
 giuen out, saieng almost after this maner in his description of Kent;
 "The Danes (saith he) both before, & in the time of king Alfred, had
 flocked by the sea coasts of this Iland in great numbers, sometimes
 wasting and spoiling with sword and fire, wheresoeuer they might
 arriue, and somtime taking great booties with them to their ships,
 [Sidenote: Englishmen noisome to their owne countrie.]
 without dooing anie further hurt or damage to the countrie. This
 inconuenience continuing for manie yeeres togither, caused our
 husbandmen to abandon their tillage, and gaue occasion and hardinesse
 to euill disposed persons, to fall to the like pillage, as practising
 to follow the Danes in these their thefts and robberies. And the
 better to cloake their mischeefe withall, they feigned themselues to
 be Danish pirats, and would sometime come a land in one port, and
 sometime in another, driuing dailie great spoiles (as the Danes had
 doone) vnto their ships before them. The good king Alfred therefore
 (who had maruellouslie trauelled in repelling the barbarous Danes)
 espieng this outrage, and thinking it no lesse the part of a politike
 prince, to root out the noisome subiect, than to hold out the forren
 aduersarie: by the aduise of his nobilitie, and the example of Moses
 (who followed the counsell of Iethro his father in law to the like
 effect) diuided the whole realme into certeine parts or sections,
 which (of the Saxon word Schyran, signifieng to cut) he termed shires,
 or as we yet speake, shares, or portions, of which some one hath
 fortie miles in length (as Essex) and almost so manie broad, Hereford
 foure & twentie in length, and twentie in breadth, and Warwike six and
 thirtie in length, &c: and some of them also conteine ten, twelue,
 thirteene, sixteene, twentie, or thirtie hundreds, more or lesse, as
 some hundreds doo sixteene, twentie, thirtie, fortie, fiftie or sixtie
 townes, out of which the king was alwaies to receiue an hundred able
 men to serue him in the warres, or a hundred men able to be pledges,
 [Sidenote: Earle and alderman.]
 and ouer each of the portions he appointed either an earle or
 alderman, or both, to whome he committed the gouernement of the same.
 These shires also he brake into lesser parts, whereof some were called
 lathes, of the word Gelathian, which is to assemble togither; other
 hundreds, for that they enioied iurisdiction ouer an hundred pledges;
 and other tithings, bicause there were in each of them to the number
 of ten persons, whereof euerie one from time to time was suertie for
 others good abearing. He prouided also that euerie man should procure
 himselfe to be receiued into some tithing, to the end, that if anie
 were found of so small and base a credit, that no man would become
 pledge or suertie for him, he should forthwith be committed to prison,
 least otherwise he might happen to doo more harme abroad. Hitherto
 master Lambert." By whose words we may gather verie much of the state
 of this Iland in the time of Alfred, whose institution continued after
 a sort vntill the comming of the Normans, who changed the gouernement
 of the realme in such wise (by bringing in of new officers and
 offices, after the maner of their countries) that verie little of the
 old regiment remained more than the bare names of some officers
 (except peraduenture in Kent) so that in these daies it is hard to set
 downe anie great certeintie of things as they stood in Alfreds time,
 more than is remembred and touched at this present.

 [Sidenote: What a lath is.]
 Some as it were roming or rouing at the name Lath, doo saie that it is
 deriued of a barne, which is called in old English a lath, as they
 coniecture. From which speech in like sort some deriue the word
 Laistow, as if it should be trulie written Lath stow, a place wherein
 to laie vp or laie on things, of whatsoeuer condition. But hereof as
 yet I cannot absolutelie be satisfied, although peraduenture some
 likelihood in their iudgements may seeme to be therein. Other vpon
 some further consideration affirme that they were certeine circuits in
 euerie countie or shire conteining an appointed number of townes,
 whose inhabitants alwaies assembled to know and vnderstand of matters
 touching their portions, in to some one appointed place or other
 within their limits, especiallie whilest the causes were such as
 required not the aid or assistance of the whole countie. Of these
 [Sidenote: Leetes.]
 lathes also (as they saie) some shires had more, some lesse, as they
 were of greatnesse. (And M. Lambert seemeth to be of the opinion, that
 the leets of our time wherein these pledges be yet called Franci
 plegij of the word Free burgh) doo yeeld some shadow of that politike
 institution of Alfred. But sith my skill is so small in these cases
 that I dare not iudge anie thing at all as of mine owne knowledge, I
 will not set downe anie thing more than I read, least I should roue at
 randon in our obscure antiquities, and reading no more of lathes my
 next talke shall be of hundreds.

 [Sidenote: Hundred or wapentake.]
 The hundred and the wapentake is all one, as I read in some, and by
 this diuision not a name appertinent to a set number of townes (for
 then all hundreds should be of equall quantitie) but a limited
 iurisdiction, within the compasse whereof were an hundred persons
 [Sidenote: Denarie or tithing.]
 called pledges (as I said) or ten denaries, or tithings of men, of
 which ech one was bound for others good abering, and laudable
 behauiour in the common-wealth of the realme. The chiefe man likewise
 of euerie denarie or tithing was in those daies called a tithing man,
 [Sidenote: Tithing man in Latine Decurio Borsholder.]
 in Latine Decurio, but now in most places a borsholder or burgholder,
 [Sidenote: Burrow.]
 as in Kent; where euerie tithing is moreouer named a burgh or burrow,
 although that in the West countrie he be still called a tithing man,
 and his circuit a tithing, as I haue heard at large. I read
 furthermore (and it is partlie afore noted) that the said Alfred
 caused ech man of free condition (for the better maintenance of his
 peace) to be ascribed into some hundred by placing himselfe in one
 denarie or other, where he might alwais haue such as should sweare or
 saie vpon their certeine knowledge for his honest behauiour and ciuill
 conuersation if it should happen at anie time, that his credit should
 come in question. In like sort I gather out of Leland and other, that
 if anie small matter did fall out worthie to be discussed, the tithing
 man or borsholder (now officers, at the commandement of the high
 constable of which euerie hundred hath one at the least) should decide
 the same in their leetes, whereas the great causes were referred to
 the hundreds, the greater to the lathes, and the greatest of all to
 the shire daies, where the earles or aldermen did set themselues, &
 make finall ends of the same, according vnto iustice. For this purpose
 [Sidenote: Twelue men.]
 likewise in euerie hundred were twelue men chosen of good age and
 wisedome, and those sworne to giue their sentences without respect of
 person, and in this maner (as they gather) were things handeled in
 those daies. Which waie the word wapentake came in vse, as yet I
 cannot tell; howbeit the signification of the same declareth (as I
 conceiue) that at the chiefe towne the soldiers which were to serue in
 that hundred did meet, fetch their weapons, & go togither from thence
 to the field, or place of seruice by an ordinarie custome, then
 generallie knowen amongst them. It is supposed also that the word Rape
 commeth a Rapiendo, as it were of catching and snatching, bicause the
 tenants of the hundred or wapentakes met vpon one or sundrie daies &
 made quicke dispatch of their lords haruest at once and in great hast.
 But whether it be a true imagination or not as yet I am vncerteine,
 and therefore it lieth not in me to determine anie thing thereof:
 wherefore it shall suffice to haue touched them in this maner.

 [Sidenote: Fortie shires in England, thirteene in Wales.]
 In my time there are found to be in England fourtie shires, and
 likewise thirteene in Wales, and these latter erected of late yeares
 by king Henrie the eight, who made the Britons or Welshmen equall in
 all respects vnto the English, and brought to passe that both nations
 should indifferentlie be gouerned by one law, which in times past were
 ordred by diuerse, and those far discrepant and disagreing one from
 another: as by the seuerall view of the same is yet easie to be
 discerned. The names of the shires in England are these, whereof the
 first ten lie betweene the British sea and the Thames, as Polydor also
 dooth set them downe.

   Kent.
   Sussex.
   Surreie.
   Hampshire.
   Barkeshire.
   Wilshire.
   Dorsetshire.
   Summerset.
   Deuon.
   Cornewall.

 There are moreouer on the northside of the Thames, and betweene the
 same and the riuer Trent, which passeth through the middest of England
 (as Polydor saith) sixteene other shires, whereof six lie toward the
 east, the rest toward the west, more into the middest of the countrie.

   Essex, somtime all forrest saue one hundred.
   Middlesex.
   Hartfordshire.
   Suffolke.
   Norffolke.
   Cambrigeshire in which are 12 hundreds.
   Bedford.
   Huntingdon wherin are foure hundreds.
   Buckingham.
   Oxford.
   Northampton.
   Rutland.
   Leircestershire.
   Notinghamshire.
   Warwike.
   Lincolne.

 We haue six also that haue their place westward towards Wales, whose
 names insue.

   Glocester.
   Hereford.
   Worcester.
   Shropshire.
   Stafford.
   Chestershire.

 And these are the thirtie two shires which lie by south of the Trent.
 Beyond the same riuer we haue in like sort other eight, as

   Darbie.
   Yorke.
   Lancaster.
   Cumberland.
   Westmerland.
   Richemond, wherein are fiue wapentaxes, & when it is accompted as
     parcell of Yorkeshire (out of which it is taken) then is it reputed
     for the whole Riding.
   Durham.
   Northumberland.

 So that in the portion sometime called Lhoegres, there are now fortie
 shires. In Wales furthermore are thirteene, whereof seuen are in
 Southwales:

   Cardigan, or Cereticon.
   Penmoroke, or Penbrooke.
   Caermardine, wherein are 9 hundreds or commots.
   Glamorgan.
   Monmouth.
   Breckenocke.
   Radnor.

 In Northwales likewise are six, that is to saie

   Angleseie.
   Carnaruon.
   Merioneth.
   Denbigh.
   Flint.
   Montgomerie.

 Which being added to those of England yeeld fiftie and three shires or
 counties, so that vnder the queenes Maiestie are so manie counties,
 whereby it is easilie discerned, that hir power farre exceedeth that
 of Offa, who of old time was highlie honored for that he had so much
 of Britaine vnder his subiection as afterward conteined thirtie nine
 shires, when the diuision was made, whereof I spake before.

 [Sidenote: Od parcels of shires.]
 This is moreouer to be noted in our diuision of shires, that they be
 not alwaies counted or laid togither in one parcell, whereof I haue
 great maruell. But sith the occasi[=o] hath growen (as I take it)
 either by priuilege or some like occasion, it is better briefelie to
 set downe how some of these parts lie than to spend the time in
 seeking a iust cause of this their od diuision. First therefore I note
 that in the part of Buckinghamshire betweene Amondesham, and
 Beconsfield, there is a peece of Hartfordshire to be found, inuironed
 round about with the countie of Buckingham, and yet this patch is not
 aboue three miles in length and two in breadth at the verie most. In
 Barkeshire also betweene Ruscombe and Okingham is a peece of Wilshire,
 one mile in breadth and foure miles in length, whereof one side lieth
 on the Loden riuer. In the borders of Northamptonshire directlie ouer
 against Luffeld a towne in Buckinghamshire, I find a parcell of
 Oxfordshire not passing two miles in compasse.

 With Oxfordshire diuerse doo participate, in so much that a peece of
 Glocestershire, lieth halfe in Warwikeshire & halfe in Oxfordshire,
 not verie far from Horneton. Such another patch is there, of
 Glocestershire not far from long Compton, but lieng in Oxford countie:
 & a peece of Worcestershire, directlie betweene it & Glocestershire.
 Glocester hath the third peece vpon the north side of the Winrush
 neere Falbrocke, as Barkeshire hath one parcell also vpon the selfe
 side of the same water, in the verie edge of Glocestershire: likewise
 an other in Oxfordshire, not verie farre from Burford: and the third
 ouer against Lach lade, which is parted from the main countie of
 Barkeshire, by a little strake of Oxfordshire. Who would thinke that
 two fragments of Wilshire were to be seene in Barkeshire vpon the
 Loden, and the riuer that falleth into it: whereof and the like sith
 there are verie manie, I thinke good to giue this briefe admonition.
 For although I haue not presentlie gone thorough with them all, yet
 these may suffice to giue notice of this thing, wherof most readers
 (as I persuade my selfe) are ignorant.

 [Sidenote: Lieutenants.]
 But to proceed with our purpose. Ouer ech of these shires in time of
 necessitie is a seuerall lieutenant chosen vnder the prince, who being
 a noble man of calling, hath almost regall authoritie ouer the same
 for the time being in manie cases which doo concerne his office:
 [Sidenote: Shiriffes.]
 otherwise it is gouerned by a shiriffe (a word deriued of Schire and
 Greue, and pronounced as Shire and Reue) whose office is to gather vp
 and bring his accounts into the excheker, of the profits of his
 countie receiued, whereof he is or may be called Quaestor comitatus or
 Prouinciae. This officer is resident and dwelling somewhere within the
 same countie, and called also a viscount, Quasi vicarius comitis or
 Procomes, in respect of the earle (or as they called him in time past
 the alderman) that beareth his name of the countie, although it be
 seldome seene in England, that the earle hath anie great store of
 possessions, or oughts to doo in the shire whereof he taketh his name,
 more than is allowed to him, through his personall resiance, if he
 happen to dwell and be resident in the same.

 In the election also of these magistrates, diuerse able persons aswell
 for wealth as wisedome are named by the commons, at a time and place
 appointed for their choise, whose names being deliuered to the prince,
 he foorthwith pricketh some such one of them, as he pleaseth to
 assigne vnto that office, to whome he committeth the charge of the
 countie, and who herevpon is shiriffe of that shire for one whole
 [Sidenote: Vndershiriffes.]
 yeare, or vntill a new be chosen. The shiriffe also hath his vnder
 shiriffe that ruleth & holdeth the shire courts and law daies vnder
 him, vpon sufficient caution vnto the high shiriffe for his true
 execution of iustice, preseruation from impeachment, and yeelding of
 accompt when he shall be therevnto called. There are likewise vnder
 [Sidenote: Bailiffes.]
 him certeine bailiffes, whose office is to serue and returne such
 writs and processes as are directed vnto them from the high shiriffe:
 to make seisure of the goods and cattels, and arrest the bodies of
 such as doo offend, presenting either their persons vnto him, or at
 the leastwise taking sufficient bond, or other assurance of them for
 their dutifull appearance at an appointed time, when the shiriffe by
 order of law ought to present them to the iudges according to his
 [Sidenote: High constables.]
 charge. In euerie hundred also are one or more high constables
 according to the quantitie thereof, who receiuing the writs and
 injunctions from the high shiriffe vnder his seale, or from anie other
 officers of the prince, either for the prouision of vittels or for
 other causes, or priuat purueiance of cates for the maintenance of the
 [Sidenote: Petie constables.]
 roiall familie, doo forthwith charge the petie constables of euerie
 towne within their limits, with the execution of the same.

 In each countie likewise are sundrie law daies holden at their
 appointed seasons, of which some retaine the old Saxon name, and are
 [Sidenote: Motelagh.]
 called Motelagh, of the word motes and law. They haue also an other
 [Sidenote: Shiriffes turne.]
 called the shiriffes turne, which they hold twise in their times, in
 euerie hundred, according to the old order appointed by king Edgar (as
 king Edward reduced the folkmote ordeined by king Arthur to be held
 yearelie on the first of Maie, vntill the first of euerie moneth) and
 in these two latter such small matters as oft arise amongst the
 inferior sort of people, are heard and well determined. They haue
 finallie their quarter sessions, wherein they are assisted by the
 [Sidenote: Gaile deliuerie or great assises.]
 iustices and gentlemen of the countrie, & twise in the yeare gaile
 deliuerie, at which time the iudges ride about in their circuits, into
 euerie seuerall countie (where the nobilitie and gentlemen with the
 iustices there resiant associat them) & minister the lawes of the
 realme, with great solemnitie & iustice. Howbeit in dooing of these
 things, they reteine still the old order of the land in vse before the
 conquest. For they commit the full examination of all causes there to
 be heard, to the consideration of twelue sober, graue, and wise men,
 chosen out of the same countie; and foure of them of necessitie out of
 the hundred where the action lieth, or the defendant inhabiteth (which
 [Sidenote: Inquests.]
 number they call an inquest) & of these inquests there are more or
 lesse impanneled at euerie assise, as the number of cases there to be
 handled dooth craue and require, albeit that some one inquest hath
 often diuerse matters to consider of. And when they haue (to their
 vttermost power) consulted and debated of such things as they are
 charged withall, they returne againe to the place of iustice, with
 their verdict in writing, according wherevnto the iudge dooth
 pronounce his sentence, be it for life or death, or anie other matter
 what soeuer is brought before him. It is also verie often seene, that
 such as are nominated to be of these inquests, doo after their charge
 receiued seldome or neuer eat or drinke, vntill they haue agreed upon
 their verdict, and yeelded it vp vnto the iudge of whome they receiued
 the charge; by meanes whereof sometimes it commeth to passe that
 diuerse of the inquest haue beene welneere famished, or at least taken
 such a sickenesse thereby, as they haue hardlie auoided. And this
 commeth by practise, when the one side feareth the sequele, and
 therefore conueieth some one or more into the iurie, that will in his
 behalfe neuer yeeld vnto the rest, but of set purpose put them to this
 trouble.

 Certes it is a common practise (if the vnder shiriffe be not the
 better man) for the craftier or stronger side to procure and packe
 such a quest, as he himselfe shall like of, whereby he is sure of the
 issue before the charge be giuen: and beside this if the matter doo
 iustlie proceed against him, it is a world to see now and then how the
 honest yeomen that haue Bona fide discharged their consciences shall
 [Sidenote: Atteinct.]
 be sued of an atteinct, & bound to appeere at the Starre chamber, with
 what rigor they shall be caried from place to place, countie to
 countie, yea and sometime in carts, which hath and dooth cause a great
 number of them to absteine from the assises, & yeeld to paie their
 issues, rather than they would for their good meaning be thus
 disturbed & dealt withall. Sometimes also they bribe the bailiffes to
 be kept at home, whervpon poore men, not hauing in their pursses
 wherewith to beare their costes, are impanelled vpon iuries, who verie
 often haue neither reason nor iudgement to performe the charge they
 come for. Neither was this kind of seruice at anie time halfe so
 painefull as at this present: for vntill of late yeares (that the
 number of lawiers and atturneies hath so exceedinglie increased, that
 some shifts must needs be found and matters sought out, whereby they
 may be set on worke) a man should not haue heard at one assise of more
 than two or three Nisi prius, but verie seldome of an atteinct, wheras
 now an hundred & more of the first and one or two of the later are
 verie often perceiued, and some of them for a cause arising of
 sixpence or tweluepence. Which declareth that men are growen to be
 farre more contentious than they haue beene in time past, and readier
 to reuenge their quarels of small importance, whereof the lawiers
 complaine not. But to my purpose, from whence I haue now digressed.

 Beside these officers afore mentioned, there are sundrie other in
 euerie countie, as crowners, whose dutie is to inquire of such as come
 to their death by violence, to attach & present the plees of the
 crowne, to make inquirie of treasure found, &c. There are diuerse also
 [Sidenote: Iustices of peax & quorum.]
 of the best learned of the law, beside sundrie gentlemen, where the
 number of lawiers will not suffice (and whose reuenues doo amount to
 aboue twentie pounds by the yeare) appointed by especiall commission
 from the prince, to looke vnto the good gouernement of hir subiects,
 in the counties where they dwell. And of these the least skilfull in
 the law are of the peace, the other both of the peace and quorum,
 otherwise called of Oier and Determiner, so that the first haue
 authoritie onelie to heare, the other to heare and determine such
 matters as are brought vnto their presence. These also doo direct
 their warrants to the keepers of the gailes within their limitations,
 for the safe keeping of such offendors as they shall iudge worthie to
 commit vnto their custodie there to be kept vnder ward, vntill the
 great assises, to the end their causes may be further examined before
 the residue of the countie, & these officers were first deuised about
 the eighteene yeare of Edward the third, as I haue beene informed.

 [Sidenote: Quarter sessions.]
 They meeting also & togither with the shiriffes, doo hold their
 aforesaid sessions at foure times in the yeare, whereof they are
 called quarter sessions, and herein they inquire of sundrie
 trespasses, and the common annoiances of the kings liege people, and
 diuerse other things, determining vpon them as iustice dooth require.
 [Sidenote: Petie sessions.]
 There are also a third kind of sessions holden by the high constables
 and bailiffes afore mentioned, called petie sessions, wherein the
 weights and measures are perused by the clarke of the market for the
 countie, who sitteth with them. At these meetings also vittellers, and
 in like sort seruants, labourers, roges and runnagates, are often
 reformed for their excesses, although the burning of vagabounds
 through their eare be referred to the quarter sessions or higher
 courts of assise, where they are iudged either to death, if they be
 taken the third time, & haue not since their second apprehension
 applied themselues to labour, or else to be set perpetuallie to worke
 in an house erected in euerie shire for that purpose, of which
 punishment they stand in greatest feare.

 I might here deliuer a discourse of sundrie rare customes and courts,
 surnamed barons, yet mainteined and holden in England: but forsomuch
 as some of the first are beastlie, and therefore by the lords of the
 soiles now liuing conuerted into monie, being for the most part
 deuised in the beginning either by malicious or licentious women, in
 meere contempt and slauish abuse of their tenants, vnder pretense of
 some punishment due for their excesses, I passe ouer to bring them
 vnto light, as also the remembrance of sundrie courts baron likewise
 holden in strange maner; yet none more absurd and far from law than
 are kept yearlie at Kings hill in Rochford, and therfore may well be
 called a lawlesse court, as most are that were deuised vpon such
 occasions. This court is kept vpon wednesdaie insuing after
 Michaelmasse daie after midnight, so that it is begun and ended before
 the rising of the sunne. When the tenants also are altogither in an
 alehouse, the steward secretlie stealeth from them with a lanterne
 vnder his cloke, and goeth to the Kings hill, where sitting on a
 mole-hill he calleth them with a verie soft voice, writing their
 appeerance vpon a peece of paper with a cole, hauing none other light
 than that which is inclosed in the lanterne: so soone as the tenants
 also doo misse the steward, they runne to the hill with all their
 might, and there answer all at once, Here here, wherby they escape
 their amercements: which they should not doo if he could haue called
 ouer his bill of names before they had missed him in the alehouse. And
 this is the verie forme of the court deuised at the first (as the
 voice goeth) vpon a rebellion made by the tenants of the honour of
 Raibie against their lord, in perpetuall memorie of their disobedience
 shewed. I could beside this speake also of some other, but sith one
 hath taken vpon him to collect a number of them into a particular
 treatise, I thinke it sufficient for me to haue said so much of both.

 And thus much haue I thought good to set downe generallie of the said
 counties and their maner of gouernance, although not in so perfect
 order as the cause requireth, bicause that of all the rest there is
 nothing wherewith I am lesse acquainted than with our temporall
 regiment, which (to saie truth) smallie concerneth my calling. What
 else is to be added after the seuerall shires of England with their
 ancient limits (as they agreed with the diuision of the land in the
 time of Ptolomie and the Romans) and commodities yet extant, I reserue
 vnto that excellent treatise of my freend W. Cambden, who hath
 trauelled therein verie farre, & whose worke written in Latine shall
 in short time (I hope) be published, to the no small benefit of such
 as will read and peruse the same.




 OF DEGREES OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF ENGLAND.

 CHAP. V.


 We in England diuide our people commonlie into foure sorts, as
 gentlemen, citizens or burgesses, yeomen, which are artificers, or
 laborers. Of gentlemen the first and cheefe (next the king) be the
 prince, dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, and barons: and these are
 called gentlemen of the greater sort, or (as our common vsage of
 speech is) lords and noblemen: and next vnto them be knights,
 esquiers, and last of all they that are simplie called gentlemen; so
 that in effect our gentlemen are diuided into their conditions, wherof
 in this chapiter I will make particular rehearsall.

 [Sidenote: Prince.]
 The title of prince dooth peculiarlie belong with vs to the kings
 eldest sonne, who is called prince of Wales, and is the heire apparant
 to the crowne; as in France the kings eldest sonne hath the title of
 Dolphine, and is named peculiarlie Monsieur. So that the prince is so
 termed of the Latine word Princeps, sith he is (as I may call him) the
 cheefe or principall next the king. The kings yoonger sonnes be but
 gentlemen by birth (till they haue receiued creation or donation from
 their father of higher estate, as to be either visconts, earles, or
 dukes) and called after their names, as lord Henrie, or lord Edward,
 with the addition of the word Grace, properlie assigned to the king
 and prince, and now also by custome conueied to dukes, archbishops,
 and (as some saie) to marquesses and their wiues.

 [Sidenote: Duke.]
 The title of duke commeth also of the Latine word Dux, a ducendo,
 bicause of his valor and power ouer the armie: in times past a name of
 office due to the emperour, consull, or cheefe gouernour of the whole
 armie in the Romane warres: but now a name of honor, although perished
 in England, whose ground will not long beare one duke at once; but if
 there were manie as in time past, or as there be now earles, I doo not
 thinke but that they would florish and prosper well inough.

 [Sidenote: Marquesse.]
 In old time he onelie was called marquesse, Qui habuit terram
 limitaneam, a marching prouince vpon the enimies countries, and
 thereby bound to keepe and defend the frontiers. But that also is
 changed in common vse, and reputed for a name of great honor next vnto
 the duke, euen ouer counties, and sometimes small cities, as the
 prince is pleased to bestow it.

 [Sidenote: Earle.]
 The name of earle likewise was among the Romans a name of office, who
 had Comites sacri palatij, comites aerarij, comites stabuli, comites
 patrimonij, largitionum, scholarum, commerciorum, and such like. But
 at the first they were called Comites, which were ioined in commission
 with the proconsull, legate, or iudges for counsell and aids sake in
 each of those seuerall charges. As Cicero epistola ad Quintum fratrem
 remembreth, where he saith; "Atque inter hos quos tibi comites, &
 adiutores, negotiorum publicorum dedit ipsa respublica duntaxat
 finibus his praestabis, quos ante praescripsi, &c." After this I read
 also that euerie president in his charge was called Comes, but our
 English Saxons vsed the word Hertoch and earle for Comes, and
 indifferentlie as I gesse, sith the name of duke was not in vse before
 the conquest. Coropius saith, that Comes and Graue is all one, to wit
 [Sidenote: Viscont.]
 the viscont, called either Procomes, or Vicecomes: and in time past
 gouerned in the countie vnder the earle, but now without anie such
 seruice or office, it is also become a name of dignitie next after the
 earle, and in degree before the baron. His releefe also by the great
 charter is one hundred pounds, as that of a baronie a hundred marks,
 and of a knight fiue at the most for euerie fee.

 [Sidenote: Baron.]
 The baron, whose degree answered to the dignitie of a senator in Rome,
 is such a free lord as hath a lordship or baronie, whereof he beareth
 his name, & hath diuerse knights or freeholders holding of him, who
 with him did serue the king in his wars, and held their tenures in
 Baronia, that is, for performance of such seruice. These Bracton (a
 learned writer of the lawes of England in king Henrie the thirds time)
 tearmeth Barones, quasi robur belli. The word Baro indeed is older
 than that it may easilie be found from whence it came: for euen in the
 oldest histories both of the Germans and Frenchmen, written since the
 conquest, we read of barons, and those are at this daie called among
 the Germans Liberi vel Ingenui, or Freihers in the Germane toong as
 some men doo coniecture, or (as one saith) the citizens and burgesses
 of good townes and cities were called Barones. Neuerthelesse by
 diligent inquisition it is imagined, if not absolutelie found, that
 the word Baro and Filius in the old Scithian or Germane language are
 all one; so that the kings children are properlie called Barones, from
 whome also it was first translated to their kindred, and then to the
 nobilitie and officers of greatest honour indifferentlie. That Baro
 and Filius signifieth one thing, it yet remaineth to be seene,
 although with some corruption: for to this daie, euen the common sort
 doo call their male children barnes here in England, especiallie in
 the north countrie, where that word is yet accustomablie in vse. And
 it is also growne into a prouerbe in the south, when anie man
 susteineth a great hinderance, to saie, I am beggered and all my
 barnes. In the Hebrue toong (as some affirme) it signifieth Filij
 solis, and what are the nobilitie in euerie kingdome but Filij or
 serui regum? But this is farre fetched, wherefore I conclude, that
 from hensefoorth the originall of the word Baro shall not be anie more
 to seeke: and the first time that euer I red thereof in anie English
 historie, is in the reigne of Canutus, who called his nobilitie and
 head officers to a councell holden at Cirnecester, by that name, 1030,
 as I haue else-where remembred. Howbeit the word Baro dooth not
 alwaies signifie or is attributed to a noble man by birth or creation,
 for now and then it is a title giuen vnto one or other with his
 office, as the cheefe or high tribune of the excheker is of custome
 called lord cheefe baron, who is as it were the great or principall
 receiuer of accounts next vnto the lord treasuror, as they are vnder
 him are called Tribuni aerarij, & rationales. Hervnto I may ad so much
 of the word lord, which is an addition going not seldome and in like
 sort with sundrie offices, and to continue so long as he or they doo
 execute the same, and no longer.

 [Sidenote: Bishops.]
 Vnto this place I also referre our bishops, who are accounted
 honourable, called lords, and hold the same roome in the parlement
 house with the barons, albeit for honour sake the right hand of the
 prince is giuen vnto them, and whose countenances in time past were
 much more glorious than at this present it is, bicause those lustie
 prelats sought after earthlie estimation and authoritie with farre
 more diligence than after the lost sheepe of Christ, of which they had
 small regard, as men being otherwise occupied and void of leisure to
 attend vpon the same. Howbeit in these daies their estate remaineth no
 lesse reuerend than before, and the more vertuous they are that be of
 this calling, the better are they esteemed with high and low. They
 reteine also the ancient name (lord) still, although it be not a
 little impugned by such as loue either to heare of change of all
 things, or can abide no superiours. For notwithstanding it be true,
 [Sidenote: 1. Sam ^b 15. 1. Reg. ^3 7.]
 that in respect of function, the office of the eldership is equallie
 distributed betweene the bishop and the minister, yet for ciuill
 gouernements sake, the first haue more authoritie giuen vnto them by
 kings and princes, to the end that the rest maie thereby be with more
 ease reteined within a limited compasse of vniformitie, than otherwise
 they would be, if ech one were suffered to walke in his owne course.
 This also is more to be maruelled at, that verie manie call for an
 alteration of their estate, crieng to haue the word lord abolished,
 their ciuill authoritie taken from them, and the present condition of
 the church in other things reformed; whereas to saie trulie, few of
 them doo agree vpon forme of discipline and gouernement of the church
 succedent: wherein they resemble the Capuans, of whome Liuie dooth
 speake in the slaughter of their senat. Neither is it possible to
 frame a whole monarchie after the patterne of one towne or citie, or
 to stirre vp such an exquisite face of the church as we imagine or
 desire, sith our corruption is such that it will neuer yeeld to so
 great perfection: for that which is not able to be performed in a
 priuat house, will much lesse be brought to passe in a common-wealth
 and kingdome, before such a prince be found as Xenophon describeth, or
 such an orator as Tullie hath deuised. But whither am I digressed from
 my discourse of bishops, whose estates doo daily decaie, & suffer some
 diminution? Herein neuerthelesse their case is growne to be much
 better than before, for whereas in times past the cleargie men were
 feared bicause of their authoritie and seuere gouernment vnder the
 prince, now are they beloued generallie for their painefull diligence
 dailie shewed in their functions and callings, except peraduenture of
 some hungrie wombes, that couet to plucke & snatch at the loose ends
 of their best commodities; with whom it is (as the report goeth) a
 common guise, when a man is to be preferred to an ecclesiasticall
 liuing, what part thereof he will first forgo and part with to their
 vse. Finallie, how it standeth with the rest of the clergie for their
 places of estate, I neither can tell nor greatlie care to know.
 Neuerthelesse with what degrees of honour and worship they haue beene
 [Sidenote: De Asia, cap. 12.]
 matched in times past Iohannes Bohemus in his De omnium gentium
 moribus, and others doo expresse; and this also found beside their
 reports, that in time past euerie bishop, abbat, and pelting prior
 were placed before the earles and barons in most statutes, charters,
 and records made by the prince, as maie also appeare in the great
 charter, and sundrie yeares of Henrie the third, wherein no duke was
 heard of. But as a number of their odious comparisons and ambitious
 titles are now decaied and worthilie shroonke in the wetting, so
 giuing ouer in these daies to mainteine such pompous vanitie, they doo
 thinke it sufficient for them to preach the word, & hold their liuings
 to their sees (so long as they shall be able) from the hands of such
 as indeuour for their owne preferrement to fleece and diminish the
 same. This furthermore will I adde generallie in commendation of the
 cleargie of England, that they are for their knowlege reputed in
 France, Portingale, Spaine, Germanie and Polonia, to be the most
 learned diuines, although they like not anie thing at all of their
 religion: and thereto they are in deed so skilfull in the two
 principall toongs, that it is accounted a maime in anie one of them,
 [Sidenote: No Greeke, no grace.]
 not to be exactlie seene in the Greeke and Hebrue, much more then to
 be vtterlie ignorant or nothing conuersant in them. As for the Latine
 toong it is not wanting in anie of the ministerie, especiallie in such
 as haue beene made within this twelue or fourteene yeares, whereas
 before there was small choise, and manie cures were left vnserued,
 bicause they had none at all. And to saie truth, our aduersaries were
 [Sidenote: Bene con, bene can, bene le.]
 the onelie causers hereof. For whilest they made no further accompt of
 their priesthood, than to construe, sing, read their seruice and their
 portesse, it came to passe that vpon examination had, few made in
 queene Maries daies, and the later end of king Henrie, were able to
 doo anie more, and verie hardlie so much, so void were they of further
 skill, and so vnapt to serue at all.

 [Sidenote: Duke, marquesse, earle, viscont.]
 Dukes, marquesses, earles, visconts, and barons, either be created of
 the prince, or come to that honor by being the eldest sonnes or
 highest in succession to their parents. For the eldest sonne of a duke
 during his fathers life is an erle, the eldest sonne of an erle is a
 baron, or sometimes a viscont, according as the creation is. The
 creation I call the originall donation and condition of the honour
 giuen by the prince for good seruice doone by the first ancestor, with
 some aduancement, which with the title of that honour is alwaies giuen
 to him and his heires males onelie. The rest of the sonnes of the
 nobilitie by the rigor of the law be but esquiers: yet in common
 speech all dukes and marquesses sonnes, and earles eldest sonnes be
 called lords, the which name commonlie dooth agree to none of lower
 degree than barons, yet by law and vse these be not esteemed barons.

 [Sidenote: Barons.]
 The baronie or degree of lords dooth answer to the degree of senators
 of Rome (as I said) and the title of nobilitie (as we vse to call it
 in England) to the Romane Patricij. Also in England no man is
 commonlie created baron, except he maie dispend of yearelie reuenues a
 thousand pounds, or so much as maie fullie mainteine & beare out his
 countenance and port. But visconts, erles, marquesses, and dukes
 exceed them according to the proportion of their degree & honour. But
 though by chance he or his sonne haue lesse, yet he keepeth this
 degree: but if the decaie be excessiue and not able to mainteine the
 honour, as Senatores Romani were amoti a senatu: so sometimes they are
 not admitted to the vpper house in the parlement although they keepe
 the name of lord still, which can not be taken from them vpon anie
 such occasion. The most of these names haue descended from the French
 inuention, in whose histories we shall read of them eight hundred
 yeares passed.

 [Sidenote: Of the second degree of gentlemen.]
 This also is worthie the remembrance, that Otto the first emperour of
 that name, indeuouring to restore the decaied estate of Italie vnto
 some part of hir pristinate magnificence, did after the French example
 giue Dignitates & praedia to such knights and souldiers as had serued
 him in the warres, whom he also adorned with the names of dukes,
 marquesses, earles, valuasors or capteins, and valuasines.

 [Sidenote: Praedia.]
 His Praedia in like maner were tributes, tolles, portage, bankage,
 stackage, coinage, profits by saltpits, milles, water-courses (and
 whatsoeuer emoluments grew by them) & such like. But at that present I
 read not that the word Baro was brought into those parts. And as for
 the valuasors, it was a denomination applied vnto all degrees of honor
 vnder the first three (which are properlie named the kings capteins)
 so that they are called Maiores, minores, & minimi valuasores. This
 also is to be noted, that the word capteine hath two relations, either
 as the possessor therof hath it from the prince, or from some duke,
 marquesse, or earle, for each had capteins vnder them. If from the
 [Sidenote: Valuasores.]
 prince, then are they called Maiores valuasores, if from anie of his
 three peeres, then were they Minores valuasores: but if anie of these
 Valuasors doo substitute a deputie, those are called Minimi
 valuasores, and their deputies also Valuasini, without regard vnto
 which degree the valuasor dooth apperteine: but the word Valuasor is
 now growne out of vse, wherefore it sufficeth to haue said thus much
 of that function.

 [Sidenote: Knights.]
 Knights be not borne, neither is anie man a knight by succession, no
 not the king or prince: but they are made either before the battell,
 to incourage them the more to aduenture & trie their manhood: or after
 the battell ended, as an aduancement for their courage and prowesse
 [Sidenote: Milites.]
 alreadie shewed (& then are they called Milites;) or out of the warres
 for some great seruice doone, or for the singular vertues which doo
 appeare in them, and then are they named Equites aurati, as common
 custome intendeth. They are made either by the king himselfe, or by
 his commission and roiall authoritie giuen for the same purpose: or by
 his lieutenant in the warres. This order seemeth to answer in part to
 [Sidenote: Equites aurati.]
 that which the Romans called Equitum Romanorum. For as Equites Romani
 were chosen Ex censu, that is, according to their substance and
 riches; so be knights in England most commonlie according to their
 yearelie reuenues or aboundance of riches, wherewith to mainteine
 their estates. Yet all that had Equestrem censum, were not chosen to
 be knights, and no more be all made Knights in England that may spend
 a knights lands, but they onelie whome the prince will honour.
 Sometime diuerse ancient gentlemen, burgesses, and lawiers, are called
 vnto knighthood by the prince, and neuerthelesse refuse to take that
 state vpon them, for which they are of custome punished by a fine,
 that redoundeth vnto his cofers, and to saie truth, is oftentimes more
 profitable vnto him than otherwise their seruice should be, if they
 did yeeld vnto knighthood. And this also is a cause, wherefore there
 be manie in England able to dispend a knights liuing, which neuer come
 vnto that countenance, and by their owne consents. The number of the
 knights in Rome was also vncerteine: and so is it of knights likewise
 with vs, as at the pleasure of the prince. And whereas the Equites
 Romani had Equum publicum of custome bestowed vpon them, the knights
 of England haue not so, but beare their owne charges in that also, as
 in other kind of furniture, as armorie meet for their defense and
 seruice. This neuerthelesse is certeine, that who so may dispend 40
 pounds by the yeare of free land, either at the coronation of the
 king, or mariage of his daughter, or time of his dubbing, may be
 inforced vnto the taking of that degree, or otherwise paie the
 reuenues of his land for one yeare, which is onelie fortie pounds by
 an old proportion, and so for a time be acquited of that title. We
 name him knight in English that the French calleth Cheualier, and the
 Latins Equitem, or Equestris ordinis virum. And when any man is made a
 knight, he kneeling downe is striken of the king or his substitute
 with his sword naked vpon the backe or shoulder, the prince, &c:
 saieng, "Soyes cheualier au nom de Dieu." And when he riseth vp the
 king saith "Aduances bon cheualier." This is the maner of dubbing
 knights at this present, and the tearme (dubbing) is the old tearme
 for that purpose and not creation, howbeit in our time the word
 (making) is most in vse among the common sort.

 [Sidenote: Knights of the bath.]
 At the coronation of a king or queene, there be other knights made
 with longer and more curious ceremonies, called knights of the bath.
 But how soeuer one be dubbed or made knight, his wife is by and by
 called madame or ladie, so well as the barons wife; he himselfe hauing
 added to his name in common appellation this syllable Sir, which is
 the title whereby we call our knights in England. His wife also of
 courtesie so long as she liueth is called my ladie, although she
 happen to marie with a gentleman or man of meane calling, albeit that
 by the c[=o]omon law she hath no such prerogatiue. If hir first
 husband also be of better birth than hir second, though this later
 likewise be a knight, yet in that she pretendeth a priuilege to loose
 no honor through courtesie yeelded to hir sex, she will be named after
 the most honorable or worshipfull of both, which is not seene
 elsewhere.

 [Sidenote: Knights of the garter.]
 The other order of knighthood in England, and the most honorable is
 that of the garter, instituted by king Edward the third, who after he
 had gained manie notable victories, taken king Iohn of France, and
 king Iames of Scotland (and kept them both prisoners in the Tower of
 London at one time) expelled king Henrie of Castile the bastard out of
 his realme, and restored Don Petro vnto it (by the helpe of the prince
 of Wales and duke of Aquitaine his eldest sonne called the Blacke
 prince) he then inuented this societie of honour, and made a choise
 out of his owne realme and dominions, and throughout all christendome
 of the best, most excellent and renowmed persons in all vertues and
 honour, and adorned them with that title to be knights of his order,
 giuing them a garter garnished with gold and pretious stones, to weare
 dailie on the left leg onlie: also a kirtle, gowne, cloke, chaperon,
 collar, and other solemne and magnificent apparell, both of stuffe and
 fashion exquisite & heroicall to weare at high feasts, & as to so high
 and princelie an order apperteineth. Of this companie also he and his
 successors kings and queenes of England, be the souereignes, and the
 rest by certeine statutes and lawes amongst themselues be taken as
 brethren and fellowes in that order, to the number of six and twentie,
 as I find in a certeine treatise written of the same, an example
 whereof I haue here inserted word for word, as it was deliuered vnto
 me, beginning after this maner.

 [Sidenote: Round table.]
 I might at this present make a long tractation of the round table and
 estate of the knights thereof, erected sometimes by Arthur the great
 monarch, of this Iland; and therevnto intreat of the number of his
 knights, and ceremonies belonging to the order, but I thinke in so
 dooing that I should rather set downe the latter inuentions of other
 men, than a true description of such ancient actions as were performed
 in deed. I could furthermore with more facilitie describe the roialtie
 of Charles the great & his twelue peeres, with their solemne rites and
 vsages: but vnto this also I haue no great deuotion, considering the
 truth hereof is now so stained with errours and fables inserted into
 the same by the lewd religious sort, that except a man should professe
 to lie with them for companie, there is little sound knowledge to be
 gathered hereof worthie the remembrance. In like maner diuerse aswell
 subiects as princes haue attempted to restore againe a round table in
 [Sidenote: Roger Mortimer.]
 this land (as for example Roger lord Mortimer at Killingworth) but
 such were the excessiue charges apperteining therevnto (as they did
 make allowance) and so great molestation dailie insued therevpon,
 beside the breeding of sundrie quarrels among the knights, and such as
 resorted hitherto from forreine countries (as it was first vsed) that
 in fine they gaue it ouer, and suffered their whole inuentions to
 perish and decaie, till Edward the third deuised an other order not so
 much pestered with multitude of knights as the round table, but much
 more honorable for princelie port and countenance, as shall appeare
 hereafter.

 [Sidenote: The occasion of the deuise.]
 The order of the garter therefore was deuised in the time of king
 Edward the third, and (as some write) vpon this occasion. The queenes
 maiestie then liuing, being departed from his presence the next waie
 toward hir lodging, he following soone after happened to find hir
 garter, which slacked by chance and so fell from hir leg, vnespied in
 the throng by such as attended vpon hir. His groomes & gentlemen also
 passed by it, disdaining to stoope and take vp such a trifle: but he
 knowing the owner, commanded one of them to staie and reach it vp to
 him. Why and like your grace (saieth a gentleman) it is but some
 womans garter that hath fallen from hir as she followed the queenes
 [Sidenote: Peradventure but a blue ribbon.]
 maiestie. What soeuer it be (quoth the king) take it vp and giue it
 me. So when he had receiued the garter, he said to such as stood about
 him: You my maisters doo make small account of this blue garter here
 (and therewith held it out) but if God lend me life for a few moneths,
 I will make the proudest of you all to reuerence the like. And euen
 vpon this slender occasion he gaue himselfe to the deuising of this
 order. Certes I haue not read of anie thing, that hauing had so simple
 a begining hath growne in the end to so great honour and estimation.
 But to proceed. After he had studied awhile about the performance of
 his deuise, and had set downe such orders as he himselfe inuented
 concerning the same, he proclamed a roiall feast to be holden at
 Windsore, whither all his nobilitie resorted with their ladies, where
 he published his institution, and foorthwith inuested an appointed
 number into the afore said fellowship, whose names insue, himselfe
 being the souereigne and principall of that companie. Next vnto
 himselfe also he placed

 [Sidenote: Election.]
 What order of election, and what estatutes were prescribed vnto the
 elected at this first institution, as yet I can not exactlie
 vnderstand; neither can I learne what euerie prince afterward added
 therevnto before the six and thirtith yeare of king Henrie the eight,
 and third of king Edward the sixt: wherefore of necessitie I must
 resort vnto the estate of the said order as it is at this present,
 which I will set downe so brieflie as I may. When anie man therefore
 is to be elected (vpon a roome found void for his admission) into this
 fellowship, the king directeth his letters vnto him, notwithstanding
 that he before hand be nominated to the same, to this effect. Right
 trustie and welbeloued we greete you well, asserteining you, that in
 consideration aswell of your approoued truth and fidelitie, as also of
 your couragious and valiant acts of knighthood, with other your
 probable merits knowne by experience in sundrie parties and behalfes:
 we with the companions of the noble order of the Garter, assembled at
 the election holden this daie within our manour of N. haue elected and
 chosen you amongst other to be one of the companions of the said
 Order, as your deserts doo condignelie require. Wherefore we will that
 with conuenient diligence vpon the sight herof, you repaire vnto our
 presence, there to receiue such things as to the said order
 apperteineth. Dated vnder our signet at our maner of N. &c. These
 letters are the exemplification of certeine, which (as it should
 seeme) were written An. 3. Edwardi sexti at Greenewich Aprilis 24,

 [Sidenote: Admission.]
 Being elected, preparation is made for his installing at Windsore (the
 place appointed alwaies for this purpose) whereat it is required that
 his banner be set vp, of two yardes and a quarter in length, and three
 quarters in bredth, besides the fringe. Secondlie his sword of
 whatsoeuer length him seemeth good. Thirdlie his helme, which from the
 charnell vpwards ought to be of three inches at the least. Fourthlie

 stuffe and bignesse, as it shall please him to appoint.

 Item a plate of armes at the backe of his stall, and crest with
 mantels and beasts supportant, to be grauen in the mettall.

 Item lodging scutcheons of his armes, inuironed with a garter, and
 painted in paper or cloth of buckram, which when he trauelleth by the
 waie are to be fixed in the common Ins where he dooth lodge, as a
 testimonie of his presence and staies from time to time as he did
 trauell.

 Item two mantels, one to remaine in the college at Windsore, the other
 to vse at his pleasure, with the scutcheon of the armes of S. George
 in the garter with laces, tasselets, and knops of blue silke and gold
 belonging to the same.

 Item a surcote or gowne of red or crimosine veluet, with a whood of
 the same, lined with white sarcenet or damaske.

 Item a collar of the garter of thirtie ounces of gold Troie weight.

 Item a tablet of S. George, richlie garnished with precious stones or
 otherwise.

 Item a garter for his (left) leg, hauing the buckle and pendant
 garnished with gold.

 Item a booke of the statutes of the said order.

 Item a scutcheon of the armes of S. George in the garter to set vpon
 the mantell. And this furniture is to be prouided against his
 installation.

 [Sidenote: Installation.]
 When anie knight is to be installed, he hath with his former letters,
 a garter sent vnto him, and when he commeth to be installed, he is
 brought into the chapter house, where incontinentlie his commission is
 read before the souereigne, or his deputie, and the assemblie present:
 from hence he is lead by two knights of the said order, accompanied
 with the other of the nobilitie, and officers toward the chappell,
 hauing his mantell borne before him, either by a knight of the order,
 or else the king at armes, to whome it secondarilie apperteineth to
 [Sidenote: Mantell.]
 beare it. This mantell shall be deliuered vnto him for his habit,
 after his oth taken before his stall, and not before: which doone, he
 shall returne vnto the chapter house, where the souereigne, or his
 deputie, shall deliuer him his collar, and so he shall haue the full
 [Sidenote: Stall.]
 possession of his habit. As for his stall, it is not giuen according
 vnto the calling and countenance of the receiuer, but as the place is
 that happeneth to be void, so that each one called vnto this
 knighthood (the souereigne, and emperours, and kings, and princes
 alwaies excepted) shall haue the same seat, which became void by the
 death of his predecessor, howsoeuer it fall out: wherby a knight onlie
 oftentimes dooth sit before a duke, without anie murmuring or grudging
 at his roome, except it please the souereigne, once in his life onelie
 to make a generall alteration of those seats, and to set each one
 according to his degree.

 Now as touching the apparell of these knights, it remaineth such as
 king Edward, the first deuiser of this order left it, that is to saie,
 euerie yeare one of the colours, that is to say, scarlet, sanguine in
 grain, blue and white. In like sort the kings grace hath at his
 pleasure the content of cloth for his gowne and whood, lined with
 white satine or damaske, and multitude of garters with letters of
 gold.

 The prince hath fiue yardes of cloth for his gowne and whood, and
 [Sidenote: A timber conteineth fortie skins, peltes, or felles.]
 garters with letters of gold at his pleasure, beside fiue timber of
 the finest mineuer.

 A duke hath fiue yardes of woollen cloth, fiue timber of mineuer, 120
 garters with title of gold.

 A marques hath fiue yards of woollen cloth, fiue timber of mineuer,
 110 garters of silke.

 An earle fiue yardes of woollen cloth, fiue timber of mineuer, and 100
 garters of silke.

 A viscount fiue yardes of woollen cloth, fiue timber of mineuer, 90
 garters of silke.

 A baron fiue yardes of woollen cloth, three timber of mineuer gresse,
 80 garters of silke.

 A banneret fiue yards of woollen cloth, three timber of mineuer, 70
 garters of silke.

 A knight fiue yards of woollen cloth, three timber of mineuer, 60
 garters of silke.

 The bishop of Winchester chapleine of the garter, hath eight and
 twentie timber of mineuer pure, nineteene timber gresse, three timber
 and a halfe of the best, and foure & twentie yards of woollen cloth.

 The chancellor of the order fiue yards of woollen cloth, three timber
 of mineuer pure.

 The register of the order fiue yardes of woollen cloth, three timber
 of mineuer pure.

 And this order to be holden generallie among the knights of this
 companie, which are six and twentie in number, and whose patrone in
 time of superstition was supposed to be S. George, of whome they were
 also called S. Georges knights as I haue heard reported. Would to God
 they might be called knights of honor, or by some other name, for the
 title of saint George argueth a wrong patrone.

 [Sidenote: Installation.]
 Furthermore at his installation he is solemnelie sworne, the maner
 whereof I haue thought good also to annex, in this maner. You being
 chosen to be one of the honorable companie of the order of the Garter,
 shall promise and sweare vpon the holie euangelies by you bodilie
 touched, to be faithfull and true to the kings maiestie, and to
 obserue and keepe all the points of the statutes of the said order,
 and euerie article in them conteined, the same being agreeable and not
 repugnant to the kings highnesse other godlie proceedings, so far as
 to you belongeth & apperteineth, as God you helpe, &c. And thus much
 haue I thought good to note touching the premisses.

 [Sidenote: Estatutes.]
 As touching the estatutes belonging to this order they are manie, and
 therefore not to be touched here. Howbeit if anie doubt doo arise
 aboue the interpretation of them, the king who is the perpetuall
 souereigne of that order hath to determine and resolue the same.
 Neither are anie chosen therevnto vnder the degree of a knight, and
 that is not a gentelman of bloud and of sound estimation.

 [Sidenote: Gentleman of bloud.]
 And for the better vnderstanding what is meant by a gentleman of
 bloud, he is defined to descend of three descents of noblenesse, that
 is to saie, of name and of armes both by father and mother.

 [Sidenote: Degrees of reproch.]
 There are also foure degrees of reproch, which may inhibit from the
 entrance into this order: of which the first is heresie lawfullie
 prooued, the second high treason, the third is flight from the
 battell, the fourth riot and prodigall excesse of expenses, whereby he
 is not likelie to hold out, and mainteine the port of knight of this
 order, according to the dignitie thereof. Moreouer touching the
 [Sidenote: Apparell.]
 wearing of their aforesaid apparell, it is their custome to weare the
 same, when they enter into the chappell of S. George or be in the
 chapter house of their order, or finallie doo go about anie thing
 apperteining to that companie. In like sort they weare also their
 mantels vpon the euen of S. George, and go with the souereigne, or his
 deputie in the same in maner of procession from the kings great
 chamber vnto the chappell, or vnto the college, and likewise backe
 againe vnto the aforsaid place, not putting it from them, vntill
 supper be ended, and the auoid doone. The next daie they resort vnto
 the chappell also in the like order, & from thence vnto diner, wearing
 afterward their said apparell vnto euening praier, and likewise all
 the supper time, vntill the auoid be finished. In the solemnitie
 likewise of these feasts, the thirteene chanons there, and six and
 twentie poore knights haue mantels of the order, whereof those for the
 chanons are of Murreie with a roundell of the armes of S. George, the
 other of red, with a scutcheon onelie of the said armes.

 [Sidenote: Sicke or absent.]
 If anie knight of this order be absent from this solemnitie vpon the
 euen and daie of S. George, and be inforced not to be present either
 through bodilie sicknesse, or his absence out of the land: he dooth in
 the church, chappell, or chamber where he is remaining, prouide an
 honorable stall for the kings maiestie in the right hand of the place
 with a cloth of estat, and cushions, and scutchion of the garter, and
 therein the armes of the order. Also his owne stall of which side
 soeuer it be distant from the kings or the emperours in his owne
 place, appointed so nigh as he can, after the maner and situation of
 his stall at Windsore, there to remaine, the first euening praier on
 the euen of S. George, or three of the clocke, and likewise the next
 daie during the time of the diuine seruice, vntill the morning praier,
 and the rest of the seruice be ended: and to weare in the meane time
 his mantell onelie, with the George and the lace, without either
 whood, collar or surcote. Or if he be so sicke that he doo keepe his
 bed, he dooth vse to haue that habit laid vpon him during the times of
 diuine seruice aforesaid.

 [Sidenote: Offering.]
 At the seruice time also vpon the morrow after S. George, two of the
 chiefe knights (sauing the deputie of the souereigne if he himselfe be
 absent) shall offer the kings banner of armes, then other two the
 sword with the hilts forwards, which being doone the first two shall
 returne againe, and offer the helme and crest, hauing at each time two
 heralds of armes going before, according to the statutes. The lord
 deputie or lieutenant vnto the kings grace, for the time being, alone
 and assisted with one of the chiefe lords, dooth deliuer at his
 offering a peece of gold, and hauing all the king of armes and heralds
 going before him, he so proceedeth to the offering. When he hath thus
 offered for the prince, he returneth with like solemnitie vnto his
 stall, and next of all goeth againe with one herald to offer for
 himselfe, whose oblation being made, euerie knight according to their
 stals, with an herald before him proceedeth to the offering.

 [Sidenote: Buriall.]
 What solemnitie is vsed at the buriall of anie knight of the Garter,
 it is but in vaine to declare: wherefore I will shew generallie what
 is doone at the disgrading of one of these knights, if through anie
 grieuous offense he be separated from this companie. Whereas otherwise
 the signe of the order is neuer taken from him vntill death doo end &
 finish vp his daies. Therfore when anie such thing is doone,
 promulgation is made therof after this maner insuing.

 [Sidenote: Disgrading.]
 Be it knowne vnto all men that N.N. knight of the most noble order of
 the Garter, is found giltie of the abhominable and destestable crime
 of high treason, for he hath most traitorouslie conspired against our
 most high and mightie prince souereigne of the said order, contrarie
 to all right, his dutie, and the faithfull oth, which he hath sworne
 and taken. For which causes therefore he hath deserued to be deposed
 from this noble order, and fellowship of this Garter. For it may not
 be suffered that such a traitor and disloiall member remaine among the
 faithfull knights of renowmed stomach & bountifull prowes, or that his
 armes should be mingled with those of noble chiualrie. Wherefore our
 most excellent prince and supreme of this most honorable order, by the
 aduise and counsell of his collegues, willeth and commandeth that his
 armes which he before time hath deserued shall be from hencefoorth be
 taken awaie and throwne downe: and he himselfe cleane cut off from the
 societie of this renowmed order, and neuer from this daie reputed anie
 more for a member of the same, that all other by his example may
 hereafter beware how they commit the like trespasse, or fall into such
 notorious infamie and rebuke. This notice being giuen, there resorteth
 vnto the partie to be disgraded certeine officers with diuerse of his
 late fellowes appointed, which take from him his George, and other
 inuestiture, after a solemne maner.

 And hitherto of this most honorable order, hoping that no man will be
 offended with me, in vttering thus much. For sith the noble order of
 the Toison Dor or golden fleese, with the ceremonies apperteining vnto
 the creation and inuestiture of the six and thirtie knights thereof:
 and likewise that of saint Michaell and his one and thirtie knights,
 are discoursed vpon at large by the historiographers of their owne
 countries, without reprehension or checke, especiallie by Vincentius
 Lupan. lib. 1. de Mag. Franc. cap. de equitibus ordinis, where he
 calleth them Cheualliers sans reproche, and thereto addeth that their
 chaine is commonlie of two hundred crownes at the least, and honour
 thereof so great, that it is not lawfull for them to sell, giue or
 laie the same to morgage (would to God they might once brooke their
 name, Sans reproche, but their generall deling in our time with all
 men, will not suffer some of the best of their owne countries to haue
 that opinion of them) I trust I haue not giuen anie cause of
 displeasure, briefelie to set foorth those things that apperteine vnto
 our renowmed order of the Garter, in whose compasse is written
 [Sidenote: * Some think that this was the answer of the queene,
 when the king asked what men would think of her,
 in loosing the garter after such a maner.]
 commonlie, [*]"Honi soit qui mal y pense," which is so much to saie,
 as, "Euill come to him that euill thinketh:" a verie sharpe
 imprecation, and yet such as is not contrarie to the word, which
 promiseth like measure to the meter, as he dooth mete to others.

 [Sidenote: Bannerets.]
 There is yet an other order of knights in England called knights
 Bannerets, who are made in the field with the ceremonie of cutting
 awaie the point of his penant of armes, and making it as it were a
 banner, so that being before but a bacheler knight, he is now of an
 higher degree, and allowed to displaie his armes in a banner, as
 barrons doo. Howbeit these knights are neuer made but in the warres,
 the kings standard being vnfolded.

 [Sidenote: Esquire.]
 Esquire (which we call commonlie squire) is a French word, and so much
 in Latine as Scutiger vel armiger, and such are all those which beare
 armes, or armoires, testimonies of their race from whence they be
 descended. They were at the first costerels or bearers of the armes of
 barons, or knights, & thereby being instructed in martiall knowledge,
 had that name for a dignitie giuen to distinguish them from common
 souldiers called Gregarij milites when they were togither in the
 field.

 [Sidenote: Gentlemen.]
 Gentlemen be those whome their race and bloud, or at the least their
 vertues doo make noble and knowne. The Latines call them Nobiles &
 generosos, as the French do Nobles or Gentlehommes. The etymologie of
 the name expoundeth the efficacie of the word: for as Gens in Latine
 betokeneth the race and surname: so the Romans had Cornelios, Sergios,
 Appios, Curios, Papyrios, Scipiones, Fabios, AEmilios, Iulios, Brutos,
 &c: of which, who were Agnati, and therefore kept the name, were also
 called Gentiles, gentlemen of that or that house and race.

 Moreouer as the king dooth dubbe knights, and createth the barons and
 higher degrees, so gentlemen whose ancestors are not knowen to come in
 with William duke of Normandie (for of the Saxon races yet remaining
 we now make none accompt, much lesse of the British issue) doo take
 their beginning in England, after this maner in our times. Who soeuer
 [Sidenote: Lawiers students in vniuersities.]
 [Sidenote: Physicians.]
 [Sidenote: Capteins.]
 studieth the lawes of the realme, who so abideth in the vniuersitie
 giuing his mind to his booke, or professeth physicke and the liberall
 sciences, or beside his seruice in the roome of a capteine in the
 warres, or good counsell giuen at home, whereby his common-wealth is
 benefited, can liue without manuell labour, and thereto is able and
 will beare the port, charge, and countenance of a gentleman, he shall
 for monie haue a cote and armes bestowed vpon him by heralds (who in
 the charter of the same doo of custome pretend antiquitie and seruice,
 and manie gaie things) and therevnto being made so good cheape be
 called master, which is the title that men giue to esquiers and
 gentlemen, and reputed for a gentleman euer after. Which is so much
 the lesse to be disalowed of, for that the prince dooth loose nothing
 by it, the gentleman being so much subiect to taxes and publike
 paiments as is the yeoman or husbandman, which he likewise dooth beare
 the gladlier for the sauing of his reputation. Being called also to
 the warres (for with the gouernment of the common-wealth he medleth
 litle) what soeuer it cost him, he will both arraie & arme himselfe
 accordinglie, and shew the more manly courage, and all the tokens of
 the person which he representeth. No man hath hurt by it but himselfe,
 who peraduenture will go in wider buskens than his legs will beare, or
 as our prouerbe saith, now and then beare a bigger saile than his boat
 is able to susteine.

 Certes the making of new gentlemen bred great strife sometimes amongst
 the Romans, I meane when those which were Noui homines, were more
 allowed of for their vertues newlie seene and shewed, than the old
 smell of ancient race, latelie defaced by the cowardise & euill life
 [Sidenote: * Sic.--qu. de_p_endants?]
 of their nephues & defendants[*] could make the other to be. But as
 enuie hath no affinitie with iustice and equitie, so it forceth not
 what language the malicious doo giue out, against such as are exalted
 for their wisdomes. This neuerthelesse is generallie to be reprehended
 in all estates of gentilitie, and which in short time will turne to
 the great ruine of our countrie, and that is the vsuall sending of
 noblemens & meane gentlemens sonnes into Italie, from whence they
 bring home nothing but meere atheisme, infidelitie, vicious
 conuersation, & ambitious and proud behauiour, wherby it commeth to
 passe that they returne far worsse men than they went out. A gentleman
 at this present is newlie come out of Italie, who went thither an
 earnest protestant, but comming home he could saie after this maner:
 Faith & truth is to be kept, where no losse or hinderance of a further
 purpose is susteined by holding of the same; and forgiuenesse onelie
 to be shewed when full reuenge is made. Another no lesse forward than
 he, at his returne from thence could ad thus much; He is a foole that
 maketh accompt of any religion, but more foole that will loose anie
 part of his wealth, or will come in trouble for constant leaning to
 anie: but if he yeeld to loose his life for his possession, he is
 stark mad, and worthie to be taken for most foole of all the rest.
 This gaie bootie gate these gentlemen by going into Italie, and hereby
 a man may see what fruit is afterward to be looked for where such
 blossoms doo appeere. I care not (saith a third) what you talke to me
 of God, so as I may haue the prince & the lawes of the realme on my
 side. Such men as this last, are easilie knowen; for they haue learned
 in Italie, to go vp and downe also in England, with pages at their
 heeles finelie apparelled, whose face and countenance shall be such as
 sheweth the master not to be blind in his choise. But least I should
 offend too much, I passe ouer to saie anie more of these Italionates
 and their demeanor, which alas is too open and manifest to the world,
 and yet not called into question.

 [Sidenote: Citizens and burgesses.]
 Citizens and burgesses haue next place to gentlemen, who be those that
 are free within the cities, and are of some likelie substance to beare
 office in the same. But these citizens or burgesses are to serue the
 commonwealth in their cities and boroughs, or in corporat townes where
 they dwell. And in the common assemblie of the realme wherein our
 lawes are made, for in the counties they beare but little swaie (which
 assemblie is called the high court of parlement) the ancient cities
 appoint foure, and the boroughs two burgesses to haue voices in it,
 and giue their consent or dissent vnto such things as passe or staie
 there in the name of the citie or borow, for which they are appointed.

 [Sidenote: Merchants.]
 In this place also are our merchants to be installed, as amongst the
 citizens (although they often change estate with gentlemen, as
 gentlemen doo with them, by a mutuall conuersion of the one into the
 other) whose number is so increased in these our daies, that their
 onelie maintenance is the cause of the exceeding prices of forreine
 wares, which otherwise when euerie nation was permitted to bring in
 hir owne commodities, were farre better cheape and more plentifullie
 to be had. Of the want of our commodities here at home, by their great
 transportation of them into other countries, I speake not, sith the
 matter will easilie bewraie it selfe. Certes among the Lacedemonians
 it was found out, that great numbers of merchants were nothing to the
 furtherance of the state of the commonwealth: wherefore it is to be
 wished that the huge heape of them were somewhat restreined, as also
 of our lawiers, so should the rest liue more easilie vpon their owne,
 and few honest chapmen be brought to decaie, by breaking of the
 bankerupt. I doo not denie but that the nauie of the land is in part
 mainteined by their traffike, and so are the high prices of wares kept
 vp now they haue gotten the onelie sale of things, vpon pretense of
 better furtherance of the common-wealth into their owne hands: whereas
 in times past when the strange bottoms were suffered to come in, we
 had sugar for foure pence the pound, that now at the writing of this
 treatise is well worth halfe a crowne, raisons or corints for a penie
 that now are holden at six pence, and sometime at eight pence and ten
 pence the pound: nutmegs at two pence halfe penie the ounce: ginger at
 a penie an ounce, prunes at halfe penie farding: great raisons three
 pound for a penie, cinamon at foure pence the ounce, cloues at two
 pence, and pepper at twelue, and sixteene pence the pound. Whereby we
 may see the sequele of things not alwaies but verie seldome to be such
 as is pretended in the beginning. The wares that they carrie out of
 the realme, are for the most part brode clothes and carsies of all
 colours, likewise cottons, freeses, rugs, tin, wooll, our best beere,
 baies, bustian, mockadoes tufted and plaine, rash, lead, fells, &c:
 which being shipped at sundrie ports of our coasts, are borne from
 thence into all quarters of the world, and there either exchanged for
 other wares or readie monie: to the great gaine and commoditie of our
 merchants. And whereas in times past their cheefe trade was into
 Spaine, Portingall, France, Flanders, Danske, Norwaie, Scotland, and
 Iseland onelie: now in these daies, as men not contented with these
 iournies, they haue sought out the east and west Indies, and made now
 and then suspicious voiages not onelie vnto the Canaries, and new
 Spaine, but likewise into Cathaia, Moscouia, Tartaria, and the regions
 thereabout, from whence (as they saie) they bring home great
 commodities. But alas I see not by all their trauell that the prices
 of things are anie whit abated. Certes this enormitie (for so I doo
 accompt of it) was sufficientlie prouided for, An. 9 Edward 3. by a
 noble estatute made in that behalfe, but vpon what occasion the
 generall execution thereof is staied or not called on, in good sooth I
 cannot tell. This onelie I know, that euerie function and seuerall
 vocation striueth with other, which of them should haue all the water
 of commoditie run into hir owne cesterne.

 [Sidenote: Yeomen.]
 Yeomen are those, which by our law are called Legales homines, free
 men borne English, and may dispend of their owne free land in yearelie
 reuenue, to the summe of fortie shillings sterling, or six pounds as
 monie goeth in our times. Some are of the opinion by Cap. 2. Rich. 2.
 an. 20. that they are the same which the French men call varlets, but
 as that phrase is vsed in my time it is farre vnlikelie to be so. The
 truth is that the word is deriued from the Saxon terme Zeoman or
 Geoman, which signifieth (as I haue read) a settled or staid man, such
 I meane as being maried and of some yeares, betaketh himselfe to staie
 in the place of his abode for the better maintenance of himselfe and
 his familie, whereof the single sort haue no regard, but are likelie
 to be still fleeting now hither now thither, which argueth want of
 stabilitie in determination and resolution of iudgement, for the
 execution of things of anie importance. This sort of people haue a
 certeine preheminence, and more estimation than labourers & the common
 sort of artificers, & these commonlie liue wealthilie, keepe good
 houses, and trauell to get riches. They are also for the most part
 farmers to gentlemen (in old time called Pagani, & opponuntur
 militibus, and therfore Persius calleth himselfe Semipaganus) or at
 the leastwise artificers, & with grasing, frequenting of markets, and
 keeping of seruants (not idle seruants as the gentlemen doo, but such
 as get both their owne and part of their masters liuing) do come to
 great welth, in somuch that manie of them are able and doo buie the
 lands of vnthriftie gentlemen, and often setting their sonnes to the
 schooles, to the vniuersities, and to the Ins of the court; or
 otherwise leauing them sufficient lands wherevpon they may liue
 without labour, doo make them by those meanes to become gentlemen:
 these were they that in times past made all France afraid. And albeit
 they be not called master as gentlemen are, or sir as to knights
 apperteineth, but onelie Iohn and Thomas, &c: yet haue they beene
 [Sidenote: Englishmen on foot and Frenchmen on horssebacke best.]
 found to haue doone verie good seruice: and the kings of England in
 foughten battels, were woont to remaine among them (who were their
 footmen) as the French kings did amongst their horssemen: the prince
 thereby shewing where his chiefe strength did consist.

 [Sidenote: _Capite censi or Proletarij._]
 The fourth and last sort of people in England are daie labourers,
 poore husbandmen, and some retailers (which haue no free land) copie
 holders, and all artificers, as tailers, shomakers, carpenters,
 [Sidenote: No slaues nor bondmen in England.]
 brickmakers, masons, &c. As for slaues and bondmen we haue none, naie
 such is the priuilege of our countrie by the especiall grace of God,
 and bountie of our princes, that if anie come hither from other
 realms, so soone as they set foot on land they become so free of
 condition as their masters, whereby all note of seruile bondage is
 vtterlie remooued from them, wherein we resemble (not the Germans who
 had slaues also, though such as in respect of the slaues of other
 countries might well be reputed free, but) the old Indians and the
 Taprobanes, who supposed it a great iniurie to nature to make or
 suffer them to be bond, whome she in hir woonted course dooth product
 and bring foorth free. This fourth and last sort of people therefore
 haue neither voice nor authoritie in the common wealth, but are to be
 ruled, and not to rule other: yet they are not altogither neglected,
 for in cities and corporat townes, for default of yeomen they are
 faine to make up their inquests of such maner of people. And in
 villages they are commonlie made churchwardens, sidemen, aleconners,
 now and then constables, and manie times inioie the name of
 hedboroughes. Vnto this sort also may our great swarmes of idle
 seruing men be referred, of whome there runneth a prouerbe; Yoong
 seruing men old beggers, bicause seruice is none heritage. These men
 are profitable to none, for if their condition be well perused, they
 are enimies to their masters, to their freends, and to themselues: for
 by them oftentimes their masters are incouraged vnto vnlawfull
 exactions of their tenants, their freends brought vnto pouertie by
 their rents inhanced, and they themselues brought to confusion by
 their owne prodigalitie and errors, as men that hauing not wherewith
 of their owne to mainteine their excesses, doo search in high waies,
 budgets, cofers, males, and stables, which way to supplie their wants.
 How diuerse of them also coueting to beare an high saile doo insinuate
 themselues with yoong gentlemen and noble men newlie come to their
 lands, the case is too much apparant, whereby the good natures of the
 parties are not onelie a little impaired, but also their liuelihoods
 and reuenues so wasted and consumed, that if at all yet not in manie
 yeares they shall be able to recouer themselues. It were verie good
 therefore that the superfluous heapes of them were in part diminished.
 And sith necessitie inforceth to haue some, yet let wisdome moderate
 their numbers, so shall their masters be rid of vnnecessarie charge,
 and the common wealth of manie theeues. No nation cherisheth such
 store of them as we doo here in England, in hope of which maintenance
 manie giue themselues to idlenesse, that otherwise would be brought to
 labour, and liue in order like subiects. Of their whoredomes I will
 not speake anie thing at all, more than of their swearing, yet is it
 found that some of them doo make the first a cheefe piller of their
 building, consuming not onelie the goods but also the health & welfare
 of manie honest gentlemen, citizens, wealthie yeomen, &c: by such
 vnlawfull dealings. But how farre haue I waded in this point, or how
 farre may I saile in such a large sea? I will therefore now staie to
 speake anie more of those kind of men. In returning therefore to my
 matter, this furthermore among other things I haue to saie of our
 husbandmen and artificers, that they were neuer so excellent in their
 trades as at this present. But as the workemanship of the later sort
 was neuer more fine and curious to the eie, so was it neuer lesse
 strong and substantiall for continuance and benefit of the buiers.
 Neither is there anie thing that hurteth the common sort of our
 artificers more than hast, and a barbarous or slauish desire to turne
 the penie, and by ridding their worke to make speedie vtterance of
 their wares: which inforceth them to bungle vp and dispatch manie
 things they care not how so they be out of their hands, whereby the
 buier is often sore defrauded, and findeth to his cost, that hast
 maketh wast, according to the prouerbe.

 Oh how manie trades and handicrafts are now in England, whereof the
 common wealth hath no need? How manie needfull commodities haue we
 which are perfected with great cost, &c: and yet may with farre more
 ease and lesse cost be prouided from other countries if we could vse
 the meanes. I will not speake of iron, glasse, and such like, which
 spoile much wood, and yet are brought from other countries better
 cheepe than we can make them here at home, I could exemplifie also in
 manie other. But to leaue these things and proceed with our purpose,
 and herein (as occasion serueth) generallie by waie of conclusion to
 speake of the common-wealth of England, I find that it is gouerned and
 mainteined by three sorts of persons.

 1 The prince, monarch, and head gouernour, which is called the king,
 or (if the crowne fall to the woman) the queene: in whose name and by
 whose authoritie all things are administred.

 2 The gentlemen, which be diuided into two sorts, as the baronie or
 estate of lords (which conteineth barons and all aboue that degree)
 and also those that be no lords, as knights, esquiers, & simple
 gentlemen, as I haue noted alreadie. Out of these also are the great
 deputies and high presidents chosen, of which one serueth in Ireland,
 as another did sometime in Calis, and the capteine now at Berwike; as
 one lord president dooth gouerne in Wales, and the other the north
 parts of this Iland, which later with certeine councellors and iudges
 were erected by king Henrie the eight. But forsomuch as I haue touched
 their conditions elsewhere, it shall be inough to haue remembred them
 at this time.

 3 The third and last sort is named the yeomanrie, of whom & their
 sequele, the labourers and artificers, I haue said somewhat euen now.
 Whereto I ad that they be not called masters and gentlemen, but
 goodmen, as goodman Smith, goodman Coot, goodman Cornell, goodman
 Mascall, goodman Cockswet, &c: & in matters of law these and the like
 are called thus, Giles lewd-yeoman, Edward Mountford yeoman, Iames
 Cocke yeoman, Herrie Butcher yeoman, &c: by which addition they are
 exempt from the vulgar and common sorts. Cato calleth them Aratores &
 optimos ciues rei publicae, of whom also you may read more in the booke
 of common wealth which sir Thomas Smith sometime penned of this land.

 Of gentlemen also some are by the prince chosen, and called to great
 offices in the common wealth, of which said offices diuerse concerne
 the whole realme; some be more priuat and peculiar to the kings house.
 And they haue their places and degrees, prescribed by an act of
 parlement made An. 31 Henr. octaui, after this maner insuing.

 These foure the lord Chancellor, the lord Treasuror (who is Supremus
 aerarij Anglici quaestor _or_ Tribunus aerarius maximus) the lord
 President of the councell, and the lord Priuie seale, being persons of
 the degree of a baron or aboue, are in the same act appointed to sit
 in the parlement and in all assemblies or councell aboue all dukes,
 not being of the bloud roiall, Videlicet the kings brother, vncle, or
 nephue.

 And these six, the lord great Chamberleine of England: the lord high
 Constable of England: the lord Marshall of England: the lord Admirall
 of England: the lord great master or Steward of the kings house: and
 the lord Chamberleine: by that act are to be placed in all assemblies
 of councell, after the lord priuie seale, according to their degrees
 and estats: so that if he be a baron, then he is to sit aboue all
 barons: or an earle, aboue all earles.

 And so likewise the kings secretarie, being a baron of the parlement,
 hath place aboue all barons, and if he be a man of higher degree, he
 shall sit and be placed according therevnto.

 good also to note out of an ancient president.




 OF THE FOOD AND DIET OF THE ENGLISH.

 CHAP. VI.


 The situation of our region, lieng neere vnto the north, dooth cause
 the heate of our stomaches to be of somewhat greater force: therefore
 our bodies doo craue a little more ample nourishment, than the
 inhabitants of the hotter regions are accustomed withall, whose
 digestiue force is not altogither so vehement, bicause their internall
 heat is not so strong as ours, which is kept in by the coldnesse of
 the aire, that from time to time (speciallie in winter) dooth enuiron
 our bodies.

 It is no maruell therefore that our tables are oftentimes more
 plentifullie garnished than those of other nations, and this trade
 hath continued with vs euen since the verie beginning. For before the
 Romans found out and knew the waie vnto our countrie, our predecessors
 fed largelie vpon flesh and milke, whereof there was great aboundance
 in this Ile, bicause they applied their cheefe studies vnto pasturage
 and feeding. After this maner also did our Welsh Britons order
 themselues in their diet so long as they liued of themselues, but
 after they became to be vnited and made equall with the English they
 framed their appetites to liue after our maner, so that at this daie
 there is verie little difference betweene vs in our diets.

 In Scotland likewise they haue giuen themselues (of late yeares to
 speake of) vnto verie ample and large diet, wherein as for some
 respect nature dooth make them equall with vs: so otherwise they far
 exceed vs in ouer much and distemperate gormandize, and so ingrosse
 their bodies that diuerse of them doo oft become vnapt to anie other
 purpose than to spend their times in large tabling and bellie cheere.
 Against this pampering of their carcasses dooth Hector Boetius in his
 description of the countrie verie sharpelie inueigh in the first
 chapter of that treatise. Henrie Wardlaw also bishop of S. Andrewes,
 noting their vehement alteration from competent frugalitie into
 excessiue gluttonie, to be brought out of England with Iames the first
 (who had beene long time prisoner there vnder the fourth & fift
 Henries, and at his returne caried diuerse English gentlemen into his
 countrie with him, whome he verie honorablie preferred there) dooth
 vehementlie exclame against the same in open parlement holden at Perth
 1433, before the three estats, and so bringeth his purpose to passe in
 the end by force of his learned persuasions, that a law was presentlie
 made there for the restreint of superfluous diet, amongest other
 things baked meats (dishes neuer before this mans daies seene in
 Scotland) were generallie so prouided for by vertue of this act, that
 it was not lawfull for anie to eat of the same vnder the degree of a
 gentleman, and those onelie but on high and festiuall daies, but alas
 it was soone forgotten.

 In old time these north Britons did giue themselues vniuersallie to
 great abstinence, and in time of warres their souldiers would often
 feed but once or twise at the most in two or three daies (especiallie
 if they held themselues in secret, or could haue no issue out of their
 bogges and marises, through the presence of the enimie) and in this
 distresse they vsed to eat a certeine kind of confection, whereof so
 much as a beane would qualifie their hunger aboue common expectation.
 In woods moreouer they liued with hearbes and rootes, or if these
 shifts serued not thorough want of such prouision at hand, then vsed
 they to creepe into the water or said moorish plots vp vnto the chins,
 and there remaine a long time, onelie to qualifie the heats of their
 stomachs by violence, which otherwise would haue wrought and beene
 readie to oppresse them for hunger and want of sustinance. In those
 daies likewise it was taken for a great offense ouer all, to eat
 either goose, hare, or henne, bicause of a certeine superstitious
 opinion which they had conceiued of those three creatures, howbeit
 after that the Romans (I saie) had once found an entrance into this
 Iland, it was not long yer open shipwracke was made of this religious
 obseruation, so that in processe of time, so well the north and south
 Britons as the Romans, gaue ouer to make such difference in meats, as
 they had doone before.

 From thencefoorth also vnto our daies, and euen in this season wherein
 we liue, there is no restreint of anie meat, either for religions sake
 or publike order in England, but it is lawfull for euerie man to feed
 vpon what soeuer he is able to purchase, except it be vpon those daies
 whereon eating of flesh is especiallie forbidden by the lawes of the
 realme, which order is taken onelie to the end our numbers of cattell
 may be the better increased, & that aboundance of fish which the sea
 yeeldeth, more generallie receiued. Beside this there is great
 consideration had in making of this law for the preseruation of the
 nauie, and maintenance of conuenient numbers of sea faring men, both
 which would otherwise greatlie decaie, if some meanes were not found
 whereby they might be increased. But how soeuer this case standeth,
 white meats, milke, butter & cheese, which were neuer so deere as in
 my time, and woont to be accounted of as one of the chiefe staies
 throughout the Iland, are now reputed as food appertinent onelie to
 the inferiour sort, whilest such as are more wealthie, doo feed vpon
 the flesh of all kinds of cattell accustomed to be eaten, all sorts of
 fish taken vpon our coasts and in our fresh riuers, and such
 diuersitie of wild and tame foules as are either bred in our Iland or
 brought ouer vnto vs from other countries of the maine.

 In number of dishes and change of meat, the nobilitie of England
 (whose cookes are for the most part musicall headed Frenchmen and
 strangers) doo most exceed, sith there is no daie in maner that
 passeth ouer their heads, wherein they haue not onelie beefe, mutton,
 veale, lambe, kid, porke, conie, capon, pig, or so manie of these as
 the season yeeldeth: but also some portion of the red or fallow deere,
 beside great varietie of fish and wild foule, and thereto sundrie
 other delicates wherein the sweet hand of the seafaring Portingale is
 not wanting: so that for a man to dine with one of them, and to tast
 of euerie dish that standeth before him (which few vse to doo, but ech
 one feedeth vpon that meat him best liketh for the time, the beginning
 of euerie dish notwithstanding being reserued vnto the greatest
 personage that sitteth at the table, to whome it is drawen vp still by
 the waiters as order requireth, and from whome it descendeth againe
 euen to the lower end, whereby each one may tast thereof) is rather to
 yeeld vnto a conspiracie with a great deale of meat for the speedie
 suppression of naturall health, then the vse of a necessarie meane to
 satisfie himselfe with a competent repast, to susteine his bodie
 withall. But as this large feeding is not seene in their gests, no
 more is it in their owne persons, for sith they haue dailie much
 resort vnto their tables (and manie times vnlooked for) and thereto
 reteine great numbers of seruants, it is verie requisit & expedient
 for them to be somewhat plentifull in this behalfe.

 The chiefe part likewise of their dailie prouision is brought in
 before them (commonlie in siluer vessell if they be of the degree of
 barons, bishops and vpwards) and placed on their tables, wherof when
 they haue taken what it pleaseth them, the rest is reserued, and
 afterward sent downe to their seruing men and waiters, who feed
 thereon in like sort with conuenient moderation, their reuersion also
 being bestowed vpon the poore, which lie readie at their gates in
 great numbers to receiue the same. This is spoken of the principall
 tables whereat the nobleman, his ladie and guestes are accustomed to
 sit, beside which they haue a certeine ordinarie allowance dailie
 appointed for their hals, where the chiefe officers and household
 seruants (for all are not permitted by custome to waite vpon their
 master) and with them such inferiour guestes doo feed as are not of
 calling to associat the noble man himselfe (so that besides those
 afore mentioned, which are called to the principall table, there are
 commonlie fortie or three score persons fed in those hals, to the
 great reliefe of such poore sutors and strangers also as oft be
 partakers thereof and otherwise like to dine hardlie. As for drinke it
 is vsuallie filled in pots, gobblets, iugs, bols of siluer in noble
 mens houses, also in fine Venice glasses of all formes, and for want
 of these elsewhere in pots of earth of sundrie colours and moulds
 whereof manie are garnished with siluer) or at the leastwise in
 pewter, all which notwithstanding are seldome set on the table, but
 each one as necessitie vrgeth, calleth for a cup of such drinke as him
 listeth to haue: so that when he hath tasted of it he deliuered the
 cup againe to some one of the standers by, who making it cleane by
 pouring out the drinke that remaineth, restoreth it to the cupbord
 from whence he fetched the same. By this deuise (a thing brought vp at
 the first by Mnesteus of Athens, in conseruation of the honour of
 Orestes, who had not yet made expiation for the death of his
 adulterous parents Egistus and Clitemnestra) much idle tippling is
 furthermore cut off, for if the full pots should continuallie stand at
 the elbow or neere the trencher, diuerse would alwaies be dealing with
 them, whereas now they drinke seldome and onelie when necessitie
 vrgeth, and so auoid the note of great drinking, or often troubling of
 the seruitours with filling of their bols. Neuerthelesse in the noble
 mens hals, this order is not vsed, neither in anie mans house
 commonlie vnder the degree of a knight or esquire of great reuenues.
 It is a world to see in these our daies, wherin gold and siluer most
 aboundeth, how that our gentilitie as lothing those mettals (bicause
 of the plentie) do now generallie choose rather the Venice glasses
 both for our wine and beere, than anie of those mettals or stone
 wherein before time we haue beene accustomed to drinke, but such is
 the nature of man generallie that it most coueteth things difficult to
 be atteined; & such is the estimation of this stuffe, that manie
 become rich onelie with their new trade vnto Murana (a towne neere to
 Venice situat on the Adriatike sea) from whence the verie best are
 dailie to be had, and such as for beautie doo well neere match the
 christall or the ancient Murrhina vasa, whereof now no man hath
 knowledge. And as this is seene in the gentilitie, so in the wealthie
 communaltie the like desire of glasse is not neglected, whereby the
 gaine gotten by their purchase is yet much more increased to the
 benefit of the merchant. The poorest also will haue glasse if they
 may, but sith the Venecian is somewhat too deere for them, they
 content themselues with such as are made at home of ferne and burned
 stone, but in fine all go one waie, that is, to shards at the last, so
 that our great expenses in glasses (beside that they breed much strife
 toward such as haue the charge of them) are worst of all bestowed in
 mine opinion, bicause their peeces doo turne vnto no profit. If the
 [Sidenote: Ro. Bacon.]
 philosophers stone were once found, and one part hereof mixed with
 fortie of molten glasse, it would induce such a mettallicall
 toughnesse therevnto, that a fall should nothing hurt it in such
 maner, yet it might peraduenture bunch or batter it, neuerthelesse
 that inconuenience were quickelie to be redressed by the hammer. But
 whither am I slipped?

 The gentlemen and merchants keepe much about one rate, and each of
 them contenteth himselfe with foure, fiue, or six dishes, when they
 haue but small resort, or peraduenture with one, or two, or three at
 the most, when they haue no strangers to accompanie them at their
 tables. And yet their seruants haue their ordinarie diet assigned,
 beside such as is left at their masters boordes, & not appointed to be
 brought thither the second time, which neuerthelesse is often seene
 generallie in venison, lambe, or some especiall dish, whereon the
 merchant man himselfe liketh to feed when it is cold, or peraduenture
 for sundrie causes incident to the feeder is better so, than if it
 were warme or hot. To be short, at such time as the merchants doo make
 their ordinarie or voluntarie feasts, it is a world to see what great
 prouision is made of all maner of delicat meats, from euerie quarter
 of the countrie, wherein beside that they are often comparable herein
 to the nobilitie of the land, they will seldome regard anie thing that
 the butcher vsuallie killeth, but reiect the same as not worthie to
 come in place. In such cases also geliffes of all colours mixed with a
 varietie in the representation of sundrie floures, herbs, trees,
 formes of beasts, fish, foules and fruits, and therevnto marchpaine
 wrought with no small curiositie, tarts of diuerse hewes and sundrie
 denominations, conserues of old fruits forren and home-bred, suckets,
 codinacs, marmilats, marchpaine, sugerbread, gingerbread, florentines,
 wild foule, venison of all sorts, and sundrie outlandish confections,
 altogether seasoned with suger (which Plinie calleth Mel ex
 arundinibus, a deuise not common nor greatlie vsed in old time at the
 table, but onelie in medicine, although it grew in Arabia, India &
 Sicilia) doo generallie beare the swaie, besides infinit deuises of
 our owne not possible for me to remember. Of the potato and such
 venerous roots as are brought out of Spaine, Portingale, and the
 Indies to furnish vp our bankets, I speake not, wherin our Mures of no
 lesse force, and to be had about Crosbie Rauenswath, doo now begin to
 haue place.

 But among all these, the kind of meat which is obteined with most
 difficultie and cost, is commonlie taken for the most delicat, and
 therevpon each guest will soonest desire to feed. And as all estats
 doo exceed herin, I meane for strangenesse and number of costlie
 dishes, so these forget not to vse the like excesse in wine, in somuch
 as there is no kind to be had (neither anie where more store of all
 sorts than in England, although we haue none growing with vs but
 yearelie to the proportion of 20000 or 30000 tun and vpwards,
 notwithstanding the dailie restreincts of the same brought ouer vnto
 vs) wherof at great meetings there is not some store to be had.
 Neither doo I meane this of small wines onlie, as Claret, White, Red,
 French, &c: which amount to about fiftie six sorts, according to the
 number of regions from whence they come: but also of the thirtie kinds
 of Italian, Grecian, Spanish, Canarian, &c: whereof Veruage, Cate
 pument, Raspis, Muscadell, Romnie, Bastard Tire, Oseie, Caprike,
 Clareie & Malmeseie are not least of all accompted of, bicause of
 their strength and valure. For as I haue said in meat, so the stronger
 the wine is, the more it is desired, by means wherof in old time, the
 best was called Theologicum, bicause it was had from the cleargie and
 religious men, vnto whose houses manie of the laitie would often send
 for bottels filled with the same, being sure that they would neither
 drinke nor be serued of the worst, or such as was anie waies mingled
 or brued by the vintener: naie the merchant would haue thought that
 his soule should haue gone streightwaie to the diuell, if he should
 haue serued them with other than the best. Furthermore when these haue
 had their course which nature yeeldeth, sundrie sorts of artificiall
 stuffe, as ypocras & wormewood wine must in like maner succeed in
 their turnes, beside stale ale and strong beere, which neuerthelesse
 beare the greatest brunt in drinking, and are of so manie sorts and
 ages as it pleaseth the bruer to make them.

 [Sidenote: Beere.]
 The beere that is vsed at noble mens tables in their fixed and
 standing houses, is commonlie of a yeare old, or peraduenture of two
 yeares tunning or more, but this is not generall. It is also brued in
 March and therefore called March beere, but for the household it is
 vsuallie not vnder a moneths age, ech one coueting to haue the same
 stale as he may, so that it be not sowre, and his bread new as is
 possible so that it be not hot.

 [Sidenote: Artificer.]
 The artificer and husbandman make greatest accompt of such meat as
 they may soonest come by, and haue it quickliest readie, except it be
 in London when the companies of euery trade doo meet on their quarter
 daies, at which time they be nothing inferiour to the nobilitie. Their
 food also consisteth principallie in beefe and such meat as the
 butcher selleth, that is to saie, mutton, veale, lambe, porke, &c:
 whereof he findeth great store in the markets adioining, beside souse,
 brawne, bacon, fruit, pies of fruit, foules of sundrie sorts, cheese,
 butter, egs, &c: as the other wanteth it not at home, by his owne
 prouision, which is at the best hand, and commonlie least charge. In
 feasting also this latter sort, I meane the husbandmen doo exceed
 after their maner: especiallie at bridales, purifications of women,
 and such od meetings, where it is incredible to tell what meat is
 consumed & spent, ech one bringing such a dish, or so manie with him
 as his wife & he doo consult vpon, but alwaies with this
 consideration, that the leefer freend shall haue the better prouision.
 This also is commonlie seene at these bankets, that the good man of
 the house is not charged with any thing sauing bread, drink, sauce,
 houseroome, and fire. But the artificers in cities and good townes doo
 deale far otherwise, for albeit that some of them doo suffer their
 iawes to go oft before their clawes, and diuerse of them by making
 good cheere doo hinder themselues and other men: yet the wiser sort
 can handle the matter well inough in these iunkettings, and therfore
 their frugalitie deserueth commendation. To conclude, both the
 artificer and the husbandman are sufficientlie liberall, & verie
 freendlie at their tables, and when they meet, they are so merie
 without malice, and plaine without inward Italian or French craft and
 subtiltie, that it would doo a man good to be in companie among them.
 Herein onelie are the inferiour sort somewhat to be blamed, that being
 thus assembled, their talke is now and then such as sauoureth of
 scurrilitie and ribaldrie, a thing naturallie incident to carters and
 clownes, who thinke themselues not to be merie & welcome, if their
 foolish veines in this behalfe be neuer so little restreined. This is
 moreouer to be added in these meetings, that if they happen to stumble
 vpon a peece of venison, and a cup of wine or verie strong beere or
 ale (which latter they commonlie prouide against their appointed
 daies) they thinke their cheere so great, and themselues to haue fared
 [Sidenote: I haue dined so well as my lord maior.]
 so well, as the lord Maior of London, with whome when their bellies be
 full they will not often sticke to make comparison, because that of a
 subiect there is no publike officer of anie citie in Europe, that may
 compare in port and countenance with him during the time of his
 office.

 I might here talke somewhat of the great silence that is vsed at the
 tables of the honorable and wiser sort, generallie ouer all the realme
 (albeit that too much deserueth no c[=o]mendation, for it belongeth to
 gests neither to be muti nor loquaces) likewise of the moderate eating
 and drinking that is dailie seene, and finallie of the regard that
 each one hath to keepe himselfe from the note of surffetting and
 dronkennesse (for which cause salt meat, except beefe, bacon, and
 porke are not anie whit esteemed, and yet these three may not be much
 powdered) but as in rehearsall thereof I should commend the noble man,
 merchant, and frugall artificer, so I could not cleare the meaner sort
 of husbandmen, and countrie inhabitants of verie much babbling (except
 it be here and there some od yeoman) with whome he is thought to be
 the meriest that talketh of most ribaldrie, or the wisest man that
 speaketh fastest among them, & now and then surffetting and
 dronkennesse, which they rather fall into for want of heed taking,
 than wilfullie following or delighting in those errours of set mind
 and purpose. It may be that diuers of them liuing at home with hard
 and pinching diet, small drinke, and some of them hauing scarse inough
 of that, are soonest ouertaken when they come vnto such bankets,
 howbeit they take it generallie as no small disgrace if they happen to
 be cupshotten, so that it is a greefe vnto them though now sans
 remedie sith the thing is doone and past. If the freends also of the
 wealthier sort come to their houses from farre, they are commonlie so
 welcome till they depart as vpon the first daie of their comming,
 wheras in good townes and cities, as London, &c: men oftentimes
 complaine of little roome, and in reward of a fat capon or plentie of
 beefe and mutton, largelie bestowed vpon them in the countrie, a cup
 of wine or beere with a napkin to wipe their lips, and an "You are
 heartelie welcome" is thought to be great interteinement, and
 therefore the old countrie clearkes haue framed this saieng in that
 behalfe, I meane vpon the interteinment of townesmens and Londoners
 after the daies of their aboad in this maner:

   Primus iucundus, tollerabilis estq; secundus,
   Tertius est vanus, sed fetet quatriduanus.

 [Sidenote: Bread.]
 The bread through out the land is made of such graine as the soile
 yeeldeth, neuerthelesse the gentilitie commonlie prouide themselues
 sufficientlie of wheat for their owne tables, whilest their household
 and poore neighbours in some shires are inforced to content themselues
 with rie, or barleie, yea and in time of dearth manie with bread made
 either of beans, peason, or otes, or of altogither and some acornes
 among, of which scourge the poorest doo soonest tast, sith they are
 least able to prouide themselues of better. I will not saie that this
 extremitie is oft so well to be seene in time of plentie as of dearth,
 but if I should I could easilie bring my triall. For albeit that there
 be much more ground eared now almost in euerie place, than hath beene
 of late yeares, yet such a price of corne continueth in each towne and
 market without any iust cause (except it be that landlords doo get
 licences to carie corne out of the land onelie to keepe vp the peeces
 for their owne priuate gaines and ruine of the common-wealth) that the
 artificer and poore laboring man, is not able to reach vnto it, but
 [Sidenote: A famine at hand is first seene in the horsse manger
 when the poore doo fall to horssecorne.]
 is driuen to content himselfe with horsse-corne, I meane, beanes,
 peason, otes, tares, and lintels: and therefore it is a true prouerbe,
 and neuer so well verified as now, that hunger setteth his first foot
 into the horsse manger. If the world last a while after this rate,
 wheate and rie will be no graine for poore men to feed on, and some
 caterpillers there are that can saie so much alreadie.

 Of bread made of wheat we haue sundrie sorts, dailie brought to the
 table, whereof the first and most excellent is the mainchet, which we
 [Sidenote: Primarius panis.]
 commonlie call white bread, in Latine Primarius panis, wherof Budeus
 also speaketh, in his first booke De asse, and our good workemen
 deliuer commonlie such proportion, that of the flower of one bushell
 with another they make fortie cast of manchet, of which euerie lofe
 weigheth eight ounces into the ouen and six ounces out, as I haue
 [Sidenote: Cheat bread.]
 beene informed. The second is the cheat or wheaton bread, so named
 bicause the colour therof resembleth the graie or yellowish wheat,
 being cleane and well dressed, and out of this is the coursest of the
 [Sidenote: Rauelled bread.]
 bran (vsuallie called gurgeons or pollard) taken. The raueled is a
 kind of cheat bread also, but it reteineth more of the grosse, and
 lesse of the pure substance of the wheat: and this being more
 sleightlie wrought vp, is vsed in the halles of the nobilitie, and
 gentrie onelie, whereas the other either is or should be baked in
 [Sidenote: The size of bread is verie ill kept or not at all
 looked vnto in the countrie townes and markets.]
 cities & good townes of an appointed size (according to such price as
 the corne dooth beare) and by a statute prouided by king Iohn in that
 behalfe. The raueled cheat therfore is generallie so made that out of
 one bushell of meale, after two and twentie pounds of bran be sifted
 and taken from it (wherevnto they ad the gurgeons that rise from the
 manchet) they make thirtie cast, euerie lofe weighing eighteene ounces
 into the ouen and sixteene ounces out: and beside this they so handle
 the matter that to euerie bushell of meale they ad onelie two and
 twentie or three and twentie pound of water, washing also in some
 houses there corne before it go to the mill, whereby their manchet
 bread is more excellent in colour and pleasing to the eie, than
 [Sidenote: Browne bread.]
 otherwise it would be. The next sort is named browne bread of the
 colour, of which we haue two sorts, one baked vp as it c[=o]meth from
 the mill, so that neither the bran nor the floure are anie whit
 diminished, this Celsus called Autopirus panis, lib. 2. and putteth it
 in the second place of nourishment. The other hath little or no floure
 [Sidenote: Panis Cibarius.]
 left therein at all, howbeit he calleth it Panem Cibarium, and it is
 not onlie the woorst and weakest of all the other sorts, but also
 appointed in old time for seruants, slaues, and the inferiour kind of
 people to feed vpon. Herevnto likewise, bicause it is drie and brickie
 in the working (for it will hardlie be made vp handsomelie into
 loaues) some adde a portion of rie meale in our time, whereby the
 rough drinesse or drie roughnes therof is somwhat qualified, & then it
 is named miscelin, that is, bread made of mingled corne, albeit that
 diuerse doo sow or mingle wheat & rie of set purpose at the mill, or
 before it come there, and sell the same at the markets vnder the
 aforesaid name.

 [Sidenote: Summer wheat and winter barleie verie rare in England.]
 In champeigne countries much rie and barleie bread is eaten, but
 especiallie where wheat is scant and geson. As for the difference that
 is betweene the summer and winter wheat, most husbandmen know it not,
 sith they are neither acquainted with summer wheat, nor winter
 barleie: yet here and there I find of both sorts, speciallie in the
 north and about Kendall, where they call it March wheat, and also of
 summer rie, but in so small quantities as that I dare not pronounce
 them to be greatlie common among vs.

 [Sidenote: Drinke.]
 Our drinke, whose force and continuance is partlie touched alreadie,
 is made of barleie, water, and hops, sodden and mingled togither, by
 the industrie of our bruers, in a certeine exact proportion. But
 before our barleie doo come vnto their hands, it susteineth great
 [Sidenote: Malt.]
 alteration, and is conuerted into malt, the making whereof, I will
 here set downe in such order, as my skill therein may extend vnto (for
 I am scarse a good malster) chiefelie for that forreine writers haue
 attempted to describe the same, and the making of our beere, wherein
 they haue shot so farre wide, as the quantitie of ground was betweene
 themselues & their marke. In the meane time beare with me, gentle
 reader (I beseech thee) that lead thee from the description of the
 plentifull diet of our countrie, vnto the fond report of a seruile
 trade, or rather from a table delicatelie furnished, into a mustie
 malthouse: but such is now thy hap, wherfore I praie thee be
 contented.

 [Sidenote: Making of malt.]
 Our malt is made all the yeare long in some great townes, but in
 gentlemens and yeomens houses, who commonlie make sufficient for their
 owne expenses onelie, the winter halfe is thought most meet for that
 commoditie: howbeit the malt that is made when the willow dooth bud,
 is commonlie worst of all, neuerthelesse each one indeuoureth to make
 it of the best barleie, which is steeped in a cesterne, in greater or
 less quantitie, by the space of three daies and three nights, vntill
 it be throughlie soked. This being doone, the water is drained from it
 by little and little, till it be quite gone. Afterward they take it
 out, and laieng it vpon the cleane floore on a round heape, it resteth
 so vntill it be readie to shoote at the root end, which maltsters call
 Comming. When it beginneth therefore to shoot in this maner, they saie
 it is come, and then foorthwith they spread it abroad, first thicke,
 and afterward thinner and thinner vpon the said floore (as it commeth)
 and there it lieth (with turning euerie daie foure or fiue times) by
 the space of one and twentie daies at the least, the workeman not
 suffering it in anie wise to take anie heat, whereby the bud end
 should spire, that bringeth foorth the blade, and by which ouersight
 or hurt of the stuffe it selfe the malt would be spoiled, and turne
 small commoditie to the bruer. When it hath gone or beene turned so
 long vpon the floore, they carie it to a kill couered with haire
 cloth, where they giue it gentle heats (after they haue spread it
 there verie thin abroad) till it be drie, & in the meane while they
 turne it often, that it may be vniformelie dried. For the more it be
 dried (yet must it be doone with soft fire) the sweeter and better the
 malt is, and the longer it will continue, whereas if it be not dried
 downe (as they call it) but slackelie handled, it will breed a kind of
 worme, called a wiuell, which groweth in the floure of the corne, and
 in processe of time will so eat out it selfe, that nothing shall
 remaine of the graine but euen the verie rind or huske.

 The best malt is tried by the hardnesse & colour, for if it looke
 fresh with a yellow hew, & thereto will write like a peece of chalke,
 after you haue bitten a kirnell in sunder in the middest, then you may
 assure your selfe that it is dried downe. In some places it is dried
 at leisure with wood alone, or strawe alone, in other with wood and
 strawe togither, but of all the strawe dried, is the most excellent.
 For the wood dried malt when it is brued, beside that the drinke is
 higher of colour, it dooth hurt and annoie the head of him that is not
 vsed thereto, bicause of the smoake. Such also as vse both
 indifferentlie doo barke, cleaue, and drie their wood in an ouen,
 thereby to remooue all moisture that shuld procure the fume, and this
 malt is in the second place, & with the same likewise, that which is
 made with dried firze, broome, &c: whereas if they also be occupied
 greene, they are in maner so preiudiciall to the corne, as is the
 moist wood. And thus much of our malts, in bruing whereof some grinde
 the same somewhat groselie, and in seething well the liquor that shall
 be put vnto it, they adde to euerie nine quarters of mault one of
 headcorne, which consisteth of sundrie graine, as wheate, and otes
 groond. But what haue I to doo with this matter, or rather so great a
 quantitie, wherewith I am not acquainted. Neuerthelesse, sith I haue
 taken occasion to speake of bruing, I will exemplifie in such a
 proportion as I am best skilled in, bicause it is the vsuall rate for
 mine owne familie, and once in a moneth practised by my wife & hir
 maid seruants, who proceed withall after this maner, as she hath oft
 informed me.

 [Sidenote: Bruing of beere.]
 Hauing therefore groond eight bushels of good malt vpon our querne,
 where the toll is saued, she addeth vnto it halfe a bushell of wheat
 meale, and so much of otes small groond, and so tempereth or mixeth
 them with the malt, that you cannot easilie discerne the one from the
 other, otherwise these later would clunter, fall into lumps, and
 thereby become vnprofitable. The first liquor which is full eightie
 gallons, according to the proportion of our furnace, she maketh
 boiling hot, and then powreth it softlie into the malt, where it
 resteth (but without stirring) vntill hir second liquor be almost
 readie to boile. This doone she letteth hir mash run till the malt be
 left without liquor, or at the leastwise the greatest part of the
 moisture, which she perceiueth by the staie and soft issue thereof,
 and by this time hir second liquor in the furnace is ready to seeth,
 which is put also to the malt as the first woort also againe into the
 furnace wherevnto she addeth two pounds of the best English hops, and
 so letteth them seeth togither by the space of two houres in summer,
 or an houre and an halfe in winter, whereby it getteth an excellent
 colour, and continuance without impeachment, or anie superfluous
 [Sidenote: Charwoort.]
 tartnesse. But before she putteth hir first woort into the furnace, or
 mingleth it with the hops, she taketh out a vessel full, of eight or
 nine gallons, which she shutteth vp close, and suffereth no aire to
 come into it till it become yellow, and this she reserueth by it selfe
 vnto further vse, as shall appeare herafter, calling it Brackwoort or
 Charwoort, and as she saith it addeth also to the colour of the
 drinke, whereby it yeeldeth not vnto amber or fine gold in hew vnto
 the eie. By this time also hir second woort is let runne, and the
 first being taken out of the furnace and placed to coole, she
 returneth the middle woort vnto the furnace, where it is striken ouer,
 or from whence it is taken againe, when it beginneth to boile and
 mashed the second time, whilest the third liquor is heat (for there
 are three liquors) and this last put into the furnace, when the second
 is mashed againe. When she hath mashed also the last liquor (and set
 the second to coole by the first) she letteth it runne, and then
 seetheth it againe with a pound and an halfe of new hops, or
 peraduenture two pounds as she seeth cause by the goodnesse or
 basenesse of the hops, & when it hath sodden in summer two houres & in
 winter an houre & an halfe, she striketh it also and reserueth it vnto
 mixture with the rest when time dooth serue therefore. Finallie when
 she setteth hir drinke togither, she addeth to hir brackwoort or
 charwoort halfe an ounce of arras, and halfe a quarterne of an ounce
 of baiberries finelie powdered, and then putting the same into hir
 woort with an handfull of wheat flowre, she proceedeth in such vsuall
 order as common bruing requireth. Some in steed of arras & baies adde
 so much long pepper onelie, but in hir opinion and my liking it is not
 so good as the first, and hereof we make three hoggesheads of good
 beere, such (I meane) as is meet for poore men as I am to liue
 withall, whose small maintenance (for what great thing is fortie
 pounds a yeare Computatis computandis able to performe) may indure no
 deeper cut, the charges whereof groweth in this manner. I value my
 malt at ten shillings, my wood at foure shillings which I buie, my
 hops at twentie pence, the spice at two pence, seruants wages two
 shillings six pence with meat and drinke, and the wearing of my
 vessell at twentie pence, so that for my twentie shillings I haue ten
 score gallons of beere or more, notwithstanding the losse in seething,
 which some being loth to forgo doo not obserue the time, and therefore
 speed thereafter in their successe, and worthilie. The continuance of
 the drinke is alwaie determined after the quantitie of the hops, so
 that being well hopped it lasteth longer. For it feedeth vpon the hop,
 and holdeth out so long as the force of the same continueth, which
 being extinguished the drinke must be spent or else it dieth, and
 becommeth of no value.

 In this trade also our bruers obserue verie diligentlie the nature of
 the water, which they dailie occupie; and soile through which it
 passeth, for all waters are not of like goodnesse, sith the fattest
 standing water is alwaies the best: for although the waters that run
 by chalke or cledgie soiles be good, and next vnto the Thames water
 which is the most excellent, yet the water that standeth in either of
 these is the best for vs that dwell in the countrie, as whereon the
 sunne lieth longest, and fattest fish is bred. But of all other the
 fennie and morish is the worst, and the cleerest spring water next
 vnto it. In this busines therfore the skilfull workeman dooth redeeme
 the iniquitie of that element, by changing of his proportions, which
 trouble in ale (sometime our onelie, but now taken with manie for old
 and sickmens drinke) is neuer seene nor heard of. Howbeit as the beere
 well sodden in the bruing, and stale, is cleere and well coloured as
 muscadell or malueseie, or rather yellow as the gold noble as our
 potknights call it: so our ale which is not at all or verie little
 sodden, and without hops, is more thicke, fulsome, and of no such
 continuance, which are three notable things to be considered in that
 liquor. But what for that? Certes I know some aleknights so much
 addicted therevnto, that they will not ceasse from morow vntill euen
 to visit the same, clensing house after house, till they defile
 themselues, and either fall quite vnder the boord, or else not daring
 to stirre from their stooles, sit still pinking with their narrow eies
 as halfe sleeping, till the fume of their aduersarie be digested that
 he may go to it afresh. Such flights also haue the alewiues for the
 vtterance of this drinke, that they will mixe it with rosen and salt:
 but if you heat a knife red hot, and quench it in the ale so neere the
 bottome of the pot as you can put it, you shall see the rosen come
 foorth hanging on the knife. As for the force of salt, it is well
 knowne by the effect, for the more the drinker tipleth, the more he
 may, and so dooth he carrie off a drie dronken noll to bed with him,
 except his lucke be the better. But to my purpose.

 In some places of England, there is a kind of drinke made of apples,
 [Sidenote: Cider.]
 [Sidenote: Perrie.]
 which they call cider or pomage, but that of peares is named pirrie,
 and both are groond and pressed in presses made for the nonce. Certes
 these two are verie common in Sussex, Kent, Worcester, and other
 steeds, where these sorts of fruits doo abound, howbeit they are not
 their onelie drinke at all times, but referred vnto the delicate sorts
 [Sidenote: Metheglin.]
 of drinke, as metheglin is in Wales, whereof the Welshmen make no
 lesse accompt (and not without cause if it be well handled) than the
 Greekes did of their Ambrosia or Nectar, which for the pleasantnesse
 thereof, was supposed to be such as the gods themselues did delite in.
 There is a kind of swish swash made also in Essex, and diuerse other
 places, with honicombs and water, which the homelie countrie wiues,
 [Sidenote: Mead.]
 putting some pepper and a little other spice among, call mead, verie
 good in mine opinion for such as loue to be loose bodied at large, or
 a little eased of the cough, otherwise it differeth so much fr[=o] the
 true metheglin, as chalke from cheese. Truelie it is nothing else but
 the washing of the combes, when the honie is wroong out, and one of
 the best things that I know belonging thereto is, that they spend but
 [Sidenote: Hydromel.]
 little labour and lesse cost in making of the same, and therefore no
 great losse if it were neuer occupied. Hitherto of the diet of my
 countrimen, & somewhat more at large peraduenture than manie men will
 like of, wherefore I thinke good now to finish this tractation, and so
 will I, when I haue added a few other things incident vnto that which
 goeth before, whereby the whole processe of the same shall fullie be
 deliuered, & my promise to my freend in this behalfe performed.

 [Sidenote: Lesse time spent in eating than heretofore.]
 Heretofore there hath beene much more time spent in eating and
 drinking than commonlie is in these daies, for whereas of old we had
 breakefasts in the forenoone, beuerages, or nuntions after dinner, and
 thereto reare suppers generallie when it was time to go to rest (a
 toie brought into England by hardie Canutus and a custome whereof
 Athenaeus also speaketh lib. 1, albeit Hippocrates speake but of twise
 at the most lib. 2. De rat. vict. in feb. ac.) Now these od repasts
 thanked be God are verie well left, and ech one in maner (except here
 and there some yoong hungrie stomach that cannot fast till dinner
 time) contenteth himselfe with dinner & supper onelie. The Normans
 misliking the gormandise of Canutus, ordeined after their arriuall,
 that no table should be couered aboue once in the daie, which
 Huntingdon imputeth to their auarice: but in the end either waxing
 wearie of their owne frugalitie, or suffering the cockle of old
 custome to ouergrow the good corne of their new constitution, they
 [Sidenote: Canutus a glutton, but the Normans at the last
 exceeded him in that vice.]
 fell to such libertie, that in often feeding they surmounted Canutus
 surnamed the hardie. For whereas he couered his table but three or
 foure times in the daie, these spred their clothes fiue or six times,
 and in such wise as I before rehearsed. They brought in also the
 custome of long and statelie sitting at meat, whereby their feasts
 resembled those ancient pontificall bankets whereof Macrobius speaketh
 lib. 3. cap. 13. and Plin. lib. 10. cap. 10. and which for
 sumptuousnesse of fare, long sitting and curiositie shewed in the
 same, exceeded all other mens feasting, which fondnesse is not yet
 left with vs, notwithstanding that it proueth verie beneficiall for
 the physicians, who most abound, where most excesse and misgouernement
 of our bodies doo appeere, although it be a great expense of time, and
 worthie of reprehension. For the nobilitie, gentlemen, and
 [Sidenote: Long sitting reprehended.]
 merchantmen, especiallie at great meetings doo sit commonlie till two
 or three of the clocke at afternoone, so that with manie is an hard
 matter, to rise from the table to go to euening praier, and returne
 from thence to come time inough to supper. For my part I am persuaded
 that the purpose of the Normans at the first was to reduce the ancient
 Roman order or Danish custome in feeding once in the daie, and toward
 the euening, as I haue red and noted. And indeed the Romans had such a
 custome, and likewise the Grecians, as may appeere by the words of
 Socrates, who said vnto the Atheniens, "Oriente sole consilium,
 occidente conuiuium est cogitandum," although a little something was
 allowed in the morning to yoong children which we now call a
 breakefast. Plato called the Siciliens monsters, for that they vsed to
 eat twise in the daie. Among the Persians onelie the king dined when
 the sunne was at the highest, and shadow of the stile at the shortest:
 the rest (as it is reported) went alwaies but once to meat when their
 stomachs craued it, as the Canariens and Indians doo in my time (who
 if appetite serue refuse not to go to meat at anie houre of the night)
 and likewise the ancient Caspians. Yet Arhianus noteth it as a rare
 thing li. 4. cap. 16. that the Tyrhenians had taken vp an ill custome
 to feed twise in a daie. Howbeit at the last they fell generallie to
 allow of suppers toward the setting of the sunne in all places,
 bicause they would haue their whole familie to go to meat togither,
 and wherevnto they would appoint their guests to come at a certeine
 length of the shadow, to be perceiued in their dials. And this is more
 to be noted of antiquitie, that if anie man (as Plutarch saith) did
 feed before that time, he incurred a note of reprehension as if he had
 beene gluttonous and giuen vnto the bellie, 8. Sympos. 6. Their slaues
 in like sort were glad, when it grew to the tenth foot, for then were
 they sure soone after to go to meat. In the scripture we read of manie
 suppers & few dinners, onelie for that dining was not greatlie vsed in
 Christs time, but taken as a thing latelie sproong vp, when pampering
 of the bellie began to take hold, occasioned by idlenes and great
 abundance of riches. It is pretie to note in Iuuenal, how he taunteth
 [Sidenote: * That is at three of the clocke at afternoone.]
 Marius for that he gaue himselfe to drinke before the [*]ninth houre
 of the daie: for thinking three houres to be too little for the
 filling of his bellie, he began commonlie at eight, which was an houre
 too soone. Afterwards when gurmandise increased yet more amongst the
 Romans, and from them was dispersed vnto all nations vnder their
 subiection, it came to passe that six houres onlie were appointed to
 worke and consult in, and the other six of the daie to feed and drinke
 in, as the verse saith:

   Sex horae tantum rebus tribuantur agendis,
     Viuere post illas, littera Zetha monet.

 Wherevnto Maximus Planudes (except my memorie faile me) addeth this
 scholie after his maner, saieng that from morning vnto noone (which is
 six of the clocke after the vnequall accompt) each one dooth trauell
 about his necessarie affaires, that being doone, he betaketh himselfe
 to the refreshing of his bodie, which is noted and set downe by the
 Greeke letters of the diall (wherewith the Romane horologies were
 marked, as ours be with their numerall letters) whereby the time is
 described; for those which point 7, 8, 9 and 10 are written with
 [Greek: x e th i] and being ioined yeeld [Greek: xethi], which in
 English signified so much as liue, as if they should meane, eat that
 thou maist liue. But how Martial diuided his daie, and with him the
 whole troope of the learned & wiser sort, these verses following doo
 more euidentlie declare:

 [Sidenote: Li. 4. epig. 8.]

   Prima salutantes, atque altera continet horas,
     Exercet raucos tertia causidicos.
   In quintam varios extendit Roma labores,
     Sexta quies lassis, septima finis erit.
   Sufficit in nonam nitidis octaua palestris,
     Imperat extructos frangere nona thoros.
   Hora libellorum decima est Eupheme meorum,
     Temperat Ambrosias cum tua cura dapes.
   Et bonus aethereo laxatur Nectare Caesar,
     Ingentique tenet pocula parca manu.
   Tunc admitte iocos: gressu timet ire licenti,
     Ad matutinum nostra Thaleia Iouem.

 Thus we see how the ancient maner of the Gentils was to feed but once
 in the daie, and that toward night, till gluttonie grew on and altered
 this good custome. I might here remember also their maner in pulling
 off their shooes when they sat downe to meat, whereof Martial saith:

   Deposui soleas, affertur protinus ingens
     Inter lactucas oxygarmuq; liber, &c.

 And Tullie also remembreth where he saith Seruum a pedibus ad te misi,
 which office grew of the said custome, as Seruus ad limina did of
 keeping the doore, though in most houses both these were commonlie one
 mans office, also Ad pocula of attending on the cup. But bicause the
 good writers of our time haue obserued these phrases and such like
 with their causes and descriptions, in their infinite and seuerall
 treatises, I shall not need to discourse anie farther vpon them. With
 vs the nobilitie, gentrie, and students, doo ordinarilie go to dinner
 at eleuen before noone, and to supper at fiue, or betweene fiue and
 six at afternoone. The merchants dine and sup seldome before twelue at
 noone, and six at night especiallie in London. The husbandmen dine
 also at high noone as they call it, and sup at seuen or eight: but out
 of the tearme in our vniuersities the scholers dine at ten. As for the
 poorest sort they generallie dine and sup when they may, so that to
 talke of their order of repast, it were but a needlesse matter. I
 might here take occasion also to set downe the varietie vsed by
 antiquitie in their beginnings of their diets, wherin almost euerie
 nation had a seuerall fashion, some beginning of custome (as we doo in
 summer time) with salets at supper, and some ending with lettice, some
 making their entrie with egs, and shutting vp their tables with
 mulberies, as we doo with fruit and conceits of all sorts. Diuerse (as
 the old Romans) began with a few crops of rue, as the Venetians did
 with the fish called Gobius, the Belgies with butter (or as we doo yet
 also) with butter and egs vpon fish daies. But whereas we commonlie
 begin with the most grosse food, and end with the most delicate, the
 Scot thinking much to leaue the best for his meniall seruants maketh
 his entrance at the best, so that he is sure therby to leaue the
 worst. We vse also our wines by degrees, so that the hotest commeth
 last to the table, but to stand vpon such toies would spend much time,
 and turne to small profit, wherfore I will deale with other things
 more necessarie for this turne.




 OF THEIR APPARELL AND ATTIRE.

 CHAP. VII.


 An Englishman, indeuoring sometime to write of our attire, made
 sundrie platformes for his purpose, supposing by some of them to find
 out one stedfast ground whereon to build the summe of his discourse.
 But in the end (like an oratour long without exercise) when he saw
 what a difficult peece of worke he had taken in hand, he gaue ouer his
 trauell, and onelie drue the picture of a naked man, vnto whome he
 gaue a paire of sheares in the one hand, and a peece of cloth in the
 other, to the end he should shape his apparell after such fashion as
 himselfe liked, sith he could find no kind of garment that could
 please him anie while togither, and this he called an Englishman.
 [Sidenote: Andrew Beerd.]
 Certes this writer (otherwise being a lewd popish hypocrite and
 vngratious priest) shewed himselfe herein not to be altogether void of
 iudgement, sith the phantasticall follie of our nation, euen from the
 courtier to the carter is such, that no forme of apparell liketh vs
 longer than the first garment is in the wearing, if it continue so
 long and be not laid aside, to receiue some other trinket newlie
 deuised by the fickle headed tailors, who couet to haue seuerall
 trickes in cutting, thereby to draw fond customers to more expense of
 monie. For my part I can tell better how to inueigh against this
 [Sidenote: Strange cuts.]
 enormitie, than describe anie certeintie of our attire: sithence such
 is our mutabilitie, that to daie there is none to the Spanish guise,
 to morrow the French toies are most fine and delectable, yer long no
 such apparell as that which is after the high Alman fashion, by and by
 the Turkish maner is generallie best liked of, otherwise the Morisco
 gowns, the Barbarian sleeues, the mandilion worne to Collie weston
 ward, and the short French breches make such a comelie vesture, that
 except it were a dog in a doublet, you shall not see anie so
 disguised, as are my countrie men of England. And as these fashions
 are diuerse, so likewise it is a world to see the costlinesse and the
 curiositie: the excesse and the vanitie: the pompe and the brauerie:
 the change and the varietie: and finallie the ficklenesse and the
 follie that is in all degrees: in somuch that nothing is more constant
 [Sidenote: Much cost vpon the bodie, and little vpon the soule.]
 in England than inconstancie of attire. Oh how much cost is bestowed
 now adaies vpon our bodies and how little vpon our soules! how manie
 sutes of apparell hath the one and how little furniture hath the
 other? how long time is asked in decking vp of the first, and how
 little space left wherin to feed the later? how curious, how nice also
 are a number of men and women, and how hardlie can the tailor please
 them in making it fit for their bodies? how manie times must it be
 sent backe againe to him that made it? what chafing, what fretting,
 what reprochfull language doth the poore workeman beare awaie? and
 manie times when he dooth nothing to it at all, yet when it is brought
 home againe it is verie fit and handsome; then must we put it on, then
 must the long seames of our hose be set by a plumb-line, then we
 puffe, then we blow, and finallie sweat till we drop, that our clothes
 may stand well vpon vs. I will saie nothing of our heads, which
 sometimes are polled, sometimes curled, or suffered to grow at length
 like womans lockes, manie times cut off aboue or vnder the eares round
 as by a woodden dish. Neither will I meddle with our varietie of
 [Sidenote: Beards.]
 beards, of which some are shauen from the chin like those of Turks,
 not a few cut short like to the beard of marques Otto, some made round
 like a rubbing brush, other with a pique de vant (O fine fashion!) or
 now and then suffered to grow long, the barbers being growen to be so
 cunning in this behalfe as the tailors. And therefore if a man haue a
 leane and streight face, a marquesse Ottons cut will make it broad and
 large; if it be platter like, a long slender beard will make it seeme
 the narrower; if he be wesell becked, then much heare left on the
 cheekes will make the owner looke big like a bowdled hen, and so grim
 as a goose, if Cornelis of Chelmeresford saie true: manie old men doo
 weare no beards at all. Some lustie courtiers also and gentlemen of
 courage, doo weare either rings of gold, stones, or pearle in their
 eares, whereby they imagine the workemanship of God not to be a little
 amended. But herein they rather disgrace than adorne their persons, as
 by their nicenesse in apparell, for which I saie most nations doo not
 vniustlie deride vs, as also for that we doo seeme to imitate all
 nations round about vs, wherein we be like to the Polypus or
 Chameleon; and therevnto bestow most cost vpon our arses, & much more
 than vpon all the rest of our bodies, as women doo likewise vpon their
 [Sidenote: Excesse in women.]
 heads and shoulders. In women also it is most to be lamented, that
 they doo now farre exceed the lightnesse of our men (who neuerthelesse
 are transformed from the cap euen to the verie shoo) and such staring
 attire as in time past was supposed meet for none but light housewiues
 onelie, is now become an habit for chast and sober matrones. What
 should I saie of their doublets with pendant codpeeses on the brest
 full of iags & cuts, and sleeues of sundrie colours? their
 galligascons to beare out their bums & make their attire to sit plum
 round (as they terme it) about them? their fardingals, and diuerslie
 coloured nether stocks of silke, ierdseie, and such like, whereby
 their bodies are rather deformed than commended? I haue met with some
 of these trulles in London so disguised, that it hath passed my skill
 to discerne whether they were men or women.

 Thus it is now come to passe, that women are become men, and men
 transformed into monsters: and those good gifts which almightie God
 hath giuen vnto vs to releeue our necessities withall (as a nation
 turning altogither the grace of God into wantonnesse, for

   Luxuriant animi rebus plerunque secundis)

 not otherwise bestowed than in all excesse, as if we wist not
 otherwise how to consume and wast them. I praie God that in this
 behalfe our sinne be not like vnto that of Sodoma and Gomorha, whose
 [Sidenote: Ezech. 16.]
 errors were pride, excesse of diet, and abuse of Gods benefits
 aboundantlie bestowed vpon them, beside want of charitie toward the
 poore, and certeine other points which the prophet shutteth vp in
 silence. Certes the common-wealth cannot be said to florish where
 these abuses reigne, but is rather oppressed by vnreasonable exactions
 made vpon rich farmers, and of poore tenants, wherewith to mainteine
 the same. Neither was it euer merier with England, than when an
 Englishman was knowne abroad by his owne cloth, and contented himselfe
 at home with his fine carsie hosen, and a meane slop: his coat, gowne,
 and cloake of browne blue or puke, with some pretie furniture of
 veluet or furre, and a doublet of sad tawnie, or blacke veluet, or
 other comelie silke, without such cuts and gawrish colours as are
 worne in these daies, and neuer brought in but by the consent of the
 French, who thinke themselues the gaiest men, when they haue most
 diuersities of iagges and change of colours about them. Certes of all
 [Sidenote: Attire of merchants.]
 estates our merchants doo least alter their attire, and therefore are
 most to be commended: for albeit that which they weare be verie fine
 and costlie, yet in forme and colour it representeth a great peece of
 the ancient grauitie apperteining to citizens and burgesses, albeit
 the yoonger sort of their wiues both in attire and costlie
 housekeeping can not tell when and how to make an end, as being women
 in deed in whome all kind of curiositie is to be found and seene, and
 in farre greater measure than in women of higher calling. I might here
 name a sort of hewes deuised for the nonce, wherewith to please
 phantasticall heads, as gooseturd greene, pease porridge tawnie,
 popingaie blue, lustie gallant, the diuell in the head (I should saie
 the hedge) and such like: but I passe them ouer thinking it sufficient
 to haue said thus much of apparell generallie, when nothing can
 particularlie be spoken of anie constancie thereof.




 OF THE HIGH COURT OF PARLEMENT, AND AUTHORITIE OF THE SAME.

 CHAP. VIII.


 In speaking of parlement lawe, I haue in the chapiter precedent said
 somewhat of this high and most honorable court. Wherefore it shall not
 need to remember ought heere that is there touched: I will onelie
 speake of other things therefore concerning the estate of assemblie,
 whereby the magnificence thereof shall be in some part better knowne
 vnto such as shall come after vs. This house hath the most high and
 absolute power of the realme, for thereby kings and mightie princes
 haue from time to time beene deposed from their thrones, lawes either
 enacted or abrogated, offendors of all sorts punished, and corrupted
 religion either dissanulled or reformed, which commonlie is diuided
 [Sidenote: The parlement house diuideth the estate of the
 realme into nobilitie and the commons.]
 into two houses or parts, the higher or vpper house consisting of the
 nobilitie, including all euen vnto the baron and bishop: the lower
 called the nether house of knights, squires, gentlemen, and burgesses
 of the commons, with whome also the inferior members of the cleargie
 are ioined, albeit they sit in diuerse places, and these haue to deale
 onelie in matters of religion, till it come that they ioine with the
 rest in confirmation of all such acts as are to passe in the same. For
 without the consent of the three estates, that is, of the nobilitie,
 cleargie, and laietie, sildome anie thing is said to be concluded
 vpon, and brought vnto the prince for his consent and allowance. To be
 short, whatsoeuer the people of Rome did in their Centuriatis or
 Tribunitijs comitijs, the same is and may be doone by authoritie of
 our parlement house, which is the head and bodie of all the realme,
 and the place wherein euerie particular person is intended to be
 present, if not by himselfe, yet by his aduocate or atturneie. For
 this cause also any thing ther enacted is not to be misliked, but
 [Sidenote: Time of summons.]
 obeied of all men without contradiction or grudge. By the space of
 fortie dais, before this assemblie be begun, the prince sendeth his
 writs vnto all his nobilitie particularlie, summoning them to appeare
 at the said court. The like he doth to the shiriffe of euerie countie;
 with commandement to choose two knights within ech of their counties,
 to giue their aduise in the name of the shire, likewise to euerie
 citie and towne, that they may choose their burgesses, which commonlie
 are men best skilled in the state of their citie or towne, either for
 the declaration of such benefits as they want, or to shew which waie
 to reforme such enormities as thorough the practises of ill members
 are practised and crept in among them: the first being chosen by the
 gentlemen of the shire, the other by the citizens and burgesses of
 euerie citie and towne, whereby that court is furnished. The first
 [Sidenote: Of the vpper house.]
 daie of the parlement being come, the lords of the vpper house, as
 well ecclesiasticall as temporall, doo attend vpon the prince, who
 rideth thither in person, as it were to open the doore of their
 authoritie; and being come into the place, after praiers made, and
 causes shewed, wherefore some not present are inforced to be absent,
 each man taketh his place according to his degree. The house it selfe
 is curiouslie furnished with tapisterie, and the king being set in his
 throne, the spirituall lords take vp the side of the house which is on
 [Sidenote: Places of the peeres.]
 the right hand of the prince, and the temporall lords the left, I
 meane, so well dukes and earles, as viscounts and barons, as I before
 remembred. In the middest and a pretie distance from the prince, lie
 certeine sackes stuffed with wooll or haire, wheron the iudges of the
 realme, the master of the rols, and secretaries of estate doo sit.
 Howbeit these iudges haue no voice in the house, but onelie shew what
 their opinion is of such & such matters as come in question among the
 lords, if they be commanded so to doo: as the secretaries are to
 answer such letters or things passed in the councell, whereof they
 haue the custodie & knowledge. Finallie, the consent of this house is
 giuen by each man seuerallie, first for himselfe being present, then
 seuerallie for so manie as he hath letters & proxies directed vnto
 him, saieng onelie; Content or Not content, without any further
 debating. Of the number assembled in the lower house, I haue alreadie
 made a generall report in the chapter precedent, and their particulars
 shall follow here at hand. These therefore being called ouer by name
 [Sidenote: Of the lower house.]
 [Sidenote: Speaker.]
 do choose a speaker, who is as it were their mouth, and him they
 present vnto the prince, in whom it is either to refuse or admit him
 by the lord chancellor, who in the princes name dooth answer vnto his
 oration, made at his first entrance & presentation into the house,
 wherein he declareth the good liking that the king hath conceiued of
 [Sidenote: Petitions of the speaker.]
 his choise vnto that office & function. Being admitted, he maketh fiue
 requests vnto that honorable assemblie, first that the house may (as
 in times past) inioy hir former liberties and priuileges: secondlie,
 that the congregates may frankelie shew their minds vpon such matters
 as are to come in question: thirdlie, that if anie of the lower house
 doo giue anie cause of offense during the continuance of this
 assemblie, that the same may inflict such punishment vpon the partie
 culpable, as to the said assemblie shall be thought conuenient:
 fourthlie, if anie doubt should arise among them of the lower house,
 that he in their name might haue free accesse and recourse vnto his
 maiestie & lords of the higher house, to be further instructed and
 resolued in the same: fiftlie and last, he craueth pardon for
 himselfe, if in his going to and fro betweene the houses, he forget or
 mistake anie thing, requiring that he may returne and be better
 informed in such things as he did faile in without offense: vnto which
 petitions the lord chancellor dooth answer as apperteineth, and this
 is doone on the first daie, or peraduenture the second, if it could
 not be conuenientlie performed in the first.

 [Sidenote: Clerke of the parlement.]
 Beside the lord chancellor there is another in the vpper house called
 the clerke of the parlement, whose office is to read the billes. For
 euerie thing that commeth in consultation in either house, is first
 put in writing in paper, which being read, he that listeth riseth vp
 and speaketh either with it or against it, and so one after another so
 long as they shall thinke good; that doone they go to another, and so
 to the third, &c: the instrument still wholie or in part raced or
 reformed, as cause moueth for the amendment of the same if the
 substance be reputed necessarie. In the vpper house the lord
 chancellor demandeth if they will haue it ingrossed, that is to saie,
 put in parchment, which doone, it is read the third time, & after
 debating of the matter to and fro if the more part doo conclude
 withall, vpon the vtterance of these words, "Are ye contented that it
 be enacted or no?" the clerke writeth vnderneath "Soit baille aux
 commons," and so when they see time they send such billes approued to
 the commons by some of them that sit on the wooll sackes, who comming
 into the house, & demanding licence to speake, doo vse this kind of
 words or the like to the speaker, as sir Thomas Smith dooth deliuer
 and set them downe, whose onelie direction I vse, and almost word for
 word in this chapter, requiting him with the like borowage as he hath
 vsed toward me in his discourse of the sundrie degrees of estates in
 the common-wealth of England, which (as I hope) shall be no discredit
 to his trauell. "Master speaker, my lords of the vpper house haue
 passed amongst them, and thinke good that there should be enacted by
 parlement such an act, and such an act (reading their titles in such
 sort as he receiued them) they praie you therefore to consider & shew
 your aduise vpon them." Which doone they go their waie, and the doore
 being shut after them, the speaker declareth what message was sent
 vnto them, and if they be then void of consultation vpon anie other
 bill, he presentlie demandeth what their pleasures are, first of one,
 then of another, &c: which are solemnelie read, or their contents
 breeflie shewed and then debated vpon among them.

 [Sidenote: Of the nether house.]
 The speaker sitteth in a chaire erected somewhat higher than the rest,
 that he may see and be seene of all men, and before him on a lower
 seat sitteth his clerke, who readeth such bils as be first propounded
 in the lower house, or sent downe from the lords: for in that point
 each house hath equall authoritie to propound what they thinke meet,
 either for the abrogation of old or making of new lawes. All bils be
 thrise and on diuerse daies read and disputed vpon before they come to
 the question, which is, whether they shall be enacted or not; and in
 discourse vpon them, verie good order is vsed in the lower house,
 wherein he that will speake giueth notice thereof by standing vp bare
 headed. If manie stand vp at once (as now & then it happeneth) he
 speaketh first that was first seene to moue out of his place, and
 telleth his tale vnto the speaker, without rehersall of his name whose
 speches he meaneth to confute, so that with a perpetuall oration & not
 with altercation these discourses are continued. But as the partie
 confuted may not replie on that daie, so one man can not speake twise
 to one bill in one daie though he would change his opinion, but on the
 next he may speake againe, & yet but once as afore. No vile,
 seditious, vnreuerent or biting words are vsed in this assemblie, yet
 if anie happen to escape and be vttered, the partie is punished
 according to the censure of the assemblie and custome in that behalfe.
 In the afternoone they sit not except vpon some vrgent occasion,
 neither hath the speaker anie voice in that house, wherewith to moue
 or dissuade the furtherance or staie of anie bill, but his office is
 vpon the reading thereof breeflie to declare the contents. If anie
 bill passe, which commeth vnto them from the lords, it is thus
 subscribed, "Les commons ont assentus:" so if the lords agree vpon
 anie bill sent vnto them from the commons, it is subscribed after this
 maner, "Les seigniours ont assentus." If it be not agreed on after
 thrise reading, there is conference required and had betweene the
 vpper and nether houses, by certeine appointed for that purpose vpon
 the points in question, wherevpon if no finall agreement by the more
 part can be obteined, the bill is dashed and reiected, or (as the
 saieng is) cleane cast out of the doores. None of the nether house can
 giue his voice by proxie but in his owne person, and after the bill
 twise read, then ingrossed and the third time read againe & discoursed
 vpon, the speaker asketh if they will go to the question, whervnto if
 they agree he holdeth vp the bill & saith; "So manie as will haue this
 bill go forward saie Yea:" hervpon so manie as allow of the thing crie
 Yea, the other No, & as the crie is more or lesse on either side, so
 is the bill to staie or else go forward. If the number of negatiue and
 affirmatiue voices seeme to be equall, so manie as allow of the bill
 go downe withall, the rest sit still, and being told by the poll the
 greater part doo carrie away the matter. If something be allowed and
 in some part reiected, the bill is put to certeine committees to be
 amended, & then being brought in againe, it is read and passeth or
 staieth as the voices yeeld therto. This is the order of the passage
 of our lawes, which are not ratified till both houses haue agreed vnto
 them, and yet not holden for law till the prince haue giuen his
 assent. Vpon the last daie therfore of the parlement or session, the
 prince commeth in person againe into the house, in his robes as at the
 first. Where after thanks giuen to the prince, first in the name of
 the lords by the lord chancellor, then in the name of the commons by
 the speaker for his great care of the welfare of his realme, &c: the
 lord chancellor in the princes name giueth thanks to the lords &
 commons likewise for their paines, with promise of recompense as
 opportunitie & occasion shall serue therefore. This doone one readeth
 the title of euerie act passed in that session, and then it is noted
 vpon them what the prince doth allow of with these words, "Le roy
 veult." If the prince like not of them, it is written vpon them "Le
 roy aduisera." And so those acts are dashed, as the other from
 thencefoorth are taken and holden for law, and all imprinted except
 such as concerne some priuat persons, which are onelie exemplified
 vnder the seale of the parlement, as priuileges to his vse. And this
 is the summe of the maner after which our parlements in England are
 holden, without which no forfaiture of life, member or lands of anie
 Englishman, where no law is ordeined for the same before hand, is
 auailable or can take place amongst vs. And so much in maner out of
 the third chapiter of the second booke of the common-wealth of England
 written by sir Thomas Smith: whervnto I will annex a table of the
 counties, cities, boroughs and ports, which send knights, burgesses,
 and barons to the parlement house, and dooth insue as followeth.

 OF THE LAWES OF ENGLAND SINCE HIR FIRST INHABITATION.

 CHAP. IX.


 [Sidenote: Samothes.]
 That Samothes or Dis gaue the first lawes to the Celtes (whose
 kingdome he erected about the fifteenth of Nimbrote) the testimonie of
 Berosus is proofe sufficient. For he not onelie affirmeth him to
 publish the same in the fourth of Ninus, but also addeth thereto, how
 there liued none in his daies of more excellent wisdome, nor politike
 inuention than he, whereof he was named Samothes, as some other do
 affirme. What his lawes were, it is now altogither vnknowne, as most
 things of this age; but that they were altered againe at the comming
 [Sidenote: Albion.]
 of Albion, no man can absolutelie denie, sith new lords vse commonlie
 to giue new lawes, and conquerors abolish such as were in vse before
 them.

 [Sidenote: Brute.]
 The like also may be affirmed of our Brute, notwithstanding that the
 certeine knowledge so well of the one as of the other is perished, and
 nothing worthie memorie left of all their dooings. Somewhat yet we
 [Sidenote: Mulmutius.]
 haue of Mulmutius, who not onelie subdued such princes as reigned in
 this land, but also brought the realme to good order, that long before
 had beene torne with ciuill discord. But where his lawes are to be
 found, and which they be from other mens, no man liuing in these daies
 is able to determine.

 Certes, there was neuer prince in Britaine, of whome his subiects
 conceiued better hope in the beginning, than of Bladudus, and yet I
 read of none that made so ridiculous an end: in like sort there hath
 not reigned anie monarch in this Ile, whose waies were more feared at
 [Sidenote: The praise of Dunwallon.]
 the first, than those of Dunwallon (king Henrie the fift excepted) and
 yet in the end he prooued such a prince, as after his death there was
 in maner no subiect, that did not lament his funerals. And this onelie
 for his policie in gouernance, seuere administration of iustice, and
 prouident framing of his lawes and constitutions, for the gouernment
 of his subiects. His people also, coueting to continue his name vnto
 posteritie, intituled those his ordinances according to their maker,
 calling them by the name of the lawes of Mulmutius, which indured in
 execution among the Britons, so long as our homelings had the dominion
 of this Ile. Afterward when the comeling Saxons had once obteined the
 superioritie of the kingdom, the maiestie of those lawes fell for a
 time into such decaie, that although "Non penitus cecidit, tamen
 potuit cecidisse videri," as Leland saith, and the decrees themselues
 had vtterlie perished in deed at the verie first brunt, had they not
 beene preserued in Wales, where they remained amongst the relikes of
 the Britons, & not onlie vntill the comming of the Normans, but euen
 vntill the time of Edward the first, who obteining the souereigntie of
 that portion, indeuoured verie earnestlie to extinguish those of
 Mulmutius, and to establish his owne.

 But as the Saxons at their first arriuall did what they could to
 abolish the British lawes, so in processe of time they yeelded a
 little to relent, & not so much to abhorre and mislike of the lawes of
 Mulmutius, as to receiue and imbrace the same, especiallie at such
 time as the said Saxon princes entered into amitie with the British
 nobilitie, and after that began to ioine in matrimonie with the
 British ladies, as the British barons did with the Saxon frowes, both
 by an especiall statute and decree, wherof in another treatise I haue
 made mention at large. Heerof also it came to passe in the end, that
 they were contented to make a choise, and insert no small numbers of
 them into their owne volumes, as may be gathered by those of Athelbert
 the great, surnamed king of Kent, Inas and Alfred kings of the west
 Saxons, and diuerse other yet extant to be seene. Such also was the
 lateward estimation of them, that when anie of the Saxon princes went
 about to make new ordinances, they caused those of Mulmutius (which
 Gildas sometime translated into Latine) to be first expounded vnto
 them, and in this perusall if they found anie there alreadie framed,
 that might serue their turnes, they foorthwith reuiued the same, and
 annexed them to their owne.

 But in this dealing, the diligence of Alfred is most of all to be
 commended, who not onelie chose out the best, but gathered togither
 all such whatsoeuer the said Mulmutius had made: and then to the end
 they should lie no more in corners as forlorne bookes, and vnknowne to
 the learned of his kingdome, he caused them to be turned into the
 Saxon toong, wherein they continued long after his decease.

 As for the Normans, who for a season neither regarded the British, nor
 cared for the Saxon statutes, they also at the first vtterlie misliked
 of them, till at the last, when they had well weied that one kind of
 regiment is not conuenient for all peoples, and that no stranger,
 being in a forren countrie newlie brought vnder obedience, could make
 such equall ordinances, as he might thereby gouerne his new
 common-wealth without some care & trouble: they fell in with such a
 desire to see by what rule the state of the land was gouerned in time
 of the Saxons, that hauing perused the same, they not onelie commended
 their maner of regiment, but also admitted a great part of their lawes
 (now currant vnder the name of S. Edwards lawes, and vsed as
 principles and grounds) whereby they not onelie qualified the rigor of
 their owne, and mitigated their almost intollerable burden of
 seruitude which they had latelie laid vpon the shoulders of the
 English, but also left vs a great number of the old Mulmutian lawes,
 whereof the most part are in vse to this daie as I said, albeit that
 we know not certeinlie how to distinguish them from others, that are
 in strength amongst vs.

 [Sidenote: Martia.]
 After Dunwallon, the next lawgiuer was Martia, whome Leland surnameth
 Proba; and after him Iohn Bale also, who in his Centuries dooth
 iustlie confesse himselfe to haue beene holpen by the said Leland, as
 I my selfe doo likewise for manie things conteined in this treatise.
 Shee was wife vnto Gutteline king of the Britons: and being made
 protectrix of the realme, after hir husbands deceasse in the nonage of
 hir sonne, and seeing manie things dailie to grow vp among hir people
 worthie reformation, she deuised sundrie and those verie politike
 lawes, for the gouernance of hir kingdome, which hir subiects when she
 was dead and gone, did name the Martian statutes. Who turned them into
 Latine, as yet I doo not read, howbeit (as I said before of the lawes
 of Mulmutius) so the same Alfred caused those of this excellentlie
 well learned ladie (whome diuerse commend also for hir great knowledge
 in the Greeke toong) to be turned into his owne language, wherevpon it
 came to passe that they were dailie executed among his subiects,
 afterward allowed of (among the rest) by the Normans, and finallie
 remaine in vse in these our daies, notwithstanding that we can not
 disseuer them also verie readilie from the other.

 The seuenth alteration of lawes was practised by the Saxons, for I
 ouerpasse the vse of the ciuill ordinances vsed in Rome, finallie
 brought hither by the Romans, & yet in perfect notice among the
 Ciuilians of our countrie, though neuer generallie nor fullie receiued
 by all the seuerall regions of this Iland. Certes there are great
 numbers of these later, which yet remaine in sound knowlege, and are
 to be read, being comprehended for the most part vnder the names of
 [Sidenote: Martian Law.]
 [Sidenote: Saxon Law.]
 [Sidenote: Dane Law.]
 the Martian and the Saxon law. Beside these also I read of the Dane
 law, so that the people of middle England were ruled by the first, the
 west Saxons by the second; as Essex, Norffolke, Suffolke,
 Cambridgeshire, and part of Herfordshire were by the third, of all the
 rest the most inequall and intollerable. And as in these daies what
 soeuer the prince in publike assemblie commanded vpon the necessitie
 of his subiects, or his owne voluntarie authoritie, was counted for
 law: so none of them had appointed anie certeine place, wherevnto his
 people might repaire at fixed times for iustice, but caused them to
 resort commonlie to their palaces, where in proper person they would
 often determine their causes, and so make shortest worke, or else
 commit the same to the hearing of other, and so dispatch them awaie.
 Neither had they any house appointed to assemble in for the making of
 their ordinances, as we haue now at Westminster. Wherefore Edmund gaue
 lawes at London & Lincolne, Ethelred at Habam, Alfred at Woodstock and
 Wannetting, Athelstane in Excester, Grecklade, Feuersham, &
 Thundersleie, Canutus at Winchester, &c: other in other places,
 whereof this may suffice.

 Among other things also vsed in the time of the Saxons, it shall not
 be amisse to set downe the forme of their Ordalian law, which they
 brought hither with them from beyond the seas out of Scithia, and vsed
 onelie in the triall of guiltie and vnguiltinesse. Certes it conteined
 not an ordinarie proceeding by daies and termes, as in the ciuill and
 common law we see practised in these daies; but a short dispatch &
 triall of the matter by fire or water, whereof at this present I will
 deliuer the circumstance, as I haue faithfullie translated it out of
 an ancient volume, and conferred with an imprinted copie, latelie
 published by M. Lambert, and now extant to be read. Neuerthelesse, as
 the Scithians were the first that vsed this practise, so I read that
 it was taken vp and occupied also in France in processe of time, yea
 and likewise in Grecia, as G. Pachymerus remembreth in the first booke
 of his historie (which beginneth with the empire of M. Paleologus)
 where he noteth his owne sight and vew in that behalfe. But what stand
 I herevpon?

 [Sidenote: Ordalian law.]
 The Ordalian (saith the aforesaid author) was a certeine maner of
 [Sidenote: Fire.]
 purgation vsed two waies, wherof the one was by fire, the other by
 water. In the execution of that which was doone by fire, the partie
 accused should go a certeine number of pases, with an hot iron in his
 hand, or else bare footed vpon certeine plough shares red hot,
 according to the maner. This iron was sometime of one pound weight,
 and then was it called single Ordalium, sometimes of three, and then
 named treble Ordalium, and whosoeuer did beare or tread on the same
 without hurt of his bodie he was adiudged guiltlesse, otherwise if his
 skin were scorched, he was foorthwith condemned as guiltie of the
 trespasse whereof he was accused, according to the proportion and
 quantitie of the burning.

 [Sidenote: Water.]
 There were in like sort two kinds of triall by the water, that is to
 say, either by hot or cold: and in this triall the partie thought
 culpable, was either tumbled into some pond or huge vessell of cold
 water, wherein if he continued for a season, without wrestling or
 strugling for life, he was foorthwith acquited as guiltlesse of the
 fact wherof he was accused: but if he began to plunge, and labour once
 for breath immediatlie vpon his falling into that liquor, he was by
 and by condemned as guiltie of the crime. Or else he did thrust his
 arme vp to the shoulder into a lead, copper, or caldron of seething
 water, from whence if he withdrew the same without anie maner of
 damage, he was discharged of further molestation: otherwise he was
 taken for a trespasser, and punished accordinglie. The fierie maner of
 purgation belonged onelie to noble men and women, and such as were
 free borne: but the husbandmen and villaines were tried by water.
 Wherof to shew the vnlearned dealing and blind ignorance of those
 times, it shall not be impertinent to set foorth the whole maner,
 which continued here in England vntill the time of King Iohn, who
 seeing the manifold subtilties in the same (by sundrie sorcerous and
 artificiall practises whereby the working of the said elements were
 restreined) did extinguish it altogither as flat lewdnesse and
 bouerie. The Rubrike of the treatise entereth thus: "_Here beginneth
 the execution of iustice, whereby the giltie or vngiltie are tried by
 hot iron._ Then it followeth: _After accusation lawfullie made, and
 three daies spent in fasting and praier, the priest being clad in all
 his holie vestures, sauing his vestiment, shall take the iron laid
 before the altar with a paire of tongs, and singing the hymne of the
 three children_, that is to saie, O all ye workes of God the Lord, and
 in Latine Benedicite omnia opera, &c: _he shall carie it solemnelie to
 the fire (alreadie made for that purpose) and first saie these words
 ouer the place where the fire is kindled, whereby this purgation shall
 be made in Latine as insueth:_ Benedic Domine Deus locum istum, vt sit
 nobis in eo sanitas, sanctitas, castitas, virtus, & victoria, &
 sanctimonia, humilitas, bonitas, lenitas, & plenitudo legis, &
 obedientia Deo patri, & filio, & spiritui sancto. Haec benedictio sit
 super hunc locum, & super omnes habitantes in eo. _In English:_ Blesse
 thou O Lord this place, that it may be to vs health, holinesse,
 chastitie, vertue, and victorie, purenesse, humilitie, goodnesse,
 gentlenesse, and fulnesse of the law, and obedience to God the father,
 the sonne, and the holie ghost. This blessing be vpon this place, and
 all that dwell in it. _Then followeth the blessing of the fire._
 Domine Deus pater omnipotens, lumen indeficiens, exaudi nos, quia tu
 es conditor omnium luminum. Benedic Domine hoc lumen, quod ante
 sanctificatum est, qui illuminasti omnem hominem venientem in hunc
 mundum (vel mundum) vt ab eo lumine accendamur igne claritatis tuae. Et
 sicut igne illuminasti Mosen, ita nunc illumina corda nostra, & sensus
 nostros, vt ad vitam aeternam mereamur peruenire, per Christum, &c.
 Lord God father almightie, light euerlasting, heare vs, sith thou art
 the maker of all lights. Blesse O Lord this light, that is alreadie
 sanctified in thy sight, which hast lightned all men that come into
 the world (or the whole world) to the end that by the same light we
 may be lightned with the shining of thy brightnesse. As thou diddest
 lighten Moses, so now illuminate our hearts, and our senses, that we
 may deserue to come to euerlasting life, through Christ our, &c. _This
 being ended let him say the_ Pater noster, &c: _then these words:_
 Saluum fac seruum, &c. Mitte ei auxilium Deus, &c. De Sion tuere eum,
 &c. Dominus vobiscum, &c. _That is_, O Lord saue thy seruant, &c. Send
 him helpe O God from thy holie place, &c. Defend him out of Sion, &c.
 Lord heare, &c. The Lord be with you, &c.

 "_The praier._ Benedic Domine sancte pater, omnipotens Deus, per
 inuocationem sanctissimi nominis tui, & per aduentum filij tui, atque
 per donum spiritus paracleti, ad manifestandum verum iudicium tuum,
 hoc genus metalli, vt sit sanctificatum, & omni daemonum falsitate
 procul remota, veritas veri iudicij tui fidelibus tuis manifesta fiat,
 per eundem Dominum, &c. _In English:_ Blesse we beseech thee O Lord,
 holie father, euerlasting God, through the inuocation of thy most
 holie name, by the comming of thy sonne, and gift of the holie ghost,
 and to the manifestation of thy true iudgement, this kind of mettall,
 that being hallowed, and all fraudulent practises of the diuels
 vtterlie remoued, the manifest truth of thy true iudgement may be
 reuealed, by the same Lord Iesus, &c.

 "_After this, let the iron be laid into the fire, and sprinkled with
 holie water, and whilest it heateth, let the priest go to masse, and
 doo as order requireth: and when he hath receiued the host, he shall
 call the man that is to be purged (as it is written hereafter) first
 adiuring him, and then permitting him to communicate according to the
 maner._


 _The office of the masse._

 "Iustus es Domine, &c. O Lord thou art iust, &c.

 _The Praier._

 "Absolue quaesumus Domine delicta famuli tui, vt a peccatorum suorum
 nexibus, quae pro sua fragilitate contraxit, tua benignitate liberetur,
 & in hoc iudicio quoad meruit, iustitia tua praeueniente, ad veritatis
 censuram peruenire mereatur, per Christum Dominum, &c. _That is:_
 Pardon we beseech thee O Lord, the sinnes of thy seruant, that being
 deliuered from the burden of his offenses, wherewith he is intangled,
 he may be cleared by thy benignitie, and in this his triall (so far as
 he hath deserued thy mercie preuenting him) he may come to the
 knowledge of the truth, by Christ our Lord, &c.


 _The Gospell._ Mar. 10.

 "In illo tempore, cum egressus esset Iesus in via, procurrens quidam
 genu flexo ante eum, rogabat eum dicens, Magister bone, quid faciam vt
 vitam aeternam percipiam? Iesus autem dixit ei, Quid me dicis bonum?
 &c. In those daies when Iesus went foorth toward his iourneie, and one
 meeting him in the waie running, and kneeling vnto him, asked him
 saieng: Good master what shall I doo that I may possesse eternall
 life? Iesus said vnto him, Whie callest thou me good? &c. _Then
 followeth the secret, and so foorth all of the rest of the masse. But
 before the partie dooth communicate, the priest shall vse these words
 vnto him:_ Adiuro te per patrem, & filium, & spiritum sanctum, & per
 veram christianitatem quam suscepisti, & per sanctas relliquias quae in
 ista ecclesia sunt, & per baptismum quo te sacerdos regenerauit, vt
 non praesumas vllo modo communicare, neq; accedere ad altare, si hoc
 fecisti aut consensisti, &c. I adiure thee by the father, the sonne,
 and the holie Ghost, by the true christendome which thou hast
 receiued, by the holie relikes which are in this church, and by the
 baptisme wherewith the priest hath regenerated thee, that thou presume
 not by any maner of means to communicate, nor come about the altar, if
 thou hast doone or consented vnto this, whereof thou art accused, &c.
 [Sidenote: The cup yet in vse.]
 _Here let the priest suffer him to communicate, saieng;_ Corpus hoc, &
 sanguis Domini nostri Iesu Christi, sit tibi ad probationem hodie.
 This bodie & this bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, be vnto thee a
 triall this daie. _The praier:_ Perceptis Domine Deus noster sacris
 muneribus, supplices deprecamur, vt huius participatio sacramenti a
 proprijs nos reatibus expediat, & in famulo tuo veritatis sententiam
 declaret, &c. Hauing receiued O Lord God these holie mysteries, we
 humblie beseech thee that the participation of this sacrament may rid
 vs of our guiltinesse, and in this thy seruant set foorth the truth.
 _Then shall follow_ Kyrieleson, _the Letanie, and certeine Psalmes,
 and after all them_ Oremus: Let vs praie. Deus qui per ignem signa
 magna ostendens, Abraham puerum tuum de incendio Chaldaeorum quibusdam
 pereuntibus eruisti, Deus qui rubum ardere ante conspectum Mosis &
 minime comburi permisisti, Deus qui de incendio fornacis Chaldaicis
 plerisque succensis, tres pueros tuos illaesos eduxisti, Deus qui
 incendio ignis populum Sodomae inuoluens, Loth famulum tuum cum suis
 salute donasti, Deus qui in aduentu sancti spiritus tui, illustratione
 ignis fideles tuos ab infidelibus decreuisti: ostende nobis in hoc
 prauitatis nostrae examine virtutem eiusdem spiritus, &c: & per ignis
 huius feruorem discernere infideles, vt a tactu eius cuius inquisitio
 agitur, conscius exhorrescat, & manus eius comburatur, innocens vero
 p[oe]nitus illaesus permaneat, &c. Deus cuius noticiam nulla vnquam
 secreta effugiunt, fidei nostrae tua bonitate responde, & praesta vt
 quisquis purgandi se gratia, hoc ignitum tulerit ferrum, vel
 absoluatur vt innocens, vel noxius detegatur, &c. _In English thus:_ O
 God, which in shewing great tokens by fire diddest deliuer Abraham thy
 seruant from the burning of the Chaldeis, whilest other perished; O
 God which sufferedst the bush to burne in the sight of Moses, and yet
 not to consume; O God which deliueredst the three children from
 bodilie harme in the fornace of the Chaldeis, whilest diuerse were
 consumed; O God which by fire didst wrap the people of Sodome in their
 destruction, and yet sauedst Lot and his daughters from perill; O God
 which by the shining of thy brightnesse at the comming of the holie
 ghost in likenesse of fire, diddest separate the faithfull from such
 as beleeued not: shew vnto vs in the triall of this our wickednesse,
 the power of the same spirit, &c: and by the heat of this fire
 discerne the faithfull from the vnfaithfull, that the guiltie whose
 cause is now in triall, by touching thereof, may tremble and feare,
 and his hand be burned, or being innocent, that he may remaine in
 safetie, &c. O God from whome no secrets are hidden, let thy goodnesse
 answer to our faith, and grant that whosoeuer in this purgation, shall
 touch and beare this iron, may either be tried an innocent, or
 reuealed as an offender, &c. _After this the priest shall sprinkle the
 iron with holie water saieng:_ The blessing of the father, the sonne,
 and the holie ghost, be vpon this iron, to the reuelation of the iust
 iudgement of God. _And foorthwith let him that is accused beare it, by
 the length of nine foot, and then let his hand be wrapped and sealed
 vp for the space of three daies: after this if any corruption or raw
 flesh appeare where the iron touched it, let him be condemned as
 guiltie: if it be whole and sound, let him giue thanks to God._" And

 thus much of the firie Ordalia, wherevnto that of the water hath so
 precise relation, that in setting foorth of the one, I haue also
 described the other, wherefore it shall be but in vaine to deale anie
 further withall.

 Hitherto also (as I thinke) sufficientlie of such lawes as were in vse
 before the conquest. Now it resteth that I should declare the order of
 those, that haue beene made and receiued since the comming of the
 Normans, referred to the eight alteration or change of our maner of
 gouernance, and therevnto doo produce three score and foure seuerall
 courts. But for asmuch as I am no lawier, and therefore haue but
 little skill to proceed in the same accordinglie, it shall suffice to
 set downe some generall discourse of such as are vsed in our daies,
 and so much as I haue gathered by report and common heare-saie.

 [Sidenote: Ciuill law.]
 We haue therefore in England sundrie lawes, and first of all the
 ciuill, vsed in the chancerie, admeraltie, and diuerse other courts,
 in some of which, the seuere rigor of iustice is often so mitigated by
 conscience, that diuerse things are thereby made easie and tollerable,
 which otherwise would appeare to be meere iniurie and extremitie.

 [Sidenote: Canon law.]
 We haue also a great part of the Canon law dailie practised among vs,
 especiallie in cases of tithes, contracts of matrimonie, and such
 like, as are vsuallie to be seene in the consistories of our bishops
 and higher courts of the two archbishops, where the exercise of the
 same is verie hotlie followed. The third sort of lawes that we haue
 are our owne, & those alwaies so variable, & subiect to alteration and
 change, that oft in one age, diuerse iudgements doo passe vpon one
 maner of case, whereby the saieng of the poet,

   "Tempora mutantur, & nos mutamur in illis,"

 [Sidenote: Lawiers of England not alwaies constant in iudgment.]
 may verie well be applied vnto such, as being vrged with these words;
 In such a yeare of the prince, this opinion was taken for sound law;
 doo answer nothing else, but that the iudgement of our lawiers is now
 altered, so that they saie farre otherwise. The regiment that we haue
 therefore after our owne ordinances, dependeth vpon three lawes, to
 wit, Statute law, Common law, Customarie law, and Prescription,
 according to the triple maner of our trials and iudgments, which is by
 parlement, verdict of twelue men at an assise, or wager of battell, of
 which the last is little vsed in our daies, as no appeale dooth hold
 in the first and last rehearsed. But to returne to my purpose.

 [Sidenote: Parlement law.]
 The first is deliuered vnto vs by parlement, which court, being for
 the most part holden at Westminster neere London, is the highest of
 all other, & consisteth of three seuerall sorts of people, that is to
 saie, the nobilitie, cleargie, and commons of this realme. And thereto
 is not summoned, but vpon vrgent occasion when the prince dooth see
 his time, and that by seuerall writs, dated commonlie full six weekes
 before it begin to be holden. Such lawes as are agreed vpon in the
 higher house by the lords spirituall and temporall, and in the lower
 house by the commons and bodie of the realme (whereof the conuocation
 of the cleargie holden in Powles, or if occasion so require in
 Westminster church, is a member) there speaking by the mouth of the
 knights of the shire and burgesses, remaine in the end to be confirmed
 by the prince, who commonlie resorteth thither of custome, vpon the
 first and last daies of this court, there to vnderstand what is doone,
 and giue his roiall consent to such statutes as him liketh of. Comming
 therefore thither into the higher house, and hauing taken his throne,
 the speaker of the parlement (for one is alwaies appointed to go
 betweene the houses, as an indifferent mouth for both) readeth openlie
 the matters there determined by the said three estates, and then
 craueth the princes consent and finall confirmation to the same. The
 king hauing heard the summe and principall points of each estatute
 brieflie recited vnto him, answereth in French with great deliberation
 vnto such as he liketh ("Il nous plaist") but to the rest "Il ne
 plaist," whereby the latter are made void and frustrate. That also
 which his maiestie liketh of, is hereby authorised, confirmed, & euer
 after holden for law, except it be repealed in anie the like
 assemblie. The number of the commons assembled in the lower house,
 [Sidenote: Number of congregates in the parlement.]
 beside the cleargie, consisteth of ninetie knights. For each shire of
 England hath two gentlemen or knights of greatest wisedome and
 reputation, chosen out of the bodie of the same for that onelie
 purpose, sauing that for Wales one onlie is supposed sufficient in
 euerie countie, whereby the number afore mentioned is made vp. There
 are likewise fourtie and six citizens, 289 burgesses, and foureteene
 barons, so that the whole assemblie of the laitie of the lower house,
 consisteth of foure hundred thirtie and nine persons, if the iust
 number be supplied. Of the lawes here made likewise some are penall
 and restraine the common law, and some againe are found to inlarge the
 same. The one sort of these also are for the most part taken strictlie
 according to the letter, the other more largelie and beneficiallie
 after their intendment and meaning.

 [Sidenote: Common law.]
 The Common law standeth vpon sundrie maximes or principles, and yeares
 or termes, which doo conteine such cases as by great studie and
 solemne argument of the iudges sound practise confirmed by long
 experience, fetched euen from the course of most ancient lawes made
 farre before the conquest, and thereto the deepest reach and
 foundations of reason, are ruled and adiudged for law. Certes these
 cases are otherwise called plees or action, wherof there are two
 sorts, the one criminall and the other ciuill. The meanes and
 messengers also to determine those causes are our writs or breefes,
 whereof there are some originall and some iudiciall. The parties
 plaintiffe & defendant when they appeare proceed (if the case doo so
 require) by plaint or declaration, barre or answer, replication,
 reioinder, and so by rebut, surrebut to issue and triall if occasion
 so fall out, the one side affirmatiuelie, the other negatiuelie as
 common experience teacheth. Our trials and recoueries are either by
 verdict and demourre, confession or default, wherein if anie
 negligence or trespasse hath beene committed, either in processe and
 forme, or in matter and iudgement, the partie grieued may haue a writ
 of errour to vndoo the same, but not in the same court where the
 former iudgement was giuen.

 [Sidenote: Customarie law.]
 Customarie law consisteth of certeine laudable customes vsed in some
 priuat countrie, intended first to begin vpon good and reasonable
 considerations, as gauell kind, which is all the male children
 equallie to inherit, and continued to this daie in Kent: where it is
 onelie to my knowledge reteined, and no where else in England. It was
 at the first deuised by the Romans, as appeareth by Caesar in his
 c[=o]mentaries, wherein I find, that to breake and daunt the force of
 the rebellious Germans, they made a law that all the male children (or
 females for want of males which holdeth still in England) should haue
 their fathers inheritance equallie diuided amongst them. By this
 meanes also it came to passe, that whereas before time for the space
 of sixtie yeares, they had put the Romans to great and manifold
 troubles, within the space of thirtie yeares after this law made,
 their power did wax so feeble, and such discord fell out amongst
 themselues, that they were not able to mainteine warres with the
 Romans, nor raise anie iust armie against them. For as a riuer runing
 with one streame is swift and more plentifull of water than when it is
 drained or drawne into manie branches: so the lands and goods of the
 ancestors being dispersed amongst their issue males, of one strong
 there were raised sundrie weake, whereby the originall or generall
 strength to resist the aduersarie, became infeebled and brought almost
 to nothing. "Vis vnita (saith the philosopher) fortior est eadem
 dispersa," and one good pursse is better than manie euill, and when
 euerie man is benefited alike, each one will seeke to mainteine his
 priuate estate, and few take care to prouide for publike welfare.

 Burrow kind, is where the yoongest is preferred before the eldest,
 which is the custome of manie countries of this region; also the woman
 to haue the third of hir husbands possessions, the husband that
 marieth an heire to haue such lands as moue by hir during his naturall
 life, if he suruiue hir, and hath a child by hir which hath beene
 heard crie thorough foure wals, &c: of such like to be learned
 elsewhere, and sometimes frequented generallie ouer all.

 [Sidenote: Prescription.]
 Prescription is a certeine custome, which hath continued time out of
 minde, but it is more particular than customarie law, as where onelie
 a parish or some priuat person dooth prescribe to haue common, or a
 waie in another mans soile, or tithes to be paid after this or that
 maner, I meane otherwise than the common course and order of the law
 requireth, whereof let this suffice at this time, in steed of a larger
 discourse of our owne lawes, least I should seeme to enter farre into
 that whereof I haue no skill. For what hath the meditation of the law
 of God to doo with anie precise knowledge of the law of man, sith they
 are seuerall trades, and incident to diuerse persons?

 There are also sundrie vsuall courts holden once in euerie quarter of
 [Sidenote: Terme.]
 the yeare, which we commonlie call termes, of the Latine word
 Terminus, wherein all controuersies are determined, that happen within
 the Queenes dominions. These are commonlie holden at London, except
 vpon some great occasion they be transferred to other places. At what
 times also they are kept both for spirituall and temporall dealing,
 the table insuing shall easilie declare. Finallie how well they are
 followed by sutors, the great wealth of lawiers without anie trauell
 of mine can readilie expresse. For as after the comming of the Normans
 the nobilitie had the start, and after them the cleargie: so now all
 the wealth of the land dooth flow vnto our common lawiers, of whome
 some one hauing practised little aboue thirteene or fourteene yeares
 is able to buie a purchase of so manie 1000 pounds: which argueth that
 they wax rich apace, and will be richer if their clients become not
 the more wiser & warie hereafter. It is not long, since a sergeant at
 the law (whome I could name) was arrested vpon an extent, for three or
 foure hundred pounds, and another standing by did greatlie maruell
 that he could not spare the gaines of one terme for the satisfaction
 of that dutie. The time hath beene that our lawiers did sit in Powles
 vpon stooles against the pillers and walles to get clients, but now
 some of them will not come from their chambers to the Guildhall in
 London vnder ten pounds or twentie nobles at the lest. And one being
 demanded why he made so much of his trauell, answered, that it was but
 follie for him to go so farre, when he was assured to get more monie
 by sitting still at home. A friend of mine also had a sute of late of
 some valure, and to be sure of counsell at his time, he gaue vnto two
 lawiers (whose names I forbeare to deliuer) twentie shillings a peece,
 telling them of the daie and houre wherein his matter should be called
 [Sidenote: Deceipt.]
 vpon. To be short, they came not vnto the barre at all, whervpon he
 staied for that daie. On the morrow after he met them againe,
 increased his former gifts by so much more, and told them of the time,
 but they once againe serued him as before. In the end he met them both
 in the verie hall doore, and after some timorous reprehension, of
 their vncourteous demeanour toward him, he bestowed either three
 angels or foure more vpon each of them, wherevpon they promised
 peremptorilie to speake earnestlie in his cause. And yet for all this,
 one of them hauing not yet sucked enough, vtterlie deceiued him: the
 other in deed came in, and wagging a scroll which he had in his hand
 before the iudge, he spake not aboue three or foure words, almost so
 soone vttered as a good morrow, and so went from the bar, and this was
 all the poore man gat for his monie, and the care which his
 counsellours did seeme to take of his cause, then standing vpon the
 [Sidenote: Manie of our lawiers stoope not at small fees.]
 hazard. But inough of these matters, for if I should set downe how
 little law poore men can haue for their small fees in these daies, and
 the great murmurings that are on all sides vttered against their
 excessiue taking of monie (for they can abide no small gaine) I should
 extend this treatise into a farre greater volume than is conuenient
 for my purpose. Wherfore it shall suffice to haue set downe so much of
 their demeanour, and so much as is euen enough to cause them to looke
 with somewhat more conscience into their dealings, except they be dull
 and senselesse.

 This furthermore is to be noted, that albeit the princes heretofore
 reigning in this land haue erected sundrie courts, especiallie of the
 chancerie at Yorke and Ludlow, for the ease of poore men dwelling in
 [Sidenote: Poore men contentious.]
 those parts, yet will the poorest (of all men commonlie most
 contentious) refuse to haue his cause heard so neere home, but
 indeuoureth rather to his vtter vndooing to trauell vp to London,
 thinking there soonest to preuaile against his aduersarie, though his
 case be neuer so doubtfull. But in this toie  our Welshmen doo exceed
 of all that euer I heard, for you shall here and there haue some one
 od poore Dauid of them giuen so much to contention and strife, that
 without all respect of charges he will vp to London, though he go
 bare legged by the waie, and carie his hosen on his necke (to saue
 their feet from wearing) bicause he hath no change. When he commeth
 there also, he will make such importunate begging of his countrimen,
 and hard shift otherwise, that he will sometimes carie downe six or
 seuen writs with him in his pursse, wherewith to molest his neighbor,
 though the greatest quarrel be scarselie worth the fee that he hath
 paid for anie one of them. But inough of this, least in reuealing the
 superfluous follie of a few brablers in this behalfe, I bring no good
 will to my selfe amongst the wisest of that nation. Certes it is a
 [Sidenote: Promoters seeke matters to set lawiers on worke withall.]
 lamentable case to see furthermore, how a number of poore men are
 dailie abused and vtterlie vndoone, by sundrie varlets that go about
 the countrie, as promoters or brokers betweene the pettie foggers of
 the lawe, and the common people, onelie to kindle and espie coales of
 contention, whereby the one side may reape commoditie, and the other
 spend and be put to trauell. But of all that euer I knew in Essex,
 Denis and Mainford excelled, till Iohn of Ludlow, alias Mason came in
 place, vnto whome in comparison they two were but children: for this
 last in lesse than three or foure yeares, did bring one man (among
 manie else-where in other places) almost to extreame miserie (if
 beggerie be the vttermost) that before he had the shauing of his
 beard, was valued at two hundred pounds (I speake with the least) and
 finallie feeling that he had not sufficient wherwith to susteine
 himselfe and his familie, and also to satisfie that greedie rauenour,
 which still called vpon him for new fees, he went to bed, and within
 foure daies made an end of his wofull life, euen with care and
 pensiuenesse. After his death also he so handled his sonne, that
 there was neuer sheepe shorne in Maie, so neere clipped of his fleece
 present, as he was of manie to come: so that he was compelled to let
 awaie his land, bicause his cattell & stocke were consumed, and he no
 longer able to occupie the ground. But hereof let this suffice, & in
 steed of these enormities, a table shall follow of the termes
 conteining their beginnings and endings, as I haue borrowed them from
 my freend Iohn Stow, whose studie is the onelie store house of
 antiquities in my time, and he worthie therefore to be had in
 reputation and honour.

 [Sidenote: The times of our termes no hinderance to iustice.]
 A man would imagine that the time of the execution of our lawes, being
 little aboue one quarter, or not fullie a third part of the yeare, and
 the appointment of the same to be holden in one place onelie, to wit,
 neere London in Westminster, and finallie the great expenses emploied
 vpon the same, should be no small cause of the staie and hinderance of
 the administration of iustice in this land: but as it falleth out they
 prooue great occasions and the staie of much contention. The reasons
 of these are soone to be conceiued, for as the broken sleeue dooth
 hold the elbow backe, and paine of trauell cause manie to sit at home
 in quiet; so the shortnesse of time and feare of delaie dooth driue
 those oftentimes to like of peace, who otherwise would liue at strife,
 and quickelie be at ods. Some men desirous of gaines would haue the
 termes yet made shorter, that more delaie might ingender longer sute;
 other would haue the houses made larger, and more offices erected,
 wherein to minister the lawes. But as the times of the tearmes are
 rather too short than too long by one returne a peece: so if there
 were smaller roomes and fowler waies vnto them, they would inforce
 manie to make pawses before they did rashlie enter into plee. But sith
 my purpose is not to make an ample discourse of these things, it shall
 suffice to deliuer the times of the holding of our termes, which
 insueth after this manner.


 _A perfect rule to know the beginning and ending of euerie terme, with
 their returnes._

 Hilarie terme beginneth the three and twentith daie of Ianuarie (if it
 be not sundaie) otherwise the next daie after, and is finished the
 twelfe of Februarie, it hath foure returnes.

 returnes.

 Note also that the escheker, which is Fiscus aerarium publicum
 principis, openeth eight daies before anie terme begin, except
 Trinitie terme, which openeth but foure daies before.

 And thus much for our vsuall termes as they are kept for the
 administration of our common lawes, wherevnto I thinke good to adde
 the lawdaies accustomablie holden in the arches and audience of
 Canturburie, with other ecclesiasticall and ciuill courts thorough the
 whole yeare, or for somuch time as their execution indureth (which in
 comparison is scarselie one halfe of the time if it be diligentlie
 examined) to the end each one at home being called vp to answer may
 trulie know the time of his appearance; being sorie in the meane
 season, that the vse of the popish calendar is so much reteined in the
 same, and not rather the vsuall daies of the moneth placed in their
 roomes, sith most of them are fixed and palter not their place of
 standing. Howbeit some of our infected lawiers will not let them go
 awaie so easilie, pretending facilitie and custome of vsage, but
 meaning peraduenture inwardlie to keepe a commemoration of those dead
 men whose names are there remembred.

 ¶ It is to be remembred that the first daie following euerie of these
 feasts noted in each terme, the court of the arches is kept in Bow
 church in the forenoone. And the same first daie in the afternoone is
 the admeraltie court for ciuill and seafaring causes kept in
 Southwarke, where iustice is ministred & execution doone continuallie
 according to the same.

 The second daie following euerie one of the said feasts, the court of
 audience of Canturburie is kept in the consistorie in Paules in the
 forenoone. And the selfe daie in the afternoone, in the same place is
 the prerogatiue court of Canturburie holden.

 The third day after anie such feast in the forenoone, the consistorie
 court of the bishop of London is kept in Paules church in the said
 consistorie, and the same third daie in the afternoone is the court of
 the delegates, and the court of the Queenes highnesse commissioners
 vpon appeales is likewise kept in the same place on the fourth daie.

 Note that the foure first daies of this terme be certeine and
 vnchanged. The other are altered after the course of the yeare, and
 sometime kept and sometime omitted. For if it so happen that one of
 those feasts fall on wednesdaie, commonlie called Ashwednesdaie after
 the daie of S. Blase (so that the same lawdaie after Ashwednesdaie
 cannot be kept bicause the lawdaie of the other feast dooth light on
 the same) then the second lawdaie after Ashwednesdaie shall be kept,
 and the other omitted. And if the lawdaie after Ashwednesdaie be the
 next daie after the feast of S. Blase, then shall all and euerie court
 daies be obserued in order, as they may be kept conuenientlie. And
 marke that although Ashwednesdaie be put the seuenth in order, yet it
 hath no certeine place, but is changed as the course of Easter causeth
 it.

 noted, which next follow by course of the yeare after Easter, and the
 like space being kept betweene other feasts.

 The rest of the lawdaies are kept to the third of the Ascension, which
 is the last day of this terme. And if it happen that the feast of the
 Ascension of our Lord, doo come before anie of the feasts aforesaid,
 then they are omitted for that yeare. And likewise if anie of those
 daies come before the fifteenth of Easter, those daies are omitted
 also.

 Here note also that the lawdaies of this terme are altered by meane of
 Whitsuntide, and the first sitting is kept alwaies on the first
 lawdaie after the feast of the holie Trinitie, and the second session
 is kept the first lawdaie after the idolatrous and papisticall feast
 daie called Corpus Christi, except Corpus Christi daie fall on some
 day aforenamed: which chanceth sometime, and then the fitter daie is
 kept. And after the second session account foure daies or thereabout,
 and then looke which is the next feast day, and the first lawdaie
 after the said feast shall be the third session. The other law daies
 follow in order, but so manie of them are kept, as for the time of the
 yeare shall be thought meet.

 It is also generallie to be obserued, that euerie daie is called a
 lawdaie that is not sundaie or holie daie: and that if the feast daie
 being knowne of anie court daie in anie terme, the first or second
 daie following be sundaie, then the court daie is kept the daie after
 the said holie daie or feast.




 OF PROUISION MADE FOR THE POORE.

 CHAP. X.


 There is no common-wealth at this daie in Europe, wherin there is not
 great store of poore people, and those necessarilie to be relieued by
 the welthier sort, which otherwise would starue and come to vtter
 [Sidenote: Three sorts of poore.]
 confusion. With vs the poore is commonlie diuided into three sorts, so
 that some are poore by impotencie, as the fatherlesse child, the aged,
 blind and lame, and the diseased person that is iudged to be
 incurable: the second are poore by casualtie, as the wounded souldier,
 the decaied householder, and the sicke person visited with grieuous
 and painefull diseases: the third consisteth of thriftlesse poore, as
 the riotour that hath consumed all, the vagabund that will abide no
 where, but runneth vp and downe from place to place (as it were
 seeking worke and finding none) and finallie the roge and strumpet
 which are not possible to be diuided in sunder, but runne too and fro
 ouer all the realme, cheefelie keeping the champaine soiles in summer
 to auoid the scorching heat, and the woodland grounds in winter to
 eschew the blustering winds.

 For the first two sorts, that is to saie, the poore by impotencie, and
 the poore by casualtie, which are the true poore in deed, and for
 whome the word dooth bind vs to make some dailie prouision: there is
 order taken through out euerie parish in the realme, that weekelie
 collection shall be made for their helpe and sustentation, to the end
 they should not scatter abroad, and by begging here and there annoie
 both towne and countrie. Authoritie also is giuen vnto the iustices in
 euerie countie, and great penalties appointed for such as make
 default, to see that the intent of the statute in this behalfe be
 trulie executed, according to the purpose and meaning of the same, so
 that these two sorts are sufficientlie prouided for: and such as can
 liue within the limits of their allowance (as each one will doo that
 is godlie and well disposed) may well forbeare to rome and range
 about. But if they refuse to be supported by this benefit of the law,
 and will rather indeuour by going to and fro to mainteine their idle
 trades, then are they adiudged to be parcell of the third sort, and so
 in steed of courteous refreshing at home, are often corrected with
 sharpe execution, and whip of iustice abroad. Manie there are, which
 notwithstanding the rigor of the lawes prouided in that behalfe, yeeld
 rather with this libertie (as they call it) to be dailie vnder the
 feare and terrour of the whip, than by abiding where they were borne
 or bred, to be prouided for by the deuotion of the parishes. I found
 not long since a note of these latter sort, the effect whereof
 insueth. Idle beggers are such either through other mens occasion, or
 [Sidenote: A thing often seene.]
 through their owne default. By other mens occasion (as one waie for
 example) when some couetous man such I meane as haue the cast or right
 veine, dailie to make beggers inough wherby to pester the land,
 espieng a further commoditie in their commons, holds, and tenures,
 dooth find such meanes as thereby to wipe manie out of their
 occupiengs, and turne the same vnto his priuate gaines. Herevpon
 [Sidenote: At whose hands shall the bloud of these men be required?]
 it followeth, that although the wise and better minded, doo either
 forsake the realme for altogether, and seeke to liue in other
 countries, as France, Germanie, Barbarie, India, Moscouia, and verie
 Calecute, complaining of no roome to be left for them at home, doo so
 behaue themselues that they are worthilie to be accompted among the
 second sort: yet the greater part commonlie hauing nothing to staie
 vpon are wilfull, and therevpon doo either prooue idle beggers, or
 else continue starke theeues till the gallowes doo eat them vp, which
 is a lamentable case. Certes in some mans iudgements these things are
 but trifles, and not worthie the regarding. Some also doo grudge at
 the great increase of people in these daies, thinking a necessarie
 brood of cattell farre better than a superfluous augmentation of
 mankind. But I can liken such men best of all vnto the pope and the
 diuell, who practise the hinderance of the furniture of the number of
 the elect to their vttermost, to the end the authoritie of the one
 vpon earth, the deferring of the locking vp of the other in
 euerlasting chaines, and the great gaines of the first may continue
 and indure the longer. But if it should come to passe that any forren
 inuasion should be made, which the Lord God forbid for his mercies
 sake! then should these men find that a wall of men is farre better
 than stackes of corne and bags of monie, and complaine of the want
 when it is too late to seeke remedie. The like occasion caused the
 Romans to deuise their law Agraria: but the rich not liking of it, and
 the couetous vtterlie condemning it as rigorous and vnprofitable,
 neuer ceased to practise disturbance till it was quite abolished. But
 to proceed with my purpose.

 Such as are idle beggers through their owne default are of two sorts,
 and continue their estates either by casuall or meere voluntarie
 meanes: those that are such by casuall means, are in the beginning
 iustlie to be referred either to the first or second sort of poore
 afore mentioned: but degenerating into the thriftlesse sort, they doo
 what they can to continue their miserie, and with such impediments as
 they haue to straie and wander about, as creatures abhorring all
 labour and euerie honest exercise. Certes I call these casuall meanes,
 not in respect of the originall of their pouertie, but of the
 continuance of the same, from whence they will not be deliuered, such
 is their owne vngratious lewdnesse, and froward disposition. The
 voluntarie meanes proceed from outward causes, as by making of
 corosiues, and applieng the same to the more fleshie parts of their
 bodies: and also laieng of ratsbane, sperewort, crowfoot, and such
 like vnto their whole members, thereby to raise pitifull and odious
 sores, and mooue the harts of the goers by such places where they lie,
 to yerne at their miserie, and therevpon bestow large almesse vpon
 them. How artificiallie they beg, what forcible speech, and how they
 select and choose out words of vehemencie, whereby they doo in maner
 coniure or adiure the goer by to pitie their cases, I passe ouer to
 remember, as iudging the name of God and Christ to be more conuersant
 in the mouths of none: and yet the presence of the heuenlie maiestie
 further off from no men than from this vngratious companie. Which
 maketh me to thinke that punishment is farre meeter for them than
 liberalitie or almesse, and sith Christ willeth vs cheeflie to haue a
 regard to himselfe and his poore members.

 Vnto this nest is another sort to be referred, more sturdie than the
 rest, which hauing sound and perfect lims, doo yet notwithstanding
 sometime counterfeit the possession of all sorts of diseases. Diuerse
 times in their apparell also they will be like seruing men or
 laborers: oftentimes they can plaie the mariners, and seeke for ships
 which they neuer lost. But in fine, they are all theeues and
 caterpillers in the common-wealth, and by the word of God not
 permitted to eat, sith they doo but licke the sweat from the true
 labourers browes, & beereue the godlie poore of that which is due vnto
 them, to mainteine their excesse, consuming the charitie of well
 disposed people bestowed vpon them, after a most wicked & detestable
 maner.

 It is not yet full threescore yeares since this trade began: but how
 it hath prospered since that time, it is easie to iudge, for they are
 now supposed of one sex and another, to amount vnto aboue 10000
 persons; as I haue heard reported. Moreouer, in counterfeiting the
 Egyptian roges, they haue deuised a language among themselues, which
 they name Canting, but other pedlers French, a speach compact thirtie
 yeares since of English, and a great number of od words of their owne
 deuising, without all order or reason: and yet such is it as none but
 themselues are able to vnderstand. The first deuiser thereof was
 hanged by the necke, a iust reward no doubt for his deserts, and a
 [Sidenote: Thomas Harman.]
 common end to all of that profession. A gentleman also of late hath
 taken great paines to search out the secret practises of this
 vngratious rable. And among other things he setteth downe and
 describeth three & twentie sorts of them, whose names it shall not be
 amisse to remember, wherby ech one may take occasion to read and know
 as also by his industrie what wicked people they are, and what
 villanie remaineth in them.

 The punishment that is ordeined for this kind of people is verie
 sharpe, and yet it can not restreine them from their gadding:
 wherefore the end must needs be martiall law, to be exercised vpon
 them, as vpon theeues, robbers, despisers of all lawes, and enimies to
 the common-wealth & welfare of the land. What notable roberies,
 pilferies, murders, rapes, and stealings of yoong children, burning,
 breaking and disfiguring their lims to make them pitifull in the sight
 of the people, I need not to rehearse: but for their idle roging about
 the countrie, the law ordeineth this maner of correction. The roge
 being apprehended, committed to prison, and tried in the next assises
 (whether they be of gaole deliuerie or sessions of the peace) if he
 happen to be conuicted for a vagabond either by inquest of office, or
 the testimonie of two honest and credible witnesses vpon their oths,
 he is then immediatlie adiudged to be greeuouslie whipped and burned
 through the gristle of the right eare, with an hot iron of the
 compasse of an inch about, as a manifestation of his wicked life, and
 due punishment receiued for the same. And this iudgement is to be
 executed vpon him, except some honest person woorth fiue pounds in the
 queenes books in goods, or twentie shillings in lands, or some rich
 housholder to be allowed by the iustices, will be bound in
 recognisance to reteine him in his seruice for one whole yeare. If he
 be taken the second time, and proued to haue forsaken his said
 seruice, he shall then be whipped againe, bored likewise through the
 other eare and set to seruice: from whence if he depart before a yeare
 be expired, and happen afterward to be attached againe, he is
 condemned to suffer paines of death as a fellon (except before
 excepted) without benefit of clergie or sanctuarie, as by the statute
 dooth appeare. Among roges and idle persons finallie, we find to be
 comprised all proctors that go vp and downe with counterfeit licences,
 coosiners, and such as gad about the countrie, vsing vnlawfull games,
 practisers of physiognomie and palmestrie, tellers of fortunes,
 fensers, plaiers, minstrels, iugglers, pedlers, tinkers, pretensed
 schollers, shipmen, prisoners gathering for fees, and others so oft as
 they be taken without sufficient licence. From among which companie
 our bearewards are not excepted, and iust cause: for I haue read that
 they haue either voluntarilie, or for want of power to master their
 sauage beasts, beene occasion of the death and deuoration of manie
 children in sundrie countries by which they haue passed, whose parents
 neuer knew what was become of them. And for that cause there is & haue
 beene manie sharpe lawes made for bearwards in Germanie, wherof you
 may read in other. But to our roges. Each one also that harboreth or
 aideth them with meat or monie, is taxed and compelled to fine with
 the queenes maiestie for euerie time that he dooth so succour them, as
 it shall please the iustices of peace to assigne, so that the taxation
 exceed not twentie shillings, as I haue beene informed. And thus much
 of the poore, & such prouision as is appointed for them within the
 realme of England.




 OF SUNDRIE KINDS OF PUNISHMENTS APPOINTED FOR MALEFACTORS.

 CHAP. XI.


 In cases of felonie, manslaghter, roberie, murther, rape, piracie, &
 such capitall crimes as are not reputed for treason or hurt of the
 estate, our sentence pronounced vpon the offendor is to hang till he
 be dead. For of other punishments vsed in other countries we haue no
 knowledge or vse, and yet so few greeuous crimes committed with vs as
 else where in the world. To vse torment also or question by paine and
 torture in these common cases with vs is greatlie abhorred, sith we
 are found alwaie to be such as despise death, and yet abhorre to be
 tormented, choosing rather frankelie to open our minds than to yeeld
 our bodies vnto such seruile halings and tearings as are vsed in other
 countries. And this is one cause wherefore our condemned persons doo
 go so cheerefullie to their deths, for our nation is free, stout,
 hautie, prodigall of life and bloud, as sir Thomas Smith saith lib. 2.
 cap. 25. de republica, and therefore cannot in anie wise digest to be
 vsed as villanes and slaues, in suffering continuallie beating,
 seruitude, and seruile torments. No, our gailers are guiltie of
 fellonie by an old law of the land, if they torment anie prisoner
 committed to their custodie for the reuealing of his complices.

 The greatest and most greeuous punishment vsed in England, for such as
 offend against the state, is drawing from the prison to the place of
 execution vpon an hardle or sled, where they are hanged till they be
 halfe dead, and then taken downe and quartered aliue, after that their
 members and bowels are cut from their bodies, and throwne into a fire
 prouided neere hand and within their owne sight, euen for the same
 purpose. Sometimes, if the trespasse be not the more hainous, they are
 suffered to hang till they be quite dead. And when soeuer anie of the
 nobilitie are conuicted of high treason by their peeres, that is to
 saie, equals (for an inquest of yeomen passeth not vpon them, but
 onelie of the lords of the parlement) this maner of their death is
 conuerted into the losse of their heads onelie, notwithstanding that
 the sentence doo run after the former order. In triall of cases
 concerning treason, fellonie, or anie other greeuous crime not
 confessed, the partie accused dooth yeeld, if he be a noble man, to be
 tried by an inquest (as I haue said) and his peeres: if a gentleman,
 by gentlemen: and an inferiour, by God and by the countrie, to wit,
 the yeomanrie (for combat or battell is not greatlie in vse) and being
 condemned of fellonie, manslaughter, &c: he is eftsoons hanged by the
 necke till he be dead, and then cut downe and buried. But if he be
 conuicted of wilfull murther, doone either vpon pretended malice, or
 in anie notable robberie, he is either hanged aliue in chaines neere
 the place where the fact was committed (or else vpon compassion taken
 first strangled with a rope) and so continueth till his bones consume
 to nothing. We haue vse neither of the wheele nor of the barre, as in
 other countries; but when wilfull manslaughter is perpetrated, beside
 hanging, the offendor hath his right hand commonlie striken off before
 or neere vnto the place where the act was doone, after which he is led
 foorth to the place of execution, and there put to death according to
 the law.

 The word fellon is deriued of the Saxon words Fell and One, that is to
 say, an euill and wicked one, a one of vntamable nature, and lewdnesse
 not to be suffered for feare of euill example and the corruption of
 others. In like sort in the word fellonie are manie greeuous crimes
 conteined, as breach of prison An. 1 of Edward the second. Disfigurers
 of the princes liege people An. 5. of Henrie the fourth. Hunting by
 night with painted faces and visors An. 1. of Henrie the seuenth. Rape
 or stealing of women & maidens An. 3 of Henrie the eight. Conspiracie
 against the person of the prince An. 3. of Henrie the seuenth.
 Embesilling of goods committed by the master to the seruant, aboue the
 value of fourtie shillings An. 17. of Henrie the eight. Carieng of
 horsses or mares into Scotland An. 23. of Henrie the eight. Sodomie
 and buggerie An. 25. of Henrie the eight. Stealing of hawkes egs An.
 31. of Henrie the eight. Coniuring, sorcerie, witchcraft, and digging
 vp of crosses An. 33. of Hen. 8. Prophesieng vpon armes, cognisances,
 names & badges An. 33. of Hen. 8. Casting of slanderous bils An. 37.
 Hen. 8. Wilfull killing by poison An. 1. of Edw. the sixt. Departure
 of a soldier from the field An. 2. of Edward the sixt. Diminution of
 coine, all offenses within case of premunire, embeselling of records,
 goods taken from dead men by their seruants, stealing of what soeuer
 cattell, robbing by the high waie, vpon the sea, or of dwelling
 houses, letting out of ponds, cutting of pursses, stealing of deere by
 night, counterfeiters of coine, euidences, charters, and writings, &
 diuerse other needlesse to be remembred. If a woman poison hir husband
 she is burned aliue, if the seruant kill his master he is to be
 executed for petie treason, he that poisoneth a man is to be boiled to
 death in water or lead, although the partie die not of the practise:
 in cases of murther all the accessaries are to suffer paines of death
 accordinglie. Periurie is punished by the pillorie, burning in the
 forehead with the letter P, the rewalting of the trees growing vpon
 the grounds of the offenders and losse of all his mooueables. Manie
 trespasses also are punished by the cutting of one or both eares from
 the head of the offendor, as the vtterance of seditious words against
 the magistrates, fraimakers, petie robbers, &c. Roges are burned
 through the eares, cariers of sheepe out of the land by the losse of
 their hands, such as kill by poison are either boiled or skalded to
 death in lead or seething water. Heretikes are burned quicke, harlots
 and their mates by carting, ducking, and dooing of open penance in
 sheets, in churches and market steeds are often put to rebuke. Howbeit
 as this is counted with some either as no punishment at all to speake
 of, or but smallie regarded of the offendors, so I would wish
 adulterie and fornication to haue some sharper law. For what great
 smart is it to be turned out of an hot sheet into a cold, or after a
 little washing in the water to be let lose againe vnto their former
 trades? Howbeit the dragging of some of them ouer the Thames betweene
 Lambeth and Westminster at the taile of a boat, is a punishment that
 most terrifieth them which are condemned therto; but this is inflicted
 vpon them by none other than the knight marshall, and that within the
 compasse of his iurisdiction & limits onelie. Canutus was the first
 that gaue authoritie to the cleargie to punish whoredome, who at that
 time found fault with the former lawes as being too seuere in this
 behalfe. For before the time of the said Canutus, the adulterer
 forfeited all his goods to the king, and his bodie to be at his
 pleasure; and the adulteresse was to lose hir eies or nose, or both,
 if the case were more than common: whereby it appeereth of what
 estimation mariage was amongst them, sith the breakers of that holie
 estate were so greeuouslie rewarded. But afterward the cleargie dealt
 more fauourablie with them, shooting rather at the punishments of such
 priests and clearkes as were maried, than the reformation of adulterie
 and fornication, wherein you shall find no example that anie seueritie
 was shewed, except vpon such laie men as had defiled their nuns. As in
 theft therefore so in adulterie and whoredome I would wish the parties
 trespassant, to be made bond or slaues vnto those that receiued the
 iniurie, to sell and giue where they listed, or to be condemned to the
 gallies: for that punishment would proue more bitter to them than
 halfe an houres hanging, or than standing in a sheet, though the
 weather be neuer so cold.

 Manslaughter in time past was punished by the pursse, wherin the
 quantitie or qualitie of the punishment was rated after the state and
 calling of the partie killed: so that one was valued sometime at 1200,
 another at 600, or 200 shillings. And by an estatute made vnder Henrie
 the first, a citizen of London at 100, whereof else-where I haue
 spoken more at large. Such as kill themselues are buried in the field
 with a stake driuen through their bodies.

 Witches are hanged or sometimes burned, but theeues are hanged (as I
 [Sidenote: Halifax law.]
 said before) generallie on the gibbet or gallowes, sauing in Halifax
 where they are beheaded after a strange maner, and whereof I find this
 report. There is and hath beene of ancient time a law or rather a
 custome at Halifax, that who soeuer dooth commit anie fellonie, and is
 taken with the same, or confesse the fact vpon examination: if it be
 valued by foure constables to amount to the sum of thirteene pence
 halfe penie, he is foorthwith beheaded vpon one of the next market
 daies (which fall vsuallie vpon the tuesdaies, thursdaies, &
 saturdaies) or else vpon the same daie that he is so conuicted, if
 market be then holden. The engine wherewith the execution is doone, is
 a square blocke of wood of the length of foure foot and an halfe,
 which dooth ride vp and downe in a slot, rabet, or regall betweene two
 peeces of timber, that are framed and set vpright of fiue yardes in
 height. In the neather end of the sliding blocke is an ax keied or
 fastened with an iron into the wood, which being drawne vp to the top
 of the frame is there fastened by a woodden pin (with a notch made
 into the same after the maner of a Samsons post) vnto the middest of
 which pin also there is a long rope fastened that commeth downe among
 the people, so that when the offendor hath made his confession, and
 hath laid his necke ouer the neathermost blocke, euerie man there
 present dooth either take hold of the rope (or putteth foorth his arme
 so neere to the same as he can get, in token that he is willing to see
 true iustice executed) and pulling out the pin in this maner, the head
 blocke wherein the ax is fastened dooth fall downe with such a
 violence, that if the necke of the transgressor were so big as that of
 a bull, it should be cut in sunder at a stroke, and roll from the
 bodie by an huge distance. If it be so that the offendor be
 apprehended for an ox, oxen, sheepe, kine, horsse, or anie such
 cattell: the selfe beast or other of the same kind shall haue the end
 of the rope tied somewhere vnto them, so that they being driuen doo
 draw out the pin wherby the offendor is executed. Thus much of Halifax
 law, which I set downe onelie to shew the custome of that countrie in
 this behalfe.

 Roges and vagabonds are often stocked and whipped, scolds are ducked
 [Sidenote: Mute.]
 vpon cucking-stooles in the water. Such fellons as stand mute and
 speake not at their arraignement are pressed to death by huge weights
 laid vpon a boord, that lieth ouer their brest, and a sharpe stone
 vnder their backs, and these commonlie hold their peace, thereby to
 saue their goods vnto their wiues and children, which if they were
 condemned should be confiscated to the prince. Theeues that are saued
 [Sidenote: Cleargie.]
 by their bookes and cleargie, for the first offense, if they haue
 stollen nothing else but oxen, sheepe, monie, or such like, which be
 no open robberies, as by the high waie side, or assailing of anie mans
 house in the night, without putting him in feare of his life, or
 breaking vp of his wals or doores, are burned in the left hand, vpon
 the brawne of the thombe with an hot iron, so that if they be
 apprehended againe, that marke bewraieth them to haue beene arraigned
 of fellonie before, whereby they are sure at that time to haue no
 mercie. I doo not read that this custome of sauing by the booke is
 vsed anie where else than in England, neither doo I find (after much
 diligent inquirie) what Saxon prince ordeined that law. Howbeit, this
 I generallie gather thereof, that it was deuised to traine the
 inhabiters of this land to the loue of learning, which before
 contemned letters and all good knowledge, as men onelie giuing
 themselues to husbandrie and the warres, the like whereof I read to
 haue beene amongst the Gothes and Vandals, who for a time would not
 suffer euen their princes to be lerned for weakening of their
 courages, nor anie learned men to remaine in the counsell house, but
 by open proclamation would command them to auoid, whensoeuer anie
 [Sidenote: Pirats.]
 thing touching the state of the land was to be consulted vpon. Pirats
 and robbers by sea are condemned in the court of the admeraltie, and
 hanged on the shore at lowe water marke, where they are left till
 three tides haue ouerwashed them. Finallie, such as hauing wals and
 banks neere vnto the sea, and doo suffer the same to decaie (after
 conuenient admonition) whereby the water entereth and drowneth vp the
 countrie, are by a certeine ancient custome apprehended, condemned,
 and staked in the breach, where they remaine for euer as parcell of
 the foundation of the new wall that is to be made vpon them, as I haue
 heard reported.

 And thus much in part of the administration of iustice vsed in our
 countrie, wherein notwithstanding that we doo not often heare of
 horrible, merciles, and wilfull murthers (such I meane as are not
 sildome seene in the countries of the maine) yet now and then some
 manslaughter and bloudie robberies are perpetrated and committed,
 contrarie to the lawes, which be seuerelie punished, and in such wise
 as I before reported. Certes there is no greater mischeefe doone in
 England than by robberies, the first by yoong shifting gentlemen,
 which oftentimes doo beare more port than they are able to mainteine.
 Secondlie by seruingmen, whose wages cannot suffice so much as to find
 them breeches, wherefore they are now and then constreined either to
 keepe high waies, and breake into the wealthie mens houses with the
 first sort, or else to walke vp and downe in gentlemens and rich
 farmers pastures, there to see and view which horsses feed best,
 whereby they manie times get something, although with hard aduenture
 it hath beene knowne by their confession at the gallowes, that some
 one such chapman hath had fortie, fiftie, or sixtie stolne horsses at
 pasture here and there abroad in the countrie at a time, which they
 haue sold at faires and markets farre off, they themselues in the
 meane season being taken about home for honest yeomen, and verie
 wealthie drouers, till their dealings haue been bewraied. It is not
 long since one of this companie was apprehended, who was before time
 reputed for a verie honest and wealthie townesman, he vttered also
 more horsses than anie of his trade, because he sold a reasonable
 peniworth, and was a faire spoken man. It was his custome likewise to
 saie, if anie man hucked hard with him about the price of a gelding;
 So God helpe me gentleman or sir, either he did cost me so much, or
 else by Iesus I stole him. Which talke was plaine inough, and yet such
 was his estimation, that each beleeued the first part of his tale, and
 made no account of the later, which was the truer indeed.

 Our third annoiers of the common-wealth are roges, which doo verie
 great mischeefe in all places where they become. For wheras the rich
 onelie suffer iniurie by the first two, these spare neither rich nor
 poore: but whether it be great gaine or small, all is fish that
 commeth to net with them, and yet I saie both they and the rest are
 trussed vp apace. For there is not one yeare commonlie, wherein three
 hundred or four hundred of them are not deuoured and eaten vp by the
 gallowes in one place and other. It appeareth by Cardane (who writeth
 it vpon the report of the bishop of Lexouia) in the geniture of king
 Edward the sixt, how Henrie the eight, executing his laws verie
 seuerelie against such idle persons, I meane great theeues, pettie
 theeues and roges, did hang vp threescore and twelue thousand of them
 in his time. He seemed for a while greatlie to haue terrified the
 rest: but since his death the number of them is so increased, yea
 although we haue had no warres, which are a great occasion of their
 breed (for it is the custome of the more idle sort, hauing once serued
 or but seene the other side of the sea vnder colour of seruice to
 shake hand with labour, for euer, thinking it a disgrace for himselfe
 to returne vnto his former trade) that except some better order be
 taken, or the lawes alreadie made be better executed, such as dwell in
 vplandish townes and little villages shall liue but in small safetie
 and rest. For the better apprehension also of theeues and mankillers,
 there is an old law in England verie well prouided, whereby it is
 ordered, that if he that is robbed, or any man complaine and giue
 warning of slaughter or murther committed, the constable of the
 village wherevnto he commeth and crieth for succour, is to raise the
 parish about him, and to search woods, groues, and all suspected
 houses and places, where the trespasser may be, or is supposed to
 lurke; and not finding him there, he is to giue warning vnto the next
 constable, and so one constable after serch made to aduertise another
 from parish to parish, till they come to the same where the offender
 is harbored and found. It is also prouided, that if anie parish in
 this businesse doo not hir dutie, but suffereth the theefe (for the
 auoiding of trouble sake) in carrieng him to the gaile, if he should
 be apprehended, or other letting of their worke, to escape the same
 parish, is not onlie to make fine to the king, but also the same with
 the whole hundred wherein it standeth, to repaie the partie robbed his
 damages, and leaue his estate harmlesse. Certes this is a good law,
 howbeit I haue knowne by mine owne experience, fellons being taken to
 haue escaped out of the stocks, being rescued by other for want of
 watch & gard, that theeues haue beene let passe, bicause the couetous
 and greedie parishoners would neither take the paines, nor be at the
 charge to carrie them to prison, if it were far off, that when hue and
 crie haue beene made euen to the faces of some constables, they haue
 said; "God restore your losse, I haue other businesse at this time."
 And by such meanes the meaning of manie a good law is left vnexecuted,
 malefactors imboldened, and manie a poore man turned out of that which
 he hath swet and taken great paines for, toward the maintenance of
 himselfe and his poore children and familie.




 OF THE MANER OF BUILDING AND FURNITURE OF OUR HOUSES.

 CHAP. XII.


 The greatest part of our building in the cities and good townes of
 England consisteth onelie of timber, for as yet few of the houses of
 the communaltie (except here & there in the West countrie townes) are
 made of stone, although they may (in my opinion) in diuerse other
 places be builded so good cheape of the one as of the other. In old
 time the houses of the Britons were slightlie set vp with a few posts
 & many radels, with stable and all offices vnder one roofe, the like
 whereof almost is to be seene in the fennie countries and northerne
 parts vnto this daie, where for lacke of wood they are inforced to
 continue this ancient maner of building. It is not in vaine therefore
 in speaking of building to make a distinction betweene the plaine and
 wooddie soiles: for as in these, our houses are commonlie strong and
 well timbered, so that in manie places, there are not aboue foure,
 six, or nine inches betweene stud and stud; so in the open and
 champaine countries they are inforced for want of stuffe to vse no
 studs at all, but onlie franke posts, raisins, beames, prickeposts,
 groundsels, summers (or dormants) transoms, and such principals, with
 here and there a griding, whervnto they fasten their splints or
 radels, and then cast it all ouer with thicke claie to keepe out the
 wind, which otherwise would annoie them. Certes this rude kind of
 building made the Spaniards in queene Maries daies to woonder, but
 cheeflie when they saw what large diet was vsed in manie of these so
 homelie cottages, in so much that one of no small reputation amongst
 them said after this maner: "These English (quoth he) haue their
 houses made of sticks and durt, but they fare commonlie so well as the
 king." Whereby it appeareth that he liked better of our good fare in
 such course cabins, than of their owne thin diet in their princelike
 habitations and palaces. In like sort as euerie countrie house is thus
 apparelled on the out side, so is it inwardlie diuided into sundrie
 roomes aboue and beneath; and where plentie of wood is, they couer
 them with tiles, otherwise with straw, sedge, or reed, except some
 quarrie of slate be neere hand, from whence they haue for their monie
 so much as may suffice them.

 The claie wherewith our houses are impanelled is either white, red, or
 blue, and of these the first dooth participat verie much with the
 nature of our chalke, the second is called lome, but the third
 eftsoones changeth colour so soone as it is wrought, notwithstanding
 that it looke blue when it is throwne out of the pit. Of chalke also
 we haue our excellent Asbestos or white lime, made in most places,
 wherewith being quenched we strike ouer our claie workes and stone
 wals, in cities, good townes, rich farmers and gentlemens houses:
 otherwise in steed of chalke (where it wanteth for it is so scant that
 in some places it is sold by the pound) they are compelled to burne a
 certeine kind of red stone, as in Wales, and else where other stones
 and shels of oisters and like fish found vpon the sea coast, which
 being conuerted into lime doth naturallie (as the other) abhorre and
 eschew water whereby it is dissolued, and neuerthelesse desire oile
 wherewith it is easilie mixed, as I haue seene by experience. Within
 their doores also such as are of abilitie doo oft make their floores
 and parget of fine alabaster burned, which they call plaster of Paris,
 whereof in some places we haue great plentie, and that verie
 profitable against the rage of fire.

 In plastering likewise of our fairest houses ouer our heads, we vse to
 laie first a laine or two of white morter tempered with haire vpon
 laths, which are nailed one by another (or sometimes vpon reed or
 wickers more dangerous for fire, and made fast here and there with
 saplaths for falling downe) and finallie couer all with the aforesaid
 plaster, which beside the delectable whitenesse of the stuffe it
 selfe, is laied on so euen and smoothlie, as nothing in my iudgment
 can be doone with more exactnesse. The wals of our houses on the inner
 sides in like sort be either hanged with tapisterie, arras worke, or
 painted cloths, wherin either diuerse histories, or hearbes, beasts,
 knots, and such like are stained, or else they are seeled with oke of
 our owne, or wainescot brought hither out of the east countries,
 whereby the roomes are not a little commended, made warme, and much
 more close than otherwise they would be. As for stooues we haue not
 hitherto vsed them greatlie, yet doo they now begin to be made in
 diuerse houses of the gentrie and wealthie citizens, who build them
 not to worke and feed in as in Germanie and else where, but now and
 then to sweat in, as occasion and need shall require. This also hath
 beene common in England, contrarie to the customes of all other
 nations, and yet to be seene (for example in most streets of London)
 that many of our greatest houses haue outwardlie beene verie simple
 and plaine to sight, which inwardlie haue beene able to receiue a duke
 with his whole traine, and lodge them at their ease. Hereby moreouer
 it is come to passe, that the fronts of our streets haue not beene so
 vniforme and orderlie builded as those of forreine cities, where (to
 saie truth) the vtterside of their mansions and dwellings haue oft
 more cost bestowed vpon them, than all the rest of the house, which
 are often verie simple and vneasie within, as experience dooth
 confirme. Of old time our countrie houses in steed of glasse did vse
 much lattise and that made either of wicker or fine rifts of oke in
 chekerwise. I read also that some of the better sort, in and before
 the times of the Saxons (who notwithstanding vsed some glasse also
 since the time of Benedict Biscop the moonke that brought the feat of
 glasing first into this land) did make panels of horne in steed of
 glasse, & fix them in woodden calmes. But as horne in windows is now
 quite laid downe in euerie place, so our lattises are also growne into
 lesse vse, bicause glasse is come to be so plentifull, and within a
 verie little so good cheape if not better then the other.

 I find obscure mention of the specular stone also to haue beene found
 and applied to this vse in England, but in such doubtfull sort as I
 dare not affirme it for certeine. Neuerthelesse certeine it is that
 antiquitie vsed it before glasse was knowen, vnder the name of
 Selenites. And how glasse was first found I care not greatlie to
 remember euen at this present, although it be directlie beside my
 purposed matter. In Syria phenices which bordereth vpon Iurie, & neere
 to the foot of mount Carmell there is a moore or marris, wherout
 riseth a brooke called somtime Belus, and falleth into the sea neere
 to Ptolemais. This riuer was fondlie ascribed vnto Baall, and also
 honored vnder that name by the infidels, long time before there was
 anie king in Israell. It came to passe also as a certeine merchant
 sailed that way loden with Nitrum, the passengers went to land for to
 repose themselues, and to take in some store of fresh water into their
 vessell. Being also on the shore they kindled a fire, and made
 prouision for their dinner, but bicause they wanted treuets or stones
 whereon to set their kettels on, ran by chance into the ship, and
 brought great peeces of Nitrum with him, which serued their turne for
 that present. To be short, the said substance being hot, and beginning
 to melt, it mixed by chance with the grauel that laie vnder it; and so
 brought forth that shining substance which now is called glasse, and
 about the time of Semiramis. When the companie saw this, they made no
 small accompt of their successe, and foorthwith began to practise the
 like in other mixtures, whereby great varietie of the said stuffe did
 also insue. Certes for the time this historie may well be true: for I
 read of glasse in Iob, but for the rest I refer me to the common
 opinion conceiued by writers. Now to turne againe to our windowes.
 Heretofore also the houses of our princes and noble men were often
 glased with Berill (an example whereof is yet to be seene in Sudleie
 castell) and in diuerse other places with fine christall, but this
 especiallie in the time of the Romans, wherof also some fragments haue
 beene taken vp in old ruines. But now these are not in vse, so that
 onelie the clearest glasse is most esteemed: for we haue diuerse
 sorts, some brought out of Burgundie, some out of Normandie, much out
 of Flanders, beside that which is made in England, which would be so
 good as the best, if we were diligent and carefull to bestow more cost
 vpon it, and yet as it is, each one that may, will haue it for his
 building. Moreouer the mansion houses of our countrie townes and
 villages (which in champaine ground stand altogither by streets, &
 ioining one to an other, but in woodland soiles dispersed here and
 there, each one vpon the seuerall grounds of their owners) are builded
 in such sort generallie, as that they haue neither dairie, stable, nor
 bruehouse annexed vnto them vnder the same roofe (as in manie places
 beyond the sea & some of the north parts of our countrie) but all
 separate from the first, and one of them from an other. And yet for
 all this, they are not so farre distant in sunder, but that the
 goodman lieng in his bed may lightlie heare what is doone in each of
 them with ease, and call quicklie vnto his meinie if anie danger
 should attach him.

 The ancient manours and houses of our gentlemen are yet and for the
 most part of strong timber, in framing whereof our carpenters haue
 beene and are worthilie preferred before those of like science among
 all other nations. Howbeit such as be latelie builded, are c[=o]monlie
 either of bricke or hard stone, or both; their roomes large and
 comelie, and houses of office further distant from their lodgings.
 Those of the nobilitie are likewise wrought with bricke and hard
 stone, as prouision may best be made: but so magnificent and statelie,
 as the basest house of a baron dooth often match in our daies with
 some honours of princes in old time. So that if euer curious building
 did florish in England, it is in these our yeares, wherin our workemen
 excell, and are in maner comparable in skill with old Vitruuius, Leo
 Baptista, and Serlo. Neuerthelesse, their estimation more than their
 greedie and seruile couetousnesse, ioined with a lingering humour
 causeth them often to be rejected, & strangers preferred to greater
 bargaines, who are more reasonable in their takings, and lesse wasters
 of time by a great deale than our owne.

 The furniture of our houses also exceedeth, and is growne in maner
 euen to passing delicacie: and herein I doo not speake of the
 nobilitie and gentrie onelie, but likewise of the lowest sort in most
 places of our south countrie, that haue anie thing at all to take to.
 Certes in noble mens houses it is not rare to see abundance of Arras,
 rich hangings of tapistrie, siluer vessell, and so much other plate,
 as may furnish sundrie cupbords, to the summe oftentimes of a thousand
 or two thousand pounds at the least: whereby the value of this and the
 rest of their stuffe dooth grow to be almost inestimable. Likewise in
 the houses of knights, gentlemen, merchantmen, and some other wealthie
 citizens, it is not geson to behold generallie their great prouision
 of tapistrie, Turkie worke, pewter, brasse, fine linen, and thereto
 costlie cupbords of plate, worth fiue or six hundred or a thousand
 pounds, to be deemed by estimation. But as herein all these sorts doo
 far exceed their elders and predecessors, and in neatnesse and
 curiositie, the merchant all other; so in time past, the costlie
 furniture staied there, whereas now it is descended yet lower, euen
 vnto the inferiour artificers and manie farmers, who by vertue of
 their old and not of their new leases haue for the most part learned
 also to garnish their cupbords with plate, their ioined beds with
 tapistrie and silke hangings, and their tables with carpets & fine
 naperie, whereby the wealth of our countrie (God be praised therefore,
 and giue vs grace to imploie it well) dooth infinitelie appeare.
 Neither doo I speake this in reproch of anie man, God is my iudge, but
 to shew that I do reioise rather, to see how God hath blessed vs with
 his good gifts; and whilest I behold how that in a time wherein all
 things are growen to most excessiue prices, & what commoditie so euer
 is to be had, is dailie plucked from the communaltie by such as looke
 into euerie trade, we doo yet find the means to obtein & atchiue such
 furniture as heretofore hath beene vnpossible. There are old men yet
 [Sidenote: Three things greatlie amended in England.]
 dwelling in the village where I remaine, which haue noted three things
 to be maruellouslie altered in England within their sound remembrance;
 & other three things too too much increased. One is, the multitude of
 [Sidenote: Chimnies.]
 chimnies latelie erected, wheras in their yoong daies there were not
 aboue two or three, if so manie in most vplandish townes of the realme
 (the religious houses, & manour places of their lords alwaies
 excepted, and peraduenture some great personages) but ech one made his
 fire against a reredosse in the hall, where he dined and dressed his
 meat.

 The second is the great (although not generall) amendment of lodging,
 for (said they) our fathers (yea and we our selues also) haue lien
 [Sidenote: Hard lodging.]
 full oft vpon straw pallets, on rough mats couered onelie with a sheet
 vnder couerlets made of dagswain or hopharlots (I vse their owne
 termes) and a good round log vnder their heads in steed of a bolster
 or pillow. If it were so that our fathers or the good man of the
 house, had within seuen yeares after his mariage purchased a matteres
 or flockebed, and thereto a sacke of chaffe to rest his head vpon, he
 thought himselfe to be as well lodged as the lord of the towne, that
 peraduenture laie seldome in a bed of downe or whole fethers; so well
 were they contented, and with such base kind of furniture: which also
 is not verie much amended as yet in some parts of Bedfordshire, and
 elsewhere further off from our southerne parts. Pillowes (said they)
 were thought meet onelie for women in childbed. As for seruants, if
 they had anie sheet aboue them it was well, for seldome had they anie
 vnder their bodies, to keepe them from the pricking straws that ran
 oft through the canuas of the pallet, and rased their hardened hides.

 [Sidenote: Furniture of household.]
 The third thing they tell of, is the exchange of vessell, as of treene
 platters into pewter, and wodden spoones into siluer or tin. For so
 common were all sorts of treene stuffe in old time, that a man should
 hardlie find foure peeces of pewter (of which one was peraduenture a
 [Sidenote: This was in the time of generall idlenesse.]
 salt) in a good farmers house, and yet for all this frugalitie (if it
 may so be iustly called) they were scarse able to liue and paie their
 rents at their daies without selling of a cow, or an horsse, or more,
 although they paid but foure pounds at the vttermost by the yeare.
 Such also was their pouertie, that if some one od farmer or husbandman
 had beene at the alehouse, a thing greatlie vsed in those daies,
 amongst six or seuen of his neighbours, and there in a brauerie to
 shew what store he had, did cast downe his pursse, and therein a noble
 or six shillings in siluer vnto them (for few such men then cared for
 gold bicause it was not so readie paiment, and they were oft inforced
 to giue a penie for the exchange of an angell) it was verie likelie
 that all the rest could not laie downe so much against it: whereas in
 my time, although peraduenture foure pounds of old rent be improued to
 fortie, fiftie, or an hundred pounds, yet will the farmer as another
 palme or date tree thinke his gaines verie small toward the end of his
 terme, if he haue not six or seuen yeares rent lieng by him, therewith
 to purchase a new lease, beside a faire garnish of pewter on his
 cupbord, with so much more in od vessell going about the house, three
 or foure featherbeds, so manie couerlids and carpets of tapistrie, a
 siluer salt, a bowle for wine (if not an whole neast) and a dozzen of
 spoones to furnish vp the sute. This also he taketh to be his owne
 cleere, for what stocke of monie soeuer he gathereth & laieth vp in
 all his yeares, it is often seene, that the landlord will take such
 order with him for the same, when he renueth his lease, which is
 commonlie eight or six yeares before the old be expired (sith it is
 now growen almost to a custome, that if he come not to his lord so
 long before, another shall step in for a reuersion, and so defeat him
 out right) that it shall neuer trouble him more than the haire of his
 beard, when the barber hath washed and shauen it from his chin. And as
 they commend these, so (beside the decaie of housekeeping whereby the
 poore haue beene relieued) they speake also of three things that are
 growen to be verie grieuous vnto them, to wit, the inhansing of rents,
 latelie mentioned; the dailie oppression of copiholders, whose lords
 seeke to bring their poore tenants almost into plaine seruitude and
 miserie, dailie deuising new meanes, and seeking vp all the old how to
 cut them shorter and shorter, doubling, trebling, and now & then seuen
 times increasing their fines, driuing them also for euerie trifle to
 loose and forfeit their tenures (by whome the greatest part of the
 realme dooth stand and is mainteined) to the end they may fleece them
 yet more, which is a lamentable hering. The third thing they talke of
 is vsurie, a trade brought in by the Iewes, now perfectlie practised
 almost by euerie christian, and so commonlie that he is accompted but
 for a foole that dooth lend his monie for nothing. In time past it was
 "Sors pro sorte," that is, the principall onelie for the principall;
 but now beside that which is aboue the principall properlie called
 "Vsura," we chalenge "F[oe]nus," that is commoditie of soile, & fruits
 of the earth, if not the ground it selfe. In time past also one of the
 hundred was much, from thence it rose vnto two, called in Latine
 "Vsura, Ex sextante;" three, to wit "Ex quadrante;" then to foure, to
 wit "Ex triente;" then to fiue, which is "Ex quincunce;" then to six,
 called "Ex semisse," &c: as the accompt of the "Assis" ariseth, and
 comming at the last vnto "Vsura ex asse," it amounteth to twelue in
 the hundred, and therefore the Latines call it "Centesima," for that
 in the hundred moneth it doubleth the principall; but more of this
 elsewhere. See Cicero against Verres, Demosthenes against Aphobus, and
 Athenaeus lib. 13. in fine: and when thou hast read them well, helpe I
 praie thee in lawfull maner to hang vp such as take "Centu[=u] pro
 cento," for they are no better worthie as I doo iudge in conscience.
 [Sidenote: By the yeare.]
 Forget not also such landlords as vse to value their leases at a
 secret estimation giuen of the wealth and credit of the taker, whereby
 they seeme (as it were) to eat them vp and deale with bondmen, so that
 if the leassee be thought to be worth an hundred pounds, he shall paie
 no lesse for his new terme, or else another to enter with hard and
 doubtfull couenants. I am sorie to report it, much more greeued to
 vnderstand of the practise; but most sorowfull of all to vnderstand
 that men of great port and countenance are so farre from suffering
 their farmers to haue anie gaine at all, that they themselues become
 grasiers, butchers, tanners, sheepmasters, woodmen, and "denique quid
 non," thereby to inrich themselues, and bring all the wealth of the
 countrie into their owne hands, leauing the communaltie weake, or as
 an idoll with broken or feeble armes, which may in a time of peace
 haue a plausible shew, but when necessitie shall inforce, haue an
 heauie and bitter sequele.




 OF CITIES AND TOWNES IN ENGLAND.

 CAP. XIII.


 [Sidenote: Six and twentie cities in England.]
 As in old time we read that there were eight and twentie flamines and
 archflamines in the south part of this Ile, and so manie great cities
 vnder their iurisdiction: so in these our daies there is but one or
 two fewer, and each of them also vnder the ecclesiasticall regiment of
 some one bishop or archbishop, who in spirituall cases haue the charge
 and ouersight of the same. So manie cities therefore are there in
 England and Wales, as there be bishopriks & archbishopriks. For
 notwithstanding that Lichfield and Couentrie, and Bath and Welles, doo
 seeme to extend the aforesaid number vnto nine and twentie: yet
 neither of these couples are to be accounted, but as one entier citie
 and see of the bishop, sith one bishoprike can haue relation but vnto
 one see, and the said see be situate but in one place, after which the
 bishop dooth take his name. It appeareth by our old and ancient
 histories, that the cities of this southerlie portion haue beene of
 exceeding greatnesse and beautie, whereof some were builded in the
 time of the Samotheans, and of which not a few in these our times are
 quite decaied, and the places where they stood worne out of all
 remembrance. Such also for the most part as yet remaine are
 maruellouslie altered, insomuch that whereas at the first they were
 large and ample, now are they come either vnto a verie few houses, or
 appeare not to be much greater in comparison than poore & simple
 villages. Antoninus the most diligent writer of the thorough fares of
 Britaine, noteth among other these ancient townes following, as
 [Sidenote: Sitomagus.]
 Sitomagus, which he placeth in the waie from Norwich, as Leland
 [Sidenote: Nouiomagus.]
 supposeth (wherin they went by Colchester) to London, Nouiomagus that
 lieth betweene Carleill and Canturburie, within ten miles east of
 [Sidenote: Neomagus.]
 [Sidenote: Niomagus.]
 London, and likewise Neomagus and Niomagus which take their names of
 their first founder Magus, the sonne of Samothes, & second king of the
 Celtes that reigned in this Iland; and not "A profunditate," onelie,
 as Bodinus affirmeth out of Plinie, as if all the townes that ended in
 Magus should stand in holes and low grounds: which is to be disprooued
 in diuerse cities in the maine, as also here with vs. Of these
 moreouer sir Thomas Eliot supposeth Neomagus to haue stood somewhere
 about Chester; & George Lillie in his booke of the names of ancient
 places, iudgeth Niomagus to be the verie same that we doo now call
 Buckingham, and lieth farre from the shore. And as these and sundrie
 other now perished tooke their denomination of this prince, so there
 [Sidenote: Salisburie of Sarron.]
 are diuerse causes, which mooue me to coniecture, that Salisburie
 dooth rather take the first name of Sarron the sonne of the said
 Magus, than of Caesar, Caradoc or Seuerus (as some of our writers doo
 imagine) or else at the least wise of Salisburge of the maine, from
 whence some Saxons came to inhabit in this land. And for this later
 not vnlikelie, sith before the comming of the Saxons, the king of the
 Suessionenses had a great part of this Iland in subiection, as Caesar
 saith; and in another place that such of Belgie as stale ouer hither
 from the maine, builded and called diuerse cities after the names of
 [Sidenote: Sarronium.]
 [Sidenote: Sarronsburg.]
 the same from whence they came, I meane such as stood vpon the coast,
 as he himselfe dooth witnesse. But sith coniectures are no verities,
 and mine opinion is but one mans iudgement, I will not stand now vpon
 the proofe of this matter, least I should seeme to take great paines
 in adding new coniectures vnto old, in such wise to deteine the heads
 of my readers about these trifles, that otherwise peraduenture would
 be farre better occupied in matters of more importance. To proceed
 therefore. As soone after the first inhabitation of this Iland, our
 cities began no doubt to be builded and increased, so they ceased not
 to multiplie from time to time, till the land was throughlie furnished
 with hir conuenient numbers, whereof some at this present with their
 ancient names, doo still remaine in knowledge, though diuerse be
 doubted of, and manie more perished by continuance of time, and
 violence of the enimie. I doubt not also but the least of these were
 [Sidenote: Greater cities in times past when husbandmen
 also were citizens.]
 comparable to the greatest of those which stand in our time, for sith
 that in those daies the most part of the Iland was reserued vnto
 pasture, the townes and villages either were not at all (but all sorts
 of people dwelled in the cities indifferentlie, an image of which
 estate may yet be seene in Spaine) or at the lestwise stood not so
 thicke, as they did afterward in the time of the Romans, but cheefelie
 [Sidenote: The cause of the increase of villages.]
 after the comming of the Saxons, and after them the Normans, when
 euerie lord builded a church neare vnto his owne mansion house, and
 thereto imparted the greatest portion of his lands vnto sundrie
 tenants, to hold the same of him by coppie of court roll, which rolles
 were then kept in some especiall place indifferentlie appointed by
 them and their lord, so that the one could haue no resort vnto them
 without the other, by which means the number of townes and villages
 was not a little increased. If anie man be desirous to know the names
 of those ancient cities, that stood in the time of the Romans, he
 shall haue them here at hand, in such wise as I haue gathered them out
 of our writers, obseruing euen their manner of writing of them so
 neare as to me is possible, without alteration of anie corruption
 crept vp into the same.

 As for Cair Dorme (another whereof I read likewise) it stood somewhere
 vpon the Nene in Huntingdon shire, but now vnknowne, sith it was twise
 raced to the ground, first by the Saxons, then by the Danes, so that
 the ruines thereof are in these daies not extant to be seene. And in
 like sort I am ignorant where most of them stood, that are noted with
 the star. I find in like sort mention of a noble citie called Alcluid
 ouer and beside these afore mentioned, sometime builded by Ebracus of
 Britaine, as the fame goeth, and finallie destroied by the Danes,
 about the yeare of Grace 870. It stood vpon the banks of the riuer
 Cluda, to wit, betweene it and the blanke on the north, and the Lound
 lake on the west, and was sometime march betweene the Britons and the
 Picts, and likewise the Picts and the Scots; neuerthelesse, the
 castell (as I heare) dooth yet remaine, and hath beene since well
 repared by the Scots, and called Dombrittain or Dunbritton, so that it
 is not an hard matter by these few words to find where Alcluid stood.
 I could here, if leisure serued, and hast of the printer not require
 dispatch, deliuer the ancient names of sundrie other townes, of which
 Stafford in time past was called Stadtford, and therfore (as I gesse)
 builded or the name altered by the Saxons, Kinebanton now Kimbalton.
 But if anie man be desirous to see more of them, let him resort to
 Houeden in the life of Henrie the second, and there he shall be
 further satisfied of his desire in this behalfe.

 [Sidenote: When Albane was martyred Asclepiodotus was legat in Britaine.]
 It should seeme when these ancient cities flourished, that the same
 towne, which we now call saint Albons, did most of all excell: but
 cheefelie in the Romans time, and was not onelie nothing inferior to
 London it selfe, but rather preferred before it, bicause it was newer,
 and made a Municipium of the Romans, whereas the other was old and
 ruinous, and inhabited onelie by the Britons, as the most part of the
 Iland was also in those daies. Good notice hereof also is to be taken
 by Matthew Paris, and others before him, out of whose writings I haue
 thought good to note a few things, whereby the maiestie of this
 ancient citie may appeare vnto posteritie, and the former estate of
 Verlamcester not lie altogither (as it hath doone hitherto) raked vp
 in forgetfulnes, through the negligence of such as might haue deserued
 better of their successours, by leauing the description thereof in a
 booke by it selfe, sith manie particulars thereof were written to
 their hands, that now are lost and perished. Tacitus in the
 foureteenth booke of his historie maketh mention of it, shewing that
 in the rebellion of the Britons, the Romans there were miserablie
 distressed, "Eadem clades" (saith he) "municipio Verolamio fuit." And
 here vpon Nennius in his catalog of cities calleth it Cair municip, as
 [Sidenote: Sullomaca and Barnet all one, or not far in sunder.]
 I before haue noted. Ptolome speaking of it, dooth place it among the
 Catyeuchlanes, but Antoninus maketh it one and twentie Italian miles
 from London, placing Sullomaca nine mile from thence, whereby it is
 euident, that Sullomaca stood neere to Barnet, if it were not the
 verie same. Of the old compasse of the walles of Verolamium there is
 now small knowledge to be had by the ruines, but of the beautie of the
 citie it selfe you shall partlie vnderstand by that which followeth at
 hand, after I haue told you for your better intelligence what
 "Municipium Romanorum" is: for there is great difference betweene that
 and "Colonia Romanorum," sith "Colonia alio traducitur a ciuitate
 Roma," but "Municipes aliunde in ciuitatem veniunt, suisq; iuribus &
 legibus viuunt:" moreouer their soile is not changed into the nature
 of the Romane, but they liue in the stedfast freendship and protection
 of the Romans, as did somtime the Ceretes who were the first people
 which euer obteined that priuilege. The British Verolamians therefore,
 hauing for their noble seruice in the warres deserued great
 commendations at the hands of the Romans, they gaue vnto them the
 whole freedome of Romans, whereby they were made Municipes, and became
 more free in truth than their Colonies could be. To conclude
 therefore, Municipium is a citie infranchised and indued with Romane
 priuileges, without anie alteration of hir former inhabitants or
 priuileges; whereas a Colonie is a companie sent from Rome into anie
 other region or prouince, to possesse either a citie newlie builded,
 or to replenish the same from whence hir former citizens haue beene
 expelled and driuen out. Now to proceed.

 In the time of king Edgar it fell out, that one Eldred was abbat
 there; who being desirous to inlarge that house, it came into his mind
 to search about in the ruines of Verolamium (which now was ouerthrowne
 by the furie of the Saxons & Danes) to see if he might there come by
 anie curious peeces of worke, wherewith to garnish his building taken
 in hand. To be short, he had no sooner begun to dig among the rubbis,
 but he found an exceeding number of pillers, peeces of antike worke,
 thresholds, doore frames, and sundrie other peeces of fine masonrie
 for windowes and such like, verie conuenient for his purpose. Of these
 also some were of porphyrite stone, some of diuerse kinds of marble,
 touch, and alabaster, beside manie curious deuises of hard mettall, in
 finding whereof he thought himselfe an happie man, and his successe to
 be greatlie guided by S. Albane. Besides these also he found sundrie
 pillers of brasse, and sockets of latton, alabaster and touch, all
 which he laid aside by great heaps, determining in the end (I saie) to
 laie the foundation of a new abbaie, but God so preuented his
 determination, that death tooke him awaie, before his building was
 begun. After him succeeded one Eadmerus, who followed the dooings of
 Eldred to the vttermost: and therefore not onlie perused what he had
 left with great diligence, but also caused his pioners to search yet
 further, within the old walles of Verolamium, where they not onelie
 found infinite other peeces of excellent workemanship, but came at the
 last to certeine vaults vnder the ground, in which stood diuers idols,
 and not a few altars, verie superstitiouslie and religiouslie adorned,
 as the pagans left them belike in time of necessitie. These images
 were of sundrie mettals, and some of pure gold, their altars likewise
 were richlie couered, all which ornaments Edmerus tooke awaie, and not
 onelie conuerted them to other vse in his building, but also destroied
 an innumerable sort of other idols, whose estimation consisted in
 their formes, and substances could doo no seruise. He tooke vp also
 sundrie curious pots, iugs, and cruses of stone and wood most
 artificiallie wrought and carued, and that in such quantitie, besides
 infinite store of fine houshold stuffe, as if the whole furniture of
 the citie had beene brought thither of purpose to be hidden in those
 vaults. In proceeding further, he tooke vp diuerse pots of gold,
 siluer, brasse, glasse and earth, whereof some were filled with the
 ashes and bones of the gentils, the mouths being turned downewards
 (the like of which, but of finer earth, were found in great numbers
 also of late in a well at little Massingham in Norffolke, of six or
 eight gallons a peece, about the yeare 1578, and also in the time of
 Henrie the eight) and not a few with the coines of the old Britons and
 Romane emperours. All which vessels the said abbat brake into peeces,
 and melting the mettall, he reserued it in like sort for the
 garnishing of his church.

 He found likewise in a stone wall two old bookes, whereof one
 contained the rites of the gentils, about the sacrifices of their
 gods, the other (as they now saie) the martyrdome of saint Albane,
 [Sidenote: This soundeth like a lie.]
 both of them written in old Brittish letters, which either bicause no
 man then liuing could read them, or for that they were not woorth the
 keeping, were both consumed to ashes, sauing that a few notes were
 first taken out of this later, concerning the death of their Albane.
 Thus much haue I thought good to note of the former beautie of
 Verolamium, whereof infinite other tokens haue beene found since that
 time, and diuerse within the memorie of man, of passing workemanship,
 the like whereof hath no whers else beene seene in anie ruines within
 the compasse of this Ile, either for cost or quantitie of stuffe.

 Furthermore, whereas manie are not afraid to saie that the Thames came
 sometimes by this citie, indeed it is nothing so; but that the Verlume
 (afterward called Vere and the Mure) did and dooth so still
 (whatsoeuer Gildas talketh hereof, whose books may be corrupted in
 that behalfe) there is yet euident proofe to be confirmed by
 experience. For albeit that the riuer be now growne to be verie small
 by reason of the ground about it, which is higher than it was in old
 time; yet it keepeth in maner the old course, and runneth betweene the
 old citie that was, and the new towne that is standing on Holmehirst
 crag, as I beheld of late. Those places also which now are medow
 beneath the abbaie, were sometimes a great lake, mere, or poole,
 through which the said riuer ran, and (as I read) with a verie swift
 and violent course, wheras at this present it is verie slow, and of no
 such deapth as of ancient times it hath beene. But heare what mine
 author saith further of the same. As those aforsaid workemen digged in
 these ruines, they happened oftentimes vpon Lempet shels, peeces of
 rustie anchors, and keeles of great vessels, wherevpon some by and by
 gathered that either the Thames or some arme of the sea did beat vpon
 that towne, not vnderstanding that these things might aswell happen in
 great lakes and meres, wherof there was one adioining to the north
 side of the citie, which laie then (as some men thinke) vnwalled, but
 that also is false. For being there vpon occasion this summer passed,
 I saw some remnant of the old wals standing in that place, which
 appeared to haue beene verie substantiallie builded; the ruines
 likewise of a greater part of them are to be seene running along by
 the old chappell hard by in maner of a banke. Whereby it is euident
 that the new towne standeth cleane without the limits of the old, and
 that the bridge whereof the historie of S. Albane speaketh, was at the
 nether end of Halliwell street or there about, for so the view of the
 place doth inforce me to coniecture. This mere (which the Latine copie
 of the description of Britaine, written of late by Humfrey Lhoid our
 countrie man calleth corruptlie "Stagnum enaximum" for "Stagnum
 maximum") at the first belonged to the king, and thereby Offa in his
 time did reape no small commoditie. It continued also vntill the time
 of Alfrijc the seuenth abbat of that house, who bought it outright of
 the king then liuing, and by excessiue charges drained it so
 narrowlie, that within a while he left it drie (sauing that he
 reserued a chanell for the riuer to haue hir vsuall course, which he
 held vp with high bankes) bicause there was alwaies contention
 betweene the moonks and the kings seruants, which fished on that water
 vnto the kings behoofe.

 In these daies therefore remaineth no maner mention of this poole, but
 onelie in one street, which yet is called Fishpoole street, wherof
 this may suffice for the resolution of such men, as seeke rather to
 yeeld to an inconuenience, than that their Gildas should seeme to
 mistake this riuer.

 Hauing thus digressed to giue some remembrance of the old estate of
 Verolamium, it is now time to returne againe vnto my former purpose.
 Certes I would gladlie set downe with the names and number of the
 cities, all the townes and villages in England and Wales, with their
 true longitudes and latitudes, but as yet I cannot come by them in
 such order as I would: howbeit the tale of our cities is soone found
 by the bishoprikes, sith euerie see hath such prerogatiue giuen vnto
 it, as to beare the name of a citie, & to vse Regale ius within hir
 owne limits. Which priuilege also is granted to sundrie ancient townes
 in England, especiallie northward, where more plentie of them is to be
 found by a great deale than in the south. The names therefore of our
 cities are these:

   London.
   Yorke.
   Canturburie.
   Winchester.
   Cairleill.
   Durham.
   Elie.
   Norwich.
   Lincolne.
   Worcester.
   Glocester.
   Hereford.
   Salisburie.
   Excester.
   Bath.
   Lichfield.
   Bristow.
   Rochester.
   Chester.
   Chichester.
   Oxford.
   Peterborow.
   Landaffe.
   S. Dauids.
   Bangor.
   S. Asaph.

 Whose particular plots and models with their descriptions shall insue,
 if it may be brought to passe, that the cutters can make dispatch of
 them before this chronologie be published. Of townes and villages
 likewise thus much will I saie, that there were greater store in old
 time (I meane within three or foure hundred yeare passed) than at this
 present. And this I note out of diuerse records, charters, and
 donations (made in times past vnto sundrie religious houses, as
 Glassenburie, Abbandon, Ramseie, Elie, and such like) and whereof in
 these daies I find not so much as the ruines. Leland in sundrie places
 complaineth likewise of the decaie of parishes in great cities and
 townes, missing in some six, or eight, or twelue churches and more, of
 all which he giueth particular notice. For albeit that the Saxons
 builded manie townes and villages, and the Normans well more at their
 first comming, yet since the first two hundred yeares after the latter
 conquest, they haue gone so fast againe to decaie, that the ancient
 number of them is verie much abated. Ranulph the moonke of Chester
 telleth of generall surueie made in the fourth, sixteenth, &
 nineteenth of the reigne of William Conquerour, surnamed the Bastard,
 wherein it was found, that (notwithstanding the Danes had ouerthrowne
 a great manie) there were to the number of 52000 townes, 45002 parish
 churches, and 75000 knights fees, whereof the cleargie held 28015. He
 addeth moreouer that there were diuerse other builded since that time,
 within the space of an hundred yeares after the comming of the
 Bastard, as it were in lieu or recompense of those that William Rufus
 pulled downe for the erection of his new forrest. For by an old booke
 which I haue, and sometime written as it seemeth by an vndershiriffe
 of Nottingham, I find, euen in the time of Edw. 4. 45120 parish
 churches, and but 60216 knights fees, whereof the cleargie held as
 before 28015, or at the least 28000: for so small is the difference
 which he dooth seeme to vse. Howbeit if the assertions of such as
 write in our time concerning this matter, either are or ought to be of
 anie credit in this behalfe, you shall not find aboue 17000 townes and
 villages, and 9210 in the whole, which is little more than a fourth
 part of the aforesaid number, if it be throughlie scanned.

 Certes this misfortune hath not onelie happened vnto our Ile & nation,
 but vnto most of the famous countries of the world heretofore, and all
 by the greedie desire of such as would liue alone and onelie to
 themselues. And hereof we may take example in Candie of old time
 called Creta, which (as Homer writeth) was called Hecatompolis,
 bicause it conteined an hundred cities, but now it is so vnfurnished
 that it may hardlie be called Tripolis. Diodorus Siculus saith, that
 Aegypt had once 18000 cities, which so decaied in processe of time,
 that when Ptolomeus Lagus reigned, there were not aboue 3000: but in
 our daies both in all Asia & Aegypt this lesser number shall not verie
 readilie be found. In time past in Lincolne (as the fame goeth) there
 haue beene two and fiftie parish churches, and good record appeareth
 for eight and thirtie: but now if there be foure and twentie it is
 all. This inconuenience hath growen altogither to the church by
 appropriations made vnto monasteries and religious houses, a terrible
 canker and enimie to religion.

 But to leaue this lamentable discourse of so notable and greeuous an
 inconuenience, growing (as I said) by incroching and ioining of house
 to house, and laieng land to land, whereby the inhabitants of manie
 places of our countrie are deuoured and eaten vp, and their houses
 either altogither pulled downe or suffered to decaie by litle and
 litle, although sometime a poore man peraduenture dooth dwell in one
 of them, who not being able to repare it, suffereth it to fall downe,
 & thereto thinketh himselfe verie friendlie dealt withall, if he may
 haue an acre of ground assigned vnto him whereon to keepe a cow, or
 wherein to set cabbages, radishes, parsneps, carrets, melons, pompons,
 or such like stuffe, by which he and his poore household liueth as by
 their principall food, sith they can doo no better. And as for wheaten
 bread, they eat it when they can reach vnto the price of it,
 contenting themselues in the meane time with bread made of otes or
 barleie: a poore estate God wot! Howbeit what care our great
 incrochers? But in diuers places where rich men dwelled sometime in
 good tenements, there be now no houses at all, but hopyards, and
 sheads for poles, or peraduenture gardens, as we may see in castell
 Hedingham, and diuerse other places. But to proceed.

 It is so, that our soile being diuided into champaine ground and
 woodland, the houses of the first lie vniformelie builded in euerie
 towne togither with streets and lanes, wheras in the woodland
 countries (except here and there in great market townes) they stand
 scattered abroad, each one dwelling in the midst of his owne
 occupieng. And as in manie and most great market townes, there are
 commonlie three hundred or foure hundred families or mansions, & two
 thousand communicants, or peraduenture more: so in the other, whether
 they be woodland or champaine, we find not often aboue fortie, fiftie,
 or three score households, and two or three hundred communicants,
 whereof the greatest part neuerthelesse are verie poore folkes,
 oftentimes without all maner of occupieng, sith the ground of the
 parish is gotten vp into a few mens hands, yea sometimes into the
 tenure of one, two or three, whereby the rest are compelled either to
 be hired seruants vnto the other, or else to beg their bread in
 miserie from doore to doore.

 There are some (saith Leland) which are not so fauourable when they
 haue gotten such lands, as to let the houses remaine vpon them to the
 vse of the poore; but they will compound with the lord of the soile to
 pull them downe for altogither, saieng that if they did let them
 stand, they should but toll beggers to the towne, therby to surcharge
 the rest of the parish, & laie more burden vpon them. But alas these
 pitifull men see not that they themselues hereby doo laie the greatest
 log vpon their neighbors necks. For sith the prince dooth commonlie
 loose nothing of his duties accustomable to be paid, the rest of the
 parishioners that remaine must answer and beare them out: for they
 plead more charge other waies, saieng; I am charged alreadie with a
 light horsse, I am to answer in this sort and after that maner. And it
 is not yet altogither out of knowledge, that where the king had seuen
 pounds thirteene shillings at a taske gathered of fiftie wealthie
 householders of a parish in England: now a gentleman hauing three
 parts of the towne in his owne hands, foure housholds doo beare all
 the aforesaid paiment, or else Leland is deceiued in his Commentaries
 lib. 13. latelie come to my hands, which thing he especiallie noted in
 his trauell ouer this Ile. A common plague & enormittie, both in the
 hart of the land and likewise vpon the coasts. Certes a great number
 compleine of the increase of pouertie, laieng the cause vpon God, as
 though he were in fault for sending such increase of people, or want
 of wars that should consume them, affirming that the land was neuer so
 full, &c: but few men doo see the verie root from whence it dooth
 proceed. Yet the Romans found it out, when they florished, and
 therefore prescribed limits to euerie mans tenure and occupieng. Homer
 commendeth Achilles for ouerthrowing of fiue and twentie cities: but
 in mine opinion Ganges is much better preferred by Suidas for building
 of three score in Inde, where he did plant himselfe. I could (if need
 required) set downe in this place the number of religious houses and
 monasteries, with the names of their founders that haue beene in this
 Iland: but sith it is a thing of small importance, I passe it ouer as
 impertinent to my purpose. Yet herein I will commend sundrie of the
 monasticall votaries, especiallie moonkes, for that they were authors
 of manie goodlie borowes and endwares, neere vnto their dwellings,
 although otherwise they pretended to be men separated from the world.
 But alas their couetous minds one waie in inlarging their reuenues,
 and carnall intent an other, appeered herin too too much. For being
 bold from time to time to visit their tenants, they wrought off great
 wickednesse, and made those endwares little better than brodelhouses,
 especiallie where nunries were farre off, or else no safe accesse vnto
 them. But what doo I spend my time in the rehearsall of these
 filthinesses? Would to God the memorie of them might perish with the
 malefactors! My purpose was also at the end of this chapter to haue
 set downe a table of the parish churches and market townes thorough
 out all England and Wales: but sith I can not performe the same as I
 would, I am forced to giue ouer my purpose: yet by these few that
 insue you shall easilie see what order I would haue vsed according to
 the shires, if I might haue brought it to passe.

 OF CASTELS AND HOLDS.

 CHAP. XIV.

 It hath beene of long time a question in controuersie, and not yet
 determined, whether holds and castels neere cities or anie where in
 the hart of common-wealths, are more profitable or hurtfull for the
 benefit of the countrie? Neuertheles it seemeth by our owne experience
 that we here in England suppose them altogither vnneedfull. This also
 is apparent by the testimonie of sundrie writers, that they haue beene
 the ruine of manie a noble citie. Of Old Salisburie I speake not, of
 Anwarpe I saie nothing more than of sundrie other, whereof some also
 in my time neuer cease to incroch vpon the liberties of the cities
 adioining, thereby to hinder them what and wherin they may. For my
 part I neuer read of anie castell that did good vnto the citie
 abutting theron, but onelie the capitoll of Rome: and yet but once
 good vnto the same, in respect of the nine times whereby it brought it
 into danger of vtter ruine and confusion. Aristotle vtterlie denieth
 that anie castle at all can be profitable to a common wealth well
 gouerned. Timotheus of Corinthum affirmeth, that a castle in a common
 wealth is but a breeder of tyrants. Pyrhus king of Epire being
 receiued also on a time into Athens, among other courtesies shewed
 vnto him, they led him also into their castell of Pallas, who at his
 departure gaue them great thanks for the freendlie intertainment; but
 with this item, that they should let so few kings come into the same
 as they might, least (saith he) they teach you to repent too late of
 your great gentlenesse. Caietanus in his common-wealth hath finallie
 no liking of them, as appeereth in his eight booke of that most
 excellent treatise. But what haue I to deale whether they be
 profitable or not, sith my purpose is rather to shew what plentie we
 haue of them, which I will performe so far as shall be needfull?

 There haue beene in times past great store of castels and places of
 defense within the realme of England, of which some were builded by
 the Britons, manie by the Romans, Saxons, and Danes, but most of all
 by the barons of the realme, in & about the time of king Stephan, who
 licenced each of them to build so manie as them listed vpon their owne
 demeasnes, hoping thereby that they would haue imploied their vse to
 his aduantage and commoditie. But finallie when he saw that they were
 rather fortified against himselfe in the end, than vsed in his
 defense, he repented all too late of his inconsiderate dealing, sith
 now there was no remedie but by force for to subdue them. After his
 decease king Henrie the second came no sooner to the crowne, but he
 called to mind the inconuenience which his predecessour had suffered,
 and he himselfe might in time sustaine by those fortifications.
 Therefore one of the first things he did was an attempt to race and
 deface the most part of these holds. Certes he thought it better to
 hazard the meeting of the enimie now and then in the plaine field,
 than to liue in perpetuall feare of those houses, and the rebellion of
 his lords vpon euerie light occasion conceiued, who then were full so
 strong as he, if not more strong; and that made them the readier to
 withstand and gainesaie manie of those proceedings, which he and his
 successours from time to time intended. Herevpon therefore he caused
 more than eleuen hundred of their said castels to be raced and
 ouerthrowne, whereby the power of his nobilitie was not a little
 restreined. Since that time also, not a few of those which remained
 haue decaied, partlie by the commandement of Henrie the third, and
 partlie of themselues, or by conuersion of them into the dwelling
 houses of noble men, their martiall fronts being remooued: so that at
 this present, there are verie few or no castels at all mainteined
 within England, sauing onelie vpon the coasts and marches of the
 countrie for the better keeping backe of the forren enimie, when
 soeuer he shall attempt to enter and annoie vs.

 The most provident prince that euer reigned in this land, for the
 fortification thereof against all outward enimies, was the late prince
 of famous memorie king Henrie the eight, who beside that he repared
 most of such as were alreadie standing, builded sundrie out of the
 ground. For hauing shaken off the more than seruile yoke of popish
 tyrannie, and espieng that the emperour was offended for his diuorce
 from queene Catharine his aunt, and thereto vnderstanding that the
 French king had coupled the Dolphin his sonne with the popes neece,
 and maried his daughter to the king of Scots (whereby he had cause
 more iustlie to suspect than safelie to trust anie one of them all as
 Lambert saith) he determined to stand vpon his owne defense, and
 therefore with no small speed, and like charge, he builded sundrie
 blockehouses, castels, and platformes vpon diuerse frontiers of his
 realme, but chieflie the east and southeast parts of England, whereby
 (no doubt) he did verie much qualifie the conceiued grudges of his
 aduersaries, and vtterlie put off their hastie purpose of inuasion.
 But would to God he had cast his eie toward Harwich, and the coasts of
 Norffolke and Suffolke, where nothing as yet is doone! albeit there be
 none so fit and likelie places for the enimie to enter vpon, as in
 those parts, where, at a full sea they may touch vpon the shore and
 come to land without resistance. And thus much brieflie for my purpose
 at this present. For I need not to make anie long discourse of
 castels, sith it is not the nature of a good Englishman to regard to
 be caged vp as in a coope, and hedged in with stone wals, but rather
 to meet with his enimie in the plaine field at handstrokes, where he
 maie trauaise his ground, choose his plot, and vse the benefit of
 sunne shine, wind and weather, to his best aduantage & commoditie.
 Isocrates also saith that towres, walles, bulworkes, soldiers, and
 [Sidenote: The best keepers of kingdomes.]
 plentie of armour, are not the best keepers of kingdomes; but freends,
 loue of subiects, & obedience vnto martiall discipline, which they
 want that shew themselues either cruell or couetous toward their
 people. As for those tales that go of Beston castell, how it shall
 saue all England on a daie, and likewise the brag of a rebellious
 baron in old time named Hugh Bigot, that said in contempt of king
 Henrie the third, and about the fiftith yeare of his reigne:

   If I were in my castell of Bungeie,
   Vpon the water of Waueneie,
   I wold not set a button by the king of Cockneie,

 I repute them but as toies, the first meere vaine, the second fondlie
 vttered if anie such thing were said, as manie other words are and
 haue beene spoken of like holds (as Wallingford, &c:) but now growen
 out of memorie, and with small losse not heard of among the common
 sort. Certes the castell of Bungeie was ouerthrowen by the aforesaid
 prince, the same yeare that he ouerthrew the walles and castell of
 Leircester, also the castels of Treske and Malesar, apperteining to
 Roger Mowbraie, and that of Fremlingham belonging likewise to Hugh
 Bigot, wherof in the chronologie following you may read at large. I
 might here in like sort take occasion to speake of sundrie strong
 places where camps of men haue lien, and of which we haue great
 plentie here in England in the plaine fields: but I passe ouer to
 talke of any such needlesse discourses. This neuerthelesse concerning
 [Sidenote: The Wandles in time past were called Windles.]
 two of them is not to be omitted, to wit, that the one neere vnto
 Cambridge now Gogmagogs hill, was called Windleburie before time, as I
 read of late in an old pamphlet. And to saie the truth I haue often
 heard them named Winterburie hilles, which difference may easilie grow
 by corruption of the former word: the place likewise is verie large
 and strong. The second is to be seene in the edge of Shropshire about
 two miles from Colme, betweene two riuers, the Clun or Colunus, and
 the Tewie otherwise named Themis, wherevnto there is no accesse but at
 one place. The Welshmen call it Cair Carador, and they are of the
 opinion, that Caractatus king of the Sillures was ouercome there by
 Ostorius, at such time as he fled to Cartimanda queene of the Brigants
 for succour, who betraied him to the Romans, as you may see in
 Tacitus.




 OF PALACES BELONGING TO THE PRINCE.

 CHAP. XV.


 It lieth not in me to set down exactlie the number & names of the
 palaces belonging to the prince, nor to make anie description of hir
 graces court, sith my calling is and hath beene such, as that I haue
 scarselie presumed to peepe in at hir gates, much lesse then haue I
 aduentured to search out and know the estate of those houses, and what
 magnificent behauiour is to be seene within them. Yet thus much will I
 saie generallie of all the houses and honours perteining to hir
 maiestie, that they are builded either of square stone or bricke, or
 else of both. And thervnto although their capacitie and hugenesse be
 not so monstrous, as the like of diuerse forren princes are to be
 seene in the maine, and new found nations of the world: yet are they
 so curious, neat, and commodious as any of them, both for conuenience
 of offices and lodgings, and excellencie of situation, which is not
 the least thing to be considered of in building. Those that were
 [Sidenote: King Hen. 8. not inferior to Adrian and Iustinian.]
 builded before the time of king Henrie the eight, reteine to these
 daies the shew and image of the ancient kind of workemanship vsed in
 this land: but such as he erected after his owne deuise (for he was
 nothing inferiour in this trade to Adrian the emperour and Iustinian
 the lawgiuer) doo represent another maner of paterne, which as they
 are supposed to excell all the rest that he found standing in this
 realme, so they are and shall be a perpetuall president vnto those
 that doo come after, to follow in their workes and buildings of
 importance. Certes masonrie did neuer better flourish in England than
 in his time. And albeit that in these daies there be manie goodlie
 houses erected in the sundrie quarters of this Iland; yet they are
 rather curious to the eie like paper worke, than substantiall for
 continuance: whereas such as he did set vp excell in both, and
 therefore may iustlie be preferred farre aboue all the rest. The names
 of those which come now to my remembrance, and are as yet reserued to
 hir maiesties onelie vse at pleasure are these: for of such as are
 giuen awaie I speake not, neither of those that are vtterlie decaied,
 as Bainards castell in London builded in the daies of the Conquerour
 by a noble man called William Bainard, whose wife Inga builded the
 priorie of litle Donemow in the daies of Henrie the first; neither of
 the tower roiall there also, &c: sith I see no cause wherefore I
 should remember them and manie of the like, of whose verie ruines I
 haue no certeine knowledge. Of such I saie therfore as I erst
 [Sidenote: White hall.]
 mentioned, we haue first of all White hall at the west end of London
 (which is taken for the most large & principall of all the rest) was
 first a lodging of the Archbishops of Yorke, then pulled downe, begun
 by cardinall Woolseie, and finallie inlarged and finished by king
 Henrie the eight. By east of this standeth Durham place, sometime
 belonging to the bishops of Durham, but conuerted also by king Henrie
 the eight into a palace roiall, & lodging for the prince. Of Summerset
 place I speake not, yet if the first beginner thereof (I meane the
 lord Edward, the learned and godlie duke of Summerset) had liued, I
 doubt not but it should haue beene well finished and brought to a
 sumptuous end: but as vntimelie death tooke him from that house & from
 vs all, so it prooued the staie of such proceeding as was intended
 about it. Wherby it commeth to passe that it standeth as he left it.
 Neither will I remember the Tower of London, which is rather an
 armorie and house of munition, and therevnto a place for the
 safekeeping of offenders, than a palace roiall for a king or queene to
 soiourne in. Yet in times past I find that Belline held his aboad
 there, and therevnto extended the site of his palace in such wise,
 that it stretched ouer the Broken wharfe, and came further into the
 citie, in so much that it approched neere to Bellines gate, & as it is
 thought some of the ruines of his house are yet extant, howbeit
 patched vp and made warehouses in that tract of ground in our times.
 [Sidenote: S. James.]
 S. Iames sometime a nonrie, was builded also by the same prince. Hir
 [Sidenote: Oteland.]
 [Sidenote: Ashridge.]
 [Sidenote: Hatfield.]
 [Sidenote: Enueeld.]
 [Sidenote: Richmond.]
 [Sidenote: Hampton.]
 [Sidenote: Woodstocke.]
 grace hath also Oteland, Ashridge, Hatfield, Hauering, Enueeld,
 Eltham, Langleie, Richmond builded by Henrie the fift, Hampton court
 (begun sometime by cardinall Woolseie, and finished by hir father) and
 therevnto Woodstocke, erected by king Henrie the first, in which the
 queenes maiestie delighteth greatlie to soiourne, notwithstanding that
 in time past it was the place of a parcell of hir captiuitie, when it
 pleased God to trie hir by affliction and calamitie.

 [Sidenote: Windsor.]
 For strength Windlesor or Winsor is supposed to be the cheefe, a
 castell builded in time past by king Arthur, or before him by
 Aruiragus, as it is thought, and repared by Edward the third, who
 erected also a notable college there. After him diuerse of his
 successours haue bestowed exceeding charges vpon the same, which
 notwithstanding are farre surmounted by the queenes maiestie now
 liuing, who hath appointed huge summes of monie to be emploied vpon
 the ornature and alteration of the mould, according to the forme of
 building vsed in our daies, which is more for pleasure than for either
 profit or safegard. Such also hath beene the estimation of this place,
 that diuerse kings haue not onelie beene interred there, but also made
 it the chiefe house of assemblie, and creation of the knights of the
 honorable order of the garter, than the which there is nothing in this
 land more magnificent and statelie.

 [Sidenote: Greenewich.]
 Greenewich was first builded by Humfreie duke of Glocester, vpon the
 Thames side foure miles east from London, in the time of Henrie the
 sixt, and called Pleasance. Afterwards it was greatlie inlarged by
 king Edw. 4. garnished by king Hen. 7. and finallie made perfect by
 king Hen. 8. the onelie Phenix of his time for fine and curious
 masonrie.

 [Sidenote: Dartford.]
 Not farre from this is Dartford, and not much distant also from the
 southside of the said streame, somtime a nonnerie builded by Edward
 the third, but now a verie commodious palace, wherevnto it was also
 [Sidenote: Eltham.]
 conuerted by K. Henrie the eight. Eltham (as I take it) was builded by
 king Henrie the third, if not before. There are beside these moreouer
 diuerse other. But what shall I need to take vpon me to repeat all,
 and tell what houses the queenes maiestie hath? sith all is hirs, and
 when it pleaseth hir in the summer season to recreat hir selfe abroad,
 and view the estate of the countrie, and heare the complaints of hir
 poore commons iniuried by hir vniust officers or their substitutes,
 euerie noble mans house is hir palace, where shee continueth during
 pleasure, and till shee returne againe to some of hir owne, in which
 she remaineth so long as pleaseth hir.

 [Sidenote: Of the court.]
 The court of England, which necessarilie is holden alwaies where the
 prince lieth, is in these daies one of the most renowmed and
 magnificent courts that are to be found in Europe. For whether you
 regard the rich and infinit furniture of household, order of officers,
 or the interteinement of such strangers as dailie resort vnto the
 same, you shall not find manie equall therevnto, much lesse one
 excelling it in anie maner of wise. I might here (if I would, or had
 sufficient disposition of matter concerned of the same) make a large
 discourse of such honorable ports, of such graue councellors, and
 noble personages, as giue their dailie attendance vpon the queenes
 maiestie there. I could in like sort set foorth a singular
 commendation of the vertuous beautie, or beautifull vertues of such
 ladies and gentlewomen as wait vpon hir person, betweene whose amiable
 countenances and costlinesse of attire, there seemeth to be such a
 dailie conflict and contention, as that it is verie difficult for me
 to gesse, whether of the twaine shall beare awaie the preheminence.
 This further is not to be omitted, to the singular commendation of
 [Sidenote: English courtiers the best learned & the worst liuers.]
 both sorts and sexes of our courtiers here in England, that there are
 verie few of them, which haue not the vse and skill of sundrie
 speaches, beside an excellent veine of writing before time not
 regarded. Would to God the rest of their liues and conuersations were
 correspondent to these gifts! for as our common courtiers (for the
 most part) are the best lerned and indued with excellent gifts, so are
 manie of them the worst men when they come abroad, that anie man shall
 either heare or read of. Trulie it is a rare thing with vs now, to
 heare of a courtier which hath but his owne language. And to saie how
 many gentlewomen and ladies there are, that beside sound knowledge of
 the Greeke and Latine toongs, are thereto no lesse skilfull in the
 Spanish, Italian, and French, or in some one of them, it resteth not
 in me: sith I am persuaded, that as the noble men and gentlemen doo
 surmount in this behalfe, so these come verie little or nothing at all
 behind them for their parts, which industrie God continue, and
 accomplish that which otherwise is wanting!

 Beside these things I could in like sort set downe the waies and
 meanes, wherby our ancient ladies of the court doo shun and auoid
 idlenesse, some of them exercising their fingers with the needle,
 other in caulworke, diuerse in spinning of silke, some in continuall
 reading either of the holie scriptures, or histories of our owne or
 forren nations about vs, and diuerse in writing volumes of their owne,
 or translating of other mens into our English and Latine toong,
 whilest the yoongest sort in the meane time applie their lutes,
 citharnes, prickesong, and all kind of musike, which they vse onelie
 for recreation sake, when they haue leisure, and are free from
 attendance vpon the queenes maiestie, or such as they belong vnto. How
 manie of the eldest sort also are skilfull in surgerie and
 distillation of waters, beside sundrie other artificiall practises
 perteining to the ornature and commendations of their bodies, I might
 (if I listed to deale further in this behalfe) easilie declare, but I
 passe ouer such maner of dealing, least I should seeme to glauer, and
 currie fauour with some of them. Neuerthelesse this I will generallie
 saie of them all, that as ech of them are cuning in somthing wherby
 they keepe themselues occupied in the court, so there is in maner none
 of them, but when they be at home, can helpe to supplie the ordinarie
 want of the kitchen with a number of delicat dishes of their owne
 deuising, wherein the Portingall is their cheefe counsellor, as some
 of them are most commonlie with the clearke of the kitchen, who vseth
 (by a tricke taken vp of late) to giue in a breefe rehearsall of such
 and so manie dishes as are to come in at euerie course throughout the
 whole seruice in the dinner or supper while: which bill some doo call
 a memoriall, other a billet, but some a fillet, bicause such are
 commonlie hanged on the file, and kept by the ladie or gentlewoman
 vnto some other purpose. But whither am I digressed?

 I might finallie describe the large allowances in offices, and
 yearelie liueries, and therevnto the great plentie of gold and siluer
 plate, the seuerall peeces whereof are commonlie so great and massie,
 and the quantitie therof so abundantlie seruing all the houshold, that
 (as I suppose) Cyniras, Cresus, and Crassus had not the like
 furniture: naie if Midas were now liuing & once againe put to his
 choise, I thinke he could aske no more, or rather not halfe so much as
 is there to be seene and vsed. But I passe ouer to make such needlesse
 discourses, resoluing my selfe, that euen in this also, as in all the
 rest, the exceeding mercie and louing kindnesse of God dooth
 wonderfullie appeere towards vs, in that he hath so largelie indued vs
 with these his so ample benefits.

 In some great princes courts beyond the seas, & which euen for that
 cause are likened vnto hell by diuerse learned writers that haue spent
 a great part of their time in them, as Henricus Cornelius Agrippa, one
 (for example) who in his epistle "Ad aulicum quendam," saith thus: "An
 non in inferno es amice, qui es in aula, vbi daemonum habitatio est,
 qui illic suis artibus humana licet effigie regnant, atque vbi
 scelerum schola est, & animarum iactura ingens, ac quicquid vspiam est
 perfidiae ac doli, quicquid crudelitatis & inclem[=e]tiae, quicquid
 effraenatae superbiae, & rapacis auariciae, quicquid obscenae libidinis,
 faedissimae impudicitiae, quicquid nefandae impietatis, & morum
 pessimorum, totum illic aceruatur cumulatissime, vbi stupra, raptus,
 incestus, adulteria, principum & nobilium ludi sunt, vbi fastus &
 tumor, ira, liuor, faedaque cupido cum socijs suis imperauit, vbi
 criminum omnium procellae virtutumque omni[=u] inenarrabile naufragium,
 &c." In such great princes courts (I saie) it is a world to see what
 lewd behauiour is vsed among diuerse of those that resort vnto the
 same, and what whoredome, swearing, ribaldrie, atheisme, dicing,
 carding, carowsing, drunkennesse, gluttonie, quareling, and such like
 inconueniences doo dailie take hold, and sometimes euen among those,
 in whose estates the like behauiour is least conuenient (whereby their
 talke is verified which say that the thing increaseth and groweth in
 the courts of princes sauing vertue, which in such places dooth
 languish and dailie vade away) all which enormities are either
 vtterlie expelled out of the court of England, or else so qualified by
 the diligent endeuour of the chiefe officers of hir graces household,
 that seldome are anie of these things apparantlie seene there, without
 due reprehension, and such seuere correction as belongeth to those
 trespasses. Finallie to auoid idlenesse, and preuent sundrie
 transgressions, otherwise likelie to be committed and doone, such
 order is taken, that euerie office hath either a bible, or the bookes
 of the acts and monuments of the church of England, or both, beside
 some histories and chronicles lieng therein, for the exercise of such
 as come into the same: whereby the stranger that entereth into the
 court of England vpon the sudden, shall rather imagine himselfe to
 come into some publike schoole of the vniuersities, where manie giue
 eare to one that readeth, than into a princes palace, if you conferre
 the same with those of other nations. Would to God all honorable
 personages would take example of hir graces godlie dealing in this
 behalfe, and shew their conformitie vnto these hir so good beginnings!
 which if they would, then should manie grieuous offenses (wherewith
 God is highlie displeased) be cut off and restreined, which now doo
 reigne exceedinglie, in most noble and gentlemens houses, wherof they
 see no paterne within hir graces gates.

 [Sidenote: Traines of attendants.]
 I might speake here of the great traines and troopes of seruing men
 also, which attend vpon the nobilitie of England in their seuerall
 liueries, and with differences of cognisances on their sleeues,
 whereby it is knowen to whome they apperteine. I could also set downe
 what a goodlie sight it is to see them muster in the court, which
 being filled with them dooth yeeld the contemplation of a noble
 varietie vnto the beholder, much like to the shew of the pecocks taile
 in the full beautie, or of some medow garnished with infinit kinds and
 diuersitie of pleasant floures. But I passe ouer the rehearsall hereof
 to other men, who more delite in vaine amplification than I, and seeke
 to be more curious in these points than I professe to be.

 The discipline of firme peace also that is mainteined within a
 certeine compasse of the princes palace, is such, as is nothing
 inferiour to that we see dailie practised in the best gouerned holds &
 fortresses. And such is the seuere punishment of those that strike
 within the limits prohibited, that without all hope of mercie, benefit
 of clergie, or sanctuarie, they are sure to loose their right hands at
 a stroke, and that in verie solemne maner, the forme whereof I will
 set downe, and then make an end of this chapter, to deale with other
 matters.

 [Sidenote: Striking within the court and palace of the prince.]
 At such time therefore as the partie transgressing is conuicted by a
 sufficient inquest impanelled for the same purpose, and the time come
 of the execution of the sentence, the sergeant of the kings wood-yard
 prouideth a square blocke, which he bringeth to some appointed place,
 and therewithall a great beetle, staple, and cords, wherewith to
 fasten the hand of the offendor vnto the said blocke, vntill the whole
 circumstance of his execution be performed. The yeoman of the
 scullarie likewise for the time being, dooth prouide a great fire of
 coales hard by the blocke, wherein the searing irons are to be made
 readie against the chiefe surgeon to the prince or his deputie shall
 occupie the same. Upon him also dooth the sergeant or chiefe farrour
 attend with those irons, whose office is to deliuer them to the said
 surgeon when he shall be redie by searing to vse the same. The groome
 of the salarie for the time being or his deputie is furthermore
 appointed to be readie with vineger and cold water, and not to depart
 from the place vntill the arme of the offendor be bound vp and fullie
 dressed. And as these things are thus prouided, so the sergeant
 surgeon is bound from time to time to be readie to execute his charge,
 and seare the stumpe, when the hand is taken from it. The sergeant of
 the cellar is at hand also with a cup of red wine, and likewise the
 chiefe officer of the pantrie with manchet bread to giue vnto the said
 partie after the execution doone, and the stumpe seared, as the
 sergeant of the ewerie is with clothes, wherein to wind and wrap vp
 the arme, the yeoman of the poultrie with a cocke to laie vnto it, the
 yeoman of the chandrie with seared cloths, and finallie the maister
 cooke or his deputie with a sharpe dressing knife, which he deliuereth
 at the place of execution to the sergeant of the larder, who dooth
 hold it vpright in his hand, vntill the execution be performed by the
 publike officer appointed therevnto. And this is the maner of
 punishment ordeined for those that strike within the princes palace,
 or limits of the same. Which should first haue beene executed on sir
 Edmund Kneuet, in the yeare 1541. But when he had made great sute to
 saue his right hand for the further seruice of the king in his warres,
 and willinglie yeelded to forgo his left, in the end the king pardoned
 him of both, to no small benefit of the offendor, and publication of
 the bountifull nature that remained in the prince. The like priuilege
 almost is giuen to churches and churchyards, although in maner of
 punishment great difference doo appeere. For he that bralleth or
 quarelleth in either of them, is by and by suspended "Ab ingressu
 ecclesiae," vntill he be absolued: as he is also that striketh with the
 fist, or laieth violent hands vpon anie whome so euer. But if he
 happen to smite with staffe, dagger, or anie maner of weapon, & the
 same be sufficientlie found by the verdict of twelue men at his
 arrainement, beside excommunication, he is sure to loose one of his
 eares without all hope of release. But if he be such a one as hath
 beene twise condemned and executed, whereby he hath now none eares,
 then is he marked with an hot iron vpon the cheeke, and by the letter
 F, which is seared deepe into his flesh, he is from thencefoorth noted
 as a common barratour and fraie maker, and therevnto remaineth
 excommunicate, till by repentance he deserue to be absolued. To strike
 a clearke also (that is to saie) a minister, is plaine
 excommunication, and the offendor not to be absolued but by the prince
 or his especiall c[=o]mission. Such also is the generall estate of
 the exc[=o]municate in euerie respect, that he can yeeld no
 testimonie in anie matter so long as he so standeth. No bargaine or
 sale that he maketh is auaileable in law, neither anie of his acts
 whatsoeuer pleadable, wherby he liueth as an outlaw & a man altogither
 out of the princes protection, although it be not lawfull to kill him,
 nor anie man otherwise outlawed, without the danger of fellonie.




 OF ARMOUR AND MUNITION.

 CHAP. XVI.


 How well or how stronglie our countrie hath beene furnished in times
 past with armor and artillerie, it lieth not in me as of my selfe to
 make rehersall. Yet that it lacked both in the late time of queen
 Marie, not onlie the experience of mine elders, but also the talke of
 certeine Spaniards not yet forgotten, did leaue some manifest notice.
 Vpon the first I need not stand, for few will denie it. For the second
 I haue heard, that when one of the greatest peeres of Spaine espied
 our nakednesse in this behalfe, and did solemnelie vtter in no obscure
 place, that it should be an easie matter in short time to conquer
 England, bicause it wanted armor, his words were then not so rashlie
 vttered, as they were politikelie noted. For albeit that for the
 present time their efficacie was dissembled, and semblance made as
 though he spake but merilie, yet at the verie enterance of this our
 gratious queene vnto the possession of the crowne, they were so
 prouidentlie called to remembrance, and such speedie reformation
 sought of all hands for the redresse of this inconuenience, that our
 countrie was sooner furnished with armour and munition, from diuerse
 parts of the maine (beside great plentie that was forged here at home)
 than our enimies could get vnderstanding of anie such prouision to be
 made. By this policie also was the no small hope conceiued by
 Spaniards vtterlie cut off, who of open freends being now become our
 secret enimies, and thereto watching a time wherein to atchieue some
 heauie exploit against vs and our countrie, did therevpon change their
 purposes, whereby England obteined rest, that otherwise might haue
 beene sure of sharpe and cruell wars. Thus a Spanish word vttered by
 one man at one time, ouerthrew or at the least wise hindered sundrie
 priuie practises of manie at another. In times past the cheefe force
 of England consisted in their long bowes. But now we haue in maner
 generallie giuen ouer that kind of artillerie, and for long bowes in
 deed doo practise to shoot compasse for our pastime: which kind of
 shooting can neuer yeeld anie smart stroke, nor beat downe our
 enimies, as our countrie men were woont to doo at euerie time of need.
 Certes the Frenchmen and Rutters deriding our new archerie in respect
 of their corslets, will not let in open skirmish, if anie leisure
 serue, to turne vp their tailes and crie; Shoote English, and all
 bicause our strong shooting is decaied and laid in bed. But if some of
 our Englishmen now liued that serued king Edward the third in his
 warres with France, the breech of such a varlet should haue beene
 nailed to his bum with one arrow, and an other fethered in his bowels,
 before he should haue turned about to see who shot the first. But as
 our shooting is thus in manner vtterlie decaied among vs one waie, so
 our countrie men wex skilfull in sundrie other points, as in shooting
 in small peeces, the caliuer, and handling of the pike, in the
 seuerall vses whereof they are become verie expert.

 Our armour differeth not from that of other nations, and therefore
 consisteth of corslets, almaine riuets, shirts of maile, iackes
 quilted and couered ouer with leather, fustian, or canuas, ouer thicke
 plates of iron that are sowed in the same, & of which there is no
 towne or village that hath not hir conuenient furniture. The said
 armour and munition likewise is kept in one seuerall place of euerie
 towne, appointed by the consent of the whole parish, where it is
 alwaies readie to be had and worne within an houres warning. Sometime
 also it is occupied, when it pleaseth the magistrate either to view
 the able men, & take note of the well keeping of the same, or finallie
 to see those that are inrolled to exercise each one his seuerall
 weapon, at the charge of the townesmen of each parish according to his
 appointment. Certes there is almost no village so poore in England (be
 it neuer so small) that hath not sufficient furniture in a readinesse
 to set foorth three or foure soldiers, as one archer, one gunner, one
 pike, & a bilman at the least. No there is not so much wanting as
 their verie liueries and caps, which are least to be accounted of, if
 anie hast required: so that if this good order may continue, it shall
 be vnpossible for the sudden enimie to find vs vnprouided. As for able
 men for seruice, thanked be God, we are not without good store, for by
 the musters taken 1574 and 1575, our number amounted to 1172674, and
 yet were they not so narrowlie taken, but that a third part of this
 like multitude was left vnbilled and vncalled. What store of munition
 and armour the queenes maiestie hath in hir storehouses, it lieth not
 in me to yeeld account, sith I suppose the same to be infinit. And
 whereas it was commonlie said after the losse of Calis, that England
 should neuer recouer the store of ordinance there left and lost: that
 same is at this time prooued false, sith euen some of the same persons
 doo now confesse, that this land was neuer better furnished with these
 things in anie kings daies that reigned since the conquest.


 _The names of our greatest ordinance are commonlie these._

 Robinet, whose weight is two hundred pounds, and it hath one inch and
 a quarter within the mouth.

 Falconet weigheth fiue hundred pounds, and his widenesse is two inches
 within the mouth.

 Falcon hath eight hundred pounds, and two inches and a halfe within
 the mouth.

 Minion poiseth eleauen hundred pounds, and hath three inches and a
 quarter within the mouth.

 Sacre hath fifteene hundred poundes, and is three inches and a halfe
 wide in the mouth.

 Demie Culuerijn weigheth three thousand pounds, and hath foure inches
 and a halfe within the mouth.

 Culuerijn hath foure thousand pounds, and fiue inches and an halfe
 within the mouth.

 Demie Canon six thousand pounds, and six inches and an halfe within
 the mouth.

 Canon seauen thousand pounds, and eight inches within the mouth.

 E. Canon eight thousand pounds, and seauen inches within the mouth.

 Basiliske 9000 pounds, eight inches, and three quarters within the
 mouth. By which proportions also it is easie to come by the weight of
 euerie shot, how manie scores it doth flee at point blanke, how much
 pouder is to be had the same, & finallie how manie inches in height
 ech bullet ought to carrie.

 I might here take iust occasion to speake of the princes armories. But
 what shall it need? sith the whole realme is hir armorie, and
 therefore hir furniture infinit. The Turke had one gun made by one
 Orban a Dane, the caster of his ordinance, which could not be drawen
 to the siege of Constantinople, but by seauentie yokes of oxen, and
 two thousand men; he had two other there also whose shot poised aboue
 two talents in weight, made by the same Orban. But to proceed. As for
 the armories of some of the nobilitie (whereof I also haue seene a
 part) they are so well furnished, that within some one barons custodie
 I haue seene three score or a hundred corslets at once, beside
 caliuers, hand-guns, bowes, sheffes of arrowes, pikes, bils, polaxes,
 flaskes, touchboxes, targets, &c: the verie sight wherof appalled my
 courage. What would the wearing of some of them doo then (trow you) if
 I should be inforced to vse one of them in the field? But thanked be
 God, our peaceable daies are such, as no man hath anie great cause to
 occupie them at all, but onelie taketh good leisure to haue them in a
 readinesse, and therefore both high and lowe in England

   Cymbala pro galeis pro scutis tympana pulsant.

 I would write here also of our maner of going to the warres, but what
 hath the long blacke gowne to doo with glistering armour? what sound
 [Sidenote: Male musis cum Marte.]
 acquaintance can there be betwixt Mars and the Muses? or how should a
 man write anie thing to the purpose of that wherewith he is nothing
 acquainted? This neuerthelesse will I adde of things at home, that
 seldome shall you see anie of my countriemen aboue eighteene or
 twentie yeeres old to go without a dagger at the least at his backe or
 by his side, although they be aged burgesses or magistrates of anie
 citie, who in appeerance are most exempt from brabling and contention.
 Our nobilitie weare commonlie swords or rapiers with their daggers, as
 dooth euerie common seruing man also that followeth his lord and
 master. Some desperate cutters we haue in like sort, which carrie two
 daggers or two rapiers in a sheath alwaies about them, wherewith in
 euerie dronken fraie they are knowen to worke much mischiefe; their
 swords & daggers also are of a great length, and longer than the like
 vsed in anie other countrie, whereby ech one pretendeth to haue the
 more aduantage of his enimie. But as manie orders haue beene taken for
 the intollerable length of these weapons; so I see as yet small
 redresse: but where the cause thereof doth rest, in sooth for my part
 I wote not. I might here speake of the excessiue staues which diuerse
 that trauell by the waie doo carrie vpon their shoulders, whereof some
 are twelue or thirteene foote long, beside the pike of twelue inches:
 but as they are commonlie suspected of honest men to be theeues and
 robbers, or at the leastwise scarse true men which beare them; so by
 reason of this and the like suspicious weapons, the honest traueller
 is now inforced to ride with a case of dags at his sadle bow, or with
 some pretie short snapper, whereby he may deale with them further off
 in his owne defense before he come within the danger of these weapons.
 Finallie, no man trauelleth by the waie without his sword, or some
 such weapon, with vs; except the minister, who c[=o]monlie weareth
 none at all, vnlesse it be a dagger or hanger at his side. Seldome
 also are they or anie other waifaring men robbed without the consent
 of the chamberleine, tapster, or ostler where they bait & lie, who
 feeling at their alighting whether their capcases or budgets be of
 anie weight or not, by taking them downe from their sadles, or
 otherwise see their store in drawing of their purses, do by and by
 giue intimation to some one or other attendant dailie in the yard or
 house, or dwelling hard by vpon such matches, whether the preie be
 worth the following or no. If it be for their turne, then the
 gentleman peraduenture is asked which waie he trauelleth, and whether
 it please him to haue another ghest to beare him companie at supper,
 who rideth the same waie in the morning that he doth, or not. And thus
 if he admit him or be glad of his acquaintance, the cheate is halfe
 wrought. And often it is seene that the new ghest shall be robbed with
 the old, onelie to colour out the matter and keepe him from suspicion.
 Sometimes when they knowe which waie the passenger trauelleth, they
 will either go before and lie in wait for him, or else come galloping
 apace after, wherby they will be sure, if he ride not the stronger, to
 be fingering with his purse. And these are some of the policies of
 such shrews or close booted gentlemen as lie in wait for fat booties
 by the high waies, and which are most commonlie practised in the
 winter season about the feast of Christmas, when seruing men and
 vnthriftie gentlemen want monie to plaie at the dice and cards,
 lewdlie spending in such wise whatsoeuer they haue wickedlie gotten,
 till some of them sharplie set vpon their cheuisances, be trussed vp
 in a Tiburne tippet, which happeneth vnto them commonlie before they
 come to middle age. Wherby it appeereth that some sort of youth will
 oft haue his swinge, although it be in a halter.

 I might also intreat of our old maner of warfare vsed in and before
 the time of Cesar, when as the cheefe brunt of our fight was in
 Essedis or wagons; but this I also passe ouer, noting neuerthelesse
 out of Propertius, that our said wagons were gorgeous and gailie
 painted, which he setteth downe in these foure verses insuing,
 Arethusae ad Lycotam, lib. 4. eleg. 3.

   Te modo viderunt iteratos Bactra per ortus,
     Te modo munito Sericus hostis equo,
   Hibernique Getae, pictoque Brittannia curru,
     Vstus & Eoa discolor Indus aqua.




 OF THE NAUIE OF ENGLAND.

 CHAP. XVII.


 There is nothing that hath brought me into more admiration of the
 power and force of antiquitie, than their diligence and care had of
 their nauies: wherein, whether I consider their speedie building, or
 great number of ships which some one kingdome or region possessed at
 one instant; it giueth me still occasion, either to suspect the
 historie, or to thinke that in our times we come verie farre behind
 them. For what a thing is it to haue a ship growing on the stub, and
 sailing on the sea within the space of fiue and fiftie daies? And yet
 such a nauie was to be seene in the first war of Carthage, led thither
 by Duellius the Romane. In the warres also against Hieron two hundred
 and twentie tall ships bare leafe & saile within fiue and fortie
 daies. In the second warre of Carthage the nauie that went with Scipio
 was felled in the wood, and seene to saile on the sea fullie furnished
 in sixe weekes: which vnto them that are ignorant of things doth seeme
 to be false, and vnpossible. In like maner for multitude, we find in
 Polybius, that at one skirmish on the sea the Romans lost seauen
 hundred vessels, which bare ech of them fiue rowes of ores on a side,
 and the Carthaginenses fiue hundred. And albeit the formes and
 apparell of these vessels were not altogither correspondent to our
 ships and gallies made in these daies: yet the capacitie of most of
 them did not onelie match, but farre exceed them; so that if one of
 their biremes onlie conteined so much in burden as a ship of ours of
 six hundred tun: what shall we thinke of those which had seauen rowes
 of ores walking on a side? But least I should seeme to speake more of
 these forren things than the course of the historie doth permit
 without licence to digresse: giue me leaue (I beseech thee gentle
 reader) to wade yet a little further in the report of these ancient
 formes & kinds of vessels. For albeit that the discourse hereof maketh
 little to the description of our present nauie in England: yet shall
 the report thereof not be vnprofitable and vnpleasant to such as shall
 reade among the writings of their capacities and moulds. It shall not
 be amisse therefore to begin at the nauie of Xerxes, of which ech
 meane vessell (as appeereth by Herodot) was able to receiue two
 hundred and thirtie souldiers, and some of them three hundred. These
 were called triremes, and were indeede gallies that had three rowes of
 ores on euerie side; for the word _Nauis_ is indifferentlie applied so
 well to the gallie as ship, as to the conuersant in histories is easie
 to be found. In old time also they had gallies of foure rowes, fiue
 rowes, six, seauen, eight, nine, twelue, yea fifteene rowes of ores on
 a side; iudge you then of what quantitie those vessels were. Plinie
 lib. 7. noteth one Damasthenes to be the first maker of the gallies
 with two rowes called biremes: Thucidides referreth the triremes to
 Ammocles of Corinthum; the quadriremes were deuised by Aristotle of
 Carthage; the quinquiremes by Nesichthon of Salamina; the gallie of
 six rowes by Xenagoras of Syracusa: from this to the tenth Nesigiton
 brought vp; Alexander the great caused one to be made of twelue;
 Ptolomeus Soter of fifteene; Demetrius the sonne of Antigonus of
 thirtie; Ptolom. Philad. of fortie; Ptol. Triphon of fiftie: all which
 aboue foure were none other (in mine opinion) than vnweldie carts, and
 more seruing for pleasure and to gaze vpon, than anie vse in the wars
 for which they should be deuised. But of all other I note one of
 fortie rowes, which Ptolo Philopater builded, conteining 200 and
 eightie cubits in length, and eight and fortie cubits in breadth: it
 held also foure thousand ores, foure hundred mariners, and three
 thousand souldiers, so that in the said vessell were seauen thousand
 and foure hundred persons: a report incredible, if truth and good
 testimonie did not confirme the same. I must needs confesse therefore,
 that the ancient vessels far exceeded ours for capacitie:
 neuerthelesse if you regard the forme, and the assurance from perill
 of the sea, and therewithall the strength and nimblenesse of such as
 are made in our time, you shall easilie find that ours are of more
 value than theirs: for as the greatest vessell is not alwaies the
 safest, so that of most huge capacitie is not alwaies the aptest to
 shift and brooke the seas: as might be seene by the great Henrie, the
 hugest vessell that euer England framed in our times. Neither were the
 ships of old like vnto ours in mould and maner of building aboue the
 water (for of low gallies in our seas we make small account) nor so
 full of ease within, sith time hath ingendred more skill in the
 wrights, and brought all things to more perfection than they had in
 the beginning. And now to come vnto our purpose at the first intended.

 The nauie of England may be diuided into three sortes, of which the
 one serueth for the warres, the other for burden, and the third for
 fishermen, which get their liuing by fishing on the sea. How manie of
 the first order are mainteined within the realme, it passeth my
 cunning to expresse: yet sith it may be parted into the nauie roiall
 and common fleete, I thinke good to speake of those that belong vnto
 the prince, and so much the rather, for that their number is certeine
 & well knowne to verie manie. Certes there is no prince in Europe that
 hath a more beautifull or gallant sort of ships than the queenes
 maiestie of England at this present, and those generallie are of such
 exceeding force, that two of them being well appointed and furnished
 as they ought, will not let to encounter with three or foure of those
 of other countries, and either bowge them or put them to flight, if
 they may not bring them home.

 Neither are the moulds of anie forren barkes so conuenientlie made, to
 brooke so well one sea as another lieng vpon the shore in anie part of
 the continent as those of England. And therefore the common report
 that strangers make of our ships amongst themselues is dailie
 confirmed to be true, which is, that for strength, assurance,
 nimblenesse and swiftnesse of sailing, there are no vessels in the
 world to be compared with ours. And all these are committed to the
 regiment and safe custodie of the admerall, who is so called (as some
 imagine) of the Greeke word _Almiras_ a capiteine on the sea, for so
 saith Zonaras "in Basilio Macedone & Basilio Porphyriogenito," though
 other fetch it from _Ad mare_ the Latine words, another sort from

 It is said, that as kings and princes haue in the yoong daies of the
 world, and long since framed themselues to erect euerie yeare a citie
 in some one place or other of their kingdoms (and no small woonder
 that Sardanapalus should begin & finish two, to wit, Anchialus and
 Tharsus in one daie) so hir grace dooth yearelie build one ship or
 other to the better defense of hir frontiers from the enimie. But as
 of this report I haue no assured certeintie, so it shall suffice to
 haue said so much of these things: yet this I thinke worthie further
 to be added, that if they should all be driuen to seruice at one
 instant (which God forbid) she should haue a power by sea of about
 nine or ten thousand men, which were a notable companie, beside the
 supplie of other vessels apperteining to hir subiects to furnish vp
 hir voiage.

 Beside these hir grace hath other in hand also, of whome hereafter as
 their turnes doo come about, I will not let to leaue some further
 remembrance. She hath likewise three notable gallies: the Speed well,
 the Trie right, and the Blacke gallie, with the sight whereof and rest
 of the nauie roiall, it is incredible to saie how greatlie hir grace
 is delighted: and not without great cause (I saie) sith by their
 meanes hir coasts are kept in quiet, and sundrie forren enimies put
 backe, which otherwise would inuade vs. The number of those that serue
 for burden with the other, whereof I haue made mention alreadie, and
 whose vse is dailie seene, as occasion serueth, in time of the warres,
 is to mee vtterlie vnknowne. Yet if the report of one record be anie
 thing at all to be credited, there are 135 ships that exceed 500 tun,
 topmen vnder 100 and aboue fortie 656: hoies 100: but of hulkes,
 catches, fisherboats, and craiers, it lieth not in me to deliuer the
 iust account, sith they are hardlie to come by. Of these also there
 are some of the queenes maiesties subiects that haue two or three,
 some foure or six, and (as I heard of late) one man whose name I
 suppresse for modesties sake, hath bene knowne long since to haue had
 sixteene or seuenteene, and emploied them wholie to the wafting in and
 out of our merchants, whereby he hath reaped no small commoditie and
 gaine. I might take occasion to tell of the notable and difficult
 voiages made into strange countries by Englishmen, and of their dailie
 successe there: but as these things are nothing incident to my
 purpose, so I surcease to speake of them. Onelie this will I ad, to
 the end all men shall vnderstand somewhat of the great masses of
 treasure dailie emploied vpon our nauie, how there are few of those
 ships, of the first and second sort, that being apparelled and made
 readie to sale, are not woorth one thousand pounds, or three thousand
 ducats at the least, if they should presentlie be sold. What shall we
 thinke then of the greater, but especiallie of the nauie roiall, of
 which some one vessell is woorth two of the other, as the shipwrights
 haue often told me? It is possible that some couetous person hearing
 this report, will either not credit it at all, or suppose monie so
 emploied to be nothing profitable to the queenes coffers: as a good
 husband said once when he hard there should be prouision made for
 armor, wishing the queenes monie to be rather laid out to some
 speedier returne of gaine vnto hir grace, bicause the realme (saith
 he) is in case good enough, and so peraduenture he thought. But if as
 by store of armour for the defense of the countrie, he had likewise
 vnderstanded that the good keeping of the sea, is the safegard of our
 land, he would haue altered his censure, and soone giuen ouer his
 iudgement. For in times past, when our nation made small account of
 nauigation, how soone did the Romans, then the Saxons, & last of all
 the Danes inuade this Iland? whose crueltie in the end inforced our
 countrimen, as it were euen against their wils, to prouide for ships
 from other places, and build at home of their owne, whereby their
 enimies were oftentimes distressed. But most of all were the Normans
 therein to be commended. For in a short processe of time after the
 conquest of this Iland, and good consideration had for the well
 keeping of the same, they supposed nothing more commodious for the
 defense of the countrie, than the maintenance of a strong nauie, which
 they speedilie prouided, mainteined, and thereby reaped in the end
 their wished securitie, wherewith before their times this Iland was
 neuer acquainted. Before the comming of the Romans, I doo not read
 that we had anie ships at all, except a few made of wicker and couered
 with buffle hides, like vnto the which there are some to be seene at
 this present in Scotland (as I heare) although there be a little (I
 wote not well what) difference betweene them. Of the same also Solinus
 speaketh, so far as I remember: neuerthelesse it may be gathered by
 his words, how the vpper parts of them aboue the water onelie were
 [Sidenote: The Britons fasted all the while they were
 at the sea in these ships.]
 framed of the said wickers, and that the Britons did vse to fast all
 the whiles they went to the sea in them: but whether it were doone for
 policie or superstition, as yet I doo not read.

 In the beginning of the Saxons regiment we had some ships also, but as
 their number and mould was litle and nothing to the purpose, so Egbert
 was the first prince that euer throughlie began to know this
 necessitie of a nauie, and vse the seruice thereof in the defense of
 his countrie. After him also other princes, as Alfred, Edgar,
 Ethelred, &c: indeuoured more and more to store themselues at the full
 with ships of all quantities, but chieflie Edgar, for he prouided a
 nauie of 1600 alias 3600 saile, which he diuided into foure parts, and
 sent them to abide vpon foure sundrie coasts of the land to keepe the
 same from pirats. Next vnto him (and worthie to be remembred) is
 Etheldred, who made a law, that euerie man holding 310 hidelands,
 should find a ship furnished to serue him in the warres. Howbeit, and
 as I said before, when all their nauie was at the greatest, it was not
 comparable for force and sure building, to that which afterward the
 Normans prouided; neither that of the Normans anie thing like to the
 same that is to be seene now in these our daies. For the iourneies
 also of our ships, you shall vnderstand, that a well builded vessell
 will run or saile commonlie three hundred leagues or nine hundred
 miles in a weeke, or peraduenture some will go 2200 leagues in six
 weekes and an halfe. And suerlie, if their lading be readie against
 they come thither, there will be of them that will be here, at the
 west Indies, & home againe in twelue or thirteene weekes from
 Colchester; although the said Indies be eight hundred leagues from the
 cape or point of Cornewall, as I haue beene informed. This also I
 vnderstand by report of some trauellers, that if anie of our vessels
 happen to make a voiage to Hispaniola or new Spaine, called in time
 past Quinquezia and Haiti, and lieth betweene the north tropike and
 the equator, after they haue once touched at the Canaries, (which are
 eight daies sailing or two hundred and fiftie leages from S. Lucas de
 Barameda in Spaine) they will be there in thirtie or fourtie daies, &
 home againe in Cornewall in other eight weekes, which is a goodlie
 matter, beside the safetie and quietnesse in the passage. But more of
 this elsewhere.




 OF FAIRES AND MARKETS.

 CHAP. XVIII.


 There are (as I take it) few great townes in England, that haue not
 their weekelie markets, one or more granted from the prince, in which
 all maner of prouision for houshold is to be bought and sold, for ease
 and benefit of the countrie round about. Wherby as it c[=o]meth to
 passe that no buier shall make anie great iourneie in the purueiance
 of his necessities: so no occupier shall haue occasion to trauell far
 off with his commodities, except it be to seeke for the highest
 prices, which commonlie are neere vnto great cities, where round and
 speediest vtterance is alwaies to be had. And as these haue beene in
 times past erected for the benefit of the realme, so are they in many
 places too too much abused: for the reliefe and ease of the buier is
 not so much intended in them, as the benefit of the seller. Neither
 are the magistrats for the most part (as men loth to displease their
 neighbours for their one yeares dignitie) so carefull in their
 offices, as of right and dutie they should bee. For in most of these
 markets neither assises of bread nor orders for goodnesse and
 sweetnesse of graine, and other commodities that are brought thither
 to be sold, are anie whit looked vnto; but ech one suffered to sell or
 set vp what and how himselfe listeth: & this is one euident cause of
 dearth and scarsitie in time of great abundance.

 I could (if I would) exemplifie in manie, but I will touch no one
 particularlie, sith it is rare to see in anie countrie towne (as I
 said) the assise of bread well kept according to the statute. And yet
 if anie countrie baker happen to come in among them on the market daie
 with bread of better quantitie, they find fault by and by with one
 thing or another in his stuffe; whereby the honest poore man, whome
 the law of nations doo commend, for that he indeuoureth to liue by
 anie lawfull meanes, is driuen awaie, and no more to come there vpon
 some round penaltie, by vertue of their priuileges. Howbeit though
 they are so nice in the proportion of their bread, yet in lieu of the
 same, there is such headie ale & beere in most of them, as for the
 mightinesse thereof among such as seeke it out, is commonlie called
 huffecap, the mad dog, father whoresonne, angels food, dragons milke,
 go by the wall, stride wide, and lift leg, &c. And this is more to be
 noted, that when one of late fell by Gods prouidence into a troubled
 c[=o]science, after he had considered well of his reachlesse life, and
 dangerous estate: another thinking belike to change his colour and not
 his mind, caried him straightwaie to the strongest ale, as to the next
 physician. It is incredible to saie how our maltbugs lug at this
 liquor, euen as pigs should lie in a row, lugging at their dames
 teats, till they lie still againe, and be not able to wag. Neither did
 Romulus and Remus sucke their shee woolfe or sheepheards wife Lupa,
 with such eger and sharpe deuotion, as these men hale at hufcap, till
 they be red as cockes, & litle wiser than their combs. But how am I
 fallen from the market into the alehouse? In returning therefore vnto
 my purpose, I find that in corne great abuse is dailie suffered, to
 the great preiudice of the towne and countrie, especiallie the poore
 artificer and householder, which tilleth no land, but laboring all the
 weeke to buie a bushell or two of graine on the market daie, can there
 haue none for his monie: bicause bodgers, loders, and common carriers
 of corne doo not onlie buie vp all, but giue aboue the price, to be
 serued of great quantities. Shall I go anie further? Well I will saie
 yet a little more, and somewhat by mine owne experience.

 At Michaelmasse time poore men must make monie of their graine, that
 they may paie their rents. So long then as the poore man hath to sell,
 rich men will bring out none, but rather buie vp that which the poore
 bring, vnder pretense of seed corne, or alteration of graine, although
 they bring none of their owne, bicause one wheat often sowen without
 change of seed, will soone decaie and be conuerted into darnell. For
 this cause therefore they must needs buie in the markets, though they
 be twentie miles off and where they be not knowne, promising there if
 they happen to be espied (which God wot is verie seldome) to send so
 much to their next market, to be performed I wot not when.

 If this shift serue not (neither dooth the fox vse alwaies one tracke
 for feare of a snare) they will compound with some one of the towne
 where the market is holden, who for a pot of hufcap or merie go downe,
 will not let to buie it for them, and that in his owne name. Or else
 [Sidenote: Suborned bodgers.]
 they wage one poore man or other, to become a bodger, and thereto get
 him a licence vpon some forged surmise, which being doone, they will
 feed him with monie, to buie for them till he hath filled their lofts,
 and then if he can doo any good for himselfe so it is, if not, they
 will giue him somewhat for his paines at this time, & reserue him for
 an other yeare. How manie of the like prouiders stumble vpon blind
 creekes at the sea coast, I wote not well; but that some haue so doone
 and yet doo vnder other mens wings, the case is too too plaine. But
 [Sidenote: Bodgers licenced.]
 who dare find fault with them, when they haue once a licence? yea
 though it be but to serue a meane gentlemans house with corne, who
 hath cast vp all his tillage, bicause he boasteth how he can buie his
 graine in the market better cheape, than he can sow his land, as the
 rich grasier often dooth also vpon the like deuise, bicause grasing
 requireth a smaller household and lesse attendance and charge. If anie
 man come to buie a bushell or two for his expenses vnto the market
 crosse, answer is made; Forsooth here was one euen now that bad me
 monie for it, and I hope he will haue it. And to saie the truth, these
 bodgers are faire chapmen, for there are no more words with them, but
 Let me see it, what shall I giue you, knit it vp, I will haue it, go
 carie it to such a chamber, and if you bring in twentie seme more in
 the weeke daie to such an Inne or sollar where I laie my corne, I will
 haue it and giue you pence or more in euerie bushell for six weekes
 day of paiment than an other will. Thus the bodgers beare awaie all,
 so that the poore artificer and labourer cannot make his prouision in
 the markets, sith they will hardlie now a daies sell by the bushell,
 nor breake their measure; and so much the rather, for that the buier
 will looke (as they saie) for so much ouer measure in a bushell as the
 bodger will doo in a quarter. Naie the poore man cannot oft get anie
 of the farmer at home, bicause he prouideth altogither to serue the
 bodger, or hath an hope grounded vpon a greedie and insatiable desire
 of gaine, that the sale will be better in the market: so that he must
 giue two pence or a groate more in a bushell at his house than the
 last market craued, or else go without it, and sleepe with an hungrie
 bellie. Of the common carriage of corne ouer vnto the parts beyond the
 seas I speake not; or at the leastwise if I should, I could not touch
 it alone but needs must ioine other prouision withall, whereby not
 onelie our freends abroad, but also manie of our aduersaries and
 countriemen the papists are abundantlie relieued (as the report goeth)
 but sith I see it not, I will not so trust mine eares as to write it
 for a truth. But to returne to our markets againe.

 By this time the poore occupier hath all sold his crop for need of
 monie, being readie peraduenture to buie againe yer long. And now is
 the whole sale of corne in the great occupiers hands, who hitherto
 haue threshed little or none of their owne, but bought vp of other
 men, so much as they could come by. Hencefoorth also they begin to
 sell, not by the quarter or load at the first, for marring the market,
 but by the bushell or two, or an horsseload at the most, therby to be
 seene to keepe the crosse, either for a shew, or to make men eger to
 buie, and so as they may haue it for monie, not to regard what they
 paie. And thus corne waxeth deere, but it will be deerer the next
 market daie. It is possible also that they mislike the price in the
 beginning for the whole yeare insuing, as men supposing that corne
 will be litle worth for this, & of better price in the next yeare. For
 they haue certeine superstitious obseruations, whereby they will giue
 a gesse at the sale of corne for the yeare following. And our
 countriemen doo vse commonlie for barleie where I dwell, to iudge
 after the price at Baldocke vpon S. Matthewes daie, and for wheat as
 it is sold in seed time. They take in like sort experiment by sight of
 the first flockes of cranes that flee southward in winter, the age of
 the moone in the beginning of Ianuarie, & such other apish toies, as
 by laieng twelue cornes vpon the hot hearth for the twelue moneths,
 &c: whereby they shew themselues to be scant good christians, but what
 care they so they may come by monie? Herevpon also will they thresh
 out three parts of the old corne, toward the latter end of the summer,
 when new commeth apace to hand, and cast the same in the fourth
 vnthreshed, where it shall lie vntill the next spring, or peraduenture
 till it must and putrifie. Certes it is not deintie to see mustie
 corne in manie of our great markets of England, which these great
 occupiers bring foorth when they can keepe it no longer. But as they
 are inforced oftentimes vpon this one occasion somwhat to abate the
 price, so a plague is not seldome ingendred thereby among the poorer
 sort that of necessitie must buie the same, wherby manie thousands of
 all degrees are consumed, of whose deaths (in mine opinion) these
 farmers are not vnguiltie. But to proceed. If they laie not vp their
 graine or wheat in this maner, they haue yet another policie, whereby
 they will seeme to haue but small store left in their barnes: for else
 they will gird their sheues by the band, and stacke it vp of new in
 lesse roome, to the end it may not onlie seeme lesse in quantitie, but
 also giue place to the corne that is yet to come into the barne, or
 growing in the field. If there happen to be such plentie in the market
 on anie market daie, that they cannot sell at their own price, then
 will they set it vp in some freends house, against an other or the
 third daie, & not bring it foorth till they like of the sale. If they
 sell anie at home, beside harder measure, it shall be deerer to the
 poore man that bieth it by two pence or a groat in a bushell than they
 may sell it in the market. But as these things are worthie redresse,
 so I wish that God would once open their eies that deale thus, to see
 their owne errours: for as yet some of them little care how manie
 poore men suffer extremitie, so that they may fill their purses, and
 carie awaie the gaine.

 It is a world also to see how most places of the realme are pestered
 with purueiours, who take vp egs, butter, cheese, pigs, capons, hens,
 chickens, hogs, bakon, &c: in one market, vnder pretense of their
 commissions, & suffer their wiues to sell the same in another, or to
 pulters of London. If these chapmen be absent but two or three market
 daies, then we may perfectlie see these wares to be more reasonablie
 sold, and therevnto the crosses sufficientlie furnished of all things.
 In like sort, since the number of buttermen haue so much increased,
 and since they trauell in such wise, that they come to mens houses for
 their butter faster than they can make it; it is almost incredible to
 see how the price of butter is augmented: whereas when the owners were
 inforced to bring it to the market townes, & fewer of these butter
 buiers were stirring, our butter was scarslie woorth eighteene pence
 the gallon, that now is worth three shillings foure pence, & perhaps
 fiue shillings. Wherby also I gather that the maintenance of a
 superfluous number of dealers in most trades, tillage alwaies
 excepted, is one of the greatest causes why the prices of things
 become excessiue: for one of them doo c[=o]monlie vse to out bid
 another. And whilest our countrie commodities are commonlie bought and
 sold at our priuate houses, I neuer looke to see this enormitie
 redressed, or the markets well furnished.

 I could saie more, but this is euen inough, & more peraduenture than I
 shall be well thanked for: yet true it is though some thinke it no
 trespasse. This moreouer is to be lamented, that one generall measure
 is not in vse throughout all England, but euerie market towne hath in
 maner a seuerall bushell, and the lesser it be, the more sellers it
 draweth to resort vnto the same. Such also is the couetousnesse of
 manie clearkes of the market, that in taking view of measures, they
 will alwaie so prouide, that one and the same bushell shall be either
 too big or too little at their next comming, and yet not depart
 without a fee at the first: so that what by their mending at one time
 and empairing the same at another, the countrie is greatlie charged,
 and few iust measures to be had in anie steed. It is oft found
 likewise, that diuerse vnconscionable dealers haue one measure to sell
 by, & another to buie withall, the like is also in weights and yet all
 sealed and bronded. Wherefore it were verie good that these two were
 reduced vnto one standard, that is, one bushell, one pound, one
 quarter, one hundred, one tale, one number: so should things in time
 fall into better order, and fewer causes of contention be mooued in
 this land. Of the complaint of such poore tenants as paie rent corne
 vnto their landlords, I speake not, who are often dealt withall very
 hardlie. For beside that in the measuring of ten quarters, for the
 most part they lose one through the iniquitie of the bushell (such is
 the greedinesse of the appointed receiuers thereof) fault is found
 also with the goodnesse and cleannesse of the graine. Wherby some
 peece of monie must needs passe vnto their purses to stop their mouths
 withall, or else my lord will not like of the corne; Thou art worthie
 to loose thy lease, &c. Or if it be cheaper in the market, than the
 rate allowed for it is in their rents, then must they paie monie and
 no corne, which is no small extremitie. And thereby we may see how
 each one of vs indeuoureth to fleece and eat vp another.

 Another thing there is in our markets worthie to be looked vnto, and
 that is the recariage of graine from the same into lofts and sollars,
 of which before I gaue some intimation: wherefore if it were ordered,
 that euerie seller should make his market by an houre, or else the
 bailie, or clearke of the said market to make sale therof according to
 his discretion, without libertie to the farmer to set vp their corne
 in houses and chambers, I am persuaded that the prices of our graine
 would soone be abated. Againe, if it were enacted that each one should
 keepe his next market with his graine, and not to run six, eight, ten,
 foureteene, or twentie miles from home to sell his corne, where he
 dooth find the highest price, and therby leaueth his neighbours
 vnfurnished, I doo not thinke but that our markets would be farre
 better serued than at this present they are. Finallie if mens barns
 might be indifferentlie viewed immediatlie after haruest, and a note
 gathered by an estimat, and kept by some appointed & trustie person
 for that purpose, we should haue much more plentie of corne in our
 towne crosses than as yet is commonlie seene: bicause each one hideth
 and hoordeth what he may vpon purpose either that it will be deerer,
 or that he shall haue some priuie veine by bodgers, who doo
 accustomablie so deale, that the sea dooth load awaie no small part
 thereof into other countries & our enimies, to the great hinderance of
 our common-wealth at home, and more likelie yet to be, except some
 remedie be found. But what doo I talke of these things, or desire the
 suppression of bodgers being a minister? Certes I may speake of them
 right well, as feeling the harme in that I am a buier, neuerthelesse I
 speake generallie in ech of them.

 To conclude therefore, in our markets all things are to be sold
 necessarie for mans vse, and there is our prouision made commonlie for
 all the weeke insuing. Therefore as there are no great townes without
 one weekelie market at the least, so there are verie few of them that
 haue not one or two faires or more within the compasse of the yeare
 assigned vnto them by the prince. And albeit that some of them are not
 much better than Lowse faire or the common kirkemesses beyond the sea,
 yet there are diuerse not inferiour to the greatest marts in Europe,
 as Sturbridge faire neere to Cambridge, Bristow faire, Bartholomew
 faire at London, Lin mart, Cold faire at Newport pond for cattell, and
 diuerse other, all which or at leastwise the greatest part of them (to
 the end I may with the more ease to the reader and lesse trauell to my
 selfe fulfill my taske in their recitall) I haue set downe, according
 to the names of the moneths wherein they are holden, at the end of
 this booke, where you shall find them at large, as I borowed the same
 from I. Stow, and the reports of others.




 OF PARKES AND WARRENS.

 CHAP. XIX.


 In euerie shire of England there is great plentie of parkes, whereof
 some here and there, to wit, welnere to the number of two hundred for
 hir daily prouision of that flesh apperteine to the prince, the rest
 to such of the nobilitie and gentlemen as haue their lands and
 patrimonies lieng in or neere vnto the same. I would gladlie haue set
 downe the iust number of these inclosures to be found in euerie
 countie: but sith I cannot so doo, it shall suffice to saie, that in
 Kent and Essex onelie are to the number of an hundred, and twentie in
 the bishoprike of Durham, wherein great plentie of fallow deere is
 cherished and kept. As for warrens of conies, I iudge them almost
 innumerable, and dailie like to increase, by reason that the blacke
 skins of those beasts are thought to counteruaile the prices of their
 naked carcases, and this is the onelie cause whie the graie are lesse
 esteemed. Neere vnto London their quickest merchandize is of the yong
 rabbets, wherfore the older conies are brought from further off, where
 there is no such speedie vtterance of rabbets and sucklings in their
 season, nor so great losse by their skins, sith they are suffered to
 growe vp to their full greatnesse with their owners. Our parkes are
 generallie inclosed with strong pale made of oke, of which kind of
 wood there is great store cherished in the woodland countries from
 time to time in ech of them, onelie for the maintenance of the said
 defense, and safe-keeping of the fallow deere from ranging about the
 countrie. Howbeit in times past diuerse haue been fensed in with stone
 walles (especiallie in the times of the Romans, who first brought
 fallow deere into this land, as some coniecture) albeit those
 inclosures were ouerthrowne againe by the Saxons & Danes, as Cauisham,
 Towner, and Woodstocke, beside other in the west countrie, and one
 also at Bolton. Among other things also to be seene in that towne,
 there is one of the fairest clockes in Europe. Where no wood is, they
 are also inclosed with piles of slate; and therto it is doubted of
 manie whether our bucke or doe are to be reckoned in wild or tame
 beasts or not. Plinie deemeth them to be wild, Martial is also of the
 same opinion, where he saith, "Imbelles damae quid nisi praeda sumus?"
 And so in time past the like controuersie was about bees, which the
 lawiers call "Feras," tit. de acquirendo rerum dominio, & lib. 2.
 instit. But Plinie attempting to decide the quarell calleth them
 "Medias inter feras & placidas aues." But whither am I so suddenlie
 digressed? In returning therefore vnto our parks, I find also the
 circuit of these inclosures in like manner conteine often times a
 walke of foure or fiue miles, and sometimes more or lesse. Wherby it
 is to be seene what store of ground is emploied vpon that vaine
 commoditie, which bringeth no manner of gaine or profit to the owner,
 sith they commonlie giue awaie their flesh, neuer taking penie for the
 same, except the ordinarie fee and parts of the deere giuen vnto the
 keeper by a custome, who beside three shillings foure pence, or fiue
 shillings in monie, hath the skin, head, vmbles, chine, and shoulders:
 whereby he that hath the warrant for an whole bucke, hath in the end
 little more than halfe, which in my iudgement is scarselie equall
 dealing; for venison in England is neither bought nor sold, as in
 other countries, but mainteined onelie for the pleasure of the owner
 and his friends. Albeit I heard of late of one ancient ladie, which
 maketh a great game by selling yeerelie hir husbands venison to the
 cookes (as another of no lesse name will not sticke to ride to the
 market to see hir butter sold) but not performed without infinite
 scoffes and mockes, euen of the poorest pezzants of the countrie, who
 thinke them as odious matters in ladies and women of such countenance
 to sell their venison and their butter, as for an earle to feele his
 oxen, sheepe, and lambs, whether they be readie for the butcher or
 not, or to sell his wooll vnto the clothier, or to keepe a tan-house,
 or deale with such like affaires as belong not to men of honor, but
 rather to farmers, or grasiers; for which such, if there be anie may
 well be noted (and not vniustlie) to degenerate from true nobilitie,
 and betake themselues to husbandrie. And euen the same enormitie tooke
 place sometime among the Romans, and entred so farre as into the verie
 senate, of whome some one had two or three ships going vpon the sea,
 pretending prouision for their houses; but in truth following the
 trades of merchandize, till a law was made which did inhibit and
 restraine them. Liuie also telleth of another law which passed
 likewise against the senators by Claudius the tribune, and helpe
 onelie of C. Flaminius, that no senator, or he that had beene father
 to anie senator should possesse anie ship or vessell aboue the
 capacitie of three hundred amphoras, which was supposed sufficient for
 the cariage and recariage of such necessities as should apperteine
 vnto his house: sith further trading with merchandizes and commodities
 dooth declare but a base and couetous mind, not altogither void of
 enuie, that anie man should liue but he; or that if anie gaine were to
 be had, he onelie would haue it himselfe: which is a wonderfull
 dealing, and must needs proue in time the confusion of that countrie
 [Sidenote: Tillage and mankind diminished by parkes.]
 wherein such enormities are exercised. Where in times past, manie
 large and wealthie occupiers were dwelling within the compasse of some
 one parke, and thereby great plentie of corne and cattell seene, and
 to be had among them, beside a more copious procreation of humane
 issue, whereby the realme was alwaies better furnished with able men
 to serue the prince in his affaires: now there is almost nothing kept
 but a sort of wild and sauage beasts, cherished for pleasure and
 delight; and yet some owners still desirous to inlarge those grounds,
 as either for the breed and feeding of cattell, doo not let dailie to
 take in more, not sparing the verie commons whervpon manie towneships
 now and then doo liue, affirming that we haue alreadie too great store
 of people in England; and that youth by marrieng too soone doo nothing
 profit the countrie, but fill it full of beggars, to the hurt and
 vtter vndooing (they saie) of the common wealth.

 [Sidenote: The decaie of the people is the destruction of a kingdome.]
 Certes if it be not one curse of the Lord, to haue our countrie
 conuerted in such sort from the furniture of mankind, into the walks
 and shrowds of wild beasts, I know not what is anie. How manie
 families also these great and small games (for so most keepers call
 them) haue eaten vp and are likelie hereafter to deuoure, some men may
 coniecture, but manie more lament, sith there is no hope of restraint
 to be looked for in this behalfe, because the corruption is so
 generall. But if a man may presentlie giue a ghesse at the
 vniuersalitie of this euill by contemplation of the circumstance, he
 shall saie at the last, that the twentith part of the realme is
 imploied vpon deere and conies alreadie, which seemeth verie much if
 it be not dulie considered of.

 King Henrie the eight, one of the noblest princes that euer reigned in
 this land, lamented oft that he was constreined to hire forren aid,
 for want of competent store of souldiors here at home, perceiuing (as
 it is indeed) that such supplies are oftentimes more hurtfull than
 profitable vnto those that interteine them, as may cheeflie be seene
 in Valens the emperor, our Vortiger, and no small number of others. He
 would oft maruell in priuate talke, how that when seauen or eight
 princes ruled here at once, one of them could lead thirtie or fortie
 thousand men to the field against another, or two of them 100000
 against the third, and those taken out onelie of their owne dominions.
 But as he found the want, so he saw not the cause of this decaie,
 which grew beside this occasion now mentioned, also by laieng house to
 house, and land to land, whereby manie mens occupiengs were conuerted
 into one, and the breed of people not a little thereby diminished. The
 auarice of landlords by increasing of rents and fines also did so
 wearie the people, that they were readie to rebell with him that would
 arise, supposing a short end in the warres to be better than a long
 and miserable life in peace.

 Priuileges and faculties also are another great cause of the ruine of
 a common wealth, and diminution of mankind: for whereas law and nature
 dooth permit all men to liue in their best maner, and whatsoeuer trade
 they be exercised in, there commeth some priuilege or other in the
 waie, which cutteth them off from this or that trade, wherby they must
 needs shift soile, and seeke vnto other countries. By these also the
 greatest commodities are brought into the hands of few, who imbase,
 corrupt, and yet raise the prices of things at their owne pleasures.
 Example of this last I can giue also in bookes, which (after the first
 impression of anie one booke) are for the most part verie negligentlie
 handled: whereas if another might print it so well as the first, then
 would men striue which of them should doo it best; and so it falleth
 out in all other trades. It is an easie matter to prooue that England
 was neuer lesse furnished with people than at this present; for if the
 old records of euerie manour be sought, and search made to find what
 tenements are fallen, either downe, or into the lords hands, or
 brought and vnited togither by other men: it will soone appeere, that
 in some one manour seuenteen, eighteene, or twentie houses are
 shrunke. I know what I saie by mine owne experience: notwithstanding
 that some one cotage be here and there erected of late, which is to
 little purpose. Of cities and townes either vtterlie decaied, or more
 than a quarter or halfe diminished, though some one be a little
 increased here and there; of townes pulled downe for sheepe-walks, and
 no more but the lordships now standing in them, beside those that
 William Rufus pulled downe in his time; I could saie somewhat: but
 then I should swarue yet further from my purpose, wherevnto I now
 returne.

 Wee had no parkes left in England at the comming of the Normans, who
 added this calamitie also to the seruitude of our nation, making men
 of the best sort furthermore to become keepers of their game, whilest
 they liued in the meane time vpon the spoile of their reuenues, and
 dailie ouerthrew townes, villages, and an infinit sort of families,
 for the maintenance of their venerie. Neither was anie parke supposed
 in these times to be statelie enough, that conteined not at the least
 eight or ten hidelands, that is, so manie hundred acres or families
 (or as they haue beene alwaies called in some places of the realme
 carrucats or cartwares) of which one was sufficient in old time to
 mainteine an honest yeoman.

 King Iohn trauelling on a time northwards, to wit 1209 to warre vpon
 the king of Scots, because he had married his daughter to the earle of
 Bullen without his consent: in his returne ouerthrew a great number of
 parkes and warrens, of which some belonged to his barons, but the
 greatest part to the abbats and prelats of the cleargie. For hearing
 (as he trauelled) by complaint of the countrie, how these inclosures
 were the cheefe decaie of men, and of tillage in the land, he sware
 with an oth that he would not suffer wild beasts to feed vpon the fat
 of his soile, and see the people perish for want of abilitie to
 procure and buie them food that should defend the realme. Howbeit,
 this act of his was so ill taken by the religious and their adherents,
 that they inuerted his intent herein to another end; affirming most
 slanderouslie how he did it rather of purpose to spoile the corne and
 grasse of the commons and catholikes that held against him of both
 estates, and by so doing to impouerish and bring the north part of the
 realme to destruction, because they refused to go with him into
 Scotland. If the said prince were aliue in these daies, wherein Andrew
 Boord saith there are more parks in England than in all Europe (ouer
 which he trauelled in his owne person) and saw how much ground they
 consume, I thinke he would either double his othes, or laie the most
 of them open that tillage might be better looked vnto. But this I hope
 shall not need in time, for the owners of a great sort of them begin
 now to smell out, that such parcels might be emploied to their more
 game, and therefore some of them doo grow to be disparked.

 Next of all we haue the franke chase, which taketh something both of
 parke and forrest, and is giuen either by the kings grant or
 prescription. Certes it differeth not much from a parke; nay, it is in
 maner the selfe same thing that a parke is, sauing that a parke is
 inuironed with pale, wall, or such like: the chase alwaie open and
 nothing at all inclosed, as we see in Enueeld & Maluerne chases. And
 as it is the cause of the seisure of the franchise of a parke not to
 keepe the same inclosed, so it is the like in a chase if at anie time
 it be imparked. It is trespasse, and against the law also, for anie
 man to haue or make a chase, parke, or free warren without good
 warrantie of the king by his charter or perfect title of prescription:
 for it is not lawfull for anie subiect either to carnilate, that is,
 build stone houses, imbattell, haue the querke of the sea, or keepe
 the assise of bread, ale, or wine, or set vp furels, tumbrell, thew,
 or pillorie, or inclose anie ground to the aforesaid purposes within
 his owne soile, without his warrant and grant. The beasts of the chase
 were commonlie the bucke, the roe, the fox, and the marterne. But
 those of venerie in old time were the hart, the hare, the bore and the
 woolfe; but as this held not in the time of Canutus, so in steed of
 the woolfe the beare is now crept in, which is a beast comonlie hunted
 in the east countries, and fed vpon as excellent venison, although
 with vs I know not anie that feed thereon or care for it at all.
 Certes it should seeme, that forrests and franke chases haue alwaies
 beene had, and religiouslie preserued in this Iland for the solace of
 the prince, and recreation of his nobilitie: howbeit I read not that
 euer they were inclosed more than at this present, or otherwise fensed
 than by vsuall notes of limitation, whereby their bounds were
 remembred from time to time, for the better preseruation of such
 venerie and vert of all sorts as were nourished in the same. Neither
 are anie of the ancient laws prescribed for their maintenance, before
 the daies of Canutus, now to be had; sith time hath so dealt with them
 that they are perished and lost. Canutus therefore seeing the dailie
 spoile that was made almost in all places of his game, did at the last
 make sundrie sanctions and decrees, whereby from thenceforth the red
 and fallow deere were better looked to throughout his whole dominions.
 We haue in these daies diuerse forrests in England and Wales, of
 which, some belong to the king, and some to his subiects, as Waltham
 forrest, Windlesor, Pickering, Fecknam, Delamore, Gillingham,
 Kingswood, Wencedale, Clun, Rath, Bredon, Weire, Charlie, Leircester,
 Lee, Rokingham, Selwood, New forrest, Wichwood, Hatfeeld, Sauernake,
 Westbirie, Blacamore Peke, Deane, Penrise, & manie other now cleane
 out of my remembrance: and which although they are far greater in
 circuit than manie parkes and warrens, yet are they in this our time
 lesse deuourers of the people than these latter, sith beside much
 tillage, & manie townes are found in each of them, wheras in parks and
 warrens we haue nothing else than either the keepers & wareners lodge,
 or at least the manor place of the cheef lord & owner of the soile. I
 find also by good record, that all Essex hath in time past wholie
 beene forrest ground, except one cantred or hundred; but how long it
 is since it lost the said denomination in good sooth I doo not read.
 This neuerthelesse remaineth yet in memorie, that the towne of Walden
 in Essex standing in the limits of the aforesaid countie doth take hir
 name thereof. For in the Celtike toong, wherewith the Saxon or
 Scithian speech dooth not a little participate, huge woods and
 forrests were called Walds, and likewise their Druides were named
 Walie or Waldie, bicause they frequented the woods, and there made
 sacrifice among the okes and thickets. So that if my coniecture in
 this behalfe be anie thing at all, the aforesaid towne taketh
 denomination of Wald and end, as if I should say, The end of the
 wooddie soile; for being once out of that parish, the champaine is at
 hand. Or it may be that it is so called of Wald and dene: for I haue
 read it written in old euidences Waldaene, with a diphthong. And to
 saie truth, Dene is the old Saxon word for a vale or lowe bottome, as
 Dune or Don is for an hill or hillie soile. Certes if it be so, then
 Walden taketh hir name of the woodie vale, in which it sometime stood.
 But the first deriuation liketh me better, and the highest part of the
 [Sidenote: Gipping, of going vp to anie place.]
 towne is called also Chipping Walden, of the Saxon word gipping, which
 signifieth Leaning or hanging, and may verie well be applied
 therevnto, sith the whole towne hangeth as it were vpon the sides of
 two hils, wherof the lesser runneth quite through the middest of the
 same. I might here for further confirmation of these things bring in
 mention of the Wald of Kent: but this may suffice for the vse of the
 word Wald, which now differeth much from Wold. For as that signifieth
 a woodie soile, so this betokeneth a soile without wood, or plaine
 champaine countrie, without anie store of trees, as may be seene in
 Cotswold, Porkewold, &c. Beside this I could saie more of our
 forrests, and the aforesaid inclosures also, & therein to prooue by
 the booke of forrest law, that the whole countie of Lancaster hath
 likewise beene forrest heretofore. Also how William the Bastard made a
 law, that whosoeuer did take anie wild beast within the kings forrest
 should lose an eare; as Henrie the first did punish them either by
 life or lim: which ordinance was confirmed by Henrie the second and
 his peeres at Woodstocke, wherevpon great trouble insued vnder king
 Iohn and Henrie the third, as appeareth by the chronicles: but it
 shall suffice to haue said so much as is set downe alreadie.

 Howbeit, that I may restore one antiquitie to light, which hath
 hitherto lien as it were raked vp in the embers of obliuion, I will
 giue out those laws that Canutus made for his forrest: whereby manie
 things shall be disclosed concerning the same (wherof peraduenture
 some lawiers haue no knowledge) and diuerse other notes gathered
 touching the ancient estate of the realme not to be found in other.
 But before I deale with the great charter (which as you may perceiue,
 is in manie places vnperfect by reason of corruption, and want also of
 congruitie, crept in by length of time, not by me to be restored) I
 will note another breefe law, which he made in the first yeare of his
 reigne at Winchester, afterward inserted into these his later
 constitutions, canon 32, & beginneth thus in his owne Saxon tong; "Ic
 will that elc one," &c: I will and grant that ech one shall be worthie
 of such venerie as he by hunting can take either in the plaines or in
 the woods, within his owne fee or dominion; but ech man shall abstaine
 from my venerie in euerie place, where I will that my beasts shall
 haue firme peace and quietnesse, vpon paine to forfet so much as a man
 may forfet. Hitherto the statute made by the aforesaid Canutus, which
 was afterward confirmed by king Edward surnamed the Confessor; &
 ratified by the Bastard in the fourth yeare of his reigne. Now
 followeth the great charter it selfe in such rude order and Latine as
 I find it word for word, and which I would gladlie haue turned into
 English, if it might haue sounded to anie benefit of the vnskilfull
 and vnlearned.

 OF GARDENS AND ORCHARDS.

 CHAP. XX.


 After such time as Calis was woone from the French, and that our
 countriemen had learned to trade into diuerse countries (wherby they
 grew rich) they began to wax idle also, and therevpon not onlie left
 off their former painfulnesse and frugalitie, but in like sort gaue
 themselues to liue in excesse and vanitie, whereby manie goodlie
 commodities failed, and in short time were not to be had amongst vs.
 Such strangers also as dwelled here with vs, perceiuing our
 sluggishnesse, and espieng that this idlenesse of ours might redound
 to their great profit, foorthwith imploied their endeuours to bring in
 the supplie of such things as we lacked, continuallie from forren
 countries; which yet more augmented our idlenes. For hauing all things
 at reasonable prices as we supposed, by such means from them, we
 thought it meere madnesse to spend either time or cost about the same
 here at home. And thus we became enimies to our owne welfare, as men
 that in those daies reposed our felicitie in following the wars,
 wherewith we were often exercised both at home and other places.
 Besides this, the naturall desire that mankind hath to esteeme of
 things farre sought, bicause they be rare and costlie, and the
 irkesome contempt of things neere hand, for that they are common and
 plentifull, hath borne no small swaie also in this behalfe amongst vs.
 For hereby we haue neglected our owne good gifts of God, growing here
 at home as vile and of no valure, and had euerie trifle and toie in
 admiration that is brought hither from far countries, ascribing I wot
 not what great forces and solemne estimation vnto them, vntill they
 also haue waxen old, after which they haue beene so little regarded,
 if not more despised amongst vs than our owne. Examples hereof I could
 set downe manie, & in manie things, but sith my purpose is to deale at
 this time with gardens and orchards, it shall suffice that I touch
 them onelie, and shew our inconstancie in the same, so farre as shall
 seeme & be conuenient for my turne. I comprehend therefore vnder the
 word garden, all such grounds as are wrought with the spade by mans
 hand, for so the case requireth. Of wine I haue written alreadie
 elsewhere sufficientlie, which commoditie (as I haue learned further
 since the penning of that booke) hath beene verie plentifull in this
 Iland, not onlie in the time of the Romans, but also since the
 conquest, as I haue seene by record: yet at this present haue we none
 at all or else verie little to speake of growing in this Iland: which
 I impute not vnto the soile, but the negligence of my countrimen. Such
 herbes, fruits, and roots also as grow yeerelie out of the ground, of
 seed, haue beene verie plentifull in this land, in the time of the
 first Edward, and after his daies: but in processe of time they grew
 also to be neglected, so that from Henrie the fourth till the latter
 end of Henrie the seuenth, & beginning of Henrie the eight, there was
 litle or no vse of them in England, but they remained either vnknowne,
 or supposed as food more meet for hogs & sauage beasts to feed vpon
 than mankind. Whereas in my time their vse is not onelie resumed among
 the poore commons, I meane of melons, pompions, gourds, cucumbers,
 radishes, skirets, parsneps, carrets, cabbages, nauewes, turneps, and
 all kinds of salad herbes, but also fed vpon as deintie dishes at the
 tables of delicate merchants, gentlemen, and the nobilitie, who make
 their prouision yearelie for new seeds out of strange countries, from
 whence they haue them aboundantlie. Neither doo they now staie with
 such of these fruits as are wholesome in their kinds, but aduenture
 further vpon such as are verie dangerous and hurtfull, as the
 verangenes, mushroms, &c: as if nature had ordeined all for the
 bellie, or that all things were to be eaten, for whose mischiefous
 operation the Lord in some measure hath giuen and prouided a remedie.

 Hops in time past were plentifull in this land, afterwards also their
 maintenance did cease, and now being reuiued, where are anie better to
 be found? where anie greater commoditie to be raised by them? onelie
 poles are accounted to be their greatest charge. But sith men haue
 learned of late to sow ashen keies in ashyards by themselues, that
 inconuenience in short time will be redressed. Madder hath growne
 abundantlie in this Iland, but of long time neglected, and now a
 little reuiued, and offereth it selfe to prooue no small benefit vnto
 our countrie, as manie other things else, which are now fetched from
 vs; as we before time when we gaue ourselues to idlenesse, were glad
 to haue them other. If you looke into our gardens annexed to our
 houses, how woonderfullie is their beautie increased, not onelie with
 floures, which Colmella calleth _Terrena sydera_, saieng:

   "Pingit & in varios terrestria sydera flores,"

 and varietie of curious and costlie workmanship, but also with rare
 and medicinable hearbes sought vp in the land within these fortie
 yeares: so that in comparison of this present, the ancient gardens
 were but dunghils and laistowes to such as did possesse them. How art
 also helpeth nature in the dailie colouring, dubling and inlarging the
 proportion of our floures, it is incredible to report: for so curious
 and cunning are our gardeners now in these daies, that they presume to
 doo in maner what they list with nature, and moderate hir course in
 things as if they were hir superiours. It is a world also to see, how
 manie strange hearbs, plants, and annuall fruits, are dailie brought
 vnto vs from the Indies, Americans, Taprobane, Canarie Iles, and all
 parts of the world: the which albeit that in respect of the
 constitutions of our bodies they doo not grow for vs, bicause that God
 hath bestowed sufficient commodities vpon euerie countrie for hir owne
 necessitie; yet for delectation sake vnto the eie, and their
 odoriferous sauours vnto the nose, they are to be cherished, and God
 to be glorified also in them, bicause they are his good gifts, and
 created to doo man helpe and seruice. There is not almost one noble
 man, gentleman, or merchant, that hath not great store of these
 floures, which now also doo begin to wax so well acquainted with our
 soiles, that we may almost accompt of them as parcell of our owne
 commodities. They haue no lesse regard in like sort to cherish
 medicinable hearbs fetched out of other regions neerer hand: insomuch
 that I haue seene in some one garden to the number of three hundred or
 foure hundred of them, if not more; of the halfe of whose names within
 fortie yeeres passed we had no maner knowledge. But herein I find some
 cause of iust complaint, for that we extoll their vses so farre that
 we fall into contempt of our owne, which are in truth more beneficiall
 and apt for vs than such as grow elsewhere, sith (as I said before)
 euerie region hath abundantlie within hir owne limits whatsoeuer is
 needfull and most conuenient for them that dwell therein. How doo men
 extoll the vse of Tabacco in my time, whereas in truth (whether the
 cause be in the repugnancie of our constitution vnto the operation
 thereof, or that the ground dooth alter hir force, I cannot tell) it
 is not found of so great efficacie as they write. And beside this, our
 common germander or thistle benet is found & knowne to bee so
 wholesome and of so great power in medicine, as anie other hearbe, if
 they be vsed accordinglie. I could exemplifie after the like maner in
 sundrie other, as the Salsa parilla, Mochoacan, &c: but I forbeare so
 to doo, because I couet to be breefe. And trulie the estimation and
 credit that we yeeld and giue vnto compound medicines made with forren
 drugs, is one great cause wherefore the full knowledge and vse of our
 owne simples hath bene so long raked vp in the imbers. And as this may
 be verified, so to be one sound conclusion, for the greater number of
 simples that go vnto anie compound medicine, the greater confusion is
 found therein, because the qualities and operations of verie few of
 the particulars are throughlie knowne. And euen so our continuall
 desire of strange drugs, whereby the physician and apothecarie onlie
 hath the benefit, is no small cause that the vse of our simples here
 at home dooth go to losse, and that we tread those herbes vnder our
 feet, whose forces if we knew, & could applie them to our necessities,
 we wold honor & haue in reuerence as to their case behooueth. Alas
 what haue we to doo with such Arabian & Grecian stuffe as is dailie
 brought from those parties, which lie in another clime? And therefore
 the bodies of such as dwell there, are of another constitution, than
 ours are here at home. Certes they grow not for vs, but for the
 Arabians and Grecians. And albeit that they maie by skill be applied
 vnto our benefit, yet to be more skilfull in them than in our owne, is
 follie; and to vse forren wares when our owne maie serue the turne is
 more follie; but to despise our owne and magnifie aboue measure the
 vse of them that are sought and brought from farre, is most follie of
 all: for it sauoureth of ignorance, or at the leastwise of negligence,
 and therefore woorthie of reproch.

 Among the Indians, who haue the most present cures for euerie disease,
 of their owne nation, there is small regard of compound medicins, &
 lesse of forren drugs, because they neither know them nor can vse
 them, but worke woonders euen with their owne simples. With them also
 the difference of the clime dooth shew hir full effect. For whereas
 they will heale one another in short time with application of one
 simple, &c: if a Spaniard or English man stand in need of their helpe,
 they are driuen to haue a longer space in their cures, and now and
 then also to vse some addition of two or three simples at the most,
 whose forces vnto them are throughlie knowne, because their exercise
 is onelie in their owne, as men that neuer sought or heard what vertue
 was in those that came from other countries. And euen so did Marcus
 Cato the learned Roman indeuor to deale in his cures of sundrie
 diseases, wherein he not onelie vsed such simples as were to be had in
 his owne countrie, but also examined and learned the forces of each of
 them, wherewith he dealt so diligentlie, that in all his life time, he
 could atteine to the exact knowledge but of a few, and thereto wrote
 of those most learnedlie, as would easilie be seene, if those his
 bookes were extant. For the space also of 600 yeeres, the colewort
 onelie was a medicine in Rome for all diseases, so that his vertues
 were thoroughlie knowne in those parts.

 In Plinies time the like affection to forren drugs did rage among the
 Romans, whereby their owne did grow in contempt. Crieng out therefore
 of this extreame follie, lib. 22. cap. 24, he speaketh after this
 maner: "Non placent remedia tam longe nascentia, non enim nobis
 gignuntur, immo ne illis quidem, alioquin non venderent; si placet
 etiam superstitionis gratia emantur, quoniam supplicamus, &c. Salutem
 quidem sine his posse constare, vel ob id probabimus, vt tanto magis
 sui tandem pudeat." For my part I doubt not, if the vse of outlandish
 drugs had not blinded our physicians of England in times passed, but
 that the vertues of our simples here at home would haue beene far
 better knowne, and so well vnto vs, as those of India are to the
 practisioners of those partes, and therevnto be found more profitable
 for vs than the forren either are or maie be. This also will I ad,
 that euen those which are most common by reason of their plentie, and
 most vile bicause of their abundance, are not without some vniuersall
 and especiall efficacie, if it were knowne, for our benefit: sith God
 in nature hath so disposed his creatures, that the most needfull are
 the most plentifull, and seruing for such generall diseases as our
 constitution most commonlie is affected withall. Great thanks
 therefore be giuen vnto the physicians of our age and countrie, who
 not onelie indeuour to search out the vse of such simples as our soile
 dooth yeeld and bring foorth, but also to procure such as grow
 elsewhere, vp[=o] purpose so to acquaint them with our clime, that
 they in time through some alteration receiued from the nature of the
 earth, maie likewise turne to our benefit and commoditie, and be vsed
 as our owne.

 The chiefe workeman, or as I maie call him the founder of this deuise,
 is Carolus Clusius, the noble herbarist, whose industrie hath
 woonderfullie stirred them vp vnto this good act. For albeit that
 Matthiolus, Rembert, Lobell, and other haue trauelled verie farre in
 this behalfe, yet none hath come neere to Clusius, much lesse gone
 further in the finding and true descriptions of such herbes as of late
 are brought to light. I doubt not but if this man were in England but
 one seuen yeeres, he would reueale a number of herbes growing with vs,
 whereof neither our physicians nor apothecaries as yet haue anie
 knowledge. And euen like thankes be giuen vnto our nobilitie,
 gentlemen, and others, for their continuall nutriture and cherishing
 of such homeborne and forren simples in their gardens, for hereby they
 shall not onlie be had at hand and preserued, but also their formes
 made more familiar to be discerned, and their forces better knowne
 than hitherto they haue beene.

 And euen as it fareth with our gardens, so dooth it with our orchards,
 which were neuer furnished with so good fruit, nor with such varietie
 as at this present. For beside that we haue most delicate apples,
 plummes, peares, walnuts, filberds, &c: and those of sundrie sorts,
 planted within fortie yeeres passed, in comparison of which most of
 the old trees are nothing woorth: so haue we no lesse store of strange
 fruit, as abricotes, almonds, peaches, figges, corne-trees in noble
 mens orchards. I haue seene capers, orenges, and lemmons, and heard of
 wild oliues growing here, beside other strange trees, brought from
 far, whose names I know not. So that England for these commodities was
 neuer better furnished, neither anie nation vnder their clime more
 plentifullie indued with these and other blessings from the most high
 God, who grant vs grace withall to vse the same to his honour and
 glorie! and not as instruments and prouocations vnto further excesse
 and vanitie, wherewith his displeasure may be kindled, least these his
 benefits doo turne vnto thornes and briers vnto vs for our annoiance
 and punishment, which he hath bestowed vpon vs for our consolation and
 comfort.

 We haue in like sort such workemen as are not onelie excellent in
 graffing the naturall fruits, but also in their artificiall mixtures,
 whereby one tree bringeth foorth sundrie fruits, and one and the same
 fruit of diuers colours and tasts, dallieng as it were with nature and
 hir course, as if hir whole trade were perfectlie knowne vnto them: of
 hard fruits they will make tender, of sowre sweet, of sweet yet more
 delicate, beereuing also some of their kernels, other of their cores,
 and finallie induing them with the sauour of muske, ambre, or sweet
 spices at their pleasures. Diuerse also haue written at large of these
 seuerall practises, and some of them how to conuert the kernels of
 peaches into almonds, of small fruit to make farre greater, and to
 remooue or ad superfluous or necessarie moisture to the trees, with
 other things belonging to their preseruation, and with no lesse
 diligence than our physicians doo commonlie shew vpon our owne
 diseased bodies, which to me dooth seeme right strange. And euen so
 doo our gardeners with their herbes, whereby they are strengthened
 against noisome blasts, and preserued from putrifaction and
 hinderance, whereby some such as were annuall, are now made
 perpetuall, being yeerelie taken vp, and either reserued in the house,
 or hauing the rosse pulled from their rootes, laid againe into the
 earth, where they remaine in safetie. What choise they make also in
 their waters, and wherewith some of them doo now and then keepe them
 moist, it is a world to see; insomuch that the apothecaries shops maie
 seeme to be needfull also to our gardens and orchards, and that in
 sundrie wise: naie the kitchin it selfe is so farre from being able to
 be missed among them, that euen the verie dishwater is not without
 some vse amongest our finest plants. Whereby and sundrie other
 circumstances not here to bee remembred, I am persuaded, that albeit
 the gardens of the Hesperides were in times past so greatlie accounted
 of because of their delicacie: yet if it were possible to haue such an
 equall iudge, as by certeine knowledge of both were able to pronounce
 vpon them, I doubt not but he would giue the price vnto the gardens of
 our daies, and generallie ouer all Europe, in comparison of those
 times, wherein the old exceeded. Plinie and other speake of a rose
 that had three score leaues growing vpon one button: but if I should
 tell of one which bare a triple number vnto that proportion, I know I
 shall not be beleeued, and no great matter though I were not, howbeit
 such a one was to be seene in Antwarpe 1585, as I haue heard, and I
 know who might haue had a slip or stallon thereof, if he would haue
 ventured ten pounds vpon the growth of the same, which should haue
 bene but a tickle hazard, and therefore better vndoone, as I did
 alwaies imagine. For mine owne part, good reader, let me boast a litle
 of my garden, which is but small, and the whole Area thereof little
 aboue 300 foot of ground, and yet, such hath beene my good lucke in
 purchase of the varietie of simples, that notwithstanding my small
 abilitie, there are verie neere three hundred of one sort and other
 conteined therein, no one of them being common or vsuallie to bee had.
 If therefore my little plot, void of all cost in keeping be so well
 furnished, what shall we thinke of those of Hampton court, Nonesuch,
 Tibaults, Cobham garden, and sundrie other apperteining to diuerse
 citizens of London, whom I could particularlie name, if I should not
 seeme to offend them by such my demeanour and dealing?




 OF WATERS GENERALLIE.

 CHAP. XXI.


 There is no one commoditie in England, whereof I can make lesse report
 than of our waters. For albeit our soile abound with water in all
 places, and that in the most ample maner: yet can I not find by some
 experience that almost anie one of our riuers hath such od and rare
 qualities as diuers of the maine are said to be indued withall.
 Virtruuius writeth of a well in Paphlagonia, whose water seemeth as it
 were mixed with wine, & addeth thereto that diuerse become drunke by
 superfluous taking of the same. The like force is found _In amne
 Licesio_, a riuer of Thracia, vpon whose bankes a man shall hardlie
 misse to find some traueller or other sleeping for drunkennesse, by
 drinking of that liquor. Neere also vnto Ephesus are certeine welles,
 which taste like sharpe vineger, and therefore are much esteemed of by
 such as are sicke and euill at ease in those parts. At Hieropolis is a
 spring of such force (as Strabo saith) that the water thereof mixed
 with certaine herbes of choise, dooth colour wooll with such a glosse,
 that the die thereof contendeth with scarlet, murreie, and purple, and
 oft ouercommeth the same. The Cydnus in Tarsus of Cilicia, is of such
 vertue, that who so batheth himselfe therein, shall find great ease of
 the gowt that runneth ouer all his ioints. In one of the fortunate
 Iles (saith Pomponius the Cosmographer) are two springs, one of the
 which bringeth immoderate laughter to him that drinketh thereof, the
 other sadnesse and restraint of that effect, whereby the last is taken
 to be a souereigne medicine against the other, to the great admiration
 of such as haue beholden it. At Susis in Persia there is a spring,
 which maketh him that drinketh downe anie of the water, to cast all
 his teeth: but if he onlie wash his mouth withall, it maketh them
 fast, & his mouth to be verie healthfull. So there is a riuer among
 the Gadarens, wherof if a beast drinke, he foorthwith casteth hoofe,
 haire, and hornes, if he haue anie. Also a lake in Assyria, neere vnto
 the which there is a kind of glewie matter to be found, which holdeth
 such birds as by hap doo light thereon so fast as birdlime, by means
 wherof verie manie doo perish and are taken that light vpon the same:
 howbeit if anie portion hereof happen to be set on fire by casualtie
 or otherwise, it will neuer be quenched but by casting on of dust, as
 Caietanus dooth report. Another at Halicarnassus called Salmacis,
 which is noted to make such men effeminate as drinke of the water of
 the same. Certes it maie be (saith Strabo) that the water and aire of
 a region maie qualifie the courage of some men, but none can make them
 effeminate, nor anie other thing because of such corruption in them,
 sooner than superfluous wealth, and inconstancie of liuing and
 behauiour, which is a bane vnto all nature, lib. 4. All which, with
 manie other not now comming to memorie, as the Letheus, Styx,
 Phlegeton, Cocitus, &c: haue strange & incredible reports made of them
 by the new and ancient writers, the like wherof are not to be found in
 England, which I impute wholie to the blessing of God, who hath
 ordeined nothing amongst vs in this our temperate region, but that
 which is good, wholesome, and most commodious for our nation. We haue
 therefore no hurtfull waters amongst vs, but all wholesome and
 profitable for the benefit of the people. Neuertheles as none of them
 is to be found without hir fish: so we know by experience, that
 diuerse turne ash, some other elme, and oken stakes or poles that lie
 or are throwne into them into hard stone, in long continuance of time,
 which is the strangest thing that I can learne at this present
 wherevpon to rest for a certentie. Yet I read of diuerse welles,
 wherevnto our old writers ascribe either wonderfull vertues, or rare
 courses, as of one vpon the shore, beyond the which the sea floweth
 euerie daie twise a large mile and more; and yet is the surge of that
 water alwaies seuen foot from the salt sea: whereby it should seeme
 that the head of the spring is mooueable. But alas I doo not easilie
 beleeue it, more than that which is written of the Lilingwan lake in
 Wales, which is neere to the Seuerne, and receiueth the flowing sea
 into hir chanell as it were a gulfe, and yet is neuer full: but when
 the sea goeth awaie by reason of the ebbe, it casteth vp the water
 with such violence, that hir banks are ouerflowne and drowned, which
 is an absurd report. They ad also, that if all the people of the
 countrie stood neere to the same, with their faces toward the lake, in
 such maner that the dashing of the water might touch and wet their
 clothes, they should haue no power to go from thence, but mawgre their
 resistance be drawne into that gulfe and perish; whereas if they
 turned their backs vnto the same, they should suffer no such
 inconuenience though they stood neuer so neere. Manie other such like
 toies I could set downe of other welles and waters of our countrie.
 But whie should I write that for other men to read, whereto I giue no
 credit my selfe, more than to the report which Iohannes du Choul dooth
 make in his description of Pilots lake, "In monte Pilati in Gallia,"
 or Boccatius of the Scaphigiolo in the Appenine hils, or F[oe]lix
 Malliolus of Pilats lake "In monte fracto" (where Iacobus de Voragino
 bishop of Gene, & Ioachimus Vadianus in Pompon. Melam doo also make
 mention) sith I take them but for fables, & far vnworthie that anie
 good man should staine his paper with such friuolous matters as are
 reported of them, being deuised at the first by Satanas the father of
 lies, for the holding of the ignorant & credulous in their
 superstitions and errors. Such also is the tale that goeth of
 Wenefrids well, & nothing inferior to that of Mercurie neere to port
 Caperia in Rome, wherein such as went by would dip branches of baie,
 and sprinkle the same vpon themselues: and so manie as stood about
 them, calling vpon Mercurie, and crauing pardon for their sinnes, as
 if that ceremonie had bene of force vnto forgiuenesse and remission of
 their trespasses. And so it appeareth partlie by Cicero, who (being a
 man neither thinking well of their owne gods nor liking of the
 augures) dooth write in his first De legibus (except my memorie faile
 me) "aspersione aquae labem tolli corpoream, & castimoniam corporis
 praestari," which maketh me to thinke further, that they thought it
 equall with our late holie-water, wherewith it maie be compared. I
 might further also (if I would) make relation of diuerse welles, which
 haue wrought manie miracles in time of superstition, as S. Butolphs
 well in Hadstocke, S. Germans well at Falkeburne, Holie well at S.
 Albones and London, and sundrie other in other places: but as their
 vertues are now found out to be but baits to draw men and women vnto
 them, either for gaine vnto the places where they were, or
 satisfaction of the lewd disposition of such as hunted after other
 gaine, so it shall suffice to haue touched them far off. Onlie this
 will I ad, that we haue no hurtfull waters, no not vnto our sheepe,
 though it please Cardan to auouch otherwise; for our waters are not
 the causes, but the signes of their infections when they drinke, as I
 elsewhere haue noted in the chapter of cattell, as also that we haue a
 spring neere Saffron Walden, and not farre from the house of the lord
 Audleie, which is of such force, that it looseth the bodie of him that
 drinketh therof in verie gentle maner, and beside that is verie
 delectable & pleasant to be taken, as I haue found by experience. I
 heare also of two welles neere London, of which the one is verie
 excellent water, the other will beare no sope, and yet so situat that
 the one is hard by the other. And thus much of waters.




 OF WOODS AND MARISHES.

 CHAP. XXII.


 [Sidenote: Great abundance of wood sometime in England.]
 It should seeme by ancient records, and the testimonie of sundrie
 authors, that the whole countries of Lhoegres and Cambria, now England
 and Wales, haue sometimes beene verie well replenished with great
 woods & groues, although at this time the said commoditie be not a
 little decaied in both, and in such wise that a man shall oft ride ten
 or twentie miles in ech of them, and find verie little or rather none
 at all, except it be neere vnto townes, gentlemens houses, & villages,
 where the inhabitants haue planted a few elmes, okes, hazels, or ashes
 about their dwellings for their defense from the rough winds, and
 keeping of the stormie weather from annoiance of the same. This
 scarsitie at the first grew (as it is thought) either by the industrie
 of man, for maintenance of tillage (as we vnderstand the like to be
 doone of late by the Spaniards in the west Indies, where they fired
 whole woods of verie great compasse therby to come by ground whereon
 to sow their graines) or else thorough the couetousnesse of such, as
 in preferring of pasture for their sheepe and greater cattell, doo
 make small account of firebote and timber: or finallie by the crueltie
 of the enimies, whereof we haue sundrie examples declared in our
 histories. Howbeit where the rocks and quarrie grounds are, I take the
 swart of the earth to be so thin, that no tree of anie greatnesse,
 other than shrubs and bushes, is able to grow or prosper long therein
 for want of sufficient moisture wherewith to feed them with fresh
 humour, or at the leastwise of mould, to shrowd, staie vpright, and
 cherish the same in the blustering winters weather, till they may grow
 vnto anie greatnesse, and spread or yeeld their rootes downe right
 into the soile about them: and this either is or may be one other
 cause, wherefore some places are naturallie void of wood. But to
 proceed. Although I must needs confesse that there is good store of
 great wood or timber here and there, euen now in some places of
 England, yet in our daies it is far vnlike to that plentie, which our
 ancestors haue seene heretofore, when statelie building was lesse in
 vse. For albeit that there were then greater number of mesuages and
 mansions almost in euerie place; yet were their frames so slight and
 slender, that one meane dwelling house in our time is able to
 counteruaile verie manie of them, if you consider the present charge
 with the plentie of timber that we bestow vpon them. In times past men
 were contented to dwell in houses, builded of sallow, willow,
 plumtree, hardbeame, and elme, so that the vse of oke was in maner
 dedicated wholie vnto churches, religious houses, princes palaces,
 noblemens lodgings, & nauigation: but now all these are reiected, and
 [Sidenote: Desire of much wealth and ease abateth manhood,
 & ouerthroweth a manlie courage.]
 nothing but oke anie whit regarded. And yet see the change, for when
 our houses were builded of willow, then had we oken men; but now that
 our houses are come to be made of oke, our men are not onlie become
 willow, but a great manie through Persian delicacie crept in among vs
 altogither of straw, which is a sore alteration. In those the courage
 of the owner was a sufficient defense to keepe the house in safetie,
 but now the assurance of the timber, double doores, lockes and bolts
 must defend the man from robbing. Now haue we manie chimnies and yet
 our tenderlings complaine of rheumes, catarhs and poses. Then had we
 none but reredosses, and our heads did neuer ake. For as the smoke in
 those daies was supposed to be a sufficient hardning for the timber of
 the house; so it was reputed a far better medicine to keepe the good
 man and his familie from the quacke or pose, wherewith as then verie
 few were oft acquainted.

 Of the curiousnesse of these piles I speake not, sith our workemen are
 growne generallie to such an excellencie of deuise in the frames now
 made, that they farre passe the finest of the old. And such is their
 husbandrie in dealing with their timber, that the same stuffe which in
 time past was reiected as crooked, vnprofitable, and to no vse but the
 fire, dooth now come in the fronts and best part of the worke. Wherby
 the common saieng is likewise in these daies verified in our mansion
 houses, which earst was said onelie of the timber for ships, that no
 oke can grow so crooked but it falleth out to some vse, & that
 necessarie in the nauie. It is a world to see moreouer how diuerse men
 being bent to building, and hauing a delectable veine in spending of
 their goods by that trade, doo dailie imagine new deuises of their
 owne to guide their workemen withall, and those more curious and
 excellent alwaies than the former. In the proceeding also of their
 workes, how they set vp, how they pull downe, how they inlarge, how
 they restreine, how they ad to, how they take from, whereby their
 heads are neuer idle, their purses neuer shut, nor their bookes of
 account neuer made perfect.

   "Destruunt, aedificant, mutant quadrata rotundis"

 saith the poet. So that if a man should well consider of all the od
 crotchets in such a builders braine, he would thinke his head to haue
 euen inough of those affaires onelie, & therefore iudge that he should
 not well be able to deale in anie other. But such commonlie are our
 workemasters, that they haue beside this veine afore mentioned, either
 great charge of merchandizes, little lesse businesse in the
 commonwealth, or finallie no small dealings otherwise incident vnto
 them, wherby gaine ariseth, and some trouble oft among withall. Which
 causeth me to wonder not a little how they can plaie the parts so well
 of so manie sundrie men, whereas diuerse other of greater forecast in
 apparance can seldome shift well or thriue in anie one of them. But to
 our purpose.

 We haue manie woods, forrests, and parks, which cherish trees
 abundantlie, although in the woodland countries there is almost no
 hedge that hath not some store of the greatest sort, beside infinit
 numbers of hedgerowes, groues, and springs, that are mainteined of
 purpose for the building and prouision of such owners as doo possesse
 the same. Howbeit as euerie soile dooth not beare all kinds of wood,
 so there is not anie wood, parke, hedgerow, groue, or forrest, that is
 not mixed with diuerse, as oke, ash, hasell, hawthorne, birch, beech,
 hardbeame, hull, sorfe, quicken aspe, poplers, wild cherie, and such
 like, wherof oke hath alwaies the preheminence, as most meet for
 building and the nauie, whervnto it is reserued. This tree bringeth
 foorth also a profitable kind of mast, whereby such as dwell neere
 vnto the aforesaid places doo cherish and bring vp innumerable heards
 of swine. In time of plentie of this mast, our red and fallow deere
 will not let to participat thereof with our hogs, more than our nete:
 yea our common pultrie also if they may come vnto them. But as this
 [Sidenote: The like haue I seene where hens doo feed
 vpon the tender blades of garlike.]
 abundance dooth prooue verie pernicious vnto the first, so these egs
 which these latter doo bring foorth (beside blackenesse in color and
 bitternesse of tast) haue not seldome beene found to breed diuerse
 diseases vnto such persons as haue eaten of the same. I might ad in
 like sort the profit insuing by the barke of this wood, whereof our
 tanners haue great vse in dressing of leather, and which they buie
 yearelie in Maie by the fadame, as I haue oft seene: but it shall not
 need at this time to enter into anie such discourse, onlie this I
 wish, that our sole and vpper leathering may haue their due time, and
 not be hasted on by extraordinarie slights, as with ash, barke, &c.
 Whereby as I grant that it seemeth outwardlie to be verie thicke &
 well doone: so if you respect the sadnes thereof, it dooth prooue in
 the end to be verie hollow & not able to hold out water. Neuerthelesse
 we haue good lawes for redresse of this enormitie, but it c[=o]meth to
 passe in these as in the execution of most penall statutes. For the
 gaines to be gotten by the same being giuen to one or two hungrie and
 vnthriftie persons, they make a shew of great reformation at the
 first, & for a litle while, till they find that following of sute in
 law against the offendors is somwhat too chargeable and tedious. This
 therefore perceiued, they giue ouer the law, and fall to the admission
 of gifts and rewards to winke at things past, and when they haue once
 gone ouer their ground with this kind of tillage, then doo they tender
 licences, and offer large dispensations vnto him that shall aske the
 same, thereby to doo what him listeth in his trade for an yearelie
 pension, whereby the bribour now groweth to some certeine reuenues, &
 the tanner to so great libertie that his lether is much worse than
 before. But is not this a mockerie of our lawes, & manifest illusion
 of the good subiect whom they thus pill & poll? Of all oke growing in
 England the parke oke is the softest, and far more spalt and brickle
 than the hedge oke. And of all in Essex, that growing in Bardfield
 parke is the finest for ioiners craft: for oftentimes haue I seene of
 their workes made of that oke so fine and faire, as most of the
 wainescot that is brought hither out of Danske, for our wainescot is
 not made in England. Yet diuerse haue assaied to deale without okes to
 that end, but not with so good successe as they haue hoped, bicause
 the ab or iuice will not so soone be remoued and cleane drawne out,
 which some attribute to want of time in the salt water. Neuerthelesse
 in building, so well the hedge as the parke oke go all one waie, and
 neuer so much hath beene spent in a hundred years before, as is in ten
 yeare of our time; for euerie man almost is a builder, and he that
 hath bought any small parcell of ground, be it neuer so little, will
 not be quiet till he haue pulled downe the old house (if anie were
 there standing) and set vp a new after his owne deuise. But wherevnto
 will this curiositie come?

 Of elme we haue great store in euerie high waie and elsewhere, yet
 haue I not seene thereof anie togither in woods or forrests, but where
 they haue beene first planted and then suffered to spread at their
 owne willes. Yet haue I knowen great woods of beech and hasell in
 manie places, especiallie in Barkeshire, Oxfordshire, and
 Buckinghamshire, where they are greatlie cherished, & conuerted to
 sundrie vses by such as dwell about them. Of all the elms that euer I
 saw, those in the south side of Douer court, in Essex neere Harwich
 are the most notable, for they grow (I meane) in crooked maner, that
 they are almost apt for nothing else but nauie timber, great
 ordinance, and beetels: and such thereto is their naturall qualitie,
 that being vsed in the said behalfe, they continue longer, and more
 long than anie the like trees in whatsoeuer parcell else of this land,
 without cuphar, shaking, or cleauing, as I find.

 Ash commeth vp euerie where of it selfe, and with euerie kind of wood.
 And as we haue verie great plentie and no lesse vse of these in our
 husbandrie, so are we not without the plane, the vgh, the sorfe, the
 chestnut, the line, the blacke cherrie, and such like. And although
 that we inioy them not in so great plentie now in most places, as in
 times past, or the other afore remembred: yet haue we sufficient of
 them all for our necessarie turnes and vses, especiallie of vgh; as
 may be seene betwixt Rotheram and Sheffield, and some steeds of Kent
 also, as I haue beene informed.

 The firre, frankincense, and pine, we doo not altogither want,
 especiallie the firre, whereof we haue some store in Chatleie moore in
 Darbishire, Shropshire, Andernesse, and a mosse neere Manchester, not
 far from Leircesters house: although that in time past not onelie all
 Lancastershire, but a great part of the coast betweene Chester and the
 Solme were well stored. As for the frankincense and pine, they haue
 beene planted onelie in colleges and cloisters, by the cleargie and
 religious heretofore. Wherefore (in mine opinion) we may rather saie
 that we want them altogither: for except they grew naturallie, and not
 by force, I see no cause whie they should be accounted for parcell of
 our commodities. We haue also the aspe, whereof our fletchers make
 their arrowes. The seuerall kinds of poplars of our turners haue great
 vse for bolles, treies, troughs, dishes, &c. Also the alder, whose
 barke is not vnprofitable to die blacke withall, and therfore much
 vsed by our countrie wiues in colouring their knit hosen. I might here
 take occasion to speake of the great sales yeerelie made of wood,
 whereby an infinit quantitie hath bin destroied within these few
 yeers: but I giue ouer to trauell in this behalfe. Howbeit thus much I
 dare affirme, that if woods go so fast to decaie in the next hundred
 yeere of Grace, as they haue doone and are like to doo in this,
 sometimes for increase of sheepwalks, and some maintenance of
 prodigalitie and pompe (for I haue knowne a well burnished gentleman
 [Sidenote: * This gentleman caught such an heate with this sore
 loade that he was faine to go to Rome for physicke, yet it
 could not saue his life, but hee must needs die homewards.]
 [*] that hath borne threescore at once in one paire of galigascons to
 shew his strength and brauerie) it is to be feared that the fennie
 bote, broome, turffe, gall, heath, firze, brakes, whinnes, ling, dies,
 hassacks, flags, straw, sedge, reed, rush, and also seacole will be
 good merchandize euen in the citie of London, wherevnto some of them
 euen now haue gotten readie passage, and taken vp their innes in the
 greatest merchants parlours. A man would thinke that our laws were
 able inough to make sufficient prouision for the redresse of this
 error & enormitie likelie to insue. But such is the nature of our
 countriemen, that as manie laws are made, so they will keepe none; or
 if they be vrged to make answer, they will rather seeke some crooked
 construction of them to the increase of their priuat gaine, than yeeld
 themselues to be guided by the same for a commonwealth and profit to
 their countrie. So that in the end whatsoeuer the law saith we will
 haue our willes, whereby the wholesome ordinances of the prince are
 contemned, the trauell of the nobilitie & councellors as it were
 derided, the common wealth impouerished, & a few onelie inriched by
 this peruerse dealing. Thus manie thousand persons doo suffer
 hinderance by this their lewd behauiour. Hereby the wholesome laws of
 the prince are oft defrauded, and the good meaning magistrate in
 consultation about the common wealth vtterlie neglected. I would wish
 that I might liue no longer than to see foure things in this land
 reformed, that is: the want of discipline in the church: the couetous
 dealing of most of our merchants in the preferment of the commodities
 of other countries, and hinderance of their owne: the holding of
 faires and markets vpon the sundaie to be abolished and referred to
 the wednesdaies: and that euerie man, in whatsoeuer part of the
 champaine soile enioieth fortie acres of land, and vpwards, after that
 rate, either by free deed, copie hold, or fee farme, might plant one
 acre of wood, or sowe the same with oke mast, hasell, beech, and
 sufficient prouision be made that it may be cherished and kept. But I
 feare me that I should then liue too long, and so long, that I should
 either be wearie of the world, or the world of me; and yet they are
 not such things but they may easilie be brought to passe.

 Certes euerie small occasion in my time is enough to cut downe a great
 wood, and euerie trifle sufficeth to laie infinit acres of corne
 ground vnto pasture. As for the taking downe of houses, a small fine
 will beare out a great manie. Would to God we might once take example
 of the Romans, who in restreint of superfluous grasing, made an exact
 limitation, how manie head of cattell ech estate might keepe, and what
 numbers of acres should suffice for that and other purposes. Neither
 was wood euer better cherished or mansion houses mainteined, than by
 their lawes and statutes. Such also was their care in the maintenance
 of nauigation, that it was a great part of the charge of their
 consuls, yeerelie to view and looke vnto the hilles whereon great
 timber did grow, least their vnnecessarie faults for the satisfaction
 of the priuat owner, and his couetous mind might prooue a preiudice
 vnto the common wealth, in the hinderance of sufficient stuffe for the
 furniture of their nauie. Certes the like hereof is yet obserued in
 Venice. Read also I praie you what Suetonius writeth of the consulship
 of Bibulus and Cesar. As for the wood that Ancus Martius dedicated
 toward the maintenance of the common nauie, I passe it ouer, as hauing
 elsewhere remembred it vnto another end. But what doo I meane to
 speake of these, sith my purpose is onlie to talke of our owne woods?
 Well, take this then for a finall conclusion in woods, that beside
 some countries are alreadie driuen to sell their wood by the pound,
 which is an heauie report: within these fortie yeeres we shall haue
 little great timber growing aboue fortie yeeres old; for it is
 commonlie seene that those yoong staddles which we leaue standing at
 one & twentie yeeres fall, are vsuallie at the next sale cut downe
 without any danger of the statute, and serue for fire bote, if it
 please the owner to burne them.

 [Sidenote: Marises and fennes.]
 Marises and fennie bogges we haue manie in England, though not now so
 many as some of the old Roman writers doo specifie, but more in Wales,
 if you haue respect vnto the seuerall quantities of the countries.
 Howbeit as they are verie profitable in the summer halfe of the yeere,
 so are a number of them which lie lowe and neere to great riuers, to
 small commoditie in the winter part, as common experience dooth teach.
 Yet this I find of manie moores, that in times past they haue beene
 harder ground, and sundrie of them well replenished with great woods,
 that now are void of bushes. And for example hereof, we may see the
 triall (beside the roots that are dailie found in the deeps of
 Monmouth, where turfe is digged, also in Wales, Aburgauennie, and
 Merioneth) in sundrie parts of Lancashire, where great store of firre
 hath growen in times past, as I said, and the people go vnto this daie
 into their fens and marises with long spits, which they dash here and
 there vp to the verie cronge into the ground. In which practise, (a
 thing commonlie doone in winter) if they happen to smite vpon anie
 firre trees which lie there at their whole lengths, or other blocks,
 they note the place, and about haruest time, when the ground is at the
 driest, they come againe and get them vp, and afterward carieng them
 home, applie them to their vses. The like doo they in Shropshire with
 the like, which hath beene felled in old time, within 7 miles of
 Salop. Some of them foolishlie suppose the same to haue lien there
 since Noies floud: and other more fond than the rest, imagine them to
 grow euen in the places where they find them, without all
 consideration that in times past, the most part, if not all Lhoegres
 and Cambria was generallie replenished with wood, which being felled
 or ouerthrowne vpon sundrie occasions, was left lieng in some places
 still on the ground, and in processe of time became to be quite
 ouergrowne with earth and moulds, which moulds wanting their due
 sadnesse, are now turned into moorie plots. Wherby it commeth to passe
 also, that great plentie of water commeth betweene the new loose swart
 and the old hard earth, that being drawen awaie by ditching and
 draines (a thing soone doone if our countrie-men were painfull in that
 behalfe) might soone leaue a drie soile to the great lucre and
 aduantage of the owner. We find in our histories, that Lincolne was
 somtime builded by Lud brother to Cassibelan, who called it Cair
 Ludcoit, of the great store of woods that inuironed the same: but now
 the commoditie is vtterlie decaied there, so that if Lud were aliue
 againe, he would not call it his citie in the wood, but rather his
 towne in the plaines: for the wood (as I heare) is wasted altogither
 about the same. The hilles called the Peke were in like sort named
 Mennith and Orcoit, that is, the wooddie hilles and forrests. But how
 much wood is now to be seene in those places, let him that hath beene
 there testifie, if he list; for I heare of no such store there as hath
 beene in time past by those that trauell that waie. And thus much of
 woods and marises, and so far as I can deale with the same.




 OF BATHS AND HOT WELLES.

 CHAP. XXIII.


 As almightie GOD hath in most plentifull maner bestowed infinit, and
 those verie notable benefits vpon this Ile of Britaine, whereby it is
 not a little inriched: so in hot and naturall baths (whereof we haue
 diuerse in sundrie places) it manifestlie appeereth that he hath not
 forgotten England. There are sundrie baths therefore to be found in
 this realme, of which the first is called saint Vincents, the second
 Halliewell; both being places (in my opinion) more obscure than the
 other two, and yet not seldome sought vnto by such as stand in need.
 For albeit the fame of their forces be not so generallie spread, yet
 in some cases they are thought to be nothing inferior to the other, as
 diuerse haue often affirmed by their owne experience and triall. The
 third place wherein hot baths are to be found is neere vnto Buxston, a
 towne in Darbishire, situat in the high Peke, not passing sixteene
 miles from Manchester, or Markechesterford, and twentie from Darbie,
 where, about eight or nine seuerall welles are to be seene; of which
 three are counted to be most excellent: but of all, the greatest is
 the hotest, void of corruption, and compared (as Iones saith) with
 those of Summersetshire, so cold indeed, as a quart of boiling water
 would be made if fiue quartes of running water were added therevnto;
 whereas on the other side, those of Bath likened vnto these, haue such
 heat appropriated vnto them, as a gallon of hot water hath when a
 quart of cold is mixed with the same. Herevpon the effect of this bath
 worketh more temperatlie and pleasantlie (as he writeth) than the
 other. And albeit that it maketh not so great speed in cure of such as
 resort vnto it for helpe: yet it dealeth more effectuallie and
 commodiouslie than those in Summersetshire, and infer with all lesse
 greeuous accidents in the restreining of naturall issues,
 strengthening the affeebled members, assisting the liuelie forces,
 dispersing annoious oppilations, and qualifieng of sundrie griefes, as
 his experience hath oft confirmed. The like vertues haue the other
 two, but not in such measure: and therefore their operation is not so
 speedilie perceiued. The fourth place where baths are, is kings
 Newnam, and within certeine miles of Couentrie, the water wherof (as
 it is thought) proceedeth from some rocke of allume, and this I
 vnderstand by diuerse glouers which haue beene there, and also by mine
 owne experience, that it hath a tast much like to allume liquor, and
 yet nothing vnplesant nor vnsauorie in the drinking. There are three
 welles in all, but the chiefest and best of them riseth out of an
 hill, and runneth toward the south, & from thence infinit plentie of
 water without anie notable diminution of the spring is dailie caried
 into sundrie parties of the realme, & droonke by such as haue need to
 occupie the same. Of the other two, one is reserued for such as be
 comelie personages and void of lothsome diseases: the other is left
 common for tag and rag; but clensed dailie as the other is, whereby it
 becommeth the wholesomer. Manie diseases also are cured in the same,
 as the palsie, dimnesse of sight, dulnesse of hearing, but especiallie
 the collike and the stone, old sores and greene wounds; so that I
 suppose there was neuer anie compound medicine of greater and more
 speedie force in these behalfes, than the vse of this simple liquor is
 to such as doo frequent it. The said water hath a naturall propertie
 also following it which is rare, for if a leafe, or sticke of ash,
 oke, &c: doo fall into the same, within a short space, such store of
 fine sand (comming no doubt out of the earth with the water) will
 congeale and gather about it, that the forme being reserued, and the
 inner part not lightlie altered, it will seeme to become an hard
 stone, and much like vnto that which is ingendred in the kidneis of a
 man, as I haue seene by experience. At the first entrance it is verie
 cold, but after a season it warmeth the goer in, casting him into an
 indifferent heat. And this is furthermore remembred of it, that no man
 hath yet susteined anie manner of impeachment through the coldnesse of
 the same. The vertue thereof was found 1579 about Whitsuntide, by a
 man who had wounded himselfe, & comming by the same water, thought
 onelie to wash the blood from his hand therewith, and so to go home
 and seeke for helpe by surgerie: finallie finding the paine well
 asswaged, & the wound faire clensed, he departed, and misliking his
 vsuall medicins, he eftsoones came againe, and so often indeed vnto
 the said water till his hand was healed outright without anie other
 practise. By this meanes also he became a counsellor to other being
 hurt or in paine, that they should trie the vertue of this spring, who
 finding ease also, gaue out such commendation of the said water, that
 now at this present their fame is fullie equall, and the resort vnto
 them nothing inferior to that of the old baths. Beside this, the cures
 of such diseases as their forces do extend vnto, is much more speedie
 than we may haue at the other; and this is one commoditie also not
 smallie to be considered of. The fift place of baths or medicinable
 welles is at an hamlet called Newton, a little from saint Neots, or
 (as we pronounce it) saint Needs, which is ten or twelue miles from
 Cambridge, where two springs are knowne to be, of which the one is
 verie sweet and fresh, the other brackish & salt; this is good for
 scabs and leaperie (as it is said) the other for dimnesse of sight.
 Verie manie also doo make their repaire vnto them for sundrie
 diseases, some returning whole, and some nothing at all amended,
 bicause their cure is without the reach and working of those waters.
 Neuer went people so fast from the church, either vnto a faire or
 market, as they go to these wels, and those neere Rugbie, both places
 being discouered in this 1579 of Grace. I heare of another well to be
 found also about Ratcliffe neere London, euen at the same season. But
 sith rumors are now spred almost of euerie spring, & vaine tales flie
 about in maner of euerie water, I surcease to speake at all of anie
 other, till further experience doo trie whether they be medicinable or
 not: and yet I doubt not but most of these alredie mentioned haue
 heretofore bin knowne & remembred also, though confusedlie by the
 writers of old time; & yet in processe of time either neglected or
 forgotten, by meanes of sundrie troubles and turmoiles made in this
 realme by Danes, and other outward enimies, whereby their manifold
 benefit hath woonderfullie beene missed.

 The last place of our baths, is a citie in Summersetshire, which
 taketh his name of the hot waters there to be seene and vsed. At the
 first it was called Cair Bledud, and not Cair Bledune, as some would
 haue it, for that is the old name of the ancient castell at
 Malmesburie, which the Saxons named Yngleburne. Ptolomie afterward
 called it Thermae, other Aquae solis, or Scamannia, or Acmancester, but
 now it hight generallie Bath in English, and vnder that name it is
 likelie to continue. The citie of it selfe is a verie ancient thing,
 no doubt, as may yet appeare by diuerse notable antiquities ingraued
 in stone, to be seene in the wals thereof; and first of all betweene
 the south gate and the west, and betwixt the west gate and the north.

 The first is the antike head of a man, made all flat, with great locks
 of haire, much like to the coine that I haue seene of Antius the
 Romane. The second betweene the south and the north gate is an image,
 as I take it, of Hercules, for he held in each hand a serpent, and so
 dooth this. Thirdlie there standeth a man on foot with a sword in his
 one hand, and a buckler stretched out in the other. There is also a
 branch that lieth folded and wreathed into circles, like to the wreath
 of Alcimedon. There are moreouer two naked images, whereof the one
 imbraceth the other, beside sundrie antike heads, with ruffled haire,
 a greiehound running, and at his taile certeine Romane letters, but so
 defaced that no man liuing can read them at this present. There is
 moreouer the image of Lacaon, inuironed with two serpents, and an
 other inscription, and all these betweene the south and the west
 gates, as I haue said before.

 Now, betweene the west and north gate are two inscriptions, of which
 some words are euident to be read, the residue are cleane defaced.
 There is also the image of a naked man, and a stone in like sort,
 which hath "Cupidines & labruscas intercurrentes," and a table hauing
 at each hand an image vined and finelie florished both aboue and
 beneath. Finallie (sauing that I saw afterward the image of a naked
 man grasping a serpent in each hand) there was an inscription of a
 toome or buriall, wherein these words did plainelie appeare, "Vixit
 annos xxx" but so defusedlie written, that letters stood for whole
 words, and two or three letters combined into one. Certes I will not
 saie whether these were set into the places where they now stand by
 the gentiles, or brought thither from other ruines of the towne it
 selfe, and placed afterward in those wals, in their necessarie
 reparations. But howsoeuer the matter standeth, this is to be gathered
 by our histories, that Bladud first builded that citie there, and
 peraduenture might also kindle the sulphurous veines, of purpose to
 burne continuallie there in the honour of Minerua: by which occasion
 the springs thereabout did in processe of time become hot & not
 vnprofitable, for sundrie kinds of diseases. Indeed the later Pagans
 dreamed, that Minerua was the cheefe goddesse and gouernesse of these
 [Sidenote: Chap. 25.]
 waters, bicause of the neerenesse of hir temple vnto the same. Solinus
 addeth furthermore, how that in hir said temple, the fire which was
 continuallie kept, did neuer consume into dead sparkles; but so soone
 as the embers thereof were cold, they congealed into clots of hard
 stone: all which I take to be nothing else than the effect of the
 aforesaid fire, of the sulphurous veine kindled in the earth, from
 whence the waters doo come. That these baths or waters are deriued
 [Sidenote: The Pyritis is found almost in euerie veine of mettall
 in great plentie, diuersities and colour, and somtimes mixed
 with that mettall of whose excrements it consisteth.]
 from such, the marchasites, which the Grecians call Pyritis, per
 antonomasiam (for being smit with the iron, it yeeldeth more sparkes
 than anie flint or calcedonie, and therefore seemeth to deserue the
 name aboue the rest) and besides these other stones mixed with some
 copper, and dailie found vpon the mounteins thereabouts will beare
 sufficient witnesse, though I would write the contrarie. Doctor Turner
 also the father of English physicke, and an excellent diuine,
 supposeth that these springs doo draw their forces from sulphur: or if
 there be anie other thing mingled withall, he gesseth that it should
 be salt peter, bicause he found an obscure likelihood of the same,
 euen in the crosse bath. But that they participate with anie allume at
 all, he could neuer till his dieng daie be induced to beleeue. I might
 here (if I thought it necessarie) intreat of the notable situation of
 the citie, which standeth in a pleasant bottome, inuironed on euerie
 side with great hils, out of the which come so manie springs of pure
 water by sundrie waies vnto the citie, and in such abundance, as that
 euerie house is serued with the same by pipes of lead, the said
 mettall being the more plentious and lesse of value vnto them, bicause
 it is not had far off from those quarters. It should not be amisse
 also to speake of the foure gates, number of parish churches, bridges,
 religious houses dissolued, and their founders, if place did serue
 therefore: but for so much as my purpose is not to deale in this
 behalfe, I will omit the mention of these things, and go in hand with
 the baths themselues, wherof in the title of this chapiter I protested
 to intreat.

 There are two springs of water (as Leland saith) in the west south
 [Sidenote: Crosse bath.]
 west part of the towne, whereof the biggest is called the crosse bath,
 of a certeine crosse that was erected sometime in the middest thereof.
 This bath is much frequented by such as are diseased with leaprie,
 pockes, scabs, and great aches: yet of it selfe it is verie temperate
 and pleasant, hauing eleuen or twelue arches of stone in the sides
 thereof, for men to stand vnder, when raine dooth ought annoie them.

 [Sidenote: Common bath.]
 The common bath, or as some call it, the hot bath, is two hundred
 foot, or thereabout from the crosse bath, lesse in compasse within the
 wall than the other, and with onelie seauen arches, wrought out of the
 maine inclosure. It is worthilie called the hot bath, for at the first
 comming into it, men thinke that it would scald their flesh, and lose
 it from the bone: but after a season, and that the bodies of the
 commers thereto be warmed throughlie in the same, it is more
 tollerable and easie to be borne. Both these baths be in the middle of
 a little street, and ioine to S. Thomas hospitall, so that it may be
 thought that Reginald bishop of Bath made his house neere vnto these
 common baths, onelie to succour such poore people as should resort
 vnto them.

 [Sidenote: Kings bath.]
 The kings bath is verie faire and large, standing almost in the middle
 of the towne, at the west end of the cathedrall church. It is
 compassed about with a verie high stone wall, and the brims thereof
 are mured round about, where in be two and thirtie arches for men and
 women to stand in separatlie, who being of the gentrie for the most
 part, doo resort thither indifferentlie, but not in such lasciuious
 [Sidenote: Hot houses in some countries little better than brodels.]
 sort as vnto other baths and hot houses of the maine, whereof some
 write more a great deale than modestie should reueale, and honestie
 performe. There went a sluce out of this bath, which serued in times
 past the priorie with water, which was deriued out of it vnto two
 places, and commonlie vsed for baths, but now I doo not thinke that
 they remaine in vsage.

 [Sidenote: Colour of the water of the baths.]
 As for the colour of the water of all the bathes, it is most like to a
 deepe blew, and reeketh much after the maner of a seething pot,
 [Sidenote: Taste of the water.]
 commonlie yeelding somwhat a sulpherous taste, and verie vnpleasant
 sauour. The water also that runneth from the two small baths, goeth by
 a dyke into the Auon by west, and beneath the bridge: but the same
 that goeth from the kings bath turneth a mill, and after goeth into
 Auon aboue Bath bridge, where it loseth both force and tast, and is
 like vnto the rest. In all the three baths a man maie euidentlie see
 [Sidenote: Fall or issue of the water.]
 how the water bubbleth vp from the springs. This is also to be noted,
 that at certeine times all entrances into them is vtterlie prohibited,
 that is to saie, at high noone, and midnight: for at those two
 seasons, and a while before and after, they boile verie feruentlie,
 and become so hot that no man is able to indure their heat, or anie
 while susteine their force and vehement working. They purge themselues
 furthermore from all such filth as the diseased doo leaue in each of
 them, wherfore we doo forbeare the rash entrance into them at that
 time: and so much the rather, for that we would not by contraction of
 anie new diseases, depart more greeuouslie affected than we came vnto
 the citie, which is in deed a thing that each one should regard. For
 [Sidenote: Not good to enter into baths at all seasons.]
 these causes therefore they are commonlie shut vp from halfe an houre
 after ten of the clocke in the forenoone, to halfe an houre after one
 in the afternoone, and likewise at midnight: at which times the keeper
 of them resorteth to his charge, openeth the gates, and leaueth (or
 should leaue) free passage vnto such as come vnto them. Hitherto
 Leland.

 What cost of late hath beene bestowed vpon these baths by diuerse of
 the nobilitie, gentrie, communaltie, and cleargie, it lieth not in me
 to declare: yet as I heare, they are not onelie verie much repared and
 garnished with sundrie curious peeces of workemanship, partlie
 touching their commendation, and partlie for the ease and benefit of
 such as resort vnto them; but also better ordered, clenlier kept, &
 more friendlie prouision made for such pouertie as dailie repaireth
 thither. But notwithstanding all this, such is the generall estate of
 things in Bath, that the rich men maie spend while they will, and the
 poore beg whilest they list for their maintenance and diet so long as
 they remaine there: and yet I denie not but that there is verie good
 order in that citie for all degrees. But where shall a man find anie
 equall regard of poore and rich, though God dooth giue these his good
 gifts freelie, & vnto both alike? I would here intreat further of the
 customs vsed in these baths, what number of physicians dailie attend
 vpon those waters, for no man (especiallie such as be able to
 interteine them) dooth enter into these baths before he consult with
 the physician; also, what diet is to be obserued, what particular
 diseases are healed there, and to what end the commers thither doo
 drinke oftimes of that medicinable liquor: but then I should exceed
 the limits of a description. Wherefore I passe it ouer to others,
 hoping that some man yer long will vouchsafe to performe that at
 large, which the famous clearke Doctor Turner hath brieflie yet
 happilie begun, touching the effects & working of the same. For
 hitherto I doo not know of manie that haue trauelled in the natures of
 those baths of our countrie, with anie great commendation; much lesse
 of anie that hath reuealed them at the full for the benefit of our
 nation, or commoditie of strangers that resort vnto the same.




 OF ANTIQUITIES FOUND.

 CHAP. XXIV.


 Hauing taken some occasion to speake here and there in this treatise
 of antiquities, it shall not be amis to deale yet more in this
 chapter, with some of them apart, & by themselues, whereby the secure
 authoritie of the Romans ouer this Iland maie in some cases more
 manifestlie appeare. For such was their possession of this Iland on
 this side of the Tine, that they held not one or two, or a few places
 onelie vnder their subiection, but all the whole countrie from east to
 west, from the Tine to the British sea, so that there was no region
 void of their gouernance: notwithstanding that vntill the death of
 Lucius, and extinction of his issue, they did permit the successors of
 Lud and Cimbaline to reigne and rule amongest them, though vnder a
 certeine tribute, as else-where I haue declared. The cheefe cause that
 vrgeth me to speake of antiquities, is the paines that I haue taken to
 gather great numbers of them togither, intending (if euer my
 Chronologie shall happen to come abroad) to set downe the liuelie
 portraitures of euerie emperour ingrauen in the same: also the faces
 of Pompeie, Crassus, the seuen kings of the Romans, Cicero, and
 diuerse other, which I haue prouided readie for the purpose, beside
 the monuments and liuelie images of sundrie philosophers, and kings of
 this Iland, since the time of Edward the Confessor. Wherof although
 presentlie I want a few, yet I doo not doubt but to obteine them all,
 if friendship at the leastwise procured for monie shall be able to
 preuaile. But as it hath doone hitherto, so the charges to be emploied
 vpon these brasen or copper images, will hereafter put by the
 impression of that treatise: whereby it maie come to passe, that long
 trauell shall soone proue to be spent in vaine, and much cost come to
 verie small successe. Whereof yet I force not greatlie, sith by this
 means I haue reaped some commoditie vnto my selfe, by searching of the
 histories, which often minister store of examples readie to be vsed in
 my function, as occasion shall mooue me. But to proceed with my
 purpose.

 Before the comming of the Romans, there was a kind of copper monie
 currant here in Britaine, as Caesar confesseth in the fift booke of his
 Commentaries, but I find not of what maner it was. Hereto he addeth a
 report of certeine rings, of a proportionate weight, which they vsed
 in his time, in stead likewise of monie. But as hitherto it hath not
 bene my lucke (I saie) to haue the certeine view of anie of these, so
 after the comming of the Romans, they inforced vs to abandon our owne,
 and receiue such imperiall monies or coines, as for the paiment of
 their legions was dailie brought ouer vnto them. What coines the
 Romans had, it is easie to be knowne, and from time to time much of it
 is found in manie places of this Iland, as well of gold and siluer, as
 of copper, brasse, and other mettall, much like steele, almost of
 euerie emperour. So that I account it no rare thing to haue of the
 Roman coine, albeit that it still represent an image of our
 captiuitie, and maie be a good admonition for vs, to take heed how we
 yeeld our selues to the regiment of strangers. Of the store of these
 monies, found vpon the Kentish coast, I haue alreadie made mention in
 the description of Richborow, and chapter of Iles adiacent vnto the
 British Albion, and there shewed also how simple fishermen haue had
 plentie of them, and that the conies in making profers and holes to
 breed in, haue scraped them out of the ground in verie great
 abundance. In speaking also of S. Albans, in the chapter of townes and
 villages, I haue not omitted to tell what plentie of these coines haue
 bene gathered there: wherfore I shall not need here to repeat the same
 againe. Howbeit this is certeine, that the most part of all these
 antiquities, to be found within the land, & distant from the shore,
 are to be gotten either in the ruines of ancient cities and townes
 decaied, or in inclosed burrowes, where their legions accustomed
 sometime to winter, as by experience is dailie confirmed. What store
 hath beene seene of them in the citie of London, which they called
 Augusta, of the legion that soiourned there, & likewise in Yorke named
 also Victrix, of the legion Victoria, or Altera Roma (because of the
 beautie and fine building of the same) I my selfe can partlie
 witnesse, that haue seene, & often had of them, if better testimonie
 were wanting. The like I maie affirme of Colchester, where those of
 Claudius, Adrian, Traian, Vespasian, and other, are oftentimes plowed
 vp, or found by other means: also of Cantorburie, Andredeschester (now
 decaied) Rochester, then called Durobreuum, Winchester, and diuerse
 other beyond the Thames, which for breuitie sake I doo passe ouer in
 silence. Onlie the chiefe of all and where most are found in deed, is
 neere vnto Carleon and Cairgwent in Southwales, about Kenchester,
 three miles aboue Hereford, Aldborow, Ancaster, Bramdon, Dodington,
 where a spurre and peece of a chaine of gold were found in king Henrie
 the eight his daies, besides much of the said Roman coine, Binchester,
 Camalet, Lacocke vpon Auon, and Lincolne, Dorchester, Warwike, and
 Chester, where they are often had in verie great abundance. It seemeth
 that Ancaster hath beene a great thing, for manie square & colored
 pauements, vaults, and arches are yet found, and often laid open by
 such as dig and plow in the fields about the same. And amongst these,
 one Vresbie or Rosebie, a plowman, did ere vp not long since a stone
 like a trough, couered with another stone, wherein was great foison of
 the aforesaid coines. The like also was seene not yet fortie yeares
 agone about Grantham. But in king Henrie the eight his daies, an
 husbandman had far better lucke at Harleston, two miles from the
 aforesaid place, where he found not onelie great plentie of this
 coine, but also an huge brasse pot, and therein a large helmet of pure
 gold, richlie fretted with pearle, and set with all kind of costlie
 stones: he tooke vp also chaines much like vnto beads of siluer, all
 which, as being (if a man might ghesse anie certeintie by their
 beautie) not likelie to be long hidden, he presented to queene
 Katharine then lieng at Peterborow, and therewithall a few ancient
 rolles of parchment written long agone, though so defaced with
 mouldinesse, and rotten for age, that no man could well hold them in
 his hand without falling into peeces, much lesse read them by reason
 of their blindnesse.

 In the beginning of the same kings daies also at Killeie a man found
 as he eared, an arming girdle, harnessed with pure gold, and a great
 massie pomell with a crosse hilt for a sword of the same mettall,
 beside studs and harnesse for spurs, and the huge long spurs of like
 stuffe, whereof one doctor Ruthall got a part into his hands. The
 boroughs or buries, wherof I spake before, were certeine plots of
 ground, wherin the Romane souldiers did vse to lie when they kept in
 the open fields as chosen places, from whence they might haue easie
 accesse vnto their aduersaries, if anie outrage were wrought or
 rebellion mooued against them. And as these were the vsuall aboads for
 those able legions that serued dailie in the wars, so had they other
 certeine habitations for the old and forworne souldiers, whereby
 diuerse cities grew in time to be replenished with Romane colonies, as
 Cairleon, Colchester, Chester, and such other, of which, Colchester
 bare the name of Colonia long time, and wherein A. Plautius builded a
 temple vnto the goddesse of Victorie (after the departure of Claudius)
 which Tacitus calleth "Aram sempiternae dominationis," a perpetuall
 monument of that our British seruitude. But to returne vnto our
 borowes, they were generallie walled about with stone wals, and so
 large in compasse that some did conteine thirtie, fourtie, three
 score, or eightie acres of ground within their limits: they had also
 diuerse gates or ports vnto each of them, and of these not a few
 remaine to be seene in our time, as one for example not far from great
 Chesterford in Essex, neere to the limits of Cambridgshire, which I
 haue often viewed, and wherein the compasse of the verie wall with the
 places where the gates stood is easie to be discerned: the like also
 is to be seene at a place within two miles south of Burton, called the
 Borow hils. In these therefore and such like, and likewise at
 Euolsburg, now S. Neots, or S. Needs, and sundrie other places,
 especiallie vpon the shore and coasts of Kent, as Douer, Rie, Romneie,
 Lid, &c: is much of their coine also to be found, and some peeces or
 other are dailie taken vp, which they call Borow pence, Dwarfs monie,
 Hegs pence, Feirie groats, Jewes monie, & by other foolish names not
 woorthie to be remembred. At the comming of the Saxons, the Britons
 vsed these holds as rescues for their cattell in the daie and night,
 when their enimies were abroad; the like also did the Saxons against
 the Danes, by which occasions (and now and then by carieng of their
 stones to helpe forward other buildings neere at hand) manie of them
 were throwne downe and defaced, which otherwise might haue continued
 for a longer time, and so your honour would saie, if you should happen
 to peruse the thickenesse and maner of building of those said wals and
 borowes. It is not long since a siluer saucer of verie ancient making
 was found neere to Saffron Walden, in the open field among the
 [Sidenote: Sterbirie a place where an armie hath lien.]
 Sterbirie hils, and eared vp by a plough, but of such massie
 greatnesse, that it weighed better than twentie ounces, as I haue
 heard reported. But if I should stand in these things vntill I had
 said all that might be spoken of them, both by experience and
 testimonie of Leland in his Commentaries of Britaine, and the report
 of diuerse yet liuing, I might make a greater chapter than would be
 either conuenient or profitable to the reader: wherefore so much
 onelie shall serue the turne for this time as I haue said alreadie of
 antiquities found within our Iland, especiallie of coine, whereof I
 purposed chiefelie to intreat.




 OF THE COINES OF ENGLAND.

 CHAP. XXV.


 The Saxon coine before the conquest is in maner vtterlie vnknowne to
 me: howbeit if my coniecture be anie thing, I suppose that one
 shilling of siluer in those daies did counterpeise our common ounce,
 though afterward it came to passe that it arose to twentie pence, and
 so continued vntill the time of king Henrie the eight, who first
 brought it to three shillings and foure pence, & afterward our siluer
 [Sidenote: Copper monie.]
 coine vnto brasse & copper monies, by reason of those inestimable
 charges, which diuerse waies oppressed him. And as I gather such
 obscure notice of the shilling which is called in Latine Solidus, so I
 read more manifestlie of another which is the 48 part of a pound, and
 this also currant among the Saxons of our Ile, so well in gold as in
 siluer, at such time as 240 of their penies made vp a iust pound, fiue
 pence went to the shilling, and foure shillings to the ounce. But to
 proceed with my purpose. After the death of K. Henrie, Edward his
 sonne began to restore the aforesaid coine againe vnto fine siluer: so
 queene Marie his successour did continue his good purpose,
 notwithstanding that in hir time the Spanish monie was verie c[=o]mon
 in England, by reason of hir mariage with Philip king of Spaine.

 [Sidenote: Siluer restored.]
 After hir decease the ladie Elizabeth hir sister, and now our most
 gratious queene, souereigne and princesse, did finish the matter
 wholie, vtterly abolishing the vse of copper and brasen coine, and
 conuerting the same into guns and great ordinance, she restored
 sundrie coines of fine siluer, as peeces of halfepenie farding, of a
 penie, of three halfe pence, peeces of two pence, of three pence, of
 foure pence (called the groat) of six pence vsuallie named the
 testone, and shilling of twelue pence, whereon she hath imprinted hir
 owne image, and emphaticall superscription. Our gold is either old or
 [Sidenote: Old gold.]
 new. The old is that which hath remained since the time of king Edward
 the third, or beene coined by such other princes as haue reigned since
 his deceasse, without anie abasing or diminution of the finesse of
 that mettall. Therof also we haue yet remaining, the riall, the George
 noble, the Henrie riall, the salut, the angell, and their smaller
 peeces, as halfes or quarters, though these in my time are not so
 common to be seene. I haue also beheld the souereigne of twentie
 shillings, and the peece of thirtie shillings, I haue heard likewise
 of peeces of fortie shillings, three pounds, fiue pounds, and ten
 pounds. But sith there were few of them coined, and those onelie at
 the commandement of kings, yearelie to bestow where their maiesties
 thought good in lieu of new yeares gifts and rewards: it is not
 requisit that I should remember them here amongst our currant monies.

 [Sidenote: New gold.]
 The new gold is taken for such as began to be coined in the latter
 daies of king Henrie the eight, at which time the finesse of the
 mettall began to be verie much alaied, & is not likelie to be restored
 for ought that I can see: and yet is it such as hath beene coined
 since by his successors princes of this realme, in value and goodnesse
 equall and not inferiour to the coine and currant gold of other
 nations, where each one dooth couet chiefelie to gather vp our old
 finer gold: so that the angels, rials, and nobles, are more
 plentifullie seene in France, Italie, and Flanders, than they be by a
 great deale within the realme of England, if you regard the paiments
 which they dailie make in those kinds of our coine. Our peeces now
 currant are of ten shillings, fiue shillings, and two shillings and
 six pence onelie: and those of sundrie stamps and names, as halfe
 souereigns (equall in weight with our currant shilling, whereby that
 gold is valued at ten times so much siluer) quarters of souereigns
 (otherwise called crownes) and halfe crownes: likewise angels, halfe
 angels, and quarters of angels, or if there be anie other, in good
 sooth I know them not, as one scarselie acquainted with any siluer at
 all, much lesse then (God it wot) with any store of gold.

 The first currant shilling or siluer peeces of twelue pence stamped
 within memorie, were coined by K. Henrie the eight in the twentith
 yeare of his reigne, & those of fiue shillings, and of two shillings
 and six pence, & the halfe shilling by king Edward the sixt: but the
 od peeces aboue remembred vnder the groat by our high and mightie
 princesse queene Elizabeth, the name of the groat, penie, two pence,
 halfe penie, and farding, in old time the greatest siluer monies if
 you respect their denominations onelie, being more ancient than that I
 can well discusse of the time of their beginnings. Yet thus much I
 read, that king Edward the first in the eight yeare of his reigne, did
 first coine the penie and smallest peeces of siluer roundwise, which
 before were square, and woont to beare a double crosse with a crest,
 in such sort that the penie might easilie be broken, either into
 halfes or quarters: by which shift onelie the people came by small
 monies, as halfe pence and fardings, that otherwise were not stamped
 nor coined of set purpose.

 Of forren coines we haue all the ducats, the single, double, and the
 double double, the crusadoes, with the long crosse and the short: the
 portigue, a peece verie solemnelie kept of diuerse, & yet oft times
 abased with washing, or absolutelie counterfeited: and finallie the
 French and Flemish crownes, onlie currant among vs, so long as they
 hold weight. But of siluer coines, as the soules turnois, whereof ten
 make a shilling, as the franke dooth two shillings, and three franks
 the French crowne, &c: we haue none at all: yet are the dalders, and
 such often times brought ouer, but neuerthelesse exchanged as bullion,
 according to their finenesse and weight, and afterward conuerted into
 coine, by such as haue authoritie.

 In old time we had sundrie mints in England, and those commonlie kept
 in abbaies and religious houses before the conquest, where true
 dealing was commonlie supposed most of all to dwell: as at Ramseie, S.
 Edmundsburie, Canturburie, Glassenburie, Peterborow, and such like,
 sundrie exemplificats of the grants whereof are yet to be seene in
 writing, especiallie that of Peterborow vnder the confirmation of pope
 Eugenius: wherevnto it appeereth further by a charter of king Edgar
 (which I haue) that they either held it or had another in Stanford.
 But after the Normans had once gotten the kingdome into their fingers,
 they trusted themselues best with the ouersight of their mints, and
 therefore erected diuerse of their owne, although they afterward
 permitted some for small peeces of siluer vnto sundrie of the houses
 aforesaid. In my time diuerse mints are suppressed, as Southwarke,
 Bristow, &c: and all coinage is brought into one place, that is to
 saie, the Tower of London, where it is continuallie holden and
 perused, but not without great gaine to such as deale withall. There
 is also coinage of tin holden yearelie at two seuerall times, that is
 to saie, Midsummer and Michaelmas in the west countrie; which at the
 first hearing I supposed to haue beene of monie of the said mettall,
 and granted by priuilege from some prince vnto the towns of
 Hailestone, Trurie, and Lostwithiell. Howbeit, vpon further
 examination of the matter, I find it to be nothing so, but an office
 onlie erected for the prince, wherin he is allowed the ordinarie
 customes of that mettall: and such blocks of tin as haue passed the
 hands of his officers, are marked with an especiall stampe, whereby it
 is knowne that the custome due for the same hath ordinarilie beene
 answered. It should seeme (and in my opinion is verie likelie to be
 true) that while the Romans reigned here, Kingstone vpon Thames
 (sometime a right noble citie and place where the Saxon kings were
 vsuallie crowned) was the chiefe place of their coinage for this
 prouince. For in earing of the ground about that towne in times past,
 and now of late (besides the curious foundation of manie goodlie
 buildings that haue beene ripped vp by plowes, and diuerse coines of
 brasse, siluer, and gold, with Romane letters in painted pots found
 there) in the daies of cardinall Woolseie, one such huge pot was
 discouered full as it were of new siluer latelie coined; another with
 plates of siluer readie to be coined; and the third with chaines of
 siluer and such broken stuffe redie (as it should appeere) to be
 melted into coinage, whereof let this suffice to countenance out my
 coniecture. Of coins currant before the comming of the Romans I haue
 elsewhere declared, that there were none at all in Britaine: but as
 the Ilanders of Scylira, the old Romans, Armenians, Scythians,
 Seritans, Sarmatians, Indians, and Essences did barter ware for ware,
 so the Britons vsed brasse or rings of iron, brought vnto a certeine
 proportion, in steed of monie, as the Lacedemonians & Bisantines also
 did, & the Achiui (as Homer writeth) who had (saith he) rough peeces
 of brasse and iron in steed of coine, wherewith they purchased their
 wines.

 OF CATTELL KEPT FOR PROFIT.

 CHAP. I.


 There is no kind of tame cattell vsually to be seene in these parts of
 the world, wherof we haue not some, and that great store in England;
 as horsses, oxen, sheepe, goats, swine, and far surmounting the like
 in other countries, as may be prooued with ease. For where are oxen
 commonlie more large of bone, horsses more decent and pleasant in
 pase, kine more commodious for the pale, sheepe more profitable for
 wooll, swine more wholesome of flesh, and goates more gainefull to
 their keepers, than here with vs in England? But to speke of them
 peculiarlie, I suppose that our kine are so abundant in yeeld of
 milke, wherof we make our butter & cheese, as the like anie where
 else, and so apt for the plough in diuerse places as either our
 horsses or oxen. And albeit they now and then twin, yet herein they
 seeme to come short of that commoditie which is looked for in other
 countries, to wit, in that they bring foorth most commonlie but one
 calfe at once. The gaines also gotten by a cow (all charges borne)
 hath beene valued at twentie shillings yearelie: but now as land is
 inhanced, this proportion of gaine is much abated, and likelie to
 decaie more and more, if ground arise to be yet deerer, which God
 forbid, if it be his will and pleasure. I heard of late of a cow in
 Warwikshire, belonging to Thomas Bruer of Studleie, which in six
 yeeres had sixteene calfes, that is, foure at once in three caluings
 and twise twins, which vnto manie may seeme a thing incredible. In
 [Sidenote: Oxen.]
 like maner our oxen are such as the like are not to be found in anie
 countrie of Europe, both for greatnesse of bodie and sweetnesse of
 flesh: or else would not the Romane writers haue preferred them before
 those of Liguria. In most places our grasiers are now growen to be so
 cunning, that if they doo but see an ox or bullocke, and come to the
 feeling of him, they will giue a ghesse at his weight, and how manie
 score or stone of flesh and tallow he beareth, how the butcher may
 liue by the sale, and what he may haue for the skin and tallow; which
 is a point of skill not commonlie practised heretofore. Some such
 grasiers also are reported to ride with veluet coats, and chaines of
 gold about them: and in their absence their wiues will not let to
 supplie those turnes with no lesse skill than their husbands: which is
 an hard worke for the poore butcher, sith he through this means can
 seldome be rich or wealthie by his trade. In like sort the flesh of
 our oxen and kine is sold both by hand and by weight as the buier
 will: but in yoong ware rather by weight, especiallie for the steere
 and heighfer, sith the finer beefe is the lightest, wheras the flesh
 of buls and old kine, &c: is of sadder substance and therefore much
 heauier as it lieth in the scale. Their hornes also are knowne to be
 more faire and large in England than in anie other places, except
 those which are to be seene among the Paeones, which quantitie albeit
 that it be giuen to our breed generallie by nature, yet it is now and
 then helped also by art.

 [Sidenote: _Athenaeus bib. 10. cap. 8._]
 For when they be verie yoong, manie grasiers will oftentimes annoint
 their budding hornes, or tender tips with honie, which mollifieth the
 naturall hardnesse of that substance, and thereby maketh them to grow
 vnto a notable greatnesse. Certes, it is not strange in England, to
 see oxen whose hornes haue the length of a yard or three foot betweene
 the tips, and they themselues thereto so tall, as the heigth of a man
 of meane and indifferent stature is scarse equall vnto them.
 Neuerthelesse it is much to be lamented that our generall breed of
 cattell is not better looked vnto: for the greatest occupiers weane
 least store, bicause they can buie them (as they saie) far better
 cheape than to raise and bring them vp. In my time a cow hath risen
 from foure nobles to foure marks by this means, which notwithstanding
 were no great price if they did yearelie bring foorth more than one
 calfe a peece, as I heare they doo in other countries.

 [Sidenote: Horsses.]
 Our horsses moreouer are high, and although not commonlie of such huge
 greatnesse as in other places of the maine: yet if you respect the
 easinesse of their pase, it is hard to saie where their like are to be
 had. Our land dooth yeeld no asses, and therefore we want the
 generation also of mules and somers; and therefore the most part of
 our cariage is made by these, which remaining stoned, are either
 reserued for the cart, or appointed to beare such burdens as are
 conuenient for them. Our cart or plough horsses (for we vse them
 indifferentlie) are commonlie so strong that fiue or six of them (at
 the most) will draw three thousand weight of the greatest tale with
 ease for a long iourneie, although it be not a load of common vsage,
 which consisteth onelie of two thousand, or fiftie foot of timber,
 fortie bushels of white salt, or six and thirtie of baie, or fiue
 quarters of wheat, experience dailie teacheth, and I haue elsewhere
 remembred. Such as are kept also for burden, will carie foure hundred
 weight commonlie, without anie hurt or hinderance. This furthermore is
 to be noted, that our princes and the nobilitie haue their cariage
 commonlie made by carts, wherby it commeth to passe, that when the
 queenes maiestie dooth remooue from anie one place to another, there
 are vsuallie 400 carewares, which amount to the summe of 2400 horsses,
 appointed out of the countries adioining, whereby hir cariage is
 conueied safelie vnto the appointed place. Hereby also the ancient vse
 of somers and sumpter horsses is in maner vtterlie relinquished, which
 causeth the traines of our princes in their progresses to shew far
 lesse than those of the kings of other nations.

 [Sidenote: Geldings.]
 Such as serue for the saddle are commonlie gelded, and now growne to
 be verie deere among vs, especiallie if they be well coloured, iustlie
 limmed, and haue thereto an easie ambling pase. For our countriemen,
 seeking their ease in euerie corner where it is to be had, delight
 verie much in these qualities, but chieflie in their excellent pases,
 which besides that it is in maner peculiar vnto horsses of our soile,
 and not hurtfull to the rider or owner sitting on their backes: it is
 moreouer verie pleasant and delectable in his eares, in that the noise
 of their well proportioned pase dooth yeeld comfortable sound as he
 trauelleth by the waie. Yet is there no greater deceipt vsed anie
 where than among our horssekeepers, horssecorsers, and hostelers: for
 such is the subtill knauerie of a great sort of them (without
 exception of anie of them be it spoken which deale for priuat gaine)
 that an honest meaning man shall haue verie good lucke among them, if
 he be not deceiued by some false tricke or other. There are certeine
 notable markets, wherein great plentie of horsses and colts is bought
 and sold, and wherevnto such as haue need resort yearelie to buie and
 make their necessarie prouision of them, as Rippon, Newport pond,
 Wolfpit, Harborow, and diuerse other. But as most drouers are verie
 diligent to bring great store of these vnto those places; so manie of
 them are too too lewd in abusing such as buie them. For they haue a
 custome to make them looke faire to the eie, when they come within two
 daies iourneie of the market, to driue them till they sweat, & for the
 space of eight or twelue houres, which being doone they turne them all
 ouer the backs into some water, where they stand for a season, and
 then go forward with them to the place appointed, where they make sale
 of their infected ware, and such as by this meanes doo fall into manie
 diseases and maladies. Of such outlandish horsses as are dailie
 brought ouer vnto vs I speake not, as the genet of Spaine, the courser
 of Naples, the hobbie of Ireland, the Flemish roile, and Scotish nag,
 bicause that further speech of them commeth not within the compasse of
 this treatise, and for whose breed and maintenance (especiallie of the
 greatest sort) king Henrie the eight erected a noble studderie and for
 a time had verie good successe with them, till the officers waxing
 wearie, procured a mixed brood of bastard races, whereby his good
 purpose came to little effect. Sir Nicholas Arnold of late hath bred
 the best horsses in England, and written of the maner of their
 production: would to God his compasse of ground were like to that of
 Pella in Syria, wherin the king of that nation had vsuallie a
 studderie of 30000 mares and 300 stallions, as Strabo dooth remember
 Lib. 16. But to leaue this, let vs see what may be said of sheepe.

 [Sidenote: Sheepe.]
 Our sheepe are verie excellent, sith for sweetnesse of flesh they
 passe all other. And so much are our woolles to be preferred before
 those of Milesia and other places, that if Iason had knowne the value
 of them that are bred, and to be had in Britaine, he would neuer haue
 gone to Colchis to looke for anie there. For as Dionysius Alexandrinus
 saith in his De situ orbis, it may by spinning be made comparable to
 the spiders web. What fooles then are our countrimen, in that they
 seeke to bereue themselues of this commoditie, by practising dailie
 how to transfer the same to other nations, in carieng ouer their rams
 & ewes to breed & increase among them? The first example hereof was
 giuen vnder Edward the fourth, who not vnderstanding the botome of the
 sute of sundrie traitorous merchants, that sought a present gaine with
 the perpetuall hinderance of their countrie, licenced them to carie
 ouer certeine numbers of them into Spaine, who hauing licence but for
 a few shipped verie manie: a thing commonlie practised in other
 commodities also, whereby the prince and hir land are not seldome
 times defrauded. But such is our nature, and so blind are we in deed,
 that we see no inconuenience before we feele it: and for a present
 gaine we regard not what damage may insue to our posteritie. Hereto
 some other man would ad also the desire that we haue to benefit other
 countries, and to impech our owne. And it is so sure as God liueth,
 that euerie trifle which commeth from beyond the sea, though it be not
 woorth three pence, is more esteemed than a continuall commoditie at
 home with vs, which far exceedeth that value. In time past the vse of
 this commoditie consisted (for the most part) in cloth and woolsteds:
 but now by meanes of strangers succoured here from domesticall
 persecution, the same hath beene imploied vnto sundrie other vses, as
 mockados, baies, vellures, grograines, &c: whereby the makers haue
 reaped no small commoditie. It is furthermore to be noted, for the low
 countries of Belgie know it, and dailie experience (notwithstanding
 the sharpenesse of our lawes to the contrarie) dooth yet confirme it:
 that although our rams & weathers doo go thither from vs neuer so well
 headed according to their kind: yet after they haue remained there a
 while, they cast there their heads, and from thencefoorth they remaine
 [Sidenote: Sheepe without hornes.]
 polled without any hornes at all. Certes this kind of cattell is more
 cherished in England, than standeth well with the commoditie of the
 commons, or prosperitie of diuerse townes, whereof some are wholie
 conuerted to their feeding: yet such a profitable sweetnesse is their
 fleece, such necessitie in their flesh, and so great a benefit in the
 manuring of barren soile with their doong and pisse, that their
 superfluous numbers are the better borne withall. And there is neuer
 an husbandman (for now I speake not of our great sheepemasters of whom
 some one man hath 20000) but hath more or lesse of this cattell
 feeding on his fallowes and short grounds, which yeeld the finer
 fleece, as Virgil (following Varro) well espied Georg. 3. where he
 saith:

   "Si tibi lanicium curae, primum aspera sylua,
   Lappaeque tribulique absint, fuge pabula laeta."

 Neuerthelesse the sheepe of our countrie are often troubled with the
 rot (as are our swine with the measels though neuer so generallie) and
 manie men are now and then great losers by the same: but after the
 calamitie is ouer, if they can recouer and keepe their new stocks
 sound for seauen yeares togither, the former losse will easilie be
 recompensed with double commoditie. Cardan writeth that our waters are
 hurtfull to our sheepe, howbeit this is but his coniecture: for we
 know that our sheepe are infected by going to the water, and take the
 same as a sure and certeine token that a rot hath gotten hold of them,
 their liuers and lights being alredie distempered through excessiue
 heat, which inforceth them the rather to seeke vnto the water. Certes
 there is no parcell of the maine, wherin a man shall generallie find
 more fine and wholesome water than in England; and therefore it is
 impossible that our sheepe should decaie by tasting of the same.
 Wherfore the hinderance by rot is rather to be ascribed to the
 vnseasonablenes & moisture of the weather in summer, also their
 licking in of mildewes, gossamire, rowtie fogs, & ranke grasse, full
 of superfluous iuice: but speciallie (I saie) to ouer moist wether,
 whereby the continuall raine pearsing into their hollow felles, soketh
 foorthwith into their flesh, which bringeth them to their baines.
 Being also infected their first shew of sickenesse is their desire to
 drinke, so that our waters are not vnto them "Causa aegritudinis," but
 "Signum morbi," what so euer Cardan doo mainteine to the contrarie.
 There are (& peraduenture no small babes) which are growne to be so
 good husbands, that they can make account of euerie ten kine to be
 cleerelie woorth twentie pounds in c[=o]mon and indifferent yeares, if
 the milke of fiue sheepe be dailie added to the same. But as I wote
 not how true this surmise is, bicause it is no part of my trade, so I
 am sure hereof, that some housewiues can and doo ad dailie a lesse
 proportion of ewes milke vnto the cheese of so manie kine, whereby
 their cheese dooth the longer abide moist, and eateth more brickle and
 mellow than otherwise it would.

 [Sidenote: Goats.]
 Goats we haue plentie, and of sundrie colours in the west parts of
 England; especiallie in and towards Wales, and amongst the rockie
 hilles, by whome the owners doo reape no small aduantage: some also
 are cherished elsewhere in diuerse steeds for the benefit of such as
 are diseased with sundrie maladies, vnto whom (as I heare) their
 milke, cheese, and bodies of their yoong kids are iudged verie
 profitable, and therefore inquired for of manie farre and neere.
 Certes I find among the writers, that the milke of a goat is next in
 estimation to that of the woman; for that it helpeth the stomach,
 remooueth oppilations and stoppings of the liuer, and looseth the
 bellie. Some place also next vnto it the milke of the ew: and thirdlie
 that of the cow. But hereof I can shew no reason; onelie this I know,
 that ewes milke is fulsome, sweet, and such in tast, as except such as
 are vsed vnto it no man will gladlie yeeld to liue and feed withall.

 [Sidenote: Swine.]
 As for swine, there is no place that hath greater store, nor more
 wholesome in eating, than are these here in England, which
 neuerthelesse doo neuer anie good till they come to the table. Of
 these some we eat greene for porke, and other dried vp into bakon to
 haue it of more continuance. Lard we make some though verie little,
 because it is chargeable: neither haue we such vse thereof as is to be
 seene in France and other countries, sith we doo either bake our meat
 with sweet suet of beefe or mutton, and bast all our meat with sweet
 or salt butter, or suffer the fattest to bast it selfe by leisure. In
 champaine countries they are kept by herds, and an hogherd appointed
 to attend and wait vpon them, who commonlie gathereth them togither by
 his noise and crie, and leadeth them foorth to feed abroad in the
 fields. In some places also women doo scowre and wet their cloths with
 their doong, as other doo with hemlocks and netles: but such is the
 sauor of the cloths touched withall, that I cannot abide to weare them
 on my bodie, more than such as are scowred with the reffuse sope, than
 the which (in mine opinion) there is none more vnkindlie sauor.

 [Sidenote: Bores.]
 Of our tame bores we make brawne, which is a kind of meat not vsuallie
 knowne to strangers (as I take it) otherwise would not the swart
 Rutters and French cookes, at the losse of Calis (where they found
 great store of this prouision almost in euerie house) haue attempted
 with ridiculous successe to rost, bake, broile, & frie the same for
 their masters, till they were better informed. I haue heard moreouer,
 how a noble man of England, not long since, did send ouer an hogshead
 of brawne readie sowsed to a catholike gentleman of France, who
 supposing it to be fish, reserued it till Lent, at which time he did
 eat thereof with verie great frugalitie. Thereto he so well liked of
 the prouision it selfe, that he wrote ouer verie earnestlie & with
 offer of great recompense for more of the same fish against the yeare
 insuing: whereas if he had knowne it to haue beene flesh, he would not
 haue touched it (I dare saie) for a thousand crownes without the popes
 dispensation. A freend of mine also dwelling sometime in Spaine,
 hauing certeine Iewes at his table, did set brawne before them,
 whereof they did eat verie earnestlie, supposing it to be a kind of
 fish not common in those parties: but when the goodman of the house
 brought in the head in pastime among them, to shew what they had
 eaten, they rose from the table, hied them home in hast, ech of them
 procuring himselfe to vomit, some by oile, and some by other meanes,
 till (as they supposed) they had clensed their stomachs of that
 prohibited food. With vs it is accounted a great peece of seruice at
 the table, from Nouember vntill Februarie be ended; but cheeflie in
 the Christmasse time. With the same also we begin our dinners ech daie
 after other: and because it is somewhat hard of digestion, a draught
 of malueseie, bastard, or muscadell, is vsuallie droonke after it,
 where either of them are conuenientlie to be had: otherwise the meaner
 sort content themselues with their owne drinke, which at that season
 is generallie verie strong, and stronger indeed than in all the yeare
 [Sidenote: Brawne of the bore.]
 beside. It is made commonlie of the fore part of a tame bore, set vp
 for the purpose by the space of a whole yere or two, especiallie in
 gentlemens houses (for the husbandmen and farmers neuer franke them
 for their owne vse aboue three or foure moneths, or halfe a yeere at
 the most) in which time he is dieted with otes and peason, and lodged
 on the bare planks of an vneasie coat, till his fat be hardened
 sufficientlie for their purpose: afterward he is killed, scalded, and
 cut out, and then of his former parts is our brawne made, the rest is
 nothing so fat, and therefore it beareth the name of sowse onelie, and
 is commonlie reserued for the seruing man and hind, except it please
 [Sidenote: Baked hog.]
 the owner to haue anie part therof baked, which are then handled of
 custome after this manner. The hinder parts being cut off, they are
 first drawne with lard, and then sodden; being sodden they are sowsed
 in claret wine and vineger a certeine space, and afterward baked in
 pasties, and eaten of manie in steed of the wild bore, and trulie it
 is verie good meat: the pestles may be hanged vp a while to drie
 before they be drawne with lard if you will, and thereby prooue the
 better. But hereof inough, and therefore to come againe vnto our
 brawne. The necke peeces being cut off round, are called collars of
 brawne, the shoulders are named shilds, onelie the ribs reteine the
 former denomination, so that these aforesaid peeces deserue the name
 of brawne: the bowels of the beast are commonlie cast awaie because of
 their ranknesse, and so were likewise his stones; till a foolish
 fantasie got hold of late amongst some delicate dames, who haue now
 found the meanes to dresse them also with great cost for a deintie
 dish, and bring them to the boord as a seruice among other of like
 sort, though not without note of their desire to the prouocation of
 fleshlie lust, which by this their fond curiositie is not a little
 reuealed. When the bore is thus cut out, ech peece is wrapped vp,
 either with bulrushes, ozier peeles, tape, inkle, or such like, and
 then sodden in a lead or caldron togither, till they be so tender that
 a man may thrust a brused rush or soft straw cleane through the fat:
 which being doone, they take it vp, and laie it abroad to coole:
 afterward putting it into close vessels, they powre either good small
 ale or beere mingled with veriuice and salt thereto till it be
 couered, and so let it lie (now and then altering and changing the
 sowsing drinke least it should wax sowre) till occasion serue to spend
 it out of the waie. Some vse to make brawne of great barrow hogs, and
 seeth them, and sowse the whole, as they doo that of the bore; and in
 my iudgement it is the better of both, and more easie of digestion.
 But of brawne thus much; and so much may seeme sufficient.




 OF WILD AND TAME FOULES.

 CHAP. II.


 Order requireth that I speake somewhat of the foules also of England,
 which I may easilie diuide into the wild & tame: but alas such is my
 small skill in foules, that to say the truth, I can neither recite
 their numbers, nor well distinguish one kind of them from another. Yet
 this I haue by generall knowledge, that there is no nation vnder the
 sunne, which hath alreadie in the time of the yere more plentie of
 wild foule than we, for so manie kinds as our Iland dooth bring
 foorth, and much more would haue, if those of the higher soile might
 be spared but one yeare or two, from the greedie engins of couetous
 foulers, which set onlie for the pot & purse. Certes this enormitie
 bred great trouble in K. Iohns daies, insomuch that going in progresse
 about the tenth of his reigne, he found little or no game wherewith to
 solace himself, or exercise his falcons. Wherfore being at Bristow in
 the Christmas insuing, he restreined all maner of hawking or taking of
 wild-foule throughout England for a season, whereby the land within
 few yeares was throughlie replenished againe. But what stand I vpon
 this impertinent discourse? Of such therefore as are bred in our land,
 we haue the crane, the bitter, the wild & tame swan, the bustard, the
 herron, curlew, snite, wildgoose, wind or doterell, brant, larke,
 plouer of both sorts, lapwing, teele, wigeon, mallard, sheldrake,
 shoueler, pewet, seamew, barnacle, quaile (who onelie with man are
 subiect to the falling sickenesse) the notte, the oliet or olife, the
 dunbird, woodcocke, partrich and feasant, besides diuerse other, whose
 names to me are vtterlie vnknowne, and much more the taste of their
 flesh, wherewith I was neuer acquainted. But as these serue not at all
 seasons, so in their seuerall turnes there is no plentie of them
 wanting, whereby the tables of the nobilitie and gentrie should seeme
 at anie time furnisht. But of all these the production of none is more
 maruellous in my mind, than that of the barnacle, whose place of
 generation we haue sought oft times so farre as the Orchades, whereas
 peraduenture we might haue found the same neerer home, and not onelie
 vpon the coasts of Ireland, but euen in our owne riuers. If I should
 say how either these or some such other foule not much vnlike vnto
 them haue bred of late times (for their place of generation is not
 perpetuall, but as opportunitie serueth, and the circumstances doo
 minister occasion) in the Thames mouth, I doo not thinke that manie
 will beleeue me: yet such a thing hath there beene scene, where a kind
 of foule had his beginning vpon a short tender shrub standing neere
 vnto the shore, from whence when their time came, they fell downe,
 either into the salt water and liued, or vpon the drie land and
 perished, as Pena the French herbarian hath also noted in the verie
 end of his herball. What I for mine owne part haue seene here by
 experience, I haue alreadie so touched in the chapter of Ilands, that
 it should be but time spent in vaine to repeat it here againe. Looke
 therefore in the description of Man or Manaw for more of these
 barnacles, as also in the eleuenth chapter of the description of
 Scotland, & I doo not doubt but you shall in some respect be satisfied
 in the generation of these foules. As for egrets, pawpers, and such
 like, they are dailie brought vnto vs from beyond the sea, as if all
 the foule of our countrie could not suffice to satisfie our delicate
 appetites.

 Our tame foule are such (for the most part) as are common both to vs
 and to other countries, as cocks, hens, geese, duckes, peacocks of
 Inde, pigeons, now an hurtfull foule by reason of their multitudes,
 and number of houses dailie erected for their increase (which the
 bowres of the countrie call in scorne almes houses, and dens of
 theeues, and such like) wherof there is great plentie in euerie
 farmers yard. They are kept there also to be sold either for readie
 monie in the open markets, or else to be spent at home in good
 companie amongst their neighbors without reprehension or fines.
 Neither are we so miserable in England (a thing onelie granted vnto vs
 by the especiall grace of God, and libertie of our princes) as to dine
 or sup with a quarter of a hen, or to make so great a repast with a
 cocks combe, as they doo in some other countries: but if occasion
 serue, the whole carcasses of manie capons, hens, pigeons, and such
 like doo oft go to wracke, beside beefe, mutton, veale, and lambe: all
 which at euerie feast are taken for necessarie dishes amongest the
 communaltie of England.

 The gelding of cocks, whereby capons are made, is an ancient practise
 brought in of old time by the Romans when they dwelt here in this
 land: but the gelding of turkies or Indish peacocks is a newer deuise:
 and certeinlie not vsed amisse, sith the rankenesse of that bird is
 verie much abated thereby, and the strong taste of the flesh in
 sundrie wise amended. If I should say that ganders grow also to be
 gelded, I suppose that some will laugh me to scorne, neither haue I
 tasted at anie time of such a foule so serued, yet haue I heard it
 more than once to be vsed in the countrie, where their geese are
 driuen to the field like heards of cattell by a gooseheard, a toie
 also no lesse to be maruelled at than the other. For as it is rare to
 heare of a gelded gander, so is it strange to me to see or heare of
 geese to be led to the field like sheepe: yet so it is, & their
 gooseheard carieth a rattle of paper or parchment with him, when he
 goeth about in the morning to gather his goslings togither, the noise
 whereof commeth no sooner to their eares, than they fall to gagling,
 and hasten to go with him. If it happen that the gates be not yet
 open, or that none of the house be stirring, it is ridiculous to see
 how they will peepe vnder the doores, and neuer leaue creaking and
 gagling till they be let out vnto him to ouertake their fellowes. With
 vs where I dwell they are not kept in this sort, nor in manie other
 places, neither are they kept so much for their bodies as their
 feathers. Some hold furthermore an opinion, that in ouer ranke soiles
 their doong dooth so qualifie the batablenesse of the soile, that
 their cattell is thereby kept from the garget, and sundrie other
 diseases, although some of them come to their ends now and then, by
 licking vp of their feathers. I might here make mention of other
 foules producted by the industrie of man, as betweene the fesant cocke
 and doonghill hen, or betweene the fesant and the ringdooue, the
 peacocke and the turkie hen, the partrich and the pigeon: but sith I
 haue no more knowledge of these, than what I haue gotten by mine eare,
 I will not meddle with them. Yet Cardan speaking of the second sort,
 dooth affirme it to be a foule of excellent beautie. I would likewise
 intreat of other foules which we repute vncleane, as rauens, crowes,
 pies, choughes, rookes, kites, iaies, ringtailes, starlings,
 woodspikes, woodnawes, rauens, &c: but sith they abound in all
 countries, though peraduenture most of all in England (by reason of
 our negligence) I shall not need to spend anie time in the rehearsall
 of them. Neither are our crowes and choughs cherished of purpose to
 catch vp the woormes that breed in our soiles (as Polydor supposeth)
 sith there are no vplandish townes but haue (or should haue) nets of
 their owne in store to catch them withall. Sundrie acts of parlement
 are likewise made for their vtter destruction, as also the spoile of
 other rauenous fouls hurtfull to pultrie, conies, lambs, and kids,
 whose valuation of reward to him that killeth them is after the head:
 a deuise brought from the Goths, who had the like ordinance for the
 destruction of their white crowes, and tale made by the becke, which
 killed both lambs and pigs. The like order is taken with vs for our
 vermines, as with them also for the rootage out of their wild beasts,
 sauing that they spared their greatest beares, especiallie the white,
 whose skins are by custome & priuilege reserued to couer those
 planchers wherevpon their priests doo stand at Masse, least he should
 take some vnkind cold in such a long peece of worke: and happie is the
 man that may prouide them for him, for he shall haue pardon inough for
 that so religious an act, to last if he will till doomes day doo
 approch; and manie thousands after. Nothing therefore can be more
 vnlikelie to be true, than that these noisome creatures are nourished
 amongst vs to deuoure our wormes, which doo not abound much more in
 England than elsewhere in other countries of the maine. It may be that
 some looke for a discourse also of our other foules in this place at
 my hand, as nightingales, thrushes, blackebirds, mauises, ruddocks,
 redstarts or dunocks, larkes, tiuits, kingsfishers, buntings, turtles
 white or graie, linets, bulfinshes, goldfinshes, washtailes,
 cheriecrackers, yellowhamers, felfares, &c: but I should then spend
 more time vpon them than is conuenient. Neither will I speake of our
 costlie and curious auiaries dailie made for the better hearing of
 their melodie, and obseruation of their natures: but I cease also to
 go anie further in these things, hauing (as I thinke) said inough
 alreadie of these that I haue named.




 OF FISH VSUALLIE TAKEN VPON OUR COASTS.

 CHAP. III.


 I haue in my description of waters, as occasion hath serued, intreated
 of the names of some of the seuerall fishes which are commonlie to bee
 found in our riuers. Neuerthelesse as euerie water hath a sundrie
 mixture, and therefore is not stored with euerie kind: so there is
 almost no house, euen of the meanest bowres, which haue not one or mo
 ponds or holes made for reseruation of water vnstored with some of
 them, as with tench, carpe, breame, roch, dace, eeles, or such like as
 will liue and breed togither. Certes it is not possible for me to
 deliuer the names of all such kinds of fishes as our riuers are found
 to beare: yet least I should seeme iniurious to the reader, in not
 deliuering so manie of them as haue beene brought to my knowledge, I
 will not let to set them downe as they doo come to mind. Besides the
 salmons therefore, which are not to be taken from the middest of
 September to the middest of Nouember, and are verie plentifull in our
 greatest riuers, as their yoong store are not to be touched from mid
 Aprill vnto Midsummer, we haue the trout, barbell, graile, powt,
 cheuin, pike, goodgeon, smelt, perch, menan, shrimpes, creuises,
 lampreies, and such like, whose preseruation is prouided for by verie
 sharpe lawes, not onelie in our riuers, but also in plashes or lakes
 and ponds, which otherwise would bring small profit to the owners, and
 doo much harme by continuall maintenance of idle persons, who would
 spend their whole times vpon their bankes, not coueting to labour with
 their hands, nor follow anie good trade. Of all these there are none
 more preiudiciall to their neighbours that dwell in the same water,
 than the pike and eele, which commonlie deuoure such fish or frie and
 spawne as they may get and come by. Neuerthelesse the pike is freend
 vnto the tench, as to his leach & surgeon. For when the fishmonger
 hath opened his side and laid out his riuet and fat vnto the buier,
 for the better vtterance of his ware, and can not make him away at
 that present, he laieth the same againe into the proper place, and
 sowing vp the wound, he restoreth him to the pond where tenches are,
 who neuer cease to sucke and licke his greeued place, till they haue
 restored him to health, and made him readie to come againe to the
 stall, when his turne shall come about. I might here make report how
 the pike, carpe, and some other of our riuer fishes are sold by inches
 of cleane fish, from the eies or gilles to the crotch of the tailes,
 but it is needlesse: also how the pike as he ageth receiueth diuerse
 names, as from a frie to a gilthed, from a gilthed to a pod, from a
 pod to a iacke, from a iacke to a pickerell, from a pickerell to a
 pike, and last of all to a luce; also that a salmon is the first yeare
 a grauellin, and commonlie so big as an herring, the second a salmon
 peale, the third a pug, and the fourth a salmon: but this is in like
 sort vnnecessarie.

 I might finallie tell you, how that in fennie riuers sides if you cut
 a turffe, and laie it with the grasse downewards, vpon the earth, in
 such sort as the water may touch it as it passeth by, you shall haue a
 brood of eeles, it would seeme a wonder; and yet it is beleeued with
 no lesse assurance of some, than that an horse haire laid in a pale
 full of the like water will in short time stirre and become a liuing
 creature. But sith the certeintie of these things is rather prooued by
 few than the certeintie of them knowne vnto manie, I let it passe at
 this time. Neuerthelesse this is generallie obserued in the
 maintenance of frie so well in riuers as in ponds, that in the time of
 spawne we vse to throw in faggots made of willow and sallow, and now
 and then of bushes for want of the other, whereby such spawne as
 falleth into the same is preserued and kept from the pike, perch, eele
 and other fish, of which the carpe also will feed vpon his owne, and
 thereby hinder the store and increase of proper kind. Some vse in
 euerie fift or seauenth yeere to laie their great ponds drie for all
 the summer time, to the end they may gather grasse, and a thin swart
 for the fish to feed vpon; and afterwards store them with breeders,
 after the water be let of new againe into them: finallie, when they
 haue spawned, they draw out the breeders, leauing not aboue foure or
 six behind, euen in the greatest ponds, by meanes whereof the rest doo
 prosper the better: and this obseruation is most vsed in carpe and
 breame; as for perch (a delicate fish) it prospereth euerie where, I
 meane so well in ponds as riuers, and also in motes and pittes, as I
 doo know by experience, though their bottoms be but claie. More would
 I write of our fresh fish, if anie more were needfull; wherefore I
 will now turne ouer vnto such of the salt water as are taken vpon our
 coasts. As our foules therefore haue their seasons, so likewise haue
 all our sorts of sea fish: whereby it commeth to passe that none, or
 at the leastwise verie few of them are to be had at all times.
 Neuerthelesse, the seas that inuiron our coasts, are of all other most
 plentifull: for as by reason of their depth they are a great succour,
 so our low shores minister great plentie of food vnto the fish that
 come thereto, no place being void or barren, either through want of
 food for them, or the falles of filthie riuers, which naturallie
 annoie them. In December therefore and Ianuarie we commonlie abound in
 herring and red fish, as rochet, and gurnard. In Februarie and March
 we feed on plaice, trowts, turbut, muskles, &c. In April and Maie,
 with makrell, and cockles. In Iune and Iulie, with conger. In August
 and September, with haddocke and herring: and the two moneths insuing
 with the same, as also thornbacke and reigh of all sorts; all which
 are the most vsuall, and wherewith our common sort are best of all
 refreshed.

 For mine owne part I am greatlie acquainted neither with the seasons,
 nor yet with the fish it selfe: and therefore if I should take vpon me
 to describe or speake of either of them absolutelie, I should
 enterprise more than I am able to performe, and go in hand with a
 greater matter than I can well bring about. It shall suffice therefore
 to declare what sorts of fishes I haue most often seene, to the end I
 may not altogither passe ouer this chapter without the rehersall of
 something, although the whole summe of that which I haue to saie be
 nothing indeed, if the performance of a full discourse hereof be anie
 thing hardlie required.

 Of fishes therefore as I find fiue sorts, the flat, the round, the
 [Sidenote: Flat fish.]
 long, the legged and shelled: so the flat are diuided into the smooth,
 scaled and tailed. Of the first are the plaice, the but, the turbut,
 birt, floke or sea flounder, dorreie, dab, &c. Of the second the
 soles, &c. Of the third, our chaits, maidens, kingsons, flath and
 thornbacke, whereof the greater be for the most part either dried and
 carried into other countries, or sodden, sowsed, & eaten here at home,
 whilest the lesser be fried or buttered; soone after they be taken as
 prouision not to be kept long for feare of putrifaction. Vnder the
 [Sidenote: Round fish.]
 round kinds are commonlie comprehended lumps, an vglie fish to sight,
 and yet verie delicat in eating, if it be kindlie dressed: the whiting
 (an old waiter or seruitor in the court) the rochet, sea breame,
 pirle, hake, sea trowt, gurnard, haddocke, cod, herring, pilchard,
 sprat, and such like. And these are they whereof I haue best
 knowledge, and be commonlie to be had in their times vpon our coasts.
 Vnder this kind also are all the great fish conteined, as the seale,
 the dolphin, the porpoise, the thirlepole, whale, and whatsoeuer is
 [Sidenote: Long fish.]
 round of bodie be it neuer so great and huge. Of the long sort are
 congers, eeles, garefish, and such other of that forme. Finallie, of
 [Sidenote: Legged fish.]
 the legged kind we haue not manie, neither haue I seene anie more of
 this sort than the Polypus called in English the lobstar, crafish or
 creuis, and the crab. As for the little crafishes they are not taken
 in the sea, but plentifullie in our fresh riuers in banks, and vnder
 stones, where they keepe themselues in most secret maner, and oft by
 likenesse of colour with the stones among which they lie, deceiue euen
 the skilfull takers of them, except they vse great diligence. Carolus
 Stephanus in his maison rustique, doubted whether these lobstars be
 fish or not; and in the end concludeth them to grow of the purgation
 of the water as dooth the frog, and these also not to be eaten, for
 that they be strong and verie hard of digestion. But hereof let other
 determine further.

 I might here speake of sundrie other fishes now and then taken also
 vpon our coasts: but sith my mind is onelie to touch either all such
 as are vsuallie gotten, or so manie of them onelie as I can well
 rehearse vpon certeine knowledge, I thinke it good at this time to
 forbeare the further intreatie of them. As touching the shellie sort,
 we haue plentie of oisters, whose valure in old time for their
 sweetnesse was not vnknowne in Rome (although Mutianus as Plinie
 noteth lib. 32, cap. 6. preferre the Cyzicene before them) and these
 we haue in like maner of diuerse quantities, and no lesse varietie
 also of our muskles and cockles. We haue in like sort no small store
 of great whelkes, scalops and perewinkles, and each of them brought
 farre into the land from the sea coast in their seuerall seasons. And
 albeit our oisters are generallie forborne in the foure hot moneths of
 the yeare, that is to saie, Maie, Iune, Iulie, and August, which are
 void of the letter R: yet in some places they be continuallie eaten,
 where they be kept in pits as I haue knowne by experience. And thus
 much of our sea fish as a man in maner vtterlie vnacquainted with
 their diuersitie of kinds: yet so much haue I yeelded to doo, hoping
 hereafter to saie somewhat more, and more orderlie of them, if it
 shall please God that I may liue and haue leasure once againe to
 peruse this treatise, and so make vp a perfect peece of worke, of that
 which as you now see is verie slenderlie attempted and begun.




 OF SAUAGE BEASTS AND VERMINES.

 CHAP. IV.


 It is none of the least blessings wherewith God hath indued this
 Iland, that it is void of noisome beasts, as lions, beares, tigers,
 pardes, wolfes, & such like, by means whereof our countrimen may
 trauell in safetie, & our herds and flocks remaine for the most part
 abroad in the field without anie herdman or keeper.

 This is cheefelie spoken of the south and southwest parts of the
 Iland. For wheras we that dwell on this side of the Twed, may safelie
 boast of our securitie in this behalfe: yet cannot the Scots doo the
 like in euerie point within their kingdome, sith they haue greeuous
 [Sidenote: Woolfes.]
 woolfes and cruell foxes, beside some other of like disposition
 continuallie conuersant among them, to the generall hinderance of
 their husbandmen, and no small damage vnto the inhabiters of those
 quarters. The happie and fortunate want of these beasts in England is
 vniuersallie ascribed to the politike gouernement of king Edgar, who
 to the intent the whole countrie might once be clensed and clearelie
 rid of them, charged the conquered Welshmen (who were then pestered
 with these rauenous creatures aboue measure) to paie him a yearelie
 [Sidenote: Tribute of Woolfes skins.]
 tribute of woolfes skinnes, to be gathered within the land. He
 appointed them thereto a certeine number of three hundred, with free
 libertie for their prince to hunt & pursue them ouer all quarters of
 the realme; as our chronicles doo report. Some there be which write
 how Ludwall prince of Wales paid yearelie to king Edgar this tribute
 of three hundred woolfes, whose carcases being brought into Lhoegres,
 were buried at Wolfpit in Cambridgeshire, and that by meanes thereof
 within the compasse and terme of foure yeares, none of those noisome
 creatures were left to be heard of within Wales and England. Since
 this time also we read not that anie woolfe hath beene seene here that
 hath beene bred within the bounds and limits of our countrie: howbeit
 there haue beene diuerse brought ouer from beyond the seas for
 greedinesse of gaine, and to make monie onlie by the gasing and gaping
 of our people vpon them, who couet oft to see them being strange
 beasts in their eies, and sildome knowne (as I haue said) in England.

 Lions we haue had verie manie in the north parts of Scotland, and
 those with maines of no lesse force than they of Mauritania were
 sometimes reported to be; but how and when they were destroied as yet
 I doo not read. They had in like sort no lesse plentie of wild and
 cruell buls, which the princes and their nobilitie in the frugall time
 of the land did hunt, and follow for the triall of their manhood, and
 by pursute either on horssebacke or foot in armor; notwithstanding
 that manie times they were dangerouslie assailed by them. But both
 these sauage cretures are now not heard of, or at the least wise the
 later scarselie known in the south parts. Howbeit this I gather by
 their being here, that our Iland was not cut from the maine by the
 great deluge or flood of Noah: but long after, otherwise the
 generation of those & other like creatures could not haue extended
 into our Ilands. For, that anie man would of set purpose replenish the
 countrie with them for his pleasure and pastime in hunting, I can in
 no wise beleeue.

 [Sidenote: Foxes.]
 [Sidenote: Badgers.]
 Of foxes we haue some but no great store, and also badgers in our
 sandie & light grounds, where woods, firzes, broome, and plentie of
 shrubs are to shrowd them in, when they be from their borrowes, and
 thereto warrens of conies at hand to feed vpon at will. Otherwise in
 claie, which we call the cledgie mould, we sildom heare of anie,
 bicause the moisture and toughnesse of the soile is such, as will not
 suffer them to draw and make their borrowes deepe. Certes if I may
 freelie saie what I thinke, I suppose that these two kinds (I meane
 foxes and badgers) are rather preserued by gentlemen to hunt and haue
 pastime withall at their owne pleasures, than otherwise suffered to
 liue, as not able to be destroied bicause of their great numbers. For
 such is the scantitie of them here in England, in comparison of the
 plentie that is to be seene in other countries, and so earnestlie are
 the inhabitants bent to root them out, that except it had beene to
 beare thus with the recreations of their superiors in this behalfe, it
 could not otherwise haue beene chosen, but that they should haue beene
 vtterlie destroied by manie yeares agone.

 I might here intreat largelie of other vermine, as the polcat, the
 miniuer, the weasell, stote, fulmart, squirrill, fitchew, and such
 like, which Cardan includeth vnder the word Mustela: also of the
 [Sidenote: Beuers.]
 otter, and likewise of the beuer, whose hinder feet and taile onlie
 are supposed to be fish. Certes the taile of this beast is like vnto a
 thin whetstone, as the bodie vnto a monsterous rat: the beast also it
 selfe is of such force in the teeth, that it will gnaw an hole through
 a thicke planke, or shere thorough a dubble billet in a night; it
 loueth also the stillest riuers: & it is giuen to them by nature, to
 go by flockes vnto the woods at hand, where they gather sticks
 wherewith to build their nests, wherein their bodies lie drie aboue
 the water, although they so prouide most commonlie, that their tailes
 may hang within the same. It is also reported that their said tailes
 are a delicate dish, and their stones of such medicinable force, that
 (as Vertomannus saith) foure men smelling vnto them each after other
 did bleed at the nose through their attractiue force, proceeding from
 a vehement sauour wherewith they are indued: there is greatest plentie
 of them in Persia, cheefelie about Balascham, from whence they and
 their dried cods are brought into all quarters of the world, though
 not without some forgerie by such as prouide them. And of all these
 here remembred, as the first sorts are plentifull in euerie wood and
 hedgerow: so these latter, especiallie the otter (for to saie the
 truth we haue not manie beuers, but onelie in the Teifie in Wales) is
 not wanting or to seeke in manie, but most streams and riuers of this
 Ile: but it shall suffice in this sort to haue named them as I doo
 [Sidenote: Marterns.]
 finallie the marterne, a beast of the chase, although for number I
 worthilie doubt whether that of our beuers or marterns may be thought
 to be the lesse.

 Other pernicious beasts we haue not, except you repute the great
 plentie of red & fallow deere, whose colours are oft garled white and
 blacke, all white or all blacke, and store of conies amongst the
 hurtfull sort. Which although that of themselues they are not
 offensiue at all, yet their great numbers are thought to be verie
 preiudiciall, and therfore iustlie reprooued of many; as are in like
 sort our huge flocks of sheepe, whereon the greatest part of our soile
 is emploied almost in euerie place, and yet our mutton, wooll, and
 felles neuer the better cheape. The yoong males which our fallow deere
 doo bring foorth, are commonlie named according to their seuerall
 ages: for the first yeere it is a fawne, the second a puckot, the
 third a serell, the fourth a soare, the fift a bucke of the first
 head; not bearing the name of a bucke till he be fiue yeers old: and
 from hencefoorth his age is commonlie knowne by his head or horns.
 Howbeit this notice of his yeers is not so certeine, but that the best
 woodman may now and then be deceiued in that account: for in some
 grounds a bucke of the first head will be so well headed as another in
 a high rowtie soile will be in the fourth. It is also much to be
 maruelled at, that whereas they doo yeerelie mew and cast their horns;
 yet in fighting they neuer breake off where they doo grife or mew.
 Furthermore, in examining the condition of our red deere, I find that
 the yoong male is called in the first yeere a calfe, in the second a
 broket, the third a spaie, the fourth a stagon or stag, the fift a
 great stag, the sixt an hart, and so foorth vnto his death. And with
 him in degree of venerie are accounted the hare, bore, and woolfe. The
 fallow deere as bucks and does, are nourished in parkes, and conies in
 warrens and burrowes. As for hares, they run at their owne aduenture,
 except some gentleman or other (for his pleasure) doo make an
 [Sidenote: Stags.]
 inclosure for them. Of these also the stag is accounted for the most
 noble game, the fallow deere is the next, then the roe, whereof we
 haue indifferent store; and last of all the hare, not the least in
 estimation, because the hunting of that seelie beast is mother to all
 the terms, blasts, and artificiall deuises that hunters doo vse. All
 which (notwithstanding our custome) are pastimes more meet for ladies
 and gentlewomen to exercise (whatsoeuer Franciscus Patritius saith to
 the contrarie in his institution of a prince) than for men of courage
 to follow, whose hunting should practise their armes in tasting of
 their manhood, and dealing with such beasts as eftsoones will turne
 againe, and offer them the hardest rather than their horsses feet,
 which manie times may carrie them with dishonour from the field.
 Surelie this noble kind of hunting onelie did great princes frequent
 in times past, as it may yet appeere by the histories of their times,
 especiallie of Alexander, who at vacant times hunted the tiger, the
 pard, the bore, and the beare, but most willinglie lions, because of
 the honorable estimation of that beast; insomuch that at one time he
 caused an od or chosen lion (for force and beautie) to be let foorth
 vnto him hand to hand, with whome he had much businesse, albeit that
 in the end he ouerthrew and killed the beast. Herevnto beside that
 which we read of the vsuall hunting of the princes and kings of
 Scotland, of the wild bull, woolfe, &c: the example of king Henrie the
 first of England, who disdaining (as he termed them) to follow or
 pursue cowards, cherished of set purpose sundrie kinds of wild beasts,
 as bears, libards, ounces, lions at Woodstocke, & one or two other
 places in England, which he walled about with hard stone, An. 1120,
 and where he would often fight with some one of them hand to hand,
 when they did turne againe and make anie raise vpon him: but cheeflie
 he loued to hunt the lion and the bore, which are both verie dangerous
 exercises, especiallie that with the lion, except some policie be
 found wherwith to trouble his eiesight in anie manner of wise. For
 though the bore be fierce, and hath learned by nature to harden his
 flesh and skin against the trees, to sharpen his teeth, and defile
 himselfe with earth, thereby to prohibit the entrance of the weapons:
 yet is the sport somewhat more easie, especiallie where two stand so
 neere togither, that the one (if need be) may helpe and be a succour
 to the other. Neither would he cease for all this to follow his
 pastime, either on horssebacke or on foot, as occasion serued, much
 like the yoonger Cyrus. I haue read of wild bores and bulles to haue
 beene about Blackleie neere Manchester, whither the said prince would
 now and then resort also for his solace in that behalfe, as also to
 come by those excellent falcons then bred thereabouts; but now they
 are gone, especiallie the bulles, as I haue said alreadie.

 King Henrie the fift in his beginning thought it a meere scofferie to
 pursue anie fallow deere with hounds or greihounds, but supposed
 himselfe alwaies to haue doone a sufficient act when he had tired them
 by his owne trauell on foot, and so killed them with his hands in the
 vpshot of that exercise and end of his recreation. Certes herein he
 resembled Polymnestor Milesius, of whome it is written, how he ran so
 swiftlie, that he would and did verie often ouertake hares for his
 pleasure, which I can hardlie beleeue: and therefore much lesse that
 one Lidas did run so lightlie and swiftlie after like game, that as he
 passed ouer the sand, he left not so much as the prints of his feet
 behind him. And thus did verie manie in like sort with the hart (as I
 doo read) but this I thinke was verie long agone, when men were farre
 higher and swifter than they are now: and yet I denie not, but rather
 grant willinglie that the hunting of the red deere is a right
 princelie pastime. In diuerse forren countries they cause their red
 and fallow deere to draw the plough, as we doo our oxen and horsses.
 [Sidenote: Hinds haue beene milked.]
 In some places also they milke their hinds as we doo here our kine and
 goats. And the experience of this latter is noted by Giraldus
 Cambrensis to haue beene seene and vsed in Wales, where he did eat
 cheese made of hinds milke, at such time as Baldwine archbishop of
 Canturburie preached the croisad there, when they were both lodged in
 a gentlemans house, whose wife of purpose kept a deirie of the same.
 As for the plowing with vres (which I suppose to be vnlikelie) because
 they are (in mine opinion) vntameable and alkes a thing commonlie vsed
 in the east countries; here is no place to speake of it, since we want
 these kind of beasts, neither is it my purpose to intreat at large of
 other things than are to be seene in England. Wherfore I will omit to
 saie anie more of wild and sauage beasts at this time, thinking my
 selfe to haue spoken alreadie sufficientlie of this matter, if not too
 much in the iudgement of the curious.




 OF HAWKES AND RAUENOUS FOULES.

 CHAP. V.


 I can not make (as yet) anie iust report how manie sorts of hawkes are
 bred within this realme. Howbeit which of those that are vsuallie had
 among vs are disclosed with in this land, I thinke it more easie and
 lesse difficult to set downe. First of all therefore that we haue the
 egle, common experience dooth euidentlie confirme, and diuerse of our
 rockes whereon they breed, if speach did serue, could well declare the
 same. But the most excellent aierie of all is not much from Chester,
 at a castell called Dinas Bren, sometime builded by Brennus, as our
 writers doo remember. Certes this castell is no great thing, but yet a
 pile sometime verie strong and inaccessible for enimies, though now
 all ruinous as manie other are. It standeth vpon an hard rocke, in the
 side whereof an eagle breedeth euerie yeare. This also is notable in
 the ouerthrow of hir nest (a thing oft attempted) that he which goeth
 thither must be sure of two large baskets, and so prouide to be let
 downe thereto, that he may sit in the one and be couered with the
 other: for otherwise the eagle would kill him, and teare the flesh
 from his bones with hir sharpe talons though his apparell were neuer
 so good. The common people call this foule an erne, but as I am
 ignorant whither the word eagle and erne doo shew anie difference of
 sexe, I meane betweene the male and female, so we haue great store of
 them. And neere to the places where they breed, the commons complaine
 of great harme to be doone by them in their fields: for they are able
 to beare a yoong lambe or kid vnto their neasts, therwith to feed
 their yoong and come againe for more. I was once of the opinion that
 there was a diuersitie of kind betweene the eagle and the erne, till I
 perceiued that our nation vsed the word erne in most places for the
 eagle. We haue also the lanner and the lanneret: the tersell and the
 gosehawke: the musket and the sparhawke: the iacke and the hobbie: and
 finallie some (though verie few) marlions. And these are all the
 hawkes that I doo heare as yet to be bred within this Iland. Howbeit
 as these are not wanting with vs, so are they not verie plentifull:
 wherefore such as delite in hawking doo make their chiefe purueiance &
 prouision for the same out of Danske, Germanie, and the Eastcountries,
 from whence we haue them in great abundance, and at excessiue prices,
 whereas at home and where they be bred they are sold for almost right
 naught, and vsuallie brought to the markets as chickins, pullets and
 pigeons are with vs, and there bought vp to be eaten (as we doo the
 aforesaid foules) almost of euerie man. It is said that the sparhawke
 preieth not vpon the foule in the morning that she taketh ouer euen,
 but as loth to haue double benefit by one seelie foule, dooth let it
 go to make some shift for it selfe. But hereof as I stand in some
 doubt, so this I find among the writers worthie the noting, that the
 sparhawke is enimie to yoong children, as is also the ape; but of the
 pecocke she is maruellouslie afraid & so appalled, that all courage &
 stomach for a time is taken from hir vpon the sight thereof. But to
 proceed with the rest. Of other rauenous birds we haue also verie
 great plentie, as the bussard, the kite, the ringtaile, dunkite, &
 such as often annoie our countrie dames by spoiling of their yoong
 breeds of chickens, duckes and goslings, wherevnto our verie rauens
 and crowes haue learned also the waie: and so much are our rauens
 giuen to this kind of spoile, that some idle and curious heads of set
 purpose haue manned, reclaimed, and vsed them in steed of hawkes, when
 other could not be had. Some doo imagine that the rauen should be the
 vulture, and I was almost persuaded in times past to beleeue the same:
 but finding of late a description of the vulture, which better agreeth
 with the forme of a second kind of eagle, I freelie surcease to be
 longer of that opinion: for as it hath after a sort the shape, colour,
 and quantitie of an eagle, so are the legs and feet more hairie and
 rough, their sides vnder their wings better couered with thicke downe
 (wherewith also their gorge or a part of their brest vnder their
 throtes is armed, and not with fethers) than are the like parts of the
 eagle, and vnto which portraiture there is no member of the rauen (who
 is also verie blacke of colour) that can haue anie resemblance: we
 haue none of them in England to my knowledge, if we haue, they go
 generallie vnder the name of eagle or erne. Neither haue we the
 pygargus or gripe, wherefore I haue no occasion to intreat further. I
 haue seene the carren crowes so cunning also by their owne industrie
 of late, that they haue vsed to soare ouer great riuers (as the Thames
 for example) & suddenlie comming downe haue caught a small fish in
 their feet & gone awaie withall without wetting of their wings. And
 euen at this present the aforesaid riuer is not without some of them,
 a thing (in my opinion) not a little to be wondered at. We haue also
 ospraies which breed with vs in parks and woods, wherby the keepers of
 the same doo reape in breeding time no small commoditie: for so soone
 almost as the yoong are hatched, they tie them to the but ends or
 ground ends of sundrie trees, where the old ones finding them, doo
 neuer cease to bring fish vnto them, which the keepers take & eat from
 them, and commonlie is such as is well fed, or not of the worst sort.
 It hath not beene my hap hitherto to see anie of these foules, &
 partlie through mine owne negligence: but I heare that it hath one
 foot like an hawke to catch hold withall, and another resembling a
 goose wherewith to swim; but whether it be so or not so, I refer the
 further search and triall thereof vnto some other. This neuertheles is
 certeine that both aliue and dead, yea euen hir verie oile is a
 deadlie terrour to such fish as come within the wind of it. There is
 no cause wherefore I should describe the cormorant amongst hawkes, of
 which some be blacke and manie pied chiefelie about the Ile of Elie,
 where they are taken for the night rauen, except I should call him a
 water hawke. But sith such dealing is not conuenient, let vs now see
 what may be said of our venemous wormes, and how manie kinds we haue
 of them within our realme and countrie.




 OF VENEMOUS BEASTS.

 CHAP. VI.


 If I should go about to make anie long discourse of venemous beasts or
 wormes bred in England, I should attempt more than occasion it selfe
 would readilie offer, sith we haue verie few worms, but no beasts at
 all, that are thought by their naturall qualities to be either
 venemous or hurtfull. First of all therefore we haue the adder (in our
 old Saxon toong called an atter) which some men doo not rashlie take
 to be the viper. Certes if it be so, then is it not the viper author
 [Sidenote: * _Galenus de Theriaca ad Pisonem._
 * _Plin. lib. 10. cap. 62._]
 of the death of hir [*] parents, as some histories affirme; and
 thereto Encelius a late writer in his "De re metallica," lib. 3. cap.
 38. where he maketh mention of a she adder which he saw in Sala, whose
 wombe (as he saith) was eaten out after a like fashion, hir yoong ones
 lieng by hir in the sunne shine, as if they had beene earth worms.
 Neuerthelesse as he nameth them "Viperas," so he calleth the male
 Echis, and the female Echidna, concluding in the end that Echis is the
 same serpent which his countrimen to this daie call Ein atter, as I
 haue also noted before out of a Saxon dictionarie. For my part I am
 persuaded that the slaughter of their parents is either not true at
 all, or not alwaies (although I doubt not but that nature hath right
 well prouided to inhibit their superfluous increase by some meanes or
 other) and so much the rather am I led herevnto, for that I gather by
 Nicander, that of all venemous worms the viper onelie bringeth out hir
 yoong aliue, and therefore is called in Latine "Vipera quasi
 viuipara:" but of hir owne death he dooth not (to my remembrance) saie
 any thing. It is testified also by other in other words, & to the like
 sense, that "Echis id est vipera sola ex serpentibus non oua sed
 animalia parit." And it may well be, for I remember that I haue read
 in Philostratus "De vita Appollonij,"

 [Sidenote: Adder or viper.]
 how he saw a viper licking hir yoong. I did see an adder once my selfe
 that laie (as I thought) sleeping on a moulehill, out of whose mouth
 came eleuen yoong adders of twelue or thirteene inches in length a
 peece, which plaied to and fro in the grasse one with another, till
 some of them espied me. So soone therefore as they saw my face, they
 [Sidenote: See _Aristotle Animalium lib. 5. cap. vltimo, &
 Theophrast. lib. 7. cap. 13_.]
 ran againe into the mouth of their dam, whome I killed, and then found
 each of them shrowded in a distinct cell or pannicle in hir bellie,
 much like vnto a soft white iellie, which maketh me to be of the
 opinion that our adder is the viper indeed. The colour of their skin
 is for the most part like rustie iron or iron graie: but such as be
 verie old resemble a ruddie blew, & as once in the yeare, to wit, in
 Aprill or about the beginning of Maie they cast their old skins
 (whereby as it is thought their age reneweth) so their stinging
 bringeth death without present remedie be at hand, the wounded neuer
 ceasing to swell, neither the venem to worke till the skin of the one
 breake, and the other ascend vpward to the hart, where it finisheth
 the naturall effect, except the iuice of dragons (in Latine called
 "Dracunculus minor") be speedilie ministred and dronke in strong ale,
 or else some other medicine taken of like force, that may counteruaile
 and ouercome the venem of the same. The length of them is most
 commonlie two foot and somwhat more, but seldome dooth it extend vnto
 two foot six inches, except it be in some rare and monsterous one:
 [Sidenote: Snakes.]
 whereas our snakes are much longer, and seene sometimes to surmount a
 yard, or three foot, although their poison be nothing so grieuous and
 deadlie as the others. Our adders lie in winter vnder stones, as
 Aristotle also saith of the viper Lib. 8. cap. 15. and in holes of the
 earth, rotten stubs of trees, and amongst the dead leaues: but in the
 heat of the summer they come abroad, and lie either round on heapes,
 or at length vpon some hillocke, or elsewhere in the grasse. They are
 found onelie in our woodland countries and highest grounds, where
 sometimes (though seldome) a speckled stone called Echites, in Dutch
 "Ein atter stein," is gotten out of their dried carcases, which diuers
 [Sidenote: _Sol. cap. 40. Plin. lib. 37. cap. 11._]
 report to be good against their poison. As for our snakes, which in
 Latine are properlie named "Angues," they commonlie are seene in
 moores, fens, lomie wals, and low bottoms.

 [Sidenote: Todes.]
 [Sidenote: Frogs.]
 [Sidenote: Sloworme.]
 And as we haue great store of todes where adders commonlie are found,
 so doo frogs abound where snakes doo keepe their residence. We haue
 also the sloworme, which is blacke and graiesh of colour, and somewhat
 shorter than an adder. I was at the killing once of one of them, and
 thereby perceiued that she was not so called of anie want of nimble
 motion, but rather of the contrarie. Neuerthelesse we haue a blind
 worme to be found vnder logs in woods, and timber that hath lien long
 in a place, which some also doo call (and vpon better ground) by the
 name of slow worms, and they are knowen easilie by their more or lesse
 varietie of striped colours, drawen long waies from their heads, their
 whole bodies little exceeding a foot in length, & yet is there venem
 deadlie. This also is not to be omitted, that now and then in our
 fennie countries, other kinds of serpents are found of greater
 quantitie than either our adder or our snake: but as these are not
 ordinarie and oft to be seene, so I meane not to intreat of them among
 our common annoiances. Neither haue we the scorpion, a plague of God
 sent not long since into Italie, and whose poison (as Apollodorus
 saith) is white, neither the tarantula or Neopolitane spider, whose
 poison bringeth death, except musike be at hand. Wherfore I suppose
 our countrie to be the more happie (I meane in part) for that it is
 void of these two grieuous annoiances, wherewith other nations are
 plagued.

 [Sidenote: Efts.]
 [Sidenote: Swifts.]
 We haue also efts, both of the land and water, and likewise the
 noisome swifts, whereof to saie anie more it should be but losse of
 time, sith they are well knowne; and no region to my knowledge found
 [Sidenote: Flies.]
 to be void of manie of them. As for flies (sith it shall not be amisse
 a little to touch them also) we haue none that can doo hurt or
 [Sidenote: Cutwasted.]
 [Sidenote: Whole bodied.]
 [Sidenote: Hornets.]
 [Sidenote: Waspes.]
 hinderance naturallie vnto anie: for whether they be cut wasted, or
 whole bodied, they are void of poison and all venemous inclination.
 The cut or girt wasted (for so I English the word Insecta) are the
 hornets, waspes, bees, and such like, whereof we haue great store, and
 of which an opinion is conceived, that the first doo breed of the
 corruption of dead horsses, the second of peares and apples corrupted,
 and the last of kine and oxen: which may be true, especiallie the
 first and latter in some parts of the beast, and not their whole
 substances, as also in the second, sith we haue neuer waspes, but when
 our fruit beginneth to wax ripe. In deed Virgil and others speake of a
 generation of bees, by killing or smoothering of a brused bullocke or
 calfe, and laieng his bowels or his flesh wrapped vp in his hide in a
 close house for a certeine season; but how true it is hitherto I haue
 not tried. Yet sure I am of this, that no one liuing creature
 corrupteth without the production of another; as we may see by our
 selues, whose flesh dooth alter into lice; and also in sheepe for
 excessiue numbers of flesh flies, if they be suffered to lie vnburied
 or vneaten by the dogs and swine, who often and happilie preuent such
 needlesse generations.

 As concerning bees, I thinke it good to remember, that wheras some
 ancient writers affirme it to be a commoditie wanting in our Iland, it
 is now found to be nothing so. In old time peraduenture we had none in
 deed, but in my daies there is such plentie of them in maner euerie
 where, that in some vplandish townes, there are one hundred, or two
 hundred hiues of them, although the said hiues are not so huge as
 those of the east countrie, but far lesse, as not able to conteine
 aboue one bushell of corne, or fiue pecks at the most. Plinie (a man
 that of set purpose deliteth to write of woonders) speaking of honie
 noteth that in the north regions the hiues in his time were of such
 quantitie, that some one combe conteined eight foot in length, & yet
 (as it should seeme) he speketh not of the greatest. For in Podolia,
 which is now subiect to the king of Poland, their hiues are so great,
 and combes so abundant, that huge bores ouerturning and falling into
 them, are drowned in the honie, before they can recouer & find the
 meanes to come out.

 [Sidenote: Honie.]
 Our honie also is taken and reputed to be the best, bicause it is
 harder, better wrought, and clenlier vesselled vp, than that which
 commeth from beyond the sea, where they stampe and streine their
 combs, bees, and yoong blowings altogither into the stuffe, as I haue
 beene informed. In vse also of medicine our physicians and
 apothecaries eschew the forren, especiallie that of Spaine and
 Ponthus, by reason of a venemous qualitie naturallie planted in the
 same, as some write, and choose the home made: not onelie by reason of
 our soile, which hath no lesse plentie of wild thime growing therein
 than in Sicilia, & about Athens, and makth the best stuffe; as also
 for that it breedeth (being gotten in haruest time) lesse choler, and
 which is oftentimes (as I haue seene by experience) so white as sugar,
 and corned as if it were salt. Our hiues are made commonlie of rie
 straw, and wadled about with bramble quarters: but some make the same
 of wicker, and cast them ouer with claie. Wee cherish none in trees,
 but set our hiues somewhere on the warmest side of the house,
 prouiding that they may stand drie and without danger both of the
 mouse and moth. This furthermore is to be noted, that wheras in
 vessels of oile, that which is neerest the top is counted the finest,
 and of wine that in the middest; so of honie the best which is
 heauiest and moistest is alwaies next the bottome, and euermore
 casteth and driueth his dregs vpward toward the verie top, contrarie
 to the nature of other liquid substances, whose groonds and leeze doo
 generallie settle downewards. And thus much as by the waie of our bees
 and English honie.

 As for the whole bodied, as the cantharides, and such venemous
 creatures of the same kind, to be abundantlie found in other
 countries, we heare not of them: yet haue we beetles, horseflies,
 turdbugs or borres (called in Latine _Scarabei_) the locust or the
 grashopper (which to me doo seeme to be one thing, as I will anon
 declare) and such like, whereof let other intreat that make an
 exercise in catching of flies, but a far greater sport in offering
 them to spiders. As did Domitian sometime, and an other prince yet
 liuing, who delited so much to see the iollie combats betwixt a stout
 flie and an old spider, that diuerse men haue had great rewards giuen
 them for their painfull prouision of flies made onelie for this
 purpose. Some parasites also in the time of the aforesaid emperour,
 (when they were disposed to laugh at his follie, and yet would seeme
 in appearance to gratifie his fantasticall head with some shew of
 dutifull demenour) could deuise to set their lord on worke, by letting
 a flesh flie priuilie into his chamber, which he foorthwith would
 egerlie haue hunted (all other businesse set apart) and neuer ceased
 till he had caught hir into his fingers: wherevpon arose the prouerbe,
 "Ne musca quidem," vttered first by Vibius Priscus, who being asked
 whether anie bodie was with Domitian, answered, "Ne musca quidem,"
 wherby he noted his follie. There are some cockescombs here and there
 in England, learning it abroad as men transregionate, which make
 account also of this pastime, as of a notable matter, telling what a
 fight is seene betwene them, if either of them be lustie and
 couragious in his kind. One also hath made a booke of the spider and
 the flie, wherein he dealeth so profoundlie, and beyond all measure of
 skill, that neither he himselfe that made it, neither anie one that
 readeth it, can reach vnto the meaning therof. But if those iollie
 fellows in steed of the straw that they thrust into the flies tale (a
 great iniurie no doubt to such a noble champion) would bestow the cost
 to set a fooles cap vpon their owne heads: then might they with more
 securitie and lesse reprehension behold these notable battels.

 Now as concerning the locust, I am led by diuerse of my countrie, who
 (as they say) were either in Germanie, Italie, or Pannonia, 1542, when
 those nations were greatly annoied with that kind of flie, and affirme
 verie constantlie, that they saw none other creature than the
 grashopper, during the time of that annoiance, which was said to come
 to them from the Meotides. In most of our translations also of the
 bible, the word _Locusta_ is Englished a grashopper, and therevnto
 Leuit. 11. it is reputed among the cleane food, otherwise Iohn the
 Baptist would neuer haue liued with them in the wildernesse. In
 [Sidenote: See _Diodorus Sicutus_.]
 Barbarie, Numidia, and sundrie other places of Affrica, as they haue
 beene, so are they eaten to this daie powdred in barels, and therefore
 the people of those parts are called _Acedophagi:_ neuertheles they
 shorten the life of the eaters by the production at the last of an
 irkesome and filthie disease. In India they are three foot long, in
 Ethiopia much shorter, but in England seldome aboue an inch. As for
 the cricket called in Latin _Cicada_, he hath some likelihood, but not
 verie great, with the grashopper, and therefore he is not to be
 brought in as an vmpier in this case. Finallie Matthiolus, and so
 manie as describe the locust, doo set downe none other forme than that
 of our grashopper, which maketh me so much the more to rest vpon my
 former imagination, which is, that the locust and grashopper are one.




 OF OUR ENGLISH DOGS AND THEIR QUALITIES.

 CHAP. VII.


 There is no countrie that maie (as I take it) compare with ours, in
 number, excellencie, and diuersite of dogs. And therefore if
 Polycrates of Samia were now aliue, he would not send to Epyro for
 such merchandize: but to his further cost prouide them out of
 Britaine, as an ornament to his countrie, and peece of husbandrie for
 his common wealth, which he furnished of set purpose with Molossian
 and Lacaonian dogs, as he did the same also with sheepe out of Attica
 and Miletum, gotes from Scyro and Naxus, swine out of Sicilia, and
 artificers out of other places. Howbeit the learned doctor Caius in
 his Latine treatise vnto Gesner "De canibus Anglicis," bringeth them
 all into three sorts: that is, the gentle kind seruing for game: the
 homelie kind apt for sundrie vses: and the currish kind meet for many
 toies. For my part I can say no more of them than he hath doone
 alredie. Wherefore I will here set downe onelie a summe of that which
 he hath written of their names and natures, with the addition of an
 example or two now latelie had in experience, whereby the courages of
 our mastiffes shall yet more largelie appeare. As for those of other
 countries I haue not to deale with them: neither care I to report out
 of Plinie, that dogs were sometime killed in sacrifice, and sometime
 their whelps eaten as a delicate dish, Lib. 29. cap. 4. Wherefore if
 anie man be disposed to read of them, let him resort to Plinie lib. 8.
 cap. 40. who (among other woonders) telleth of an armie of two hundred
 dogs, which fetched a king of the Garamantes out of captiuitie, mawgre
 the resistance of his aduersaries: also to Cardan, lib. 10. "De
 animalibus," Aristotle, &c: who write maruels of them, but none
 further from credit than Cardan, who is not afraid to compare some of
 them for greatnesse with oxen, and some also for smalnesse vnto the
 little field mouse. Neither doo I find anie far writer of great
 antiquitie, that maketh mention of our dogs, Strabo excepted, who
 saith that the Galles did somtime buy vp all our mastiffes, to serue
 in the forewards of their battels, wherein they resembled the
 Colophonians, Castabalenses of Calicute and Phenicia, of whom Plinie
 also speaketh, but they had them not from vs.

 The first sort therefore he diuideth either into such as rowse the
 beast, and continue the chase, or springeth the bird, and bewraieth
 hir flight by pursute. And as these are commonlie called spaniels, so
 the other are named hounds, whereof he maketh eight sorts, of which
 the formost excelleth in perfect smelling, the second in quicke
 espieng, the third in swiftnesse and quickenesse, the fourth in
 smelling and nimblenesse, &c: and the last in subtiltie and
 deceitfulnesse. These (saith Strabo) are most apt for game, and called
 _Sagaces_ by a generall name, not onelie bicause of their skill in
 hunting, but also for that they know their owne and the names of their
 fellowes most exactlie. For if the hunter see anie one to follow
 skilfullie, and with likelihood of good successe, he biddeth the rest
 to harke and follow such a dog, and they eftsoones obeie so soone as
 they heare his name. The first kind of these are also commonlie called
 hariers, whose game is the fox, the hare, the woolfe (if we had anie)
 hart, bucke, badger, otter, polcat, lopstart, wesell, conie, &c: the
 second hight a terrer, and it hunteth the badger and graie onelie: the
 third a bloudhound, whose office is to follow the fierce, and now and
 then to pursue a theefe or beast by his drie foot: the fourth hight a
 gasehound, who hunteth by the eie: the fift a greihound, cherished for
 his strength, swiftnes, and stature, commended by Bratius in his "De
 venatione," and not vnremembred by Hercules Stroza in a like treatise,
 but aboue all other those of Britaine, where he saith:

   ---- & magna spectandi mole Britanni,

 also by Nemesianus, libro Cynegeticon, where he saith:

   Diuisa Britannia mittit
   Veloces nostriq; orbis venatibus aptos,

 of which sort also some be smooth, of sundrie colours, and some shake
 haired: the sixt a liemer, that excelleth in smelling and swift
 running: the seuenth a tumbler: and the eight a theefe, whose offices
 (I meane of the latter two) incline onelie to deceit, wherein they are
 oft so skilfull, that few men would thinke so mischiefous a wit to
 remaine in such sillie creatures. Hauing made this enumeration of
 dogs, which are apt for the chase and hunting, he commeth next to such
 as serue the falcons in their times, whereof he maketh also two sorts.
 One that findeth his game on the land, an other that putteth vp such
 foule as keepeth in the water: and of these this is commonlie most
 vsuall for the net or traine, the other for the hawke, as he dooth
 shew at large. Of the first he saith, that they haue no peculiar names
 assigned to them seuerallie, but each of them is called after the bird
 which by naturall appointment he is allotted to hunt or serue, for
 which consideration some be named dogs for the feasant, some for the
 falcon, and some for the partrich. Howbeit the common name for all is
 spaniell (saith he) and therevpon alludeth, as if these kinds of dogs
 had bin brought hither out of Spaine. In like sort we haue of water
 spaniels in their kind. The third sort of dogs of the gentle kind, is
 the spaniell gentle, or comforter, or (as the common terme is) the
 fistinghound, and those are called _Melitei_, of the Iland Malta, from
 whence they were brought hither. These are little and prettie, proper
 and fine, and sought out far and neere to satisfie the nice delicacie
 of daintie dames, and wanton womens willes; instruments of follie to
 plaie and dallie withall, in trifling away the treasure of time, to
 withdraw their minds from more commendable exercises, and to content
 their corrupt concupiscences with vaine disport, a sillie poore shift
 to shun their irkesome idlenes. These Sybariticall puppies, the
 smaller they be (and thereto if they haue an hole in the foreparts of
 their heads) the better they are accepted, the more pleasure also they
 prouoke, as meet plaiefellowes for minsing mistresses to beare in
 their bosoms, to keepe companie withall in their chambers, to succour
 with sleepe in bed, and nourish with meat at boord, to lie in their
 laps, and licke their lips as they lie (like yoong Dianaes) in their
 wagons and coches. And good reason it should be so, for coursenesse
 with finenesse hath no fellowship, but featnesse with neatnesse hath
 neighbourhead inough. That plausible prouerbe therefore verefied
 sometime vpon a tyrant, namelie that he loued his sow better than his
 sonne, may well be applied to some of this kind of people, who delight
 more in their dogs, that are depriued of all possibilitie of reason,
 than they doo in children that are capable of wisedome & iudgement.
 Yea, they oft feed them of the best, where the poore mans child at
 their doores can hardlie come by the woorst. But the former abuse
 peraduenture reigneth where there hath beene long want of issue, else
 where barrennesse is the best blossome of beautie: or finallie, where
 poore mens children for want of their owne issue are not readie to be
 had. It is thought of some that it is verie wholesome for a weake
 stomach to beare such a dog in the bosome, as it is for him that hath
 the palsie to feele the dailie smell and sauour of a fox. But how
 truelie this is affirmed let the learned iudge: onelie it shall
 suffice for Doctor Caius to haue said thus much of spaniels and dogs
 of the gentle kind.

 [Sidenote: Homelie kind of dogs.]
 Dogs of the homelie kind, are either shepheards curs, or mastiffes.
 The first are so common, that it needeth me not to speake of them.
 Their vse also is so well knowne in keeping the heard togither (either
 when they grase or go before the sheepheard) that it should be but in
 vaine to spend anie time about them. Wherefore I will leaue this curre
 [Sidenote: Tie dogs.]
 vnto his owne kind, and go in hand with the mastiffe, tie dog, or
 banddog, so called bicause manie of them are tied vp in chaines and
 strong bonds, in the daie time, for dooing hurt abroad, which is an
 huge dog, stubborne, ouglie, eager, burthenous of bodie (& therefore
 but of little swiftnesse) terrible and fearfull to behold, and
 oftentimes more fierce and fell than anie Archadian or Corsican cur.
 Our Englishmen to the intent that these dogs may be more cruell and
 fierce, assist nature with some art, vse and custome. For although
 this kind of dog be capable of courage, violent, valiant, stout and
 bold: yet will they increase these their stomachs by teaching them to
 bait the beare, the bull, the lion, and other such like cruell and
 bloudie beasts, (either brought ouer or kept vp at home, for the same
 purpose) without anie collar to defend their throats, and oftentimes
 thereto they traine them vp in fighting and wrestling with a man
 (hauing for the safegard of his life either a pike staffe, club,
 sword, priuie coate) wherby they become the more fierce and cruell
 vnto strangers. The Caspians made so much account sometime of such
 great dogs, that euerie able man would nourish sundrie of them in his
 house of set purpose, to the end they should deuoure their carcases
 after their deaths, thinking the dogs bellies to be the most
 honourable sepulchers. The common people also followed the same rate,
 and therfore there were tie dogs kept vp by publike ordinance, to
 deuoure them after their deaths: by means whereof these beasts became
 the more eger, and with great difficultie after a while restreined
 from falling vpon the liuing. But whither am I digressed? In returning
 [Sidenote: Some barke and bite not.]
 [Sidenote: Some bite and barke not.]
 therefore to our owne, I saie that of mastiffes, some barke onelie
 with fierce and open mouth but will not bite, some doo both barke and
 bite, but the cruellest doo either not barke at all, or bite before
 they barke, and therefore are more to be feared than anie of the
 other. They take also their name of the word mase and theefe (or
 master theefe if you will) bicause they often stound and put such
 persons to their shifts in townes and villages, and are the principall
 causes of their apprehension and taking. The force which is in them
 surmounteth all beleefe, and the fast hold which they take with their
 teeth exceedeth all credit: for three of them against a beare, foure
 against a lion, are sufficient to trie mastries with them. King Henrie
 the seauenth, as the report goeth, commanded all such curres to be
 hanged, bicause they durst presume to fight against the lion, who is
 their king and souereigne. The like he did with an excellent falcon,
 as some saie, bicause he feared not hand to hand to match with an
 eagle, willing his falconers in his owne presence to pluck off his
 head after he was taken downe, saieng that it was not meet for anie
 subiect to offer such wrong vnto his lord and superiour, wherein he
 had a further meaning. But if king Henrie the seauenth had liued in
 our time, what would he haue doone to one English mastiffe, which
 alone and without anie helpe at all pulled downe first an huge beare,
 then a pard, and last of all a lion, each after other before the
 French king in one daie, when the lord Buckhurst was ambassador vnto
 him, and whereof if I should write the circumstances, that is, how he
 tooke his aduantage being let lose vnto them, and finallie draue them
 into such exceeding feare, that they were all glad to run awaie when
 he was taken from them, I should take much paines, and yet reape but
 small credit: wherefore it shall suffice to haue said thus much
 thereof. Some of our mastiffes will rage onelie in the night, some are
 to be tied vp both daie and night. Such also as are suffered to go
 lose about the house and yard, are so gentle in the daie time, that
 children may ride on their backs, & plaie with them, at their
 pleasures. Diuerse of them likewise are of such gelousie ouer their
 maister and whosoeuer of his houshold, that if a stranger doo imbrace
 or touch anie of them, they will fall fiercelie vpon them, vnto their
 extreame mischeefe if their furie be not preuented. Such an one was
 the dog of Nichomedes king sometime of Bithinia, who seeing Consigne
 the queene to imbrace and kisse hir husband as they walked togither in
 a garden, did teare hir all to peeces, mauger his resistance, and the
 present aid of such as attended on them. Some of them moreouer will
 suffer a stranger to come in and walke about the house or yard where
 him listeth, without giuing ouer to follow him: but if he put foorth
 his hand to touch anie thing, then will they flie vpon him and kill
 him if they may. I had one my selfe once, which would not suffer anie
 man to bring in his weapon further than my gate: neither those that
 were of my house to be touched in his presence. Or if I had beaten
 anie of my children, he would gentlie haue assaied to catch the rod in
 his teeth and take it out of my hand, or else pluck downe their
 clothes to saue them from the stripes: which in my opinion is not
 vnworthie to be noted. And thus much of our mastiffes, creatures of no
 lesse faith and loue towards their maisters than horsses; as may
 appeare euen by the confidence that Masinissa reposed in them, in so
 much that mistrusting his houshold seruants he made him a gard of
 dogs, which manie a time deliuered him from their treasons and
 conspiracies, euen by their barking and biting, nor of lesse force
 than the Molossian race, brought from Epiro into some countries, which
 the poets feigne to haue originall from the brasen dog that Vulcan
 made, and gaue to Iupiter, who also deliuered the same to Europa, she
 to Procris, and Procris to Cephalus, as Iulius Pollux noteth, lib. 5.
 cap. 5: neither vnequall in carefulnesse to the mastiffe of Alexander
 Phereus, who by his onelie courage and attendance kept his maister
 long time from slaughter, till at the last he was remooued by policie,
 and the tyrant killed sleeping: the storie goeth thus. Thebe the wife
 of the said Phereus and hir three brethren conspired the death of hir
 husband, who fearing the dog onelie, she found the means to allure him
 from his chamber doore by faire means, vnto another house hard by,
 whilest they should execute their purpose. Neuerthelesse, when they
 came to the bed where he laie sleeping, they waxed faint harted, till
 she did put them in choise, either that they should dispatch him at
 once, or else that she hir selfe would wake hir husband, and giue him
 warning of his enimies, or at the least wise bring in the dog vpon
 them, which they feared most of all: and therefore quicklie dispatched
 him.

 The last sort of dogs consisteth of the currish kind meet for manie
 toies: of which the whappet or prickeard curre is one. Some men call
 them warners, bicause they are good for nothing else but to barke and
 giue warning when anie bodie dooth stirre or lie in wait about the
 house in the night season. Certes it is vnpossible to describe these
 curs in anie order, bicause they haue no anie one kind proper vnto
 themselues, but are a confused companie mixt of all the rest. The
 second sort of them are called turne spits, whose office is not
 vnknowne to anie. And as these are onelie reserued for this purpose,
 so in manie places our mastiffes (beside the vse which tinkers haue of
 them in carieng their heauie budgets) are made to draw water in great
 wheeles out of deepe wels, going much like vnto those which are framed
 for our turne spits, as is to be seene at Roiston, where this feat is
 often practised. Besides these also we haue sholts or curs dailie
 brought out of Iseland, and much made of among vs, bicause of their
 sawcinesse and quarrelling. Moreouer they bite verie sore, and loue
 candles exceedinglie, as doo the men and women of their countrie: but
 I may saie no more of them, bicause they are not bred with vs. Yet
 this will I make report of by the waie, for pastimes sake, that when a
 great man of those parts came of late into one of our ships which went
 thither for fish, to see the forme and fashion of the same, his wife
 apparrelled in fine sables, abiding on the decke whilest hir husband
 was vnder the hatches with the mariners, espied a pound or two of
 candles hanging at the mast, and being loth to stand there idle alone,
 she fell to and eat them vp euerie one, supposing hir selfe to haue
 beene at a iollie banket, and shewing verie plesant gesture when hir
 husband came vp againe vnto hir.

 The last kind of toiesh curs are named dansers, and those being of a
 mongrell sort also, are taught & exercised to danse in measure at the
 musicall sound of an instrument, as at the iust stroke of a drum,
 sweet accent of the citharne, and pleasant harmonie of the harpe,
 shewing manie trickes by the gesture of their bodies: as to stand bolt
 vpright, to lie flat vpon the ground, to turne round as a ring,
 holding their tailes in their teeth, to saw and beg for meat, to take
 a mans cap from his head, and sundrie such properties, which they
 learne of their idle rogish masters whose instruments they are to
 gather gaine, as old apes clothed in motleie, and coloured short
 wasted iackets are for the like vagabunds, who seeke no better liuing,
 than that which they may get by fond pastime and idlenesse. I might
 here intreat of other dogs, as of those which are bred betweene a
 bitch and a woolfe, and called _Lycisca_: a thing verie often seene in
 France saith Franciscus Patricius in his common wealth, as procured of
 set purpose, and learned as I thinke of the Indians, who tie their
 sault bitches often in woods, that they might be loined by tigers:
 also betweene a bitch and a fox, or a beare and a mastiffe. But as we
 vtterlie want the first sort, except they be brought vnto vs: so it
 happeneth sometime, that the other two are ingendered and seene at
 home amongst vs. But all the rest heretofore remembred in this
 chapter, there is none more ouglie and odious in sight, cruell and
 fierce in deed, nor vntractable in hand, than that which is begotten
 betweene the beare and the bandog. For whatsoeuer he catcheth hold of,
 he taketh it so fast, that a man may sooner teare and rend his bodie
 in sunder, than get open his mouth to separate his chaps. Certes he
 regardeth neither woolfe, beare, nor lion, and therfore may well be
 compared with those two dogs which were sent to Alexander out of India
 (& procreated as it is thought betweene a mastiffe and male tiger, as
 be those also of Hircania) or to them that are bred in Archadia, where
 copulation is oft seene betweene lions and bitches, as the like is in
 France (as I said) betweene shee woolfes and dogs, whereof let this
 suffice; sith the further tractation of them dooth not concerne my
 purpose, more than the confutation of Cardans talke, "De subt." lib.
 10. who saith, that after manie generations, dogs doo become woolfes,
 and contrariwise; which if it were true, than could not England be
 without manie woolfes: but nature hath set a difference betweene them,
 not onelie in outward forme, but also in inward disposition of their
 bones, wherefore it is vnpossible that his assertion can be sound.




 OF OUR SAFFRON, AND THE DRESSING THEREOF.

 CHAP. VIII.


 As the saffron of England, which Platina reckneth among spices, is the
 most excellent of all other: for it giueth place neither to that of
 Cilicia, whereof Solinus speaketh, neither to anie that commeth from
 Cilicia, where it groweth vpon the mount Taurus, Tmolus, Italie,
 AEtolia, Sicilia or Licia, in sweetnesse, tincture, and continuance; so
 of that which is to be had amongst vs, the same that grows about
 Saffron Walden, somtime called Waldenburg, in the edge of Essex, first
 of all planted there in the time of Edward the third, and that of
 Glocester shire and those westerlie parts, which some thinke to be
 better than that of Walden, surmounteth all the rest, and therefore
 beareth worthilie the higher price, by six pence or twelue pence most
 commonlie in the pound. The root of the herbe that beareth this
 commoditie is round, much like vnto an indifferent chestnut, & yet it
 is not cloued as the lillie, nor flaked as the scallion, but hath a
 sad substance "Inter bulbosa," as Orchis, hyacinthus orientalis, and
 Statyrion. The colour of the rind is not much differing from the
 innermost shell of a chestnut, although it be not altogither so
 brickle as is the pill of an onion. So long as the leafe flourisheth
 the root is litle & small; but when the grasse is withered, the head
 increaseth and multiplieth, the fillets also or small roots die, so
 that when the time dooth come to take them vp, they haue no roots at
 all, but so continue vntill September that they doo grow againe: and
 before the chiue be grounded the smallest heads are also most
 esteemed; but whether they be great or small, if sheepe or neat may
 come to them on the heape, as they lie in the field, they will deuoure
 them as if they were haie or stuble, some also will wroot for them in
 verie eager maner. The leafe or rather the blade thereof is long and
 narrow as grasse, which come vp alwaies in October after the floures
 be gathered and gone, pointed on a little tuft much like vnto our
 siues. Sometimes our cattell will feed vpon the same; neuerthelesse,
 if it be bitten whilest it is greene, the head dieth, and therefore
 our crokers are carefull to keepe it from such annoiance vntill it
 begin to wither, and then also will the cattell soonest tast thereof:
 for vntill that time the iuice thereof is bitter. In euerie floure we
 find commonlie three chiues, and three yellowes, and double the number
 of leaues. Of twisted floures I speake not; yet is it found, that two
 floures grow togither, which bring foorth fiue chiues, so that alwaies
 there is an od chiue and od yellow, though three or foure floures
 should come out of one root. The whole herbe is named in Greeke
 _Crocos_, but of some (as Dioscorides saith) _Castor_, _Cynomorphos_,
 or Hercules blood: yet in the Arabian speech, (from whence we borow
 [Sidenote: Occasion of the name.]
 the name which we giue thervnto) I find that it is called _Zahafaran_,
 as Rembert dooth beare witnesse. The cause wherefore it was called
 Crocus was this (as the poets feigne) speciallie those from whome
 Galen hath borowed the historie, which he noteth in his ninth booke
 "De medicamentis secundum loca," where he writeth after this maner
 (although I take Crocus to be the first that vsed this comoditie.) A
 certeine yong gentleman called Crocus went to plaie at coits in the
 field with Mercurie, and being heedlesse of himselfe, Mercuries coit
 happened by mishap to hit him on the head, whereby he receiued a wound
 that yer long killed him altogither, to the great discomfort of his
 freends. Finallie, in the place where he bled, saffron was after found
 to grow, wherevpon the people seeing the colour of the chiue as it
 stood (although I doubt not but it grew there long before) adiudged it
 to come of the blood of Crocus, and therefore they gaue it his name.
 And thus farre Rembert, who with Galen, &c: differ verie much from
 Ouids Metamorphos. 4. who writeth also thereof. Indeed the chiue,
 while it remaineth whole & vnbrused, resembleth a darke red, but being
 broken and conuerted into vse, it yeeldeth a yellow tincture. But what
 haue we to doo with fables?

 The heads of saffron are raised in Iulie, either with plough, raising,
 or tined hooke; and being scowred from their rosse or filth, and
 seuered from such heads as are ingendred of them, since the last
 setting, they are interred againe in Iulie and August by ranks or
 rowes, and being couered with moulds, they rest in the earth, where
 they cast forth litle fillets and small roots like vnto a scallion,
 vntill September, in the beginning of which moneth the ground is
 [Sidenote: Paring.]
 pared, and all weeds and grasse that groweth vpon the same remooued,
 to the intent that nothing may annoie the floure when as his time
 dooth come to rise.

 [Sidenote: Gathering.]
 These things being thus ordered in the latter end of the aforesaid
 moneth of September, the floure beginneth to appeere of a whitish
 blew, fesse or skie colour, and in the end shewing it selfe in the
 [Sidenote: See _Rembert_.]
 owne kind, it resembleth almost the Leucotion of Theophrast, sauing
 that it is longer, and hath in the middest thereof three chiues verie
 red and pleasant to behold. These floures are gathered in the morning
 before the rising of the sunne, which otherwise would cause them to
 welke or flitter. And the chiues being picked from the floures, these
 are throwne into the doonghill; the other dried vpon little kelles
 couered with streined canuasses vpon a soft fire: wherby, and by the
 weight that is laied vpon them, they are dried and pressed into cakes,
 and then bagged vp for the benefit of their owners. In good yeeres we
 gather foure score or an hundred pounds of wet saffron of an acre,
 which being dried dooth yeeld twentie pounds of drie and more.
 Whereby, and sith the price of saffron is commonlie about twentie
 shillings in monie, or not so little, it is easie to see what benefit
 is reaped by an acre of this commoditie, towards the charges of the
 setter, which indeed are great, but yet not so much, as he shall be
 thereby a looser, if he be anie thing diligent. For admit that the
 triple tillage of an acre dooth cost 13 shillings foure pence before
 the saffron be set, the clodding sixteene pence, the taking of euerie
 load of stones from the same foure pence, the raising of euerie
 quarter of heads six pence, and so much for clensing of them, besides
 the rent of ten shillings for euerie acre, thirtie load of doong which
 is woorth six pence the load to be laid on the first yeere, for the
 setting three and twentie shillings and foure pence, for the paring
 fiue shillings, six pence for the picking of a pound wet, &c: yea
 though he hire it readie set, and paie ten pounds for the same, yet
 shall he susteine no damage, if warme weather and open season doo
 happen at the gathering. This also is to be noted, that euerie acre
 asketh twentie quarters of heads, placed in ranks two inches one from
 an other in long beds, which conteine eight or ten foot in breadth.
 And after three yeeres that ground will serue well, and without
 compest for barleie by the space of eighteene or twentie yeeres
 togither, as experience dooth confirme. The heads also of euerie acre
 at the raising will store an acre and an halfe of new ground, which is
 a great aduantage, and it will floure eight or ten daies togither. But
 the best saffron is gathered at the first; at which time foure pounds
 of wet saffron will go verie neere to make one of drie; but in the
 middest fiue pounds of the one will make but one of the other, because
 the chiue waxeth smaller, as six at the last will doo no more but
 yeeld one of the dried, by reason of the chiue which is now verie
 leane and hungrie. After twentie yeeres also the same ground may be
 set with saffron againe. And in lieu of a conclusion, take this for a
 perpetuall rule, that heads comming out of a good ground will prosper
 best in a lighter soile; and contrariwise: which is one note that our
 crokers doo carefullie obserue.

 [Sidenote: Raising.]
 The heads are raised euerie third yeare about vs, to wit, after
 Midsummer, when the rosse commeth drie from the heads; and commonlie
 in the first yeere after they be set they yeeld verie little increase:
 yet that which then commeth is counted the finest and greatest chiue,
 & best for medicine, and called saffron Du hort. The next crop is much
 greater; but the third exceedeth, and then they raise againe about
 Walden and in Cambridge shire. In this period of time also the heads
 are said to child, that is, to yeeld out of some parts of them diuerse
 other headlets, whereby it hath beene seene, that some one head hath
 beene increased (though with his owne detriment) to three, or foure,
 or fiue, or six, which augmentation is the onlie cause wherby they are
 sold so good cheape. For to my remembrance I haue not knowne foure
 bushels or a coome of them to be valued much aboue two shillings eight
 pence, except in some od yeeres that they arise to eight or ten
 shillings the quarter, and that is when ouer great store of winters
 water hath rotted the most of them as they stood within the ground, or
 heat in summer parched and burnt them vp.

 In Norffolke and Suffolke they raise but once in seuen yeeres: but as
 their saffron is not so fine as that of Cambridgeshire and about
 Walden, so it will not cake, ting, nor hold colour withall, wherein
 lieth a great part of the value of this stuffe. Some craftie iackes
 vse to mix it with scraped brazell or with the floure of Sonchus,
 which commeth somewhat neere indeed to the hue of our good saffron (if
 it be late gathered) but it is soone bewraied both by the depth of the
 colour and hardnesse. Such also was the plentie of saffron about
 twentie yeeres passed, that some of the townesmen of Walden gaue the
 one halfe of the floures for picking of the other, and sent them ten
 or twelue miles abroad into the countrie, whilest the rest, not
 thankfull for the abundance of Gods blessing bestowed vpon them (as
 wishing rather more scarsitie thereof because of the keeping vp of the
 price) in most contemptuous maner murmured against him, saieng that he
 did shite saffron therewith to choake the market. But as they shewed
 themselues no lesse than ingrat infidels in this behalfe, so the Lord
 considered their vnthankfulnesse, & gaue them euer since such
 scarsitie, as the greatest murmurers haue now the least store; and
 most of them are either worne out of occupieng, or remaine scarse able
 to mainteine their grounds without the helpe of other men. Certes it
 hath generallie decaied about Saffron Walden since the said time,
 vntill now of late within these two yeares, that men began againe to
 plant and renew the same, because of the great commoditie. But to
 proceed. When the heads be raised and taken vp, they will remaine
 sixteene or twentie daies out of the earth or more: yea peraduenture a
 full moneth. Howbeit they are commonlie in the earth againe by saint
 Iames tide, or verie shortlie after. For as if they be taken vp before
 Midsummer, or beginning of Iulie, the heads will shrinke like a rosted
 warden: so after August they will wax drie, become vnfruitfull, and
 decaie. And I know it by experience, in that I haue carried some of
 them to London with me; and notwithstanding that they haue remained
 there vnset by the space of fortie dais and more: yet some of them
 haue brought foorth two or three floures a peece, and some floures
 three or fiue chiues, to the greeat admiration of such as haue
 gathered the same, and not beene acquainted with their nature and
 countrie where they grew. The crokers or saffron men doo vse an
 obseruation a litle before the comming vp of the floure, and sometime
 in the taking vp at Midsummer tide, by opening of the heads to iudge
 of plentie and scarsitie of this commoditie to come. For if they see
 as it were manie small hairie veines of saffron to be in the middest
 of the bulbe, they pronounce a fruitfull yeare. And to saie truth, at
 the cleauing of ech head, a man shall discerne the saffron by the
 colour, and see where abouts the chiue will issue out of the root.
 Warme darke nights, sweet dews, fat grounds (cheeflie the chalkie) and
 mistie mornings are verie good for saffron; but frost and cold doo
 kill and keepe backe the floure, or else shrinke vp the chiue. And
 thus much haue I thought good to speake of English saffron, which is
 hot in the second and drie in the first degree, and most plentifull as
 our crokers hold, in that yeere wherein ewes twin most. But as I can
 make no warrantize hereof, so I am otherwise sure, that there is no
 more deceit vsed in anie trade than in saffron. For in the making they
 will grease the papers on the kell with a little candle grease, to
 make the woorst saffron haue so good a colour as the best: afterwards
 also they will sprinkle butter thereon to make the weight better. But
 both these are bewraied, either by a quantitie thereof holden ouer the
 fire in a siluer spoone, or by the softnesse thereof betweene the fore
 finger and the thumbe; or thirdlie, by the colour thereof in age: for
 if you laie it by farre worse saffron of other countries, the colour
 will bewraie the forgerie by the swartnesse of the chiue, which
 otherwise would excell it, and therevnto being sound, remaine crispe,
 brickle, and drie: and finallie, if it be holden neere the face, will
 strike a certeine biting heat vpon the skin and eies, whereby it is
 adiudged good and merchant ware indeed among the skilfull crokers.

 Now if it please you to heare of anie of the vertues thereof, I will
 note these insuing at the request of one, who required me to touch a
 few of them with whatsoeuer breuitie I listed. Therefore our saffron
 (beside the manifold vse that it hath in the kitchin and pastrie, also
 in our cakes at bridals, and thanksgiuings of women) is verie
 profitably mingled with those medicins which we take for the diseases
 of the breast, of the lungs, of the liuer, and of the bladder: it is
 good also for the stomach if you take it in meat, for it comforteth
 the same and maketh good digestion: being sodden also in wine, it not
 onelie keepeth a man from droonkennesse, but incorageth also vnto
 procreation of issue. If you drinke it in sweet wine, it inlargeth the
 breath, and is good for those that are troubled with the tisike and
 shortnesse of the wind: mingled with the milke of a woman, and laied
 vpon the eies, it staieth such humors as descend into the same, and
 taketh awaie the red wheales and pearles that oft grow about them: it
 killeth moths if it be sowed in paper bags verie thin, and laid vp in
 presses amongst tapistrie or apparell: also it is verie profitablie
 laid vnto all inflammations, painefull aposthumes, and the shingles;
 and dooth no small ease vnto deafnes, if it be mingled with such
 medicins as are beneficiall vnto the eares: it is of great vse also in
 ripening of botches and all swellings proceeding of raw humors. Or if
 it shall please you to drinke the root thereof with maluesie, it will
 maruellouslie prouoke vrine, dissolue and expell grauell, and yeeld no
 small ease to them that make their water by dropmeales. Finallie,
 three drams thereof taken at once, which is about the weight of one
 shilling nine pence halfepenie, is deadlie poison; as Dioscorides
 dooth affirme: and droonke in wine (saith Platina) lib. 3. cap. 13.
 "De honesta voluptate," dooth hast on droonkennesse, which is verie
 true. And I haue knowne some, that by eating onelie of bread more than
 of custome streined with saffron, haue become like droonken men, & yet
 otherwise well known to be but competent drinkers. For further
 confirmation of this also, if a man doo but open and ransake a bag of
 one hundred or two hundred weight, as merchants doo when they buie it
 of the crokers, it will strike such an aire into their heads which
 deale withall, that for a time they shall be giddie and sicke (I meane
 for two or three houres space) their noses and eies in like sort will
 yeeld such plentie of rheumatike water, that they shall be the better
 for it long after, especiallie their eiesight, which is woonderfullie
 clarified by this meanes: howbeit some merchants not liking of this
 physike, muffle themselues as women doo when they ride, and put on
 spectacles set in leather, which dooth in some measure (but not for
 altogither) put by the force thereof. There groweth some saffron in
 manie places of Almaine, and also about Vienna in Austria, which later
 is taken for the best that springeth in those quarters. In steed of
 this some doo vse the Carthamus, called amongst vs bastard saffron,
 but neither is this of anie value, nor the other in any wise
 comparable vnto ours. Whereof let this suffice as of a commoditie
 brought into this Iland in the time of Edward 3. and not commonlie
 planted till Richard 2. did reigne. It would grow verie well (as I
 take it) about the Chiltern hils, & in all the vale of the White
 horsse so well as in Walden and Cambridgeshire, if they were carefull
 of it. I heare of some also to be cherished alreadie in
 Glocestershire, and certeine other places westward. But of the
 finenesse and tincture of the chiue, I heare not as yet of anie
 triall. Would to God that my countriemen had beene heretofore (or were
 now) more carefull of this commoditie! then would it no doubt haue
 prooued more beneficiall to our Iland than our cloth or wooll. But
 alas! so idle are we, and heretofore so much giuen to ease, by reason
 of the smalnesse of our rents, that few men regard to search out which
 are their best commodities. But if landlords hold on to raise the
 rents of their farms as they begin, they will inforce their tenants to
 looke better vnto their gains, and scratch out their rent from vnder
 euerie clod that may be turned aside. The greatest mart for saffron is
 at Aquila in Abruzo, where they haue an especiall weight for the same
 of ten pounds lesse in the hundred than that of Florens and Luke: but
 how it agreeth with ours it shall appeere hereafter.




 OF QUARRIES OF STONE FOR BUILDING.

 CHAP. IX.


 Quarries with vs are pits or mines, out of which we dig our stone to
 build withall, & of these as we haue great plentie in England, so are
 they of diuerse sorts, and those verie profitable for sundrie
 necessarie vses. In times past the vse of stone was in maner dedicated
 to the building of churches, religious houses, princely palaces,
 bishops manours, and holds onlie: but now that scrupulous obseruation
 is altogither infringed, and building with stone so commonlie taken
 vp, that amongst noble men & gentlemen, the timber frames are supposed
 to be not much better than paper worke, of little continuance, and
 least continuance of all. It farre passeth my cunning to set downe how
 manie sorts of stone for building are to be found in England, but much
 further to call each of them by their proper names. Howbeit, such is
 the curiositie of our countrimen, that notwithstanding almightie God
 hath so blessed our realme in most plentifull maner, with such and so
 manie quarries apt and meet for piles of longest continuance, yet we
 as lothsome of this abundance, or not liking of the plentie, doo
 commonlie leaue these naturall gifts to mould and cinder in the
 ground, and take vp an artificiall bricke, in burning whereof a great
 part of the wood of this land is dailie consumed and spent, to the no
 small decaie of that commoditie, and hinderance of the poore that
 perish oft for cold.

 Our elders haue from time to time, following our naturall vice in
 misliking of our owne commodities at home, and desiring those of other
 countries abroad, most esteemed the cane stone that is brought hither
 out of Normandie: and manie euen in these our daies following the same
 veine, doo couet in their works almost to vse none other. Howbeit
 experience on the one side, and our skilfull masons on the other
 (whose iudgement is nothing inferiour to those of other countries) doo
 affirme, that in the north and south parts of England, and certeine
 other places, there are some quarries, which for hardnesse and beautie
 are equall to the outlandish greet. This maie also be confirmed by the
 kings chappell at Cambridge, the greatest part of the square stone
 wherof was brought thither out of the north. Some commend the veine of
 white free stone, slate, and meere stone, which is betweene Pentowen,
 and the blacke head in Cornewall, for verie fine stuffe. Other doo
 speake much of the quarries at Hamden, nine miles from Milberie, and
 pauing stone of Burbecke. For toph stone, not a few allow of the
 quarrie that is at Dreslie, diuerse mislike not of the veines of hard
 stone that are at Oxford, and Burford. One praiseth the free stone at
 Manchester, & Prestburie in Glocestershire; another the quarries of
 the like in Richmont. The third liketh well of the hard stone in Clee
 hill in Shropshire; the fourth of that of Thorowbridge, Welden, and
 Terrinton. Whereby it appeareth that we haue quarries inow, and good
 inough in England, sufficient for vs to build withall, if the peeuish
 contempt of our owne commodities, and delectations to inrich other
 countries, did not catch such foolish hold vpon vs. It is also
 verified (as anie other waie) that all nations haue rather need of
 England, than England of anie other. And this I thinke may suffice for
 the substance of our works. Now if you haue regard to their ornature,
 how manie mines of sundrie kinds of course & fine marble are there to
 be had in England? But chieflie one in Staffordshire, an other neere
 to the Peke, the third at Vauldrie, the fourth at Snothill (longing to
 the lord Chaindois) the fift at Eglestone, which is of blacke marble,
 spotted with graie or white spots, the sixt not farre from Durham. Of
 white marble also we haue store, and so faire as the Marpesian of
 Paris Ile. But what meane I to go about to recite all, or the most
 excellent? sith these which I haue named alredie are not altogether of
 the best, nor scarselie of anie value in comparison of those, whose
 places of growth are vtterlie vnknowne vnto me, and whereof the blacke
 marble spotted with greene is none of the vilest sort, as maie appeare
 by parcell of the pauement of the lower part of the quire of Paules in
 London, and also in Westminster, where some peeces thereof are yet to
 be seene and marked, if anie will looke for them. If marble will not
 serue, then haue we the finest alabaster that maie elsewhere bee had,
 as about saint Dauids of Wales; also neere to Beau manour, which is
 about foure or fiue miles from Leicester, & taken to be the best,
 although there are diuerse other quarries hereof beyond the Trent, as
 in Yorkeshire, &c: and fullie so good as that, whose names at this
 time are out of my remembrance. What should I talke of the plaister of
 Axholme (for of that which they dig out of the earth in sundrie places
 of Lincolne and Darbishires, wherewith they blanch their houses in
 stead of lime, I speake not) certes it is a fine kind of alabaster.
 But sith it is sold commonlie but after twelue pence the load, we
 iudge it to be but vile and course. For my part I cannot skill of
 stone, yet in my opinion it is not without great vse for plaister of
 paris, and such is the mine of it, that the stones thereof lie in
 flakes one vpon an other like plankes or tables, and vnder the same is
 an exceeding hard stone verie profitable for building, as hath often
 times beene prooued. This is also to be marked further of our plaister
 white and graie, that not contented with the same, as God by the
 quarrie dooth send and yeeld it foorth, we haue now deuised to cast it
 in moulds for windowes and pillers of what forme and fashion we list,
 euen as alabaster it selfe: and with such stuffe sundrie houses in
 Yorkshire are furnished of late. But of what continuance this deuise
 is like to proue, the time to come shall easilie bewraie. In the meane
 time sir Rafe Burcher knight hath put the deuise in practise, and
 affirmeth that six men in six moneths shall trauell in that trade to
 see greater profit to the owner, than twelue men in six yeares could
 before this tricke was inuented.

 If neither alabaster nor marble doeth suffice, we haue the touchstone,
 called in Latine _Lydius lapis_, shining as glasse, either to match in
 sockets with our pillers of alabaster, or contrariwise: or if it
 please the workeman to ioine pillers of alabaster or touch with
 sockets of brasse, pewter, or copper, we want not also these mettals.
 So that I think no nation can haue more excellent & greater diuersitie
 of stuffe for building, than we maie haue in England, if our selues
 could so like of it. But such alas is our nature, that not our own but
 other mens do most of all delite vs; & for desire of noueltie, we oft
 exchange our finest cloth, corne, tin, and woolles, for halfe penie
 cockhorsses for children, dogs of wax or of cheese, two pennie tabers,
 leaden swords, painted feathers, gewgaws for fooles, dogtricks for
 disards, hawkeswhoods, and such like trumperie, whereby we reape iust
 mockage and reproch in other countries. I might remember here our pits
 for milstones, that are to be had in diuerse places of our countrie,
 as in Angleseie, Kent, also at Queene hope of blew greet, of no lesse
 value than the Colaine, yea than the French stones: our grindstones
 for hardware men. Our whetstones are no lesse laudable than those of
 Creta & Lacedemonia, albeit we vse no oile with them, as they did in
 those parties, but onelie water, as the Italians and Naxians doo with
 theirs: whereas they that grow in Cilicia must haue both oile and
 water laid vpon them, or else they make no edge. These also are
 diuided either into the hard greet, as the common that shoemakers vse,
 or the soft greet called hones, to be had among the barbars, and those
 either blacke or white, and the rub or brickle stone which husbandmen
 doo occupie in the whetting of their sithes.

 In like maner slate of sundrie colours is euerie where in maner to be
 had, as is the flint and chalke, the shalder and the peble. Howbeit
 for all this wee must fetch them still from farre, as did the Hull men
 their stones out of Iseland, wherewith they paued their towne for want
 of the like in England: or as sir Thomas Gresham did, when he bought
 the stones in Flanders, wherwith he paued the Burse. But as he will
 answer peraduenture, that he bargained for the whole mould and
 substance of his workemanship in Flanders: so the Hullanders or Hull
 men will saie, how that stockefish is light loding, and therfore they
 did balasse their vessels with these Iseland stones, to keepe them
 from turning ouer in their so tedious a voiage. And thus much brieflie
 of our quarries of stone for building, wherein oftentimes the workemen
 haue found strange things inclosed, I meane liuelie creatures shut vp
 in the hard stones, and liuing there without respiration or breathing,
 as frogs, todes, &c: whereof you shall read more in the chronologie
 following: also in Caius Langius, William of Newburie, Agricola,
 Cornelius of Amsterdam, Bellogius de aquatilibus, Albert the great,
 lib. 19. cap. 9. "De rebus metallicis," and Goropius in Niloscopio,
 pag. 237, &c. Sometime also they find pretious stones (though seldome)
 and some of them perfectlie squared by nature, and much like vnto the
 diamond, found of late in a quarrie of marble at Naples, which was so
 perfectlie pointed, as if all the workemen in the world had
 c[=o]sulted about the performance of that workemanship. I know that
 these reports vnto some will seeme incredible, and therefore I stand
 the longer vpon them; neuerthelesse omitting to speake particularlie
 of such things as happen amongst vs, and rather seeking to confirme
 the same by the like in other countries, I will deliuer a few more
 examples, whereby the truth hereof shall so much the better appeare.
 For in the middest of a stone not long since found at Chius, vpon the
 breaking vp thereof, there was seene _Caput panisci_ inclosed therin,
 very perfectlie formed as the beholders doo remember. How come the
 grains of gold to be so fast inclosed in the stones that are & haue
 beene found in the Spanish Baetis? But this is most maruellous, that a
 most delectable and sweet oile, comparable to the finest balme, or
 oile of spike in smell, was found naturallie included in a stone,
 which could not otherwise be broken but with a smiths hammer. Goropius
 dooth tell of a pearch perfectlie formed to be found in Britaine: but
 [Sidenote: * [_Sic._]]
 as then [*] committed into hard stone, vpon the top of a crag.
 Aristotle and Theophrast speake of fishes digged out of the earth,
 farre from the sea in Greece, which Seneca also confirmeth, but with
 addition that they are perillous to be eaten. In pope Martins time, a
 serpent was found fast inclosed in a rocke, as the kernell is within
 the nut, so that no aire could come to it: and in my time another in a
 coffin of stone at Auignion, wherein, a man had beene buried, which so
 filled the roome, and laie so close from aire, that all men woondered
 how it was possible for the same to liue and continue so long time
 there. Finallie I my selfe haue seene stones opened, and within them
 the substances of corrupted wormes like vnto adders (but far shorter)
 whose crests and wrinkles of bodie appeared also therein, as if they
 had bene ingraued in the stones by art and industrie of man. Wherefore
 to affirme; that as well liuing creatures, as pretious stones, gold,
 &c: are now and then found in our quarries, shall not hereafter be a
 thing so incredible as manie talking philosophers, void, of all
 experience, doo affirme, and wilfullie mainteine against such as hold
 the contrarie.




 ON SUNDRIE MINERALS.

 CHAP. X.


 With how great benefits this Iland of ours hath beene indued from the
 beginning, I hope there is no godlie man but will readilie confesse,
 and yeeld vnto the Lord God his due honour for the same. For we are
 blessed euerie waie, & there is no temporall commoditie necessarie to
 be had or craued by anie nation at Gods hand, that he hath not in most
 aboundant maner bestowed vpon vs Englishmen, if we could see to vse
 it, & be thankefull for the same. But alas (as I said in the chapter
 precedent) we loue to inrich them that care not for vs, but for our
 great commodities: and one trifling toie not woorth the cariage,
 c[=o]ming (as the prouerbe saith) in three ships from beyond the sea
 is more woorth with vs, than a right good iewell, easie to be had at
 home. They haue also the cast to teach vs to neglect our owne things,
 for if they see that we begin to make anie account of our commodities
 (if it be so that they haue also the like in their owne countries)
 they will suddenlie abase the same to so low a price, that our gaine
 not being woorthie our trauell, and the same commoditie with lesse
 cost readie to be had at home from other countries (though but for a
 while) it causeth vs to giue ouer our indeuours, and as it were by and
 by to forget the matter wherabout we went before, to obteine them at
 their hands. And this is the onelie cause wherefore our commodities
 are oft so little esteemed of. Some of them can saie without anie
 teacher, that they will buie the case of a fox of an Englishman for a
 groat, and make him afterward giue twelue pence for the taile. Would
 to God we might once wax wiser, and each one indeuor that the
 common-wealth of England may flourish againe in hir old rate, and that
 our commodities may be fullie wrought at home (as cloth if you will
 for an example) and not caried out to be shorne and dressed abroad,
 while our clothworkers here doo starue and beg their bread, and for
 lacke of dailie practise vtterlie neglect to be skilfull in this
 science! But to my purpose.

 We haue in England great plentie of quicke siluer, antimonie, sulphur,
 blacke lead, and orpiment red and yellow. We haue also the finest
 [Sidenote: The lord Mountioy.]
 alume (wherein the diligence of one of the greatest fauourers of the
 common-wealth of England of a subiect hath beene of late egregiouslie
 abused, and euen almost with barbarous inciuilitie) & of no lesse
 force against fire, if it were vsed in our parietings than that of
 Lipara, which onlie was in vse somtime amongst the Asians & Romans, &
 wherof Sylla had such triall that when he meant to haue burned a tower
 of wood erected by Archelaus the lieutenant of Mithridates, he could
 by no meanes set it on fire in a long time, bicause it was washed ouer
 with alume, as were also the gates of the temple of Jerusalem with
 like effect, and perceiued when Titus commanded fire to be put vnto
 the same. Beside this we haue also the naturall cinnabarum or
 vermilion, the sulphurous glebe called bitumen in old time for morter,
 and yet burned in lamps where oile is scant and geason: the
 chrysocolla, coperis, and minerall stone, whereof petriolum is made,
 and that which is most strange the minerall pearle, which as they are
 for greatnesse and colour most excellent of all other, so are they
 digged out of the maine land, and in sundrie places far distant from
 the shore. Certes the westerne part of the land hath in times past
 greatlie abounded with these and manie other rare and excellent
 commodities, but now they are washed awaie by the violence of the sea,
 which hath deuoured the greatest part of Cornewall and Deuonshire on
 either side: and it dooth appeere yet by good record, that whereas now
 there is a great distance betweene the Syllan Iles and point of the
 lands end, there was of late yeares to speke of scarselie a brooke or
 draine of one fadam water betweene them, if so much, as by those
 euidences appeereth, and are yet to be seene in the hands of the lord
 and chiefe owner of those Iles. But to proceed.

 Of colemines we haue such plentie in the north and westerne parts of
 our Iland, as may suffice for all the realme of England: and so must
 they doo hereafter in deed, if wood be not better cherrished than it
 is at this present. And to saie the truth, notwithstanding that verie
 manie of them are caried into other countries of the maine, yet their
 greatest trade beginneth now to grow from the forge into the kitchin
 and hall, as may appeere alreadie in most cities and townes that lie
 about the coast, where they haue but little other fewell, except it be
 turffe and hassocke. I maruell not a little that there is no trade of
 these into Sussex and Southampton shire, for want whereof the smiths
 doo worke their iron with charcoale. I thinke that far carriage be the
 onelie cause, which is but a slender excuse to inforce vs to carrie
 them vnto the maine from hence.

 Beside our colemines we haue pits in like sort of white plaster, and
 of fat and white and other coloured marle, wherewith in manie places
 the inhabitors doo compest their soile, and which dooth benefit their
 land in ample maner for manie yeares to come. We haue saltpeter for
 our ordinance, and salt soda for our glasse, & thereto in one place a
 kind of earth (in Southerie as I weene hard by Codington, and sometime
 in the tenure of one Croxton of London) which is so fine to make
 moulds for goldsmiths and casters of mettall, that a load of it was
 woorth fiue shillings thirtie yeares agone: none such againe they saie
 in England. But whether there be or not, let vs not be vnthankefull to
 God for these and other his benefits bestowed vpon vs, whereby he
 sheweth himselfe a louing and mercifull father vnto vs, which
 contrariewise returne vnto him in lieu of humilitie and obedience,
 nothing but wickednesse, auarice, meere contempt of his will, pride,
 excesse, atheisme, and no lesse than Iewish ingratitude.




 OF METTALS TO BE HAD IN OUR LAND.

 CHAP. XI.


 All mettals receiue their beginning of quicksiluer and sulphur, which
 are as mother and father to them. And such is the purpose of nature in
 their generations: that she tendeth alwaies to the procreation of
 gold, neuerthelesse she sildome reacheth vnto that hir end, bicause of
 the vnequall mixture and proportion of these two in the substance
 ingendered, whereby impediment and corruption is induced, which as it
 is more or lesse, dooth shew it selfe in the mettall that is
 producted. First of all therefore the substance of sulphur and
 quicksiluer being mixed in due proportion, after long and temperate
 decoction in the bowels of the earth, orderlie ingrossed and fixed,
 becommeth gold, which Encelius dooth call the sunne and right heire of
 nature: but if it swarue but a little (saith he) in the commixtion and
 other circumstances, then dooth it product siluer the daughter, not so
 noble a child as gold hir brother, which among mettall is worthilie
 called the cheefe. Contrariwise, the substances of the aforesaid
 parents mixed without proportion, and lesse digested and fixed in the
 entrailes of the earth, whereby the radicall moisture becommeth
 combustible and not of force to indure heat and hammer, dooth either
 turne into tin, lead, copper, or iron, which were the first mettals
 knowne in time past vnto antiquitie, although that in these daies
 there are diuerse other, whereof neither they nor our alchumists had
 euer anie knowledge. Of these therfore which are reputed among the
 third sort, we here in England haue our parts, and as I call them to
 mind, so will I intreat of them, and with such breuitie as may serue
 [Sidenote: Gold.]
 [Sidenote: Siluer.]
 the turne, and yet not altogither omit to saie somewhat of gold and
 siluer also, bicause I find by good experience how it was not said of
 old time without great reason, that all countries haue need of
 Britaine, and Britaine it selfe of none. For truelie if a man regard
 such necessities as nature onelie requireth, there is no nation vnder
 the sunne, that can saie so much as ours: sith we doo want none that
 are conuenient for vs. Wherefore if it be a benefit to haue anie gold
 at all, we are not void of some, neither likewise of siluer:
 whatsoeuer Cicero affirmeth to the contrarie, Lib. 4. ad Atticum epi.
 16. in whose time they were not found, "Britannici belli exitus (saith
 he) expectatur, constat enim aditus insulae esse munitos mirificis
 molibus: etiam illud iam cognitum est, neque argenti scrupulum esse
 vllum in illa insula, neque vllam spem praedae nisi ex mancipijs, ex
 quibus nullos puto te litteris aut musicis eruditos expectare." And
 albeit that we haue no such abundance of these (as some other
 countries doo yeeld) yet haue my rich countrimen store inough of both
 in their pursses, where in time past they were woont to haue least,
 bicause the garnishing of our churches, tabernacles, images, shrines
 and apparell of the preests consumed the greatest part, as experience
 hath confirmed.

 Of late my countriemen haue found out I wot not what voiage into the
 west Indies, from whence they haue brought some gold, whereby our
 countrie is inriched: but of all that euer aduentured into those
 parts, none haue sped better than sir Francis Drake whose successe
 1582 hath far passed euen his owne expectation. One Iohn Frobisher in
 like maner attempting to seeke out a shorter cut by the northerlie
 regions into the peaceable sea and kingdome of Cathaie, happened 1577
 vpon certeine Ilands by the waie, wherein great plentie of much gold
 appeared, and so much that some letted not to giue out for certeintie,
 that Salomon had his gold from thence, wherewith he builded the
 temple. This golden shew made him so desirous also of like successe,
 that he left off his former voiage, & returned home to bring news of
 such things as he had seene. But when after another voiage it was
 found to be but drosse, he gaue ouer both the enterprises, and now
 keepeth home without anie desire at all to seeke into farre countries.
 In truth, such was the plentie of ore there seene and to be had, that
 if it had holden perfect, might haue furnished all the world with
 abundance of that mettall; the iorneie also was short and performed in
 foure or fiue moneths, which was a notable incouragement. But to
 proceed.

 [Sidenote: Tin.]
 [Sidenote: Lead.]
 Tin and lead, mettals which Strabo noteth in his time to be carried
 vnto Marsilis from hence, as Diodorus also confirmeth, are verie
 plentifull with vs, the one in Cornewall, Deuonshire (& else-where in
 the north) the other in Darbishire, Weredale, and sundrie places of
 this Iland; whereby my countriemen doo reape no small commoditie, but
 especiallie our pewterers, who in time past imploied the vse of pewter
 onelie vpon dishes, pots, and a few other trifles for seruice here at
 home, whereas now they are growne vnto such exquisit cunning, that
 they can in maner imitate by infusion anie forme or fashion of cup,
 dish, salt, bowle, or goblet, which is made by goldsmiths craft,
 though they be neuer so curious, exquisite, and artificiallie forged.
 Such furniture of houshold of this mettall, as we commonlie call by
 the name of vessell, is sold vsuallie by the garnish, which dooth
 conteine twelue platters, twelue dishes, twelue saucers, and those are
 either of siluer fashion, or else with brode or narrow brims, and
 bought by the pound, which is now valued at six or seuen pence, or
 peraduenture at eight pence. Of porringers, pots, and other like I
 speake not, albeit that in the making of all these things there is
 such exquisite diligence vsed, I meane for the mixture of the mettall
 and true making of this commoditie (by reason of sharpe laws prouided
 in that behalfe) as the like is not to be found in any other trade. I
 haue beene also informed that it consisteth of a composition, which
 hath thirtie pounds of kettle brasse to a thousand pounds of tin,
 whervnto they ad three or foure pounds of tinglasse: but as too much
 of this dooth make the stuffe brickle, so the more the brasse be, the
 better is the pewter, and more profitable vnto him that dooth buie and
 purchase the same. But to proceed.

 In some places beyond the sea a garnish of good flat English pewter of
 an ordinarie making (I saie flat, bicause dishes and platters in my
 time begin to be made deepe like basons, and are indeed more
 conuenient both for sawce, broth, and keeping the meat warme) is
 esteemed almost so pretious, as the like number of vessels that are
 made of fine siluer, and in maner no lesse desired amongst the great
 estates, whose workmen are nothing so skilfull in that trade as ours,
 neither their mettall so good, nor plentie so great, as we haue here
 in England. The Romans made excellent looking glasses of our English
 tin, howbeit our workemen were not then so exquisite in that feat as
 the Brundusiens: wherefore the wrought mettall was carried ouer vnto
 them by waie of merchandize, and verie highlie were those glasses
 esteemed of till siluer came generallie in place, which in the end
 brought the tin into such contempt, that in manner euerie dishwasher
 refused to looke in other than siluer glasses for the attiring of hir
 head. Howbeit the making of siluer glasses had beene in vse before
 Britaine was knowne vnto the Romans, for I read that one Praxiteles
 deuised them in the yoong time of Pompeie, which was before the
 comming of Caesar into this Iland.

 There were mines of lead sometimes also in Wales, which indured so
 long till the people had consumed all their wood by melting of the
 same (as they did also at Comeristwith six miles from Stradfleur) and
 I suppose that in Plinies time the abundance of lead (whereof he
 speaketh) was to be found in those parts, in the seauenteenth of his
 thirtie fourth booke: also he affirmeth that it laie in the verie
 swart of the earth, and dailie gotten in such plentie, that the Romans
 made a restraint of the cariage thereof to Rome, limiting how much
 should yearelie be wrought and transported ouer the sea. And here by
 the waie it is worthie to be noted, of a crow which a miner of tin,
 dwelling neere Comeristwith (as Leland saith) had made so tame, that
 it would dailie flie and follow him to his worke and other places
 where soeuer he happened to trauell. This labourer working on a time
 in the bottome or vallie, where the first mine was knowne to be, did
 laie his pursse and girdle by him, as men commonlie doo that addresse
 themselues to applie their businesse earnestlie, and he himselfe also
 had vsed from time to time before. The crow likewise was verie busie
 flittering about him, and so much molested him, that he waxed angrie
 with the bird, & in his furie threatened to wring off his necke, if he
 might once get him into his hands; to be short, in the end the crow,
 hastilie caught vp his girdle and pursse, and made awaie withall so
 fast as hir wings could carrie hir. Heerevpon the poore man falling
 into great agonie (for he feared to lose peraduenture all his monie)
 threw downe his mattocke at aduenture and ran after the bird, curssing
 and menacing that he should lose his life if euer he got him againe:
 but as it fell out, the crow was the means whereby his life was saued,
 for he had not beene long out of the mine, yer it fell downe and
 killed all his fellowes. If I should take vpon me to discourse and
 search out the cause of the thus dealing of this bird at large, I
 should peraduenture set my selfe further into the briers than well
 find which waie to come out againe: yet am I persuaded, that the crow
 was Gods instrument herein, wherby the life of this poore labourer was
 preserued. It was doone also in an other order than that which I read
 of another tame crow, kept vp by a shoomaker of Dutch land in his shop
 or stoue: who seeing the same to sit vpon the pearch among his shoone,
 verie heauilie and drousie, said vnto the bird: What aileth my iacke,
 whie art thou sad and pensiue? The crow hearing his maister speake
 after this sort vnto him, answered (or else the diuell within him) out
 of the psalter: "Cogitaui dies antiquos & aeternos in mente habui." But
 whither am I digressed, from lead vnto crowes, & from crowes vnto
 diuels? Certes it is now high time to returne vnto our mettals, and
 resume the tractation of such things as I had earst in hand.

 [Sidenote: Iron.]
 Iron is found in manie places, as in Sussex, Kent, Weredale, Mendip,
 Walshall, as also in Shropshire, but cheeflie in the woods betwixt
 Beluos and Willocke or Wicberie neere Manchester, and elsewhere in
 Wales. Of which mines diuerse doo bring foorth so fine and good
 stuffe, as anie that commeth from beyond the sea, beside the infinit
 gaines to the owners, if we would so accept it, or bestow a little
 more cost in the refining of it. It is also of such toughnesse, that
 it yeeldeth to the making of claricord wire in some places of the
 realme. Neuerthelesse, it was better cheape with vs when strangers
 onelie brought it hither: for it is our qualitie when we get anie
 commoditie, to vse it with extremitie towards our owne nation, after
 we haue once found the meanes to shut out forreners from the bringing
 in of the like. It breedeth in like manner great expense and waste of
 wood, as dooth the making of our pots and table vessell of glasse,
 wherein is much losse sith it is so quicklie broken; and yet (as I
 thinke) easie to be made tougher, if our alchumists could once find
 the true birth or production of the red man, whose mixture would
 induce a metallicall toughnesse vnto it, whereby it should abide the
 hammer.

 [Sidenote: Copper.]
 Copper is latelie not found, but rather restored againe to light. For
 I haue read of copper to haue beene heretofore gotten in our Iland;
 howbeit as strangers haue most commonly the gouernance of our mines,
 so they hitherto make small gains of this in hand in the north parts:
 for (as I am informed) the profit dooth verie hardlie counteruaile the
 charges; whereat wise men doo not a litle maruell, considering the
 abundance which that mine dooth seeme to offer, and as it were at
 hand. Leland our countrieman noteth sundrie great likelihoods of
 naturall copper mines to be eastwards, as betweene Dudman and
 Trewardth in the sea cliffes, beside other places, whereof diuerse are
 noted here and there in sundrie places of this booke alreadie, and
 therefore it shall be but in vaine to repeat them here againe: as for
 that which is gotten out of the marchasite, I speake not of it, sith
 it is not incident to my purpose. In Dorsetshire also a copper mine
 latelie found is brought to good perfection.

 [Sidenote: Steele.]
 As for our steele, it is not so good for edge-tooles as that of
 Colaine, and yet the one is often sold for the other, and like tale
 vsed in both, that is to saie, thirtie gads to the sheffe, and twelue
 sheffes to the burden. Our alchumie is artificiall, and thereof our
 spoones and some salts are commonlie made, and preferred before our
 pewter with some, albeit in truth it be much subiect to corruption,
 putrifaction, more heauie and foule to handle than our pewter; yet
 some ignorant persons affirme it to be a mettall more naturall, and
 the verie same which Encelius calleth _Plumbum cinereum_, the Germans,
 wisemute, mithan, & counterfeie, adding, that where it groweth, siluer
 can not be farre off. Neuerthelesse it is knowne to be a mixture of
 brasse, lead, and tin (of which this latter occupieth the one halfe)
 but after another proportion than is vsed in pewter. But alas I am
 persuaded that neither the old Arabians, nor new alchumists of our
 time did euer heare of it, albeit that the name thereof doo seeme to
 come out of their forge. For the common sort indeed doo call it
 alchumie, an vnwholsome mettall (God wot) and woorthie to be banished
 and driuen out of the land. And thus I conclude with this discourse,
 as hauing no more to saie of the mettals of my countrie, except I
 should talke of brasse, bell mettall, and such as are brought ouer for
 merchandize from other countries: and yet I can not but saie that
 there is some brasse found also in England, but so small is the
 quantitie, that it is not greatlie to be esteemed or accounted of.




 OF PRETIOUS STONES.

 CHAP. XII.


 The old writers remember few other stones of estimation to be found in
 [sidenote: Geat.]
 this Iland than that which we call geat, and they in Latine _Gagaies_:
 wherevnto furthermore they ascribe sundrie properties, as vsuallie
 [Sidenote: Laon.]
 [Sidenote: Chalchondile.]
 practised here in times past, whereof none of our writers doo make
 anie mention at all. Howbeit whatsoeuer it hath pleased a number of
 strangers (vpon false surmise) to write of the vsages of this our
 countrie, about the triall of the virginitie of our maidens by
 drinking the powder hereof against the time of their bestowing in
 mariage: certeine it is that euen to this daie there is some plentie
 to be had of this commoditie in Darbishire and about Barwike, whereof
 rings, salts, small cups, and sundrie trifling toies are made,
 although that in manie mens opinions nothing so fine as that which is
 brought ouer by merchants dailie from the maine. But as these men are
 drowned with the common errour conceiued of our nation, so I am sure
 that in discerning the price and value of things, no man now liuing
 can go beyond the iudgement of the old Romans, who preferred the geat
 of Britaine before the like stones bred about Luke and all other
 countries wheresoeuer. Marbodeus Gallus also writing of the same among
 other of estimation, saith thus:

   Nascitur in Lycia lapis & prope gemma Gagates,
   Sed genus eximium faecunda Britannia mittit,
   Lucidus & niger est, leuis & leuissimus idem,
   Vicinas paleas trahit attritu calefactus,
   Ardet aqua lotus, restinguitur vnctus oliuo.

 The Germane writers confound it with amber as it were a kind therof:
 but as I regard not their iudgement in this point, so I read that it
 taketh name of Gagas a citie and riuer in Silicia, where it groweth in
 plentifull maner, as Dioscorides saith. Nicander in Theriaca calleth
 it Engangin and Gangitin, of the plentie thereof that is found in the
 place aforesaid, which he calleth Ganges, and where they haue great
 vse of it in driuing awaie of serpents by the onelie perfume thereof.
 Charles the fourth emperour of that name glased the church withall
 that standeth at the fall of Tangra, but I cannot imagine what light
 should enter therby. The writers also diuide this stone into fiue
 kinds, of which the one is in colour like vnto lion tawnie, another
 straked with white veines, the third with yellow lines, the fourth is
 garled with diuerse colours, among which some are like drops of bloud
 (but those come out of Inde) and the fift shining blacke as anie
 rauens feather.

 Moreouer, as geat was one of the first stones of this Ile, whereof
 anie forren account was made, so our pearles also did match with it in
 renowme; in so much that the onelie desire of them caused Caesar to
 aduenture hither, after he had seene the quantities and heard of our
 plentie of them, while he abode in France, and whereof he made a
 taberd which he offered vp in Rome to Venus, where it hoong long after
 as a rich and notable oblation and testimonie of the riches of our
 countrie. Certes they are to be found in these our daies, and thereto
 of diuerse colours, in no lesse numbers than euer they were in old
 time. Yet are they not now so much desired bicause of their smalnesse,
 and also for other causes, but especiallie sith churchworke, as copes,
 vestments, albes, tunicles, altarclothes, canopies, and such trash,
 are worthilie abolished; vpon which our countrimen superstitiously
 bestowed no small quantities of them. For I thinke there were few
 churches or religious houses, besides bishops miters, bookes and other
 pontificall vestures, but were either throughlie fretted, or notablie
 garnished with huge numbers of them. Marbodeus likewise speaking of
 pearles, commendeth them after this maner:

   Gignit & insignes antiqua Britannia baccas, &c.

 Marcellinus also Lib. 23, "in ipso fine," speaketh of our pearls and
 their generation, but he preferreth greatlie those of Persia before
 them, which to me dooth seeme vnequallie doone. But as the British
 geat or orient pearle were in old time esteemed aboue those of other
 countries; so time hath since the conquest of the Romans reuealed
 manie other: insomuch that at this season there are found in England
 the Aetites (in English called the ernestone, but for erne some
 pronounce eagle) and the hematite or bloodstone, and these verie pure
 and excellent: also the calcedonie, the porphyrite, the christall, and
 those other which we call calaminares and speculares, besides a kind
 of diamond or adamant, which although it be verie faire to sight, is
 yet much softer (as most are that are found & bred toward the north)
 than those that are brought hither out of other countries. We haue
 also vpon our coast the white corall, nothing inferiour to that which
 is found beyond the sea in the albe, neere to the fall of Tangra, or
 to the red and blacke, whereof Dioscorides intreateth, Lib. 5. cap. 8.
 We haue in like sort sundrie other stones dailie found in cliffes and
 rocks (beside the load stone which is oftentimes taken vp out of our
 mines of iron) whereof such as find them haue either no knowledge at
 all, or else doo make but small account, being seduced by outlandish
 lapidaries, whereof the most part discourage vs from the searching and
 seeking out of our owne commodities, to the end that they maie haue
 the more free vtterance of their naturall and artificiall wares,
 whereby they get great gaines amongst such as haue no skill.

 [Sidenote: Triall of a stone.]
 I haue heard that the best triall of a stone is to laie it on the
 naile of the thombe, and so to go abroad into the cleare light, where
 if the colour hold in all places a like, the stone is thought to be
 naturall and good: but if it alter, especiallie toward the naile, then
 is it not sound, but rather to be taken for an artificiall peece of
 practise. If this be true it is an experiment woorthie the noting.
 [Sidenote: Lib. 7.]
 Cardan also hath it in his "De subtilitate;" if not, I haue read more
 lies than this, as one for example out of Cato, who saieth, that a cup
 of iuie will hold no wine at all. I haue made some vessels of the same
 wood, which refuse no kind of liquor, and therefore I suppose that
 there is no such _Antipathia_ betweene wine and our iuie, as some of
 our reading philosophers (without all maner of practise) will seeme to
 infer amongst vs: and yet I denie not but the iuie of Greece or Italie
 may haue such a propertie; but why should not the iuie then of France
 somewhat participat withall in the like effect, which groweth in an
 hotter soile than ours is? For as Baptista porta saith, it holdeth not
 also in the French iuie, wherfore I can not beleeue that it hath anie
 such qualitie at all as Cato ascribeth vnto it. What should I say more
 of stones? Trulie I can not tell, sith I haue said what I may
 alreadie, and peraduenture more than I thinke necessarie: and that
 causeth me to passe ouer those that are now & then taken out of our
 oisters, todes, muskels, snailes and adders, and likewise such as are
 found vpon sundrie hils in Glocestershire, which haue naturallie such
 sundrie proportions, formes & colours in them, as passe all humane
 possibilitie to imitate, be the workeman neuer so skilfull and
 cunning, also those that are found in the heads of our perches and
 carps much desired of such as haue the stone, & yet of themselues are
 no stones but rather shels or gristles, which in time consume to
 nothing. This yet will I ad, that if those which are found in muskels
 (for I am vtterlie ignorant of the generation of pearls) be good
 pearle in deed, I haue at sundrie times gathered more than an ounce of
 them, of which diuerse haue holes alreadie entered by nature, some of
 them not much inferiour to great peason in quantitie, and thereto of
 sundrie colours, as it happeneth amongst such as are brought from the
 esterlie coast to Saffron Walden in Lent, when for want of flesh,
 stale stinking fish and welked muskels are thought to be good meat;
 for other fish is too deere amongst vs when law dooth bind vs to vse
 it. See more for the generation of pearls in the description of
 Scotland, for there you shall be further informed out of Boetius in
 that behalfe. They are called orient, because of the cleerenesse,
 which resembleth the colour of the cleere aire before the rising of
 the sun. They are also sought for in the later end of August, a little
 before which time the sweetnesse of the dew is most conuenient for
 that kind of fish, which dooth ingender and conceiue them, whose forme
 is flat, and much like vnto a lempet. The further north also that they
 be found the brighter is their colour, & their substances of better
 valure, as lapidaries doo giue out.




 OF SALT MADE IN ENGLAND.

 CHAP. XIII.


 There are in England certein welles where salt is made, whereof Leland
 hath written abundantlie in his c[=o]mentaries of Britaine, and whose
 words onlie I will set downe in English as he wrote them, bicause he
 seemeth to haue had diligent consideration of the same, without adding
 anie thing of mine owne to him, except it be where necessitie dooth
 inforce me for the meere aid of the reader, in the vnderstanding of
 his mind. Directing therefore his iournie from Worcester in his
 peregrination and laborious trauell ouer England, he saith thus: From
 Worcester I road to the Wich by inclosed soile, hauing meetlie good
 corne ground, sufficient wood and good pasture, about a six miles off,
 Wich standeth somewhat in a vallie or low ground, betwixt two small
 hils on the left ripe (for so he calleth the banke of euerie brooke
 through out all his English treatises) of a pretie riuer which not far
 beneath the Wich is called Salope brooke. The beautie of the towne in
 maner standeth in one street, yet be there manie lanes in the towne
 besides. There is also a meane church in the maine street, and once in
 the weeke an indifferent round market. The towne of it selfe is
 somewhat foule and durtie when anie raine falleth by reason of much
 cariage through the streets, which are verie ill paued or rather not
 paued at all. The great aduancement also hereof is by making of salt.
 And though the commoditie thereof be singular great, yet the burgesses
 be poore generallie, bicause gentlemen haue for the most part gotten
 the great gaine of it into their hands, whilest the poore burgesses
 [Sidenote: A common plague in all things of anie great commoditie,
 for one beateth the bush but another catcheth the birds,
 as we may see in bat-fowling.]
 yeeld vnto all the labour. There are at this present time three
 hundred salters, and three salt springs in the towne of Wich, whereof
 the principall is within a butshoot of the right ripe (or banke) of
 the riuer that there commeth downe: and this spring is double so
 profitable in yeelding of salt liquor, as both the other. Some saie
 (or rather fable) that this salt spring did faile in the time of
 Richard de la Wich bishop of Chichester, and that afterwards by his
 intercession it was restored to the profit of the old course (such is
 the superstition of the people) in remembrance whereof, or
 peraduenture for the zeale which the Wich men and salters did beare
 vnto Richard de la Wich their countriman, they vsed of late times on
 his daie (which commeth once in the yeare) to hang this salt spring or
 well about with tapistrie, and to haue sundrie games, drinkings, and
 foolish reuels at it. But to proceed. There be a great number of salt
 cotes about this well, wherein the salt water is sodden in leads, and
 brought to the perfection of pure white salt. The other two salt
 springs be on the left side of the riuer a pretie waie lower than the
 first, and (as I found) at the verie end of the towne. At these also
 be diuerse fornaces to make salt, but the profit and plentie of these
 two are nothing comparable to the gaine that riseth by the greatest. I
 asked of a salter how manie fornaces they had at all the three
 springs, and he numbred them to eighteene score, that is, three
 hundred and sixtie, saieng how euerie one of them paied yearelie six
 shillings and eight pence to the king. The truth is that of old they
 had liberties giuen vnto them for three hundred fornaces or more, and
 therevpon they giue a fee farme (or _Vectigal_) of one hundred pounds
 yearelie. Certes the pension is as it was, but the number of fornaces
 is now increased to foure hundred. There was of late search made for
 another salt spring there abouts, by the meanes of one Newport a
 gentleman dwelling at the Wich, and the place where it was appeereth,
 as dooth also the wood and timber which was set about it, to keepe vp
 the earth from falling into the same. But this pit was not since
 occupied, whether it were for lacke of plentie of the salt spring, or
 for letting or hindering of the profit of the other three. Me thinke
 that if wood and sale of salt would serue, they might dig and find
 more salt springs about the Wich than three, but there is somewhat
 [Sidenote: Priuileges doo somtimes harme.]
 else in the wind. For I heard that of late yeares a salt spring was
 found in an other quarter of Worcestershire, but it grew to be without
 anie vse, sith the Wich men haue such a priuilege, that they alone in
 those quarters shall haue the making of salt. The pits be so set about
 with gutters, that the salt water is easilie turned to euerie mans
 house, and at Nantwich verie manie troughs go ouer the riuer for the
 commoditie of such as dwell on the other side of the same. They seeth
 also their salt water in fornaces of lead, and lade out the salt some
 in cases of wicker, through which the water draineth, and the salt
 remaineth. There be also two or three but verie little salt springs at
 Dertwitch, in a low bottome, where salt is sometime made.

 Of late also a mile from Cumbremere abbaie a peece of an hill did
 sinke, and in the same pit rose a spring of salt water, where the
 abbat began to make salt; but the men of the citie compounded with the
 abbat & couent that there should be none made there, whereby the pit
 was suffered to go to losse. And although it yeelded salt water still
 of it selfe, yet it was spoiled at the last and filled vp with filth.
 The Wich men vse the c[=o]moditie of their salt springs in drawing and
 decocting the water of them onlie by six moneths in the yeare, that
 is, from Midsummer to Christmas, as (I gesse) to mainteine the price
 of salt, or for sauing of wood, which I thinke to be their principall
 reason. For making of salt is a great and notable destruction of wood,
 and shall be greater hereafter, except some prouision be made for the
 better increase of firing. The lacke of wood also is alreadie
 perceiued in places neere the Wich, for whereas they vsed to buie and
 take their wood neere vnto their occupiengs, those woonted springs are
 now decaied, and they be inforced to seeke their wood so far as
 Worcester towne, and all the parts about Brenisgraue, Alchirch, and
 Alcester. I asked a salter how much wood he supposed yearelie to be
 spent at these fornaces? and he answered that by estimation there was
 consumed about six thousand load, and it was round pole wood for the
 most, which is easie to be cleft, and handsomelie riuen in peeces. The
 people that are about the fornaces are verie ill coloured, and the
 iust rate of euerie fornace is to make foure loads of salt yearelie,
 and to euerie load goeth fiue or six quarters as they make their
 accounts. If the fornace men make more in one fornace than foure
 loads, it is (as it is said) imploied to their owne auaile. And thus
 much hath Leland left in memorie of our white salt, who in an other
 booke, not now in my hands, hath touched the making also of baie salt
 in some part of our countrie. But sith that booke is deliuered againe
 to the owner, the tractation of baie salt can not be framed in anie
 order, bicause my memorie will not serue to shew the true maner and
 the place. It shall suffice therfore to haue giuen such notice of it,
 to the end the reader may know that aswell the baie as white are
 wrought and made in England, and more white also vpon the west coast
 toward Scotland, in Essex and else where, out of the salt water
 betweene Wire and Cokermouth, which commonlie is of like price with
 our wheat. Finallie, hauing thus intermedled our artificiall salt with
 our minerals, let vs giue ouer, and go in hand with such mettals as
 are growing here in England.




 OF OUR ACCOMPT OF TIME & HIR PARTS.

 CHAP. XIV.


 As _Libra_ is _As_ or _Assis_ to the Romans for their weight, and the
 foot in standard measure: so in our accompt of the parts of time, we
 take the daie consisting of foure and twentie houres, to be the
 greatest of the least, and least of the greatest, whereby we keepe our
 reckoning: for of the houre (to saie the truth) the most ancient
 Romans, Greeks, nor Hebrues had anie vse; sith they reckoned by
 watches: and whereof also Censorinus cap. 19. sheweth a reason
 wherefore they were neglected. For my part I doo not see anie great
 difference vsed in the obseruation of time & hir parts, betweene our
 owne & any other forren nation, wherfore I shall not need to stand
 long on this matter. Howbeit to the end our exact order herein shall
 appeere vnto all men, I will set downe some short rehearsall thereof,
 and that in so briefe manner as vnto me is possible. As for our
 astronomicall practises, I meane not to meddle with them, sith their
 course is vniformelie obserued, ouer all. Our common order therefore
 is to begin at the minut, which conteineth 1/60 part of an houre, as
 at the smallest part of time knowne vnto the people, notwithstanding
 that in most places they descend no lower than the halfe quarter or
 quarter of the houre; and from whence they proceed vnto the houre, to
 wit, the foure and twentith part of that which we call the common and
 naturall daie, which dooth begin at midnight, and is obserued
 continuallie by clockes, dialles, and astronomicall instruments of all
 sorts. The artificiall varietie of which kind of ware is so great here
 in England, as no place else (in mine opinion) can be comparable
 therein to this Ile. I will not speake of the cost bestowed vpon them
 in perle and stone, neither of the valure of mettall, whereof they
 haue beene made, as gold, siluer, &c: and almost no abbeie or
 religious house without some of them. This onelie shall suffice to
 note here (as by the waie) that as antiquitie hath delighted in these
 things, so in our time pompe and excesse spendeth all, and nothing is
 regarded that bringeth in no bread. Of vnequall or temporall houres or
 daies, our nation hath no regard, and therefore to shew their
 quantities, differences, and diuisions, into the greater and the
 lesser, (whereof the later conteineth one vnequall houre, or the
 rising of halfe a signe, the other of a whole signe, which is in two
 houres space, wherof Marke seemth to speake cap. 15 c 25, as the rest
 of the euangelists (yea and he also ibid. vers. 33) doo of the other,
 Matth. 27 e 45, Luke 23 e 44, John 19 b 14) it should be but in vaine.
 In like sort, wheras the elder Aegyptians, Italians, Bohemians, latter
 Atheniens, and Iews begin their daie at the sun set ouer night; the
 Persians, Babylonians, Grecians, and Noribergians, at the sun rising
 (ech of them accompting their daies and nights by vnequall houres)
 also the elder Atheniens, Arabians, Dutchmen, Vmbers, Hetrurians, and
 Astronomers at high noone, and so reckon from noone to noone: we after
 Hipparchus and the latter Aegyptians, or to speake more properlie,
 imitating the Roman maner vsed in the church there of long time,
 choose the verie point of midnight; from whence we accompt twelue
 equall houres vnto middaie insuing, and other twelue againe vnto the
 aforesaid point, according to these verses;

   Mane diem Graeca gens incipit astra sequentes
   In medio lucis Iudaeis vespere sancta,
   Inchoat ecclesia media sua tempora nocte.

 And this is our generall order for the naturall daie. Of the
 artificiall we make so farre accompt, as that we reckon it daie when
 the sun is vp, and night when the sun leaueth our horizon. Otherwise
 also we diuide it into two parts, that is to saie, fore noone and
 after noone, not regarding the ruddie, shining, burning and warming
 seasons (of three vnequall houres a peece, which others seeme to
 diuide into spring time, summer, autumne, and winter, in like curious
 manner) and whereof I read these verses:

   Solis equi lucis dicuntur quatuor horae,
   Haec rubet, haec splendet, haec calet, illa tepet.

 Indeed our physicians haue another partition of the daie, as men of no
 lesse learning no doubt than the best of forren countries, if we could
 so conceiue of them. And herein they concurre also with those of other
 nations, who for distinction in regiment of our humors, diuide the
 artificiall daie and night in such wise as these verses doo import,
 and are indeed a generall rule which ech of them doth follow:

   Tres lucis primas, noctis tres sanguinis imas,
   Vis cholerae medias lucis sex vendicat horas.
   Datque melam primas noctis, tres lucis & imas,
   Centrales ponas sex noctis phlegmatis horas.

 Or thus, as Tansteter hath giuen them foorth in his prelections:

   A nona noctis donec sit tertia lucis,
   Est dominus sanguis, sex inde sequentibus horis
   Est dominans cholera, dum lucis nona sit hora
   Post niger humid inest donec sit tertia noctis,
   Posthaec phlegma venit, donec sit nona quietis.

 _In English thus in effect_:

   Three houres yer sun doo rise,
       and so manie after, blud,
   From nine to three at after noone,
       hot choler beares the swaie,
   Euen so to nine at night,
       swart choler hath to rule,
   As phlegme from thence to three at morne;
       six houres ech one I saie.

 [Sidenote: Night.]
 [Sidenote: Vesper.]
 In like sort for the night we haue none other parts than the twilight,
 darkenight, midnight, and cocks crowing: wheras the Latins diuide the
 same into 7 parts, as _Vesper_ or _Vesperugo_, as Plautus calleth it,
 as Virgil vseth the word _Hesper_ the euening, which is immediatlie
 [Sidenote: Crepsuculum.]
 after the setting of the sun. _Crepusculum_ the twilight (which some
 call _Prima fax_, because men begin then to light candles) when it is
 betweene daie and night, light and darkenesse, or properlie neither
 [Sidenote: Concubium.]
 daie nor night. _Concubium_ the still of the night, when ech one is
 laid to rest.

 [Sidenote: Intempestum.]
 _Intempestum_, the dull or dead of the night, which is midnight, when
 [Sidenote: Gallicinium.]
 [Sidenote: Conticinium.]
 [Sidenote: Matutinum.]
 [Sidenote: Diluculum.]
 men be in their first or dead sleepe. _Gallicinium_, the cocks
 crowing. _Conticinium_, when the cocks haue left crowing. _Matutinum_,
 the breach of the daie, and _Diluculum siue aurora_, the ruddie,
 orenge, golden or shining colour, seene immediatlie before the rising
 of the sun, and is opposite to the euening, as _Matutinum_ is to the
 twilight.

 [Sidenote: Watches.]
 Other there are which doo reckon by watches, diuiding the night after
 sun setting into foure equall parts. Of which the first beginneth at
 euening called the first watch, and continueth by three vnequall
 houres, and so foorth vntill the end of the ninth houre, whereat the
 fourth watch entreth, which is called the morning watch, bicause it
 concurreth partlie with the darke night, and partlie with the morning
 and breach of the daie before the rising of the sun.

 [Sidenote: Houre.]
 As for the originall of the word houre, it is verie ancient; but yet
 not so old as that of the watch, wherof we shall read abundantlie in
 the scriptures, which was deuised first among souldiors for their
 better safegard and change of watchmen in their camps; the like
 whereof is almost vsed among our seafaring men, which they call
 clearing of the glasse, and performed from time to time with great
 heed and some solemnitie. Herevnto the word _Hora_ among the Grecians
 signified so well the foure quarters of the yeere, as the foure and
 twentith part of the daie, and limits of anie forme. But what stand I
 vpon these things to let my purpose staie? To proceed therefore.

 [Sidenote: Weeke.]
 Of naturall daies is the weeke compacted, which consisteth of seauen
 of them, the fridaie being commonlie called among the vulgar sort
 either king or worling, bicause it is either the fairest or foulest of
 the seauen: albeit that I cannot ghesse of anie reason whie they
 should so imagine. The first of these entreth with mondaie, whereby it
 commeth to passe, that we rest vpon the sundaie, which is the seauenth
 in number, as almightie God hath commanded in his word. The Iews begin
 their weeke vpon our saturdaie at the setting of the sun: and the
 Turks in these daies with the saturdaie, whereby it commeth to passe,
 that as the Iews make our last daie the first of their weeke, so the
 Turks make the Iewish sabaoth the beginning of their _Hebdoma_:
 bicause Mahomet their prophet (as they saie) was borne and dead vpon
 the fridaie, and so he was indeed, except their Alcharon deceiue them.
 The Iews doo reckon their daies by their distance from their sabaoth,
 so that the first daie of their weeke is the first daie of the
 sabaoth, and so foorth vnto the sixt. The Latins and Aegyptians
 accompted their daies after the seauen planets, choosing the same for
 the denominator of the daie, that entreth his regiment with the first
 vnequall houre of the same after the sun be risen. Howbeit, as this
 order is not wholie reteined with vs, so the vse of the same is not
 yet altogither abolished, as may appeere by our sunday, mondaie, and
 saturdaie. The rest were changed by the Saxons, who in remembrance of
 Theut sometime their prince, called the second day of the week
 Theutsdach, the third Woden, Othin, Othon, or Edon, or Wodensdach.
 Also of Thor they named the fourth daie Thorsdach, and of Frea wife to
 Woden the fift was called Freadach. Albeit there are (and not amisse
 as I thinke) that suppose them to meane by Thor, Iupiter, by Woden,
 Mercurie, by Frea (or Frigga as Saxo calleth hir) Venus, and finallie
 by Theut, Mars: which if it be so, then it is an easie matter to find
 out the german Mars, Venus, Mercurie, and Iupiter, whereof you may
 read more hereafter in my chronologie. The truth is, that Frea albeit
 that Saxo giueth hir scant a good report, for that she loued one of
 hir husbands men better than himselfe, had seauen sonnes by Woden; the
 first, father to Wecca, of whome descended those that were afterwards
 kings of Kent. Fethelgeta was the second, and of him came the kings of
 Mercia. Baldaie the third, father to the kings of the west Saxons.
 Beldagius the fourth, parent to the kings of Brenicia or
 Northumberland. Weogodach the fift, author of the kings of Deira.
 Caser the sixt race of the east Angle race, & Nascad originall
 burgeant of the kings of Essex. As for the kings of Sussex, although
 they were of the same people, yet were they not of the same streine,
 as our old monuments doo expresse. But to proceed.

 As certeine of our daies suffered this alteration by the Saxons, so in
 [Sidenote: * _Ferias._]
 our churches we reteined for a long time the number of daies or of [*]
 feries from the sabaoth, after the manner of the Iews, I meane vntill
 the seruice after the Romane vse was abolished, which custome was
 first receiued (as some thinke) by pope Syluester, though other saie
 by Constantine; albeit another sort doo affirme, that Syluester caused
 the sundaie onelie to be called the Lords day, and dealt not with the
 rest.

 [Sidenote: Moneth.]
 In like maner of weekes our moneths are made, which are so called of
 the moone, each one conteining eight and twentie daies, or foure
 weekes, without anie further curiositie. For we reckon not our time by
 the yeare of the moone, as the Iews, Grecians, or Romans did at the
 first; or as the Turks, Arabians and Persians doo now: neither anie
 parcell thereof by the said planet, as in some part of the west
 Indies, where they haue neither weeke, moneth, nor yeere, but onlie a
 generall accompt of hundreds and thousands of moones. Wherefore if we
 saie or write a moneth, it is to be expounded of eight and twentie
 daies, or foure weeks onelie, and not of hir vsuall period of nine and
 twentie daies and one and thirtie minuts. Or (if you take it at large)
 [Sidenote: _Triuethus in Antarticos._]
 for a moneth of the common calender, which neuerthelesse in plees and
 sutes is nothing at all allowed of, sith the moone maketh hir full
 reuolution in eight and twentie daies or foure weeks, that is, vnto
 the place where she left the sun: notwithstanding that he be now gone,
 and at hir returne not to be found verie often in that signe wherin
 she before had left him. Plutarch writeth of diuers barbarous nations
 which reckoned a more or lesse number of these moneths for whole
 yeares: and that of these some accompted but three, as the Archadians
 did foure, the Acarnans six, and the Aegyptians but one for a whole
 yeare, which causeth them to make such a large accompt of their
 antiquitie and originall. But forsomuch as we are not troubled with
 anie such disorder, it shall suffice that I haue generallie said of
 moneths and their quantities at this time. Now a word or two of the
 ancient Romane calender.

 In old time each moneth of the Romane calender was reckoned after the
 course of the moone, and their enterances were vncerteine, as were
 also the changes of that planet: whereby it came to passe, that the
 daie of the change was the first of the moneth, howsoeuer it fell out.
 But after Iulius Cesar had once corrected the same, the seuerall
 beginnings of euerie one of them did not onelie remaine fixed, but
 also the old order in the diuision of their parts continued still
 vnaltered: so that the moneth is yet diuided as before, into calends,
 ides and nones, albeit that in my daies, the vse of the same bee but
 small, and their order reteined onelie in our calenders, for the
 better vnderstanding of such times, as the historiographers and old
 authors doo remember. The reckoning also of each of these goeth (as
 you see) after a preposterous order, whereby the Romans did rather
 note how many daies were to the next change from the precedent, than
 contrariwise, as by perusall of the same you shall more easilie
 perceiue.

 The daies also of the change of the moneth of the moone, are called
 _Calendae_, which in time of paganisme were consecrated to Iuno, and
 sacrifice made to that goddesse on the same. On these daies also, and
 on the ides and nones they would not marie. Likewise the morow after
 each of them were called _Dies atri_, blacke daies, as were also
 diuerse other, and those either by reason of some notable ouerthrow or
 mishap that befell vnto the Romans vpon those daies, or in respect of
 some superstitious imagination conceiued of euill successe likelie to
 fall out vpon the same. Of some they were called _Dies Aegyptiaci_.
 Wherby it appeareth that this peeuish estimation of these daies came
 from that nation. And as we doo note our holie and festiuall daies
 with red letters in our calenders, so did the Romans their principall
 feasts & circle of the moone, either in red or golden letters, and
 their victories in white, in their publike or consularie tables. This
 also is more to be added, that if anie good successe happened
 afterward vpon such day as was alreadie blacke in their calender, they
 would solemnlie enter it in white letters by racing out of the blacke,
 whereby the blacke daie was turned into white, and wherein they not a
 little reioised.

 The word _Calendae_ (in Greeke _Neomenia_) is deriued of _Calo_, to
 call: for vpon the first day of euerie moneth, the priest vsed to call
 the people of the citie and countrie togither in Calabria, for so the
 place was called where they met, and shew them by a custome how manie
 daies were from the said calends to the nones, & what feasts were to
 be celebrated betweene that and the next change. Their order is
 retrograde, because that after the moneth was halfe expired, or the
 moone past the full, they reckoned by the daies to come vntill the
 next change, as seuenteene daies, sixteene daies, fourteene daies, &c:
 as the Greekes did in the latter decad onelie, for they had no vse of
 calends. The verie day therefore of the change is called _Calendae_,
 dedicated to Iuno, who thereof was also called _Calendaris_. At the
 first also the fasts or feast daies were knowne by none other meanes
 vnto the people but by the denunciation of the priests (as I said)
 vpon this daie, till Flauius Scriba caused them to be written &
 published in their common calenders, contrarie to the will and meaning
 of the senat, for the ease and benefit of the people, as he pretended.

 The nones commonlie are not aboue foure or six in euerie moneth: and
 so long as the nones lasted, so long did the markets continue, and
 therefore they were called _Nonae quasi Nundinae_. In them also were
 neither holiedaies more than is at this present (except the day of the
 purification of our ladie) no sacrifice offered to the gods, but each
 one applied his businesse, and kept his market, reckoning the first
 day after the calends or change, to be the fourth or sixt daie before
 the faire ended. Some thinke that they were called _Nonae_, of the word
 _Non_, "quia in ijsdem dij non coluntur." For as Ouid saith, "Nonarum
 tutela deo caret," or for that the nones were alwaies on the ninth
 daie before the ides: other because _Nundina dea_ was honored the
 ninth day before the ides, albeit I suppose rather that _Nundina dea_
 (a goddesse far yoonger than the name of _Nonae_) tooke hir name of the
 nones, whereon it was a custome among the Romans, "Lustrare infantes
 ac nomina maribus imponere," as they did with their maid children vpon
 the eight: but howsoeuer this be, sure it is that they were the mart
 daies of euerie moneth, wherin the people bought, sold, exchanged or
 bartered, and did nothing else.

 The ides are so named of the Hethruscan word, _Iduare_, to diuide: and
 before that Cesar altered the calender, they diuided the moneth
 commonlie by the middest. But afterward when he had added certeine
 daies thereto, therby to make it agree to the yeere of the sunne
 (which he intruded about the end of euerie moneth, bicause he would
 not alter the celebration of their vsuall feasts, whereof the chiefe
 were holden alwaies vpon the day of the ides) then came they short of
 the middest, sometime by two or three daies. In these therefore (which
 alwaies are eight) the merchants had leisure to packe vp and conueie
 their merchandize, to pay their creditors, and make merie with their
 friends.

 After the ides doo the calends follow, but in a decreasing order (as I
 noted) as the moone dooth in light when she is past the full. But
 herein lieth all the mysterie, if you can say so manie daies before
 the next change or new moone, as the number there expressed dooth
 betoken, as for 16 calends so manie daies before the next coniunction,
 &c: (as is aboue remembred.) Of these calends, I meane touching their
 number in euerie moneth, I find these verses insuing:

   Ianus & Augustus denas nouemq; December,
     Iunius Aprilis September & ipse Nouember
   Ter senas retinent, Februs his octo calendas,
     Iulius October Mars Maius epta decemq;

 _In English thus_:

   December Iune and August month
     full nineteene calends haue,
   Septemb Aprill Nouemb and Iune
     twise nine they doo desire,
   Sixteene foule Februarie hath,
     no more can he well craue,
   October Maie and Iulie hot
     but seuenteene doo require.

 _In like maner doo the nones and ides._

   Sex Maius nonas, October, Iulius, & Mars,
   Quatuor at reliqui, dabit idus quilibet octo.

   To Iulie, Mars, October, Maie,
     six nones I hight,
   The rest but foure, and as for ides
     they keepe still eight.

 Againe touching the number of daies in euerie moneth:

   Iunius, Aprilis, Septemq; Nouemq; tricenos,
     Vnum plus reliqui, Februs tenet octo vicenos,
   At si bissextus fuerit superadditur vnus.

   Thirtie daies hath Nouember,
     Aprill, Iune, and September,
   Twentie and eight hath Februarie alone,
     and all the rest thirtie and one,
     but in the leape you must ad one.

 Our yeare is counted after the course of the sunne, and although the
 church hath some vse of that of the moone for obseruation of certeine
 mooueable feasts, yet it is reducible to that of the sunne, which in
 our ciuill dealings is chieflie had in vse. Herein onelie I find a
 scruple, that the beginning thereof is not vniforme and certeine, for
 most of our records beare date the 25 of March, and our calenders the
 first of Ianuarie; so that with vs Christ is borne before he be
 conceiued. Our sundrie officers also haue sundrie entrances into their
 charges of custome, which breedeth great confusion, whereas if all
 these might be referred to one originall (and that to be the first of
 Ianuarie) I doo not thinke but that there would be more certeintie,
 and lesse trouble for our historiographers, notaries, & other officers
 in their account of the yere. In old time the Atheniens began their
 yeare with the change of the moone that fell neerest to the enterance
 of the sunne into the crab, the Latines at the winter solstice, or his
 going into the goat, the Iewes in ciuill case at the latter
 equinoctiall, and in ecclesiasticall with the first. They of Calecute
 begin their yeare somewhere in September, but vpon no daie certeine,
 sith they first consult with their wisards, who pronounce one day or
 other thereof to be most happie (as the yeare goeth about) and
 therewith they make their entrance, as Osorius dooth remember, who
 addeth that vpon the eleuenth calends of September, they haue solemne
 plaies, much like to the idoll games, & that they write in leaues of
 tree with a pencill, in stead of paper, which is not found among them.
 Some of the old Grecians began their yere also in September: but sith
 we seeke herein but for the custome of our countrie onelie, it shall
 be enough to affirme that we make our account from the calends or
 first of Ianuarie, and from the middest of the night which is _Limes_
 betweene that and the last of December, whereof this maie suffice. I
 might speake of the Cynike yeare also in this place (for the ease of
 our English readers) sometime in vse amongst the Egyptians, which
 conteineth 1460 common yeares, whose beginning is alwaies reckoned
 from the rising of the lesser dog. The first vse thereof entered the
 selfe yeare wherin the Olimpiads were restored. And forsomuch as this
 nation hath no vse of intercalation, at the end of euerie 1460 yeares,
 they added an whole yeare of intercalation, because there are 365
 leape yeers in the period, so that 1460 Iulian yeers doo conteine 1461
 after the Egyptians account, wherby their common yeare is found to be
 lesse than ours. Furthermore, wheras our intercalation for the leape
 yere is somewhat too much by certeine minuts, which in 115 yeares
 amount vnto about an whole day, if one intercalation in so manie were
 omitted, our calender would be the more perfect: and I would wish that
 the same yeare wherein the said intercalation trulie found out should
 be ouerpassed, might be obserued and called _Annus magnus Elizabethae_,
 in perpetuall remembrance of our noble and souereigne princesse now
 reigning amongst vs.

 I might here saie somewhat also of the prime and hir alteration, which
 is risen higher by fiue daies in our common calender than it was
 placed by Iulius Caesar: and in seauen thousand yeares some writer
 would grow to an error of an whole, if the world should last so long.
 But for somuch as in some calenders of ours it is reduced againe to
 the daie of euerie change, it shall suffice to saie no more therof.
 The pope also hath made a generall correction of the calender, wherein
 he hath reduced it to the same that it was or should haue beene at the
 councell of Nice. Howbeit as he hath abolished the vse of the golden
 number, so hath he continued the epact, applieng it vnto such generall
 vse, as dooth now serue both the turnes, whose reformation had also
 yer this time beene admitted into England, if it had not proceeded
 from him, against whom and all whose ordinances we haue so faithfullie
 sworne and set our hands.

 Certes the next omission is to be performed if all princes would agree
 thereto in the leape yeare that shall be about the yeare of Grace
 1668: if it shall please God that the world may last so long, and then
 may our calender also stand without anie alteration as it dooth
 alreadie. By this also it appeareth how the defect of our calender may
 be supplied from the creation, wherein the first equinoctiall is seene
 higher toward the beginning of March than Caesars calender now extant
 dooth yeeld vnto by seauen daies. For as in Caesars time the true
 equinoctiall was pointed out to happen (as Stadius also noteth) either
 vpon or about the sixteenth or seauenteenth of March, albeit the
 manifest apperance thereof was not found vntill the fiue and twentith
 of that moneth in their dials or by eie-sight: so at the beginning of
 the world the said entrance of the sunne into the ram, must needs fall
 out to be about the twentith or one & twentith of Aprill, as the
 calender now standeth, if I faile not in my numbers. Aboue the yeare
 we haue no more parts of time, that carie anie seuerall names with
 them, except you will affirme the word age to be one, which is taken
 for a hundred yeares, and signifieth in English so much as Seculum or
 AEuum dooth in Latine; neither is it needfull to remember that some of
 my countrimen doo reckon their times not by years but by summers and
 winters, which is verie common among vs. Wherefore to shut vp this
 chapiter withall, you shall haue a table of the names of the daies of
 the weeke, after the old Saxon and Scotish maner, which I haue borowed
 from amongst our ancient writers, as I haue perused their volumes.

 OF OUR PRINCIPALL FAIRES AND MARKETS.

 CHAP. XV.


 I haue heretofore said sufficientlie of our faires, in the chapter of
 fairs and markets; and now to performe my promise there made, I set
 downe here so manie of our faires as I haue found out by mine owne
 obseruation, and helpe of others in this behalfe. Certes it is
 impossible for me to come by all, sith there is almost no towne in
 England, but hath one or more such marts holden yearelie in the same,
 although some of them (I must needs confesse) be scarse comparable to
 Lowse faire, and little else bought or sold in them more than good
 drinke, pies, and some pedlerie trash: wherefore it were no losse if
 diuerse of them were abolished. Neither doo I see wherevnto this
 number of paltrie fairs tendeth, so much as to the corruption of
 youth, who (all other businesse set apart) must needs repaire vnto
 them, whereby they often spend not onelie the weeke daies, but also
 the Lords sabbaoth in great vanitie and riot. But such hath beene the
 iniquitie of ancient times. God grant therefore that ignorance being
 now abolished, and a further insight into things growne into the minds
 of magistrates, these old errors may be considered of, and so farre
 reformed, as that thereby neither God may be dishonored, nor the
 common wealth of our countrie anie thing diminished. In the meane
 time, take this table here insuing in stead of a calender of the
 greatest, sith that I cannot, or at the least wise care not to come by
 the names of the lesse, whose knowledge cannot be so profitable to
 them that be farre off, as they are oft preiudiciall to such as dwell
 neere hand to the places where they be holden and kept, by pilferers
 that resort vnto the same.

 OF OUR INNES AND THOROWFAIRES.

 CHAP. XVI.


 Those townes that we call thorowfaires haue great and sumptuous innes
 builded in them, for the receiuing of such trauellers and strangers as
 passe to and fro. The manner of harbouring wherein, is not like to
 that of some other countries, in which the host or goodman of the
 house dooth chalenge a lordlie authoritie ouer his ghests, but cleane
 otherwise, sith euerie man may vse his inne as his owne house in
 England, and haue for his monie how great or little varietie of
 vittels, and what other seruice himselfe shall thinke expedient to
 call for. Our innes are also verie well furnished with naperie,
 bedding, and tapisserie, especiallie with naperie: for beside the
 linnen vsed at the tables, which is commonlie washed dailie, is such
 and so much as belongeth vnto the estate and calling of the ghest. Ech
 commer is sure to lie in cleane sheets, wherein no man hath beene
 lodged since they came from the landresse, or out of the water wherein
 they were last washed. If the traueller haue an horsse, his bed dooth
 cost him nothing, but if he go on foot he is sure to paie a penie for
 the same: but whether he be horsseman or footman if his chamber be
 once appointed he may carie the kaie with him, as of his owne house so
 long as he lodgeth there. If he loose oughts whilest he abideth in the
 inne, the host is bound by a generall custome to restore the damage,
 so that there is no greater securitie anie where for trauellers than
 in the gretest ins of England. Their horsses in like sort are walked,
 dressed and looked vnto by certeine hostelers or hired seruants,
 appointed at the charges of the goodman of the house, who in hope of
 extraordinarie reward will deale verie diligentlie after outward
 appeerance in this their function and calling. Herein neuerthelesse
 are manie of them blameworthie, in that they doo not onelie deceiue
 the beast oftentimes of his allowance by sundrie meanes, except their
 owners looke well to them; but also make such packs with slipper
 merchants which hunt after preie (for what place is sure from euill &
 wicked persons) that manie an honest man is spoiled of his goods as he
 trauelleth to and fro, in which feat also the counsell of the tapsters
 or drawers of drinke, and chamberleins is not seldome behind or
 wanting. Certes I beleeue not that chapman or traueller in England is
 robbed by the waie without the knowledge of some of them, for when he
 commeth into the inne, & alighteth from his horsse, the hostler
 forthwith is verie busie to take downe his budget or capcase in the
 yard from his sadle bow, which he peiseth slilie in his hand to feele
 the weight thereof: or if he misse of this pitch, when the ghest hath
 taken vp his chamber, the chamberleine that looketh to the making of
 the beds, will be sure to remooue it from the place where the owner
 hath set it as if it were to set it more conuenientlie some where
 else, whereby he getteth an inkling whether it be monie or other short
 wares, & therof giueth warning to such od ghests as hant the house and
 are of his confederacie, to the vtter vndoing of manie an honest
 yeoman as he iournieth by the waie. The tapster in like sort for his
 part dooth marke his behauiour, and what plentie of monie he draweth
 when he paieth the shot, to the like end: so that it shall be an hard
 matter to escape all their subtile practises. Some thinke it a gay
 matter to commit their budgets at their comming to the goodman of the
 house: but thereby they oft bewraie themselues. For albeit their monie
 be safe for the time that it is in his hands (for you shall not heare
 that a man is robbed in his inne) yet after their departure the host
 can make no warrantise of the same, sith his protection extendeth no
 further than the gate of his owne house: and there cannot be a surer
 token vnto such as prie and watch for those booties, than to see anie
 ghest deliuer his capcase in such maner. In all our innes we haue
 plentie of ale, beere, and sundrie kinds of wine, and such is the
 capacitie of some of them that they are able to lodge two hundred or
 three hundred persons, and their horsses at ease, & therto with a
 verie short warning make such prouision for their diet, as to him that
 is vnacquainted withall may seeme to be incredible. Howbeit of all in
 England there are no worse ins than in London, and yet manie are there
 far better than the best that I haue heard of in anie forren countrie,
 if all circumstances be dulie considered. But to leaue this & go in
 hand with my purpose. I will here set downe a table of the best
 thorowfaires and townes of greatest trauell of England, in some of
 which there are twelue or sixteene such innes at the least, as I
 before did speake of. And it is a world to see how ech owner of them
 contendeth with other for goodnesse of interteinement of their ghests,
 as about finesse & change of linnen, furniture of bedding, beautie of
 roomes, seruice at the table, costlinesse of plate, strength of
 drinke, varietie of wines, or well vsing of horsses. Finallie there is
 not so much omitted among them as the gorgeousnes of their verie
 signes at their doores, wherein some doo consume thirtie or fortie
 pounds, a meere vanitie in mine opinion, but so vaine will they needs
 be, and that not onelie to giue some outward token of the inne keepers
 welth, but also to procure good ghests to the frequenting of their
 houses in hope there to be well vsed. Lo here the table now at hand,
 for more of our innes I shall not need to speake.

 the rehearsall of the miles.

Transcriber's Note


_ _ denotes italic text;

= = denotes Old English script, which is also bold.

[=a] (etc.) denotes a macron (straight line over a vowel), which
sometimes indicates that 'n' has been omitted from the word.
(Abbreviation in Mediaeval manuscripts).

Elizabethan words and spellings have been retained (e.g. 'height' and
'heigth' are both used, sometimes in the same sentence; 'hight' =
'known as, called, etc.').

Only obvious printer's errors have been corrected, as when a letter
seems to have been inverted ('n' for 'u'). The letters 'u' and 'v' are
mostly interchanged; as, e.g., "in haruest time" and "vnder a bridge".
If a word or name did not fit the context, it was researched, and
corrections made, if necessary.

There are a few printer's errors in this edition, which have been
checked using the online 1587 edition (which itself is not without
printing errors) as reference.
(http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/sceti/PrintedBooksnew/
index.cfm?TextID=holinshed_chronicle).
Also used were the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), and online Middle
English and Anglo-Saxon Dictionaries, as well as online Wikipedia.

Some, but by no means all, of 'ee' has the first 'e' marked with an
acute accent. This is not consistent. Where the 'e' is obviously
missing from the scan, it has not been added to the text. This
inconsistency in spelling and accents is an integral part of some very
old books.

There are some instances of round brackets which have been opened and
not closed, or nested, with only one pair closed (or closed, without
having been opened). These have been retained as such.

Some placenames may have changed with the passage of time.

Some damaged or missing punctuation has been restored, but the
punctuation in the lists at the end of Description III is as it
appeared in the scans, and in the online edition.

Page numbers have been added to the 'Description' Tables of Contents,
for the convenience of the reader; and Tables of Contents have been
added to the beginning of this Volume, and to each Book of the
Histories.

There are a few instances of repeated word 'too'. These have been
retained, being probably the author's personal style:

'is too too plaine' 'being too too much' 'haue too too manie'. 'too
too lewd'

Page 43: "practise and put in vre within your realme and kingdome."

'vre', or 'ure', is an antique word, which survives in the modern word
'inure'.

(Ure) n. [OE. ure, OF. oevre, ovre, ouvre, work, F. [oe]uvre, L.
opera. cf. Inure .] Use; practice; exercise. [Obs.] (Ure), v. t. To
use; to exercise; to inure; to accustom by practice. [Obs.] (Webster's
online dictionary, 1913 edition).

Page 67: 'barnacle'; 'barnacls'; 'barnacles' ... there were no spelling
conventions in Holinshed's time. 'barnacls' matches 1587 ed.

Page 252: 'hanting' could mean 'haunting', or 'frequenting'.

"... they ruffle and roist it out, exceeding in apparell, and hanting
riotous companie (which draweth them from their bookes vnto an other
trade.)"

Page 255: 'Philip' is an abbreviation for Queen Philippa (of
Hainault).

Page 347:
[Sidenote: Gipping, of going vp to anie place.]
Chipping Walden, of the Saxon word gipping (or ghipping) uses the
insular 'g', variant of (lowercase) yogh.

(http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_G)

Page 358: 'cuphar'.

"Of all the elms that euer I saw, those in the south side of Douer
court, in Essex neere Harwich are the most notable, for they grow (I
meane) in crooked maner, that they are almost apt for nothing else but
nauie timber, great ordinance, and beetels: and such thereto is their
naturall qualitie, that being vsed in the said behalfe, they continue
longer, and more long than anie the like trees in whatsoeuer parcell
else of this land, without cuphar, shaking, or cleauing, as I find."

Possibly from 'ceorfan' to cut, cut down. (coppice?)

Page 386: 'Bratius' is probably 'Gratius'.

"Bratius De venatione, 1/386 - probably Faliscus Gratius, De
venatione, 1534."

D'Abridgecourt, Dabridgcourt, Dabrichecourt or Aubreciourt and derived

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
