THE ANGEL OF LONESOME HILL
A STORY OF A PRESIDENT

by Frederick Landis
Author of "The Glory of His Country"

1910

[Illustration: Those who passed by night were grateful for the lamp]


It was a handful of people in the country--a simple-hearted handful.
There was no railroad--only a stage which creaked through
the gullies and was late. Once it had a hot-box, and the place drifted
through space, a vagrant atom.

Time swung on a lazy hinge. Children came; young folks married;
old ones died; Indian Creek overflowed the bottom-land; crops failed;
one by one the stage bore boys and girls away to seek their fortunes in
the far-off world; at long intervals some tragedy streaked the yellow
clay monotony with red; January blew petals from her silver garden;
April poured her vase of life; August crawled her snail length; years
passed, leaving rusty streaks back to a dull horizon.

The sky seemed higher than anywhere else; clouds hurried over this
place called "Cold Friday."

A mile to the east was "Lonesome Hill." Indians once built signal
fires upon it, and in this later time travellers alighted as their horses
struggled up the steep approach. At the top was a cabin; it was
whitewashed, and so were the apple-trees round it. A gourd vine clung
to its chimney; pigeons fluttered upon its shingles, and June flung a
crimson rose mantle over its side and half-way up the roof.

One wished to stop and rest beneath its weeping willow by the
white stone milk house.

Those who passed by day were accustomed to a woman's face at the
window--a calm face which looked on life as evening looks on day--such
a face as one might use to decorate a fancy of the old frontier. Those
who passed by night were grateful for the lamp which protested against
Nature's apparent consecration of the place to solitude.

This home held aloof from "Cold Friday"; many times Curiosity went
in, but Conjecture alone came out, for through the years the man and
woman of this cabin merely said, "We came from back yonder." Nobody
knew where "yonder" was.

But the law of compensation was in force--even in "Cold Friday."
With acquaintanceships as with books, the ecstasy of cutting leaves
is not always sustained in the reading, and the silence of this man and
woman was the life of village wonder.

It gave "Friday's" chimney talk a spice it otherwise had never known;
the back log seldom crumbled into ashes till the bones of these cabin
dwellers lay bleaching on the plains of "Perhaps."

John Dale was seventy-five years or more, but worked his niggard hillside
all the day, and seldom came to town. His aged wife was kind; the
flowers of her life she gave away, but none could glance upon the garden.
She seemed to know when neighbors were ill; hers was the dignity of being
indispensable. Many the mother of that region who, standing beneath
some cloud, thanked God as this slender, white-haired soul with star
shine in her face, hurried over the fields with an old volume pasted full
of quaint remedies.

She made a call of another kind--just once--when the "Hitchenses"
brought the first organ to "Cold Friday."

She remained only long enough to go straight to the cabinet, which the
assembled neighbors regarded with distant awe, and play several pieces
"without the book." On her leaving with the same quiet indifference, Mrs.
Ephraim Fivecoats peered owlishly toward Mrs. Rome Lukens and rendered
the following upon her favorite instrument:

"Well! if that woman ever gits the fever an' gits deliriums, I want
to be round, handy like. I'll swan there'll be more interestin' things
told than we've heerd in our born days--that woman is allus thinkin'!"

In this final respect, the judgment of the Lady of the House of Fivecoats
was sound.

How gallant the mind is! If the past be sad, it mingles with Diversion's
multitude till Sadness is lost; if the present be unhappy, it has a
magic thrift of joys, and Unhappiness is hushed by Memory's laughter;
if both past and present have a grief, it seeks amid its scanty store for
some event, for instance, whose recurrence brings some brightness; to
greet this it sends affectionate anticipations--and were its quiver empty,
it would battle still some way!

So the wife of Dale looked forward to Doctor Johnston's visits, yet
there were so many doors between her silence and the world, she did
not turn as he entered one eventful day.

Doctors are Nature's confessors, and down the memory of this one
wandered a camel of sympathy upon which the sick had heaped their secret
woes for years, though one added naught to the burden.

It was the tale he wished to hear, and when some fugitive phrase promised
revelation, he folded the powders slowly; but when it ended in a sigh,
he strapped up bottles and expectations and went away, reflecting how
poor the world where one might hear all things save those which interested.

But Time is a patient locksmith to whom all doors swing open.

"I always sit by this window," she began as he removed the fever
thermometer; "I've looked so long, I see nothing in a way--and at night
I always put the light here. If he should come in the dark I want him
to see--here is a letter."

The Doctor read and returned it with a look of infinite pity.

"I had a dream last night; I may be superstitious or it may be the
fever--but it was so real. I saw it all; it was just like my prayer. I
believe in God, you know." She smiled in half reproach. "Yes, in spite
of all.

"In that dream something touched my hand and a voice whispered the
word, 'Now.' Oh, how anxious it was! I awoke, sitting up; the lamp
had gone out, yet it was not empty--and there was no wind."

John Dale stumbled into the room, his arms full of wood, and an old dog,
lying before the fireplace, thumped his tail against the floor with
diminishing vigor.

She arose. "I'll get you a bite to eat, Doctor."

"Never mind! I must be going." He made a sign to Dale, who followed
to the gate.

"John, I've been calling here a long time--"

"I know I ought to pay somethin'," Dale started to say.

"It isn't that--I've just diagnosed the case; only one man can cure it."

"Would he--on credit?" Dale anxiously inquired.

"He never charges." Johnston smiled sorrowfully at the old man's
despair.

"Who is he?"

"The President; the President of the United States," he added as
Dale's eyes filled with questions. "I came out of college a sceptic,
John, and I'd be an infidel outright but for that wife of yours--she's
nearer the sky, somehow, than any other mortal I've seen. I don't
believe in anything, of course--but that dream--if I were you I'd trust
it--I'd follow where it led."

With his foot on the hub, the farmer slowly whetted his knife on
his boot. "I'll go with you, Doctor."

       *       *       *       *       *

"I called at the office, but it was locked, and so I'm here," apologized
Dale as Judge Long opened the door of his old-fashioned stone house in
Point Elizabeth, the county seat.

"Glad to see you--had your supper?"

Hearing voices in the dining-room, he answered in the affirmative.

"Then have a cigar and wait in the library; the folks are having a
little company."

The old man surveyed the room; the books alone were worth more than
his earthly possessions. From a desk loomed a bust of Webster. Shadows
seemed to leap from it; the sombre lips bespoke the futility of striving
against stern realities.

There was gayety in the dining-room; Judge Long was a fountain of
mirth, a favorite at taverns, while riding the circuit--before
juries--wherever people gathered.

A gale of laughter greeted his last anecdote and the diners protested as
he arose.

Dale told his story excitedly, and at the conclusion Judge Long slowly
brushed away the tobacco smoke.

"I'm sorry, John, but we did all we could last month--and we failed;
there's just one thing to do--face the matter. It's hard, but this world is
chiefly water, and what isn't water is largely rock--it's for fish and
fossils, I suppose."

"But we will win now!" The old man's hand fell with decision.

"Why do you say that?"

"Mother had another dream last night."

"But, you know, she had one a month ago," quietly protested Long.

"Yes--and it came true--we didn't do our part just right. We can't
fail this time; there must be a day of justice!"

"Well, as to that, John, this game of life is strange; we bring nothing
with us, so how can we lose? We take nothing away, so how can we
win? We think; we plan; we stack these plans with precision, but Chance
always sits at our right, waiting to cut the cards. You speak of 'justice.'
It's a myth. The statue above the court-house stands first on one foot,
then on the other, tired of waiting, tired of the sharp rocks of
technicality, tired of the pompous farce. Why, Dale," he waved a hand
toward an opposite corner, "if old Daniel Webster were here he couldn't
do anything!"

When an American lawyer cites that mighty shade it is conclusive, but
the effect was lost on Dale. He was not a lawyer, neither had he read the
"Dartmouth College Case" nor the "Reply to Hayne." In fact his relations
with the "Sage of Marshfield" were so formal he believed his fame
to rest chiefly on having left behind a multitude of busts. Besides, he was
impatient; the Judge's peroration having lifted his head so suddenly
that cigar ashes fell upon the deep rug at his feet.

"You won't go again, Judge?" He leaned forward perplexed.

"It's no use."

"Well, mebbe you can't do anything--mebbe Dan'l Webster couldn't--but
John Dale can!"

Long arose, astonished. "How foolish! Reason for a moment--any
presentation of this matter calls for the highest ability; it involves
sifting of evidence; symmetry of arrangement; cohesiveness of method, logic
of argument, persuasiveness of advocacy, subtleties of acumen, charms
of eloquence--all the elements of the greatest profession among men!"

Dale leaned heavily against the table, his eyes following the Judge as he
walked back and forth.

"Well, I've got 'em--I can't call 'em by name, but I've got the whole
damned list--and I'm goin'!"

Long stood at bay, his hand on the door, his face glowing with animation.

"Dale, you're old enough to be my father, but you shall listen. You'd
fail before a justice of the peace, and before the President of the United
States--it's absurd. You'd go down there, get mad, probably be arrested
and kill any hope we might have; why, you're guilty of contempt of
court right now. I had a strong influence, yet I failed."

The old farmer of "Lonesome Hill" would listen no more.

"Then wait, John. This letter may at least save you from jail--and you
haven't any money; will this do?"

"It's more than I need, Judge."

"No, keep it all--and keep your temper too."

As the Judge stood in the doorway, watching the venerable figure disappear
in the drizzling night, a young woman from the dining-room stole
to his side and heard him muse: "After all, who knows? A Briton
clad in skins once humbled a Roman emperor."

"Is he in trouble?" she asked.

"Yes, great trouble, and it isn't his fault. Fate's a poor shot. She never
strikes one who is guilty without wounding two who are innocent."

       *       *       *       *       *

Dale was an admirable volunteer and strangely resourceful; he had
something more than courage.

The train did not leave for two hours. He sat in the station till the
clatter of the telegraph drove him out, when he walked toward the
yards with their colored lights, and through his brain raced Speculation's
myriad fiends, all brandishing lanterns like those before him. When,
at last, the train did start, it seemed to roll slowly, though it could
suffer delay and reach the Capital by daybreak.

He read the letter of introduction several times, and wondered what
kind of man the President was; he thought of what he would say--and
how it would end.

At intervals a ghost would extend a long, bony hand and wring drops
of blood from his heart; at such times the President was hostile--the trip
very foolish--he regretted his anger at Judge Long's house; and once,
had the engine been a horse, he might have turned back. At other times
gleams of victory came from somewhere and yet from nowhere, and
routed the gypsies from his brain, and the President stood before him,
a sympathetic gentleman. Once he knew it, and through excess of spirits
walked up and down the aisle, studying the sleeping passengers; for John
Dale travelled in a common "day coach."

At last he yielded to fatigue, and far off on the horizon of consciousness
dimly flashed the duel of his hopes and fears. Rest was impossible, and
after a long time the dawn drifted between his half-closed lids; a glorious
dome floated out of the sky and the porter shouted, "All out for
Washington!"

The cabmen who besieged the well-dressed passengers paid scant homage
to the old man, who walked uncertainly out of the smoky shed and stood
for a moment in Pennsylvania Avenue--on one hand the Capitol, on
the other the Treasury and White House. A great clock above him
struck the hour of six; he hesitated, then went toward the scene of
conflict.

The waking traffic, the great buildings, the pulse of this strange life
filled him with depression. He came to a beautiful park and gazed upon
Lafayette and Rochambeau, then the equestrian statue of Jackson. As he
sat facing the snow-white building with columned portico, the magnolia
blossoms were as incense. Then he could wait no longer and crossed to
the President's office. A policeman stopped him at the steps. He explained
that he had a letter from Judge Long. What! Did this policeman
not know Judge Long?

He sat under a tree, and the policeman walked a few paces away to turn
anon and survey the waiting pilgrim. When the doors opened he entered.
The President would not come for another hour; he would be busy--possibly
he might see him by noon--provided he had credentials.

With a sigh he sank into a chair and was soon asleep.

"Come--this is no cheap lodging house!" The greeting was shaken
into him by a clerk with hair parted in the middle, who disdainfully
surveyed the sleeper's attire.

He who has much on his mind little cares what he has on his back, and
when the youth exploded, "Who are you?" the old fellow's self-reliance
came forth.

Leading the way to the door Dale pointed a trembling finger. "See
that buildin', 'Bub'--and that one yonder, and that patch over there
with Andy Jackson in it? Well, I'm one of the folks that made it all--and
paid for it; and you're one of my hired hands. I've got to keep
so many of you down here I can't afford one on the farm. I want to
see the President--give him this letter--it's from Judge Sylvester Long,
of Point Elizabeth!"

The youth vanished and Dale resumed his chair.

He was looking across the lawn when a sudden alertness came into
the scene; the silk-hatted line of callers stepped aside; those who were
seated arose; newspaper correspondents turned with vigilant ears. A
nervous voice inquired, "Where is Mr. John Dale?"

The President stood before him, dressed in white flannel, then smilingly
grasped his hand with a blast of welcome: "I'm delighted to meet
the friend of Judge Long!" Taking his arm the Executive escorted him
through the Cabinet Room thronged with Senators, Representatives, and
tourists. They entered the private office. "Take the sofa, Mr. Dale--it's
the easiest thing in the place. I hope your business is such that you
can excuse me for a little while."

A smile came over Dale's white face. Could the poorest farmer of
the "Cold Friday" region wait for the most powerful character in the
world? Nor was the old man in the linen duster the only one who smiled.
A member of the Russian Embassy turned to his companion--a distinguished
visitor from the Court of St. Petersburg: "What would a peasant
say to the Czar?"

The President now entered the Cabinet Room, shaking hands with
the many, guiding a few into his private office. Dale listened; now it was
an introduction and a message to an old friend in the West. Then a decisive
"No" dashed some hope of patronage; again, it was a discussion
of poetry, aerial navigation, or the relics of the Aztecs. It was a long
stride from "Lonesome Hill," and for the time Dale was novelty's captive.
He glanced round the room. It was not as fine as the director's
office of the Point Elizabeth Bank! Above the mantel--the place of
honor--was the painting of a martyr. He wondered whether another stroke
of the brush would have brought a smile to the face, or an expression of
sadness. The hands were very large--they  had once broken iron bands.

In one corner was a shot-gun; tennis rackets in another; on a chair
were snow-shoes and on the desk a sheaf of roses.

Those whom the President had sifted into his office from the crowd
outside engaged in conversation. A Senator discussed the ball game with
a Supreme Court Justice; a General advised an Author to try deep breathing.

The President returned more animated than before. He placed a
hand on Dale's shoulder: "Be comfortable--and stay for lunch; nobody
but us."

The crowd paid sudden respect to the homespun citizen of an older day,
and a great happiness came into his heart--it was like the unfolding of one
of the roses. Not that he was to lunch with the President, though Dale's
was the village estimate of human greatness. A vaster issue was before
him, and this was a token of success--a success which would bind up his
remaining years with peace, and give glorious recompense to the companion
of his few joys and many griefs.

The President hurriedly signed his name to parchments.

"I'm making a few postmasters." He smiled toward the sofa. "It's no
trouble here--that's all at the other end of the line."

Without stopping the pen, he discussed matters with one statesman
after another, his lips snapping with metallic positiveness.

A member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations protested
against the course pursued in Santo Domingo.

"If I were making a world, Senator, I'd try to get along without putting
in any Santo Domingos, but as things stand, we must make her be
decent or let somebody else do it."

Another brings up the question of taxing incomes and inheritances.

"I favor them both," declared the President. "They are taxes on good
luck; bad luck is its own tax."

A statesman from the Pacific slope protests against Federal interference
in the school question.

"It is a local matter as you say, Senator, and yours is a 'Sovereign
State'--they all are till they get into trouble. If we should have war with
Japan, your State would speedily become an integral part of the Union."

A group of gentlemen now object to an aspirant for a Federal judgeship
on the ground that he has not a "judicial temperament."

"As I understand it," the President begins, "judicial temperament is
largely a fragrance rising from the recollection of corporate employment;
it is the ability to throw a comma under the wheels of progress and upset
public welfare; I am glad to learn that Mr. L---- has _not_ a 'judicial
temperament'; I shall send his name to the Senate to-day."

The gentlemen retired. "Come, Mr. Dale, let us go."

This President had been accused of a lack of dignity. Is it a less valuable
trait which puts the John Dales of our land at instant ease in the
"State Dining-Room" of the White House?

"Well, sir, no man ever had a better friend than Judge Long," said
the President when they were seated. "'Ves' Long, I mean," he added
with a smile.

"I met him in the West; he had a ranch; mine was near it. We saw
much of each other; we hunted together--and that's where you learn
a man's mettle. He never complained of dogs, luck, or weather.
We saw rough times; it was glorious. We'd wake up with snow on the bed,
and when 'Ves' introduced me at Point Elizabeth in my first campaign
he said we often found rabbit tracks on the quilts--but then 'Ves' had a
remarkable eye.

"Some say, 'blood is thicker than water.' That depends somewhat on
the quality of the water; I like him; there's nothing I wouldn't do
for him!"

Dale grew suddenly sick at heart. If Long had only come! Recalling
his discouraging words, a shadow crept over the old man's mind.
Could it be possible he had not tried the month before?

Such misgivings soon vanished. "This is a trying office, Mr. Dale.
With all my feelings I had to hold in abeyance the only favor he ever
asked; it was about a pardon in a murder case over thirty-five years
ago. He said it was the most cruel case of circumstantial evidence in
the books--possibly you may know about the case."

The old man struggled back in his chair, then arose, his rough hand
brushing thin locks back from a temple where the veins seemed swelling
to the danger point. He was unable to summon more than a whisper
from his shrunken throat.

"Yes, Mr. President, I do--he's my boy!"

"Your--boy! Yes--that's the name--how stupid of me--I beg
your pardon, Mr. Dale--a thousand times."

They stared a long while at each other and Dale felt the fears which
had fled before his gracious reception returning to grip him by the heart;
the speech he had prepared had fled; it had all happened so differently.

At last the President spoke: "Congress is just going out; it's the busy
season, but I'll go through the papers to-night myself."

Dale walked to the window; perspiration was on his face, but he was
very cold. He stood with locked brain, and into his eyes came filmy
clouds; then through these he saw, with sudden strangeness, a cabin far
away, and a woman with pallid cheeks looked straight at him.

The President gazed intently as the old man wiped the window pane,
nodded his head, and turned to face the table.

He cleared his throat, then opened a flannel collar, already loose, and
his eyes glistened.

"You're sick!" exclaimed the President rising. "Waiter--some
brandy!"

"No--just a little dizzy.

"Mr. President," he slowly began, "this is a case that all the papers in
the world can't tell--nor all the men--there's none just like it.

"It's not for the boy--it's not for me. I took her from her folks against
their will, and I've not panned out lucky--but that's not to the point.
She's sick; the doctor can't help her--nobody can but you--I wish you
might have seen her from the window yonder."

The half-finished luncheon was disregarded; the President had sunk
into his chair, and the keen discrimination of a king of affairs was
struggling with a strange fascination.

"Long ago, Mr. President, I had an enemy--Bill Hartsell--we shot
each other." He held up a withered hand. "It's been a feud ever since.
His boy and mine went to war in the same company--both as brave as ever
wore the blue. When they were waitin' to be mustered out Bill's boy was
murdered in his tent--in his sleep. Bill was there and swore he saw my
Richard do it.

"One night, a month ago, my woman--she's a great woman, Mr.
President--the sick folks down in my country call her 'The Angel of
Lonesome Hill'--well, she had a dream that Bill Hartsell wanted to see
me. I hadn't laid eyes on him for years. I strapped on my six-shooter
and she said, 'No--it isn't that kind of a trip--it's peace.'

"I put down the shootin' iron and went--it was a long way--two
days on horseback. I got to Bill's cabin at night; I went in without
a knock; I wasn't afraid. Bill's folks were round the bed. He
arose and cried out: 'John, I sent for you; it was a damn lie I told--your
boy didn't do it'--and then Bill died."

For the moment the old man's agitation mastered him.

"I remember, Mr. Dale. 'Ves' told me; he brought the statements
of the family--and yours. I've been thinking of it ever since--and a great
deal these last two days. Tell me, why did you happen to come?"

"Mother had a dream that said the time was up."

Dale spoke as calmly as though delivering a message from a neighbor.

Fear was not even a memory now. He stood erect; the stone he had
slowly pushed up many steep years was near the summit--one mighty
effort might hurl it down the past forever.

"Just a word about that boy, Mr. President. At Cold Harbor his regiment
stood in hell all day; he was one of those who pinned his name to his
coat so his body could be identified--after the charge. Well, in that
charge the flag went down, and a man went out to get it--and he fell; then
another--and he fell; and then a thin, pale fellow that the doctors almost
refused sprang forward like a panther--and he fell. They were askin' for a
volunteer when a staff officer called out: 'Good God! He's alive! He's got
it! He's crawlin' back!'

"They had to lift him off the colors; he didn't know anything, . . . and
that was my boy, Mr. President--that was Dick!

"Funny how he enlisted," Dale resumed after a moment. "He'd been
tryin' to get in, but I kept him out. One night his mother sent him for a
dime's worth of clothes-line--and he never came back. He's not bad, Mr.
President; he's good--he gets it from his mother."

Dale lifted his head with pride: "When I was on the jury I heard
Judge Long say no one could be punished if their name wasn't written in
the indictment. Now, they didn't only convict Dick--they convicted
his mother--this whole world's her prison--and it's illegal, Mr.
President--her name wasn't written in that indictment--and it's her pardon
I want."

The President arose and walked the floor. "How could the man who
saved those colors shoot a comrade in his sleep? Mr. Dale, my faith in
human nature tells me that's a lie!"

He stood for an instant at the window, looking over the fountain, the
river, the tall white Washington needle which pierced the sky, then
quickly stepped to the table and lifted a glass:

"Mr. Dale, I propose a toast--'The Angel of Lonesome Hill' . . . her
liberty!"

       *       *       *       *      *

As they returned to the office there was nothing extraordinary in the
President's vigorous step--that was known the world around. There
was something most unusual, however, in the radiant soul--the splendid
ancient youth of the quaint figure by his side.

At the door where the policeman had watched the waiting pilgrim the
President shook the old man's hand.

"Come again, Mr. Dale, and tell 'Ves' Long I'll go hunting with him
this fall and bring along a man he'll like--a man who catches wolves with
his hands."

       *       *       *      *       *

John Dale knew every fence corner in that region, but the night was so
dark he stopped at times to "feel where he was."

The man with him could not aid him; he was a stranger--a strange
stranger who spoke but once--"How far is it?"

Long habit had made him silent; he was in the upper fifties, but long
absence from the sun had pinched his face into the white mask of great
age.

At the village store the stranger entered, returning with a package.

When the road turned there was a light high ahead and a moment later
the two men entered the cabin.

The stranger paused. "Mother, you sent me for a clothes-line--I've
been delayed--but here it is."

Her hand trembled as she raised the lamp from the table.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
