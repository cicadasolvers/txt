Book 10 2 Samuel
001:001 It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned
        from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode
        two days in Ziklag;
001:002 it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of
        the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head:
        and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth,
        and did obeisance.
001:003 David said to him, From whence come you?  He said to him,
        Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
001:004 David said to him, How went the matter?  Please tell me.
        He answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many
        of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan
        his son are dead also.
001:005 David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul
        and Jonathan his son are dead?
001:006 The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on
        Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold,
        the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
001:007 When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me.
        I answered, Here am I.
001:008 He said to me, Who are you?  I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
001:009 He said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me;
        for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet
        whole in me.
001:010 So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was
        sure that he could not live after that he was fallen:
        and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet
        that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.
001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them;
        and likewise all the men who were with him:
001:012 and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
        and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh,
        and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen
        by the sword.
001:013 David said to the young man who told him, Whence are you?
        He answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.
001:014 David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your
        hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?
001:015 David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
        and fall on him.  He struck him, so that he died.
001:016 David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has
        testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.
001:017 David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
        Jonathan his son
001:018 (and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of]
        the bow:  behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
001:019 Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!
        How the mighty have fallen!
001:020 Don't tell it in Gath.  Don't publish it in the streets
        of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
        lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
001:021 You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you,
        neither fields of offerings; For there the shield of
        the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul was not
        anointed with oil.
001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
        Jonathan's bow didn't turn back.  Saul's sword didn't return empty.
001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
        In their death, they were not divided.  They were swifter
        than eagles.  They were stronger than lions.
001:024 You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
        scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
        Jonathan is slain on your high places.
001:026 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.  You have
        been very pleasant to me.  Your love to me was wonderful,
        passing the love of women.
001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
002:001 It happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying,
        Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?  Yahweh said
        to him, Go up.  David said, Where shall I go up?
        He said, To Hebron.
002:002 So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam
        the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
002:003 His men who were with him did David bring up, every man
        with his household:  and they lived in the cities of Hebron.
002:004 The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
        over the house of Judah.  They told David, saying, The men
        of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.
002:005 David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said
        to them, Blessed be you of Yahweh, that you have shown this
        kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
002:006 Now Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you:
        and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have
        done this thing.
002:007 Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be you valiant;
        for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah
        have anointed me king over them.
002:008 Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken
        Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
002:009 and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites,
        and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin,
        and over all Israel.
002:010 Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began
        to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years.
        But the house of Judah followed David.
002:011 The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah
        was seven years and six months.
002:012 Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
        of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
002:013 Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
        and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down,
        the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other
        side of the pool.
002:014 Abner said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play
        before us.  Joab said, Let them arise.
002:015 Then they arose and went over by number:  twelve for Benjamin,
        and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the
        servants of David.
002:016 They caught everyone his fellow by the head, and [thrust]
        his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
        therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim,
        which is in Gibeon.
002:017 The battle was very severe that day:  and Abner was beaten,
        and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
002:018 The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel:
        and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.
002:019 Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn
        to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel?
        He answered, It is I.
002:021 Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left,
        and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor.
        But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
002:022 Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me:
        why should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold
        up my face to Joab your brother?
002:023 However he refused to turn aside:  therefore Abner with the hinder
        end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came
        out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place:
        and it happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel
        fell down and died stood still.
002:024 But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner:  and the sun went
        down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies
        before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
002:025 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner,
        and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever?
        Don't you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
        How long shall it be then, before you bid the people return
        from following their brothers?"
002:027 Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then
        in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed
        everyone his brother.
002:028 So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still,
        and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
002:029 Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah;
        and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron,
        and came to Mahanaim.
002:030 Joab returned from following Abner:  and when he had gathered
        all the people together, there lacked of David's servants
        nineteen men and Asahel.
002:031 But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men,
        [so that] three hundred sixty men died.
002:032 They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father,
        which was in Bethlehem.  Joab and his men went all night,
        and the day broke on them at Hebron.
003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
        of David:  and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house
        of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
003:002 To David were sons born in Hebron:  and his firstborn was Amnon,
        of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
003:003 and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
        and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai
        king of Geshur;
003:004 and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
        Shephatiah the son of Abital;
003:005 and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife.
        These were born to David in Hebron.
003:006 It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul
        and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
        in the house of Saul.
003:007 Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
        of Aiah:  and [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why have you gone
        in to my father's concubine?
003:008 Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said,
        Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?  This day do I show
        kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers,
        and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand
        of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault
        concerning this woman.
003:009 God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn
        to David, I don't do even so to him;
003:010 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set
        up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan
        even to Beersheba.
003:011 He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
003:012 Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is
        the land? saying [also], Make your league with me, and behold,
        my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.
003:013 He said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing
        I require of you:  that is, you shall not see my face,
        except you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come
        to see my face.
003:014 David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying,
        Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me
        for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
003:015 Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
        Paltiel the son of Laish.
003:016 Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed
        her to Bahurim.  Then said Abner to him, Go, return:
        and he returned.
003:017 Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
        In times past you sought for David to be king over you:
003:018 now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand
        of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand
        of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
003:019 Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin:  and Abner went
        also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
        good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.
        David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.
003:021 Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel
        to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you,
        and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.
        David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
003:022 Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray,
        and brought in a great spoil with them:  but Abner was not
        with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
        gone in peace.
003:023 When Joab and all the army who was with him had come,
        they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king,
        and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold,
        Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away,
        and he is quite gone?
003:025 You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you,
        and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know
        all that you do.
003:026 When Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
        after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah:
        but David didn't know it.
003:027 When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into
        the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck
        him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood
        of Asahel his brother.
003:028 Afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
        are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner
        the son of Ner:
003:029 let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house;
        and let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has
        an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff,
        or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.
003:030 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had
        killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
003:031 David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him,
        Tear your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
        before Abner.  King David followed the bier.
003:032 They buried Abner in Hebron:  and the king lifted up his voice,
        and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
003:033 The king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die
        as a fool dies?
003:034 Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters.
        As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.
        All the people wept again over him.
003:035 All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day;
        but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also,
        if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun be down.
003:036 All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them;
        as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
003:037 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
        was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.
003:038 The king said to his servants, "Don't you know that there
        a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
003:039 I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
        the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me.  May Yahweh reward
        the evil-doer according to his wickedness."
004:001 When [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron,
        his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
004:002 [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, [had] two men who were captains of bands:
        the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
        the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin
        (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:
004:003 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners
        there until this day).
004:004 Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet.
        He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan
        out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled:
        and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
        and became lame.  His name was Mephibosheth.
004:005 The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
        and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth,
        as he took his rest at noon.
004:006 They came there into the midst of the house, as though they
        would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body:
        and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
004:007 Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed
        in his bedchamber, they struck him, and killed him,
        and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way
        of the Arabah all night.
004:008 They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron,
        and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth,
        the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life;
        and Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul,
        and of his seed.
004:009 David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons
        of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives,
        who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
004:010 when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have
        brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag,
        which was the reward I gave him for his news.
004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
        in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood
        of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
004:012 David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut
        off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside
        the pool in Hebron.  But they took the head of Ishbosheth,
        and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron,
        and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
005:002 In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you
        who led out and brought in Israel:  and Yahweh said to you,
        You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall
        be prince over Israel.
005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron;
        and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh:
        and they anointed David king over Israel.
005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned forty years.
005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months;
        and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all
        Israel and Judah.
005:006 The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites,
        the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying,
        Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not
        come in here; thinking, David can't come in here.
005:007 Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is
        the city of David.
005:008 David said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites,
        let him get up to the watercourse, and [strike]
        the lame and the blind, who are hated of David's soul.
        Therefore they say, There are the blind and the lame;
        he can't come into the house.
005:009 David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David.
        David built round about from Millo and inward.
005:010 David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies,
        was with him.
005:011 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
        and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
005:012 David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel,
        and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
005:013 David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
        after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons
        and daughters born to David.
005:014 These are the names of those who were born to him
        in Jerusalem:  Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
005:015 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
005:016 and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
005:017 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
        over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David;
        and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
005:018 Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the
        valley of Rephaim.
005:019 David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against
        the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand?
        Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver
        the Philistines into your hand.
005:020 David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said,
        Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.
        Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
005:021 They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
005:022 The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
        in the valley of Rephaim.
005:023 When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You shall not go up:
        make a circuit behind them, and come on them over against
        the mulberry trees.
005:024 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops
        of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself;
        for then is Yahweh gone out before you to strike the army
        of the Philistines.
005:025 David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines
        from Geba until you come to Gezer.
006:001 David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
        thirty thousand.
006:002 David arose, and went with all the people who were with him,
        from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God,
        which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies
        who sits [above] the cherubim.
006:003 They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it
        out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill:
        and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
006:004 They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill,
        with the ark of God:  and Ahio went before the ark.
006:005 David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all
        manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, and with harps,
        and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines,
        and with castanets, and with cymbals.
006:006 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put
        forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it;
        for the oxen stumbled.
006:007 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck
        him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
006:008 David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah;
        and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.
006:009 David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, How shall
        the ark of Yahweh come to me?
006:010 So David would not remove the ark of Yahweh to him into
        the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house
        of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
006:011 The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom
        the Gittite three months:  and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom,
        and all his house.
006:012 It was told king David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house
        of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark
        of God.  David went and brought up the ark of God from the house
        of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.
006:013 It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone
        six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
006:014 David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was
        girded with a linen ephod.
006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh
        with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
006:016 It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David,
        that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window,
        and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh;
        and she despised him in her heart.
006:017 They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place,
        in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David
        offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
006:018 When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering
        and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name
        of Yahweh of Armies.
006:019 He dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
        of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a cake
        of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins.
        So all the people departed everyone to his house.
006:020 Then David returned to bless his household.
        Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said,
        How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered
        himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants,
        as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
006:021 David said to Michal, [It was] before Yahweh, who chose me
        above your father, and above all his house, to appoint
        me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel:
        therefore will I play before Yahweh.
006:022 I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my
        own sight:  but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken,
        they shall honor me.
006:023 Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
007:001 It happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh
        had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
007:002 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
        in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
007:003 Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart;
        for Yahweh is with you.
007:004 It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came
        to Nathan, saying,
007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus says Yahweh, Shall you
        build me a house for me to dwell in?
007:006 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought
        up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day,
        but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.
007:007 In all places in which I have walked with all the children
        of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
        whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying,
        Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
007:008 Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant David, Thus says
        Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep pen, from following
        the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel;
007:009 and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all
        your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name,
        like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
007:010 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
        that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more;
        neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,
        as at the first,
007:011 and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel; and I will cause you to rest from all your enemies.
        Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.
007:012 When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers,
        I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out
        of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
007:013 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish
        the throne of his kingdom forever.
007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son:
        if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men,
        and with the stripes of the children of men;
007:015 but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took
        it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
007:016 Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before you:
        your throne shall be established forever.
007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
        so did Nathan speak to David.
007:018 Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh;
        and he said, Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house,
        that you have brought me thus far?
007:019 This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have
        spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come;
        and this [too] after the manner of men, Lord Yahweh!
007:020 What can David say more to you? for you know your servant,
        Lord Yahweh.
007:021 For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, have you
        worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
007:022 Therefore you are great, Yahweh God:  for there is none like you,
        neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we
        have heard with our ears.
007:023 What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel,
        whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make
        him a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things
        for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to you
        out of Egypt, [from] the nations and their gods?
007:024 You did establish to yourself your people Israel to be a people
        to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
007:025 Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning
        your servant, and concerning his house, confirm you it forever,
        and do as you have spoken.
007:026 Let your name be magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies
        is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall
        be established before you.
007:027 For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed
        to your servant, saying, I will build you a house:
        therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this
        prayer to you.
007:028 Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth,
        and you have promised this good thing to your servant:
007:029 now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant,
        that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh,
        have spoken it:  and with your blessing let the house of your
        servant be blessed forever.
008:001 After this it happened that David struck the Philistines,
        and subdued them:  and David took the bridle of the mother
        city out of the hand of the Philistines.
008:002 He struck Moab, and measured them with the line,
        making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two
        lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive.
        The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
008:003 David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
        as he went to recover his dominion at the River.
008:004 David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty
        thousand footmen:  and David hamstrung all the chariot horses,
        but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.
008:005 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king
        of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the
        Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.
        Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
008:007 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
008:008 From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
        took exceeding much brass.
008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all
        the army of Hadadezer,
008:010 then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to Greet him,
        and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer
        and struck him:  for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.
        [Joram] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold,
        and vessels of brass:
008:011 These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver
        and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;
008:012 of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
        the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
        son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
008:013 David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians
        in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
008:014 He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons,
        and all the Edomites became servants to David.
        Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
008:015 David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice
        and righteousness to all his people.
008:016 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud was recorder;
008:017 and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,
        were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
008:018 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was over] the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.
009:001 David said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul,
        that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
009:002 There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba,
        and they called him to David; and the king said to him,
        Are you Ziba?  He said, Your servant is he.
009:003 The king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I
        may show the kindness of God to him?  Ziba said to the king,
        Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.
009:004 The king said to him, Where is he?  Ziba said to the king,
        Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel,
        in Lo Debar.
009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir
        the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.
009:006 Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
        came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance.
        David said, Mephibosheth.  He answered, Behold, your servant!
009:007 David said to him, "Don't be afraid of him; for I will
        surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake,
        and will restore you all the land of Saul your father;
        and you shall eat bread at my table continually."
009:008 He did obeisance, and said, "What is your servant, that you
        should look on such a dead dog as I am?"
009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him,
        "All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given
        to your master's son.
009:010 You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons,
        and your servants; and you shall bring in [the fruits],
        that your master's son may have bread to eat:  but Mephibosheth
        your master's son shall eat bread always at my table."
        Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
009:011 Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord
        the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do.
        As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table,
        as one of the king's sons.
009:012 Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica.
        All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
009:013 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually
        at the king's table.  He was lame in both his feet.
010:001 It happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died,
        and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
010:002 David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash,
        as his father shown kindness to me.  So David sent
        by his servants to comfort him concerning his father.
        David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
010:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun
        their lord, Do you think that David honors your father,
        in that he has sent comforters to you?  Hasn't David sent
        his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out,
        and to overthrow it?
010:004 So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half
        of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle,
        even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
010:005 When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men
        were greatly ashamed.  The king said, Wait at Jericho until
        your beards be grown, and then return.
010:006 When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious
        to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians
        of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen,
        and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men
        of Tob twelve thousand men.
010:007 When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army
        of the mighty men.
010:008 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
        at the entrance of the gate:  and the Syrians of Zobah and
        of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves
        in the field.
010:009 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him
        before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
        and put them in array against the Syrians:
010:010 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai
        his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
010:011 He said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall
        help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you,
        then I will come and help you.
010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people,
        and for the cities of our God:  and Yahweh do that which
        seems him good.
010:013 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle
        against the Syrians:  and they fled before him.
010:014 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city.
        Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon,
        and came to Jerusalem.
010:015 When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
        they gathered themselves together.
010:016 Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond
        the River:  and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain
        of the army of Hadarezer at their head.
010:017 It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together,
        and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam.  The Syrians
        set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
010:018 The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians
        [the men of] seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen,
        and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that
        he died there.
010:019 When all the kings who were servants to Hadarezer saw that they
        were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel,
        and served them.  So the Syrians feared to help the children
        of Ammon any more.
011:001 It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go
        out [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him,
        and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon,
        and besieged Rabbah.  But David stayed at Jerusalem.
011:002 It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed,
        and walked on the roof of the king's house:  and from the roof
        he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful
        to look on.
011:003 David send and inquired after the woman.  One said,
        Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife
        of Uriah the Hittite?
011:004 David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him,
        and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness);
        and she returned to her house.
011:005 The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said,
        I am with child.
011:006 David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite.
        Joab sent Uriah to David.
011:007 When Uriah was come to him, David asked of him how Joab did,
        and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
011:008 David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet.
        Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed
        him a mess [of food] from the king.
011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all
        the servants of his lord, and didn't go down to his house.
011:010 When they had told David, saying, Uriah didn't go down to his house,
        David said to Uriah, Haven't you come from a journey? why
        did you not go down to your house?
011:011 Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
        abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
        are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house,
        to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live,
        and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
011:012 David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I
        will let you depart.  So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
        and the next day.
011:013 When David had called him, he ate and drink before him;
        and he made him drunk:  and at even he went out to lie on
        his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn't go down
        to his house.
011:014 It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab,
        and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
011:015 He wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront
        of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may
        be struck, and die.
011:016 It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned
        Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.
011:017 The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab:
        and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David;
        and Uriah the Hittite died also.
011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
011:019 and he charged the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end
        of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,
011:020 it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he tells you,
        'Why did you go so near to the city to fight?  Didn't you
        know that they would shoot from the wall?
011:021 who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?  Didn't a woman
        cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died
        at Thebez?  Why did you go so near the wall?' then shall you say,
        'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shown David all that Joab
        had sent him for.
011:023 The messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us,
        and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even
        to the entrance of the gate.
011:024 The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall;
        and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant
        Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
011:025 Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you tell Joab, Don't let
        this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well
        as another; make your battle more strong against the city,
        and overthrow it:  and encourage you him.
011:026 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead,
        she made lamentation for her husband.
011:027 When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home
        to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son.
        But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.
012:001 Yahweh sent Nathan to David.  He came to him, and said
        to him, "There were two men in one city; the one rich,
        and the other poor.
012:002 The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
012:003 but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb,
        which he had bought and raised.  It grew up together with him,
        and with his children.  It ate of his own food, drank of his
        own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.
012:004 A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his
        own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring
        man who had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb,
        and dressed it for the man who had come to him."
012:005 David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said
        to Nathan, "As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is
        worthy to die!
012:006 He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing,
        and because he had no pity!"
012:007 Nathan said to David, "You are the man.  This is what Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, says:  'I anointed you king over Israel,
        and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
012:008 I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into
        your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah;
        and if that would have been too little, I would have added
        to you many more such things.
012:009 Why have you despised the word of Yahweh, to do that which
        is evil in his sight?  You have struck Uriah the Hittite
        with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife,
        and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
012:010 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house,
        because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah
        the Hittite to be your wife.'
012:011 This is what Yahweh says:  'Behold, I will raise up evil
        against you out of your own house; and I will take your
        wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor,
        and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
012:012 For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel,
        and before the sun.'"
012:013 David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against Yahweh."
        Nathan said to David, "Yahweh also has put away your sin.
        You will not die.
012:014 However, because by this deed you have given great occasion
        to Yahweh's enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born
        to you shall surely die."
012:015 Nathan departed to his house.  Yahweh struck the child that
        Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
012:016 David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted,
        and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
012:017 The elders of his house arose, [and stood] beside him,
        to raise him up from the earth:  but he would not, neither did
        he eat bread with them.
012:018 It happened on the seventh day, that the child died.
        The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead;
        for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive,
        we spoke to him, and he didn't listen to our voice:
        how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
        child is dead!
012:019 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together,
        David perceived that the child was dead; and David said
        to his servants, Is the child dead?  They said, He is dead.
012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself,
        and changed his clothing; and he came into the house
        of Yahweh, and worshiped:  then he came to his own house;
        and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
012:021 Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have
        done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;
        but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.
012:022 He said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
        for I said, Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me,
        that the child may live?
012:023 But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again?
        I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
012:024 David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay
        with her:  and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon.
        Yahweh loved him;
012:025 and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named
        him Jedidiah, for Yahweh's sake.
012:026 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and took the royal city.
012:027 Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
        against Rabbah; yes, I have taken the city of waters.
012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together,
        and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city,
        and it be called after my name.
012:029 David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
        and fought against it, and took it.
012:030 He took the crown of their king from off his head;
        and the weight of it was a talent of gold, and [in it
        were] precious stones; and it was set on David's head.
        He brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
012:031 He brought forth the people who were therein, and put them
        under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes
        of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln:
        and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon.
        David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
013:001 It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had
        a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son
        of David loved her.
013:002 Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar;
        for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do
        anything to her.
013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son
        of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
013:004 He said to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day
        to day?  Won't you tell me?  Amnon said to him, I love Tamar,
        my brother Absalom's sister.
013:005 Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign
        yourself sick:  and when your father comes to see you,
        tell him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread
        to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it,
        and eat it from her hand.
013:006 So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick:  and when the king
        was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let her
        sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight,
        that I may eat from her hand.
013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother
        Amnon's house, and dress him food.
013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.
        She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight,
        and did bake the cakes.
013:009 She took the pan, and poured them out before him;
        but he refused to eat.  Amnon said, Have out all men from me.
        They went out every man from him.
013:010 Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may
        eat from your hand.  Tamar took the cakes which she had made,
        and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
013:011 When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her,
        and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
013:012 She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such
        thing ought to be done in Israel.  Don't you do this folly.
013:013 I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be
        as one of the fools in Israel.  Now therefore, please speak
        to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.
013:014 However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger
        than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
013:015 Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred
        with which he hated her was greater than the love with which
        he had loved her.  Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
013:016 She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting
        me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me.
        But he would not listen to her.
013:017 Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said,
        Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
013:018 She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such
        robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed.
        Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
013:019 Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various
        colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head,
        and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
013:020 Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother
        been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister:
        he is your brother; don't take this thing to heart.
        So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
013:022 Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom
        hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
013:023 It happened after two full years, that Absalom had
        sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim:
        and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
013:024 Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant
        has sheepshearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants
        go with your servant.
013:025 The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go,
        lest we be burdensome to you.  He pressed him:
        however he would not go, but blessed him.
013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.
        The king said to him, Why should he go with you?
013:027 But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's
        sons go with him.
013:028 Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now,
        when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you,
        Smite Amnon, then kill him; don't be afraid; haven't I
        commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
013:029 The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
        Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up
        on his mule, and fled.
013:030 It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came
        to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons,
        and there is not one of them left.
013:031 Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth;
        and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
013:032 Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered, Don't let
        my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men
        the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment
        of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced
        his sister Tamar.
013:033 Now therefore don't let my lord the king take the thing
        to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead;
        for Amnon only is dead.
013:034 But Absalom fled.  The young man who kept the watch lifted up
        his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming
        by way of the hillside behind him.
013:035 Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are come:
        as your servant said, so it is.
013:036 It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold,
        the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept:
        and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur,
        king of Geshur.  [David] mourned for his son every day.
013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
013:039 [the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom:
        for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
        was toward Absalom.
014:002 Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman,
        and said to her, please act like a mourner, and put on
        mourning clothing, Please, and don't anoint yourself with oil,
        but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead:
014:003 and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him.
        So Joab put the words in her mouth.
014:004 When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face
        to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
014:005 The king said to her, What ails you?  She answered, Of a truth
        I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
014:006 Your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field,
        and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other,
        and killed him.
014:007 Behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid,
        and they say, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we
        may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed,
        and so destroy the heir also.  Thus will they quench my coal
        which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor
        remainder on the surface of the earth.
014:008 The king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give
        charge concerning you.
014:009 The woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king,
        the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king
        and his throne be guiltless.
014:010 The king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me,
        and he shall not touch you any more.
014:011 Then said she, Please let the king remember Yahweh your God,
        that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they
        destroy my son.  He said, As Yahweh lives, there shall not
        one hair of your son fall to the earth.
014:012 Then the woman said, Please let your handmaid speak a word
        to my lord the king.  He said, Say on.
014:013 The woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against
        the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is
        as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home
        again his banished one.
014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground,
        which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take
        away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be
        an outcast from him.
014:015 Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my
        lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
        and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king;
        it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand
        of the man who would destroy me and my son together out
        of the inheritance of God.
014:017 Then your handmaid said, Please let the word of my lord the king
        be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king
        to discern good and bad:  and Yahweh your God be with you.
014:018 Then the king answered the woman, Please don't hide anything
        from me that I shall ask you.  The woman said, Let my lord
        the king now speak.
014:019 The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?
        The woman answered, As your soul lives, my lord the king,
        none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything
        that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab,
        he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth
        of your handmaid;
014:020 to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done
        this thing:  and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom
        of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
014:021 The king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:
        go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.
014:022 Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance,
        and blessed the king:  and Joab said, Today your servant knows
        that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that
        the king has performed the request of his servant.
014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
014:024 The king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him
        not see my face.  So Absalom turned to his own house,
        and didn't see the king's face.
014:025 Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom
        for his beauty:  from the sole of his foot even to the crown
        of his head there was no blemish in him.
014:026 When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end
        that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it);
        he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels,
        after the king's weight.
014:027 To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
        whose name was Tamar:  she was a woman of a beautiful face.
014:028 Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn't see
        the king's face.
014:029 Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king;
        but he would not come to him:  and he sent again a second time,
        but he would not come.
014:030 Therefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab's field is
        near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.
        Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said
        to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
014:032 Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here,
        that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come
        from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still.
        Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be
        iniquity in me, let him kill me.
014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called
        for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face
        to the ground before the king:  and the king kissed Absalom.
015:001 It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot
        and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
015:002 Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
        and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should
        come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him,
        and said, Of what city are you?  He said, Your servant is
        of one of the tribes of Israel.
015:003 Absalom said to him, Behold, your matters are good and right;
        but there is no man deputized of the king to hear you.
015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
        that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me,
        and I would do him justice!
015:005 It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance,
        he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
015:006 In this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king
        for judgment:  so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
015:007 It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said
        to the king, please let me go and pay my vow, which I have
        vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.
015:008 For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
        saying, If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem,
        then I will serve Yahweh.
015:009 The king said to him, Go in peace.  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet,
        then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
015:011 With Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited,
        and went in their simplicity; and they didn't know anything.
015:012 Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor,
        from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering
        the sacrifices.  The conspiracy was strong; for the people
        increased continually with Absalom.
015:013 There came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men
        of Israel are after Absalom.
015:014 David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise,
        and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom:
        make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring
        down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
015:015 The king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants
        are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.
015:016 The king went forth, and all his household after him.
        The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.
015:017 The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they
        stayed in Beth Merhak.
015:018 All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
        and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men
        who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with
        us? return, and abide with the king:  for you are a foreigner,
        and also an exile; [return] to your own place.
015:020 Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go
        up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? return you,
        and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you.
015:021 Ittai answered the king, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my
        lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king
        shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will
        your servant be.
015:022 David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.  Ittai the Gittite
        passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who
        were with him.
015:023 All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
        passed over:  the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron,
        and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
015:024 Behold, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him,
        bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down
        the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people
        had done passing out of the city.
015:025 The king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city:
        if I shall find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring
        me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
015:026 but if he say thus, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I,
        let him do to me as seems good to him.
015:027 The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer?
        Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
        Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
015:028 Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word
        comes from you to inform me."
015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again
        to Jerusalem:  and they abode there.
015:030 David went up by the ascent of the [Mount of] Olives, and wept
        as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot:
        and all the people who were with him covered every man his head,
        and they went up, weeping as they went up.
015:031 One told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
        with Absalom.  David said, Yahweh, please turn the counsel
        of Ahithophel into foolishness.
015:032 It happened that when David had come to the top [of the ascent],
        where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came
        to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.
015:033 David said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be
        a burden to me:
015:034 but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, I will be
        your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant
        in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you
        defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
015:035 Don't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you?
        therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear
        out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and
        Abiathar the priests.
015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons,
        Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them
        you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.
015:037 So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom
        came into Jerusalem.
016:001 When David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold,
        Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple
        of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread,
        and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits,
        and a bottle of wine.
016:002 The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these?
        Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on;
        and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat;
        and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
016:003 The king said, Where is your master's son?  Ziba said
        to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said,
        Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
        of my father.
016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains
        to Mephibosheth is yours.  Ziba said, I do obeisance;
        let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.
016:005 When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of
        the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera.
        He came out, and cursed still as he came.
016:006 He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
        and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right
        hand and on his left.
016:007 Thus said Shimei when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man
        of blood, and base fellow:
016:008 Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul,
        in whose place you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered
        the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and behold,
        you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a
        man of blood.
016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king,
        "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?
        Please let me go over and take off his head."
016:010 The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons
        of Zeruiah?  Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said
        to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done so?
016:011 David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold,
        my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life:
        how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone,
        and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.
016:012 It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me,
        and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing
        of me this day.
016:013 So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along
        on the hillside over against him, and cursed as he went,
        and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
016:014 The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary;
        and he refreshed himself there.
016:015 Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
        and Ahithophel with him.
016:016 It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come
        to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king,
        [Long] live the king.
016:017 Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend?
        Why didn't you go with your friend?
016:018 Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people,
        and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be,
        and with him will I abide.
016:019 Again, whom should I serve?  Shouldn't I serve in the presence
        of his son? as I have served in your father's presence,
        so will I be in your presence.
016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what
        we shall do.
016:021 Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines,
        that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear
        that you are abhorred of your father:  then will the hands
        of all who are with you be strong.
016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house;
        and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight
        of all Israel.
016:023 The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days,
        was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God:  so was all
        the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose
        out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after
        David this night:
017:002 and I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will
        make him afraid; and all the people who are with him shall flee;
        and I will strike the king only;
017:003 and I will bring back all the people to you:  the man whom
        you seek is as if all returned:  [so] all the people shall
        be in peace.
017:004 The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
        us hear likewise what he says.
017:006 When Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him,
        saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner:
        shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak up.
017:007 Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given
        this time is not good.
017:008 Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men,
        that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds,
        as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father
        is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place:
        and it will happen, when some of them are fallen at the first,
        that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among
        the people who follow Absalom.
017:010 Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
        will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father
        is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.
017:011 But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you,
        from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea
        for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
017:012 So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found,
        and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground;
        and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not
        leave so much as one.
017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
        bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
        until there not be one small stone found there.
017:014 Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai
        the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
        For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel,
        to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.
017:015 Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
        thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;
        and thus and thus have I counseled.
017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don't lodge
        this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means
        pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people
        who are with him.
017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female
        servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David:
        for they might not be seen to come into the city.
017:018 But a boy saw them, and told Absalom:  and they went both of them
        away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim,
        who had a well in his court; and they went down there.
017:019 The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth,
        and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.
017:020 Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said,
        Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?  The woman said to them,
        They have gone over the brook of water.  When they had sought
        and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
017:021 It happened, after they had departed, that they came up
        out of the well, and went and told king David; and they
        said to David, Arise you, and pass quickly over the water;
        for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.
017:022 Then David arose, and all the people who were with him,
        and they passed over the Jordan:  by the morning light there
        lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.
017:023 When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,
        he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home, to his city,
        and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died,
        and was buried in the tomb of his father.
017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim.  Absalom passed over the Jordan,
        he and all the men of Israel with him.
017:025 Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab.
        Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra
        the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
        sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
017:026 Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
017:027 It happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
        the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai
        the Gileadite of Rogelim,
017:028 brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat,
        and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans,
        and lentils, and parched [pulse],
017:029 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd,
        for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat:
        for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty,
        in the wilderness.
018:001 David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains
        of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
018:002 David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand
        of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son
        of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand
        of Ittai the Gittite.  The king said to the people, I will
        surely go forth with you myself also.
018:003 But the people said, You shall not go forth:  for if we flee away,
        they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
        will they care for us:  but you are worth ten thousand of us;
        therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us
        out of the city.
018:004 The king said to them, What seems you best I will do.
        The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out
        by hundreds and by thousands.
018:005 The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
        gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
        All the people heard when the king gave all the captains
        charge concerning Absalom.
018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel:
        and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
018:007 The people of Israel were struck there before the servants
        of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day
        of twenty thousand men.
018:008 For the battle was there spread over the surface of all
        the country; and the forest devoured more people that day
        than the sword devoured.
018:009 Absalom happened to meet the servants of David.
        Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under
        the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold
        of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth;
        and the mule that was under him went on.
018:010 A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
        Absalom hanging in an oak.
018:011 Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it,
        and why didn't you strike him there to the ground? and I
        would have given you ten [pieces of] silver, and a sash.
018:012 The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
        [pieces of] silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth
        my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king
        charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
        touch the young man Absalom.
018:013 Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there
        is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would
        have set yourself against [me].
018:014 Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you.  He took three darts
        in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,
        while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
018:015 Ten young men who bore Joab's armor compassed about and
        struck Absalom, and killed him.
018:016 Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
        after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
018:017 They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest,
        and raised over him a very great heap of stones:
        and all Israel fled everyone to his tent.
018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up
        for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale;
        for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory:
        and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called
        Absalom's monument, to this day.
018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
        the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.
018:020 Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day,
        but you shall bear news another day; but this day you shall
        bear no news, because the king's son is dead.
018:021 Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen.
        The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come
        what may, Please let me also run after the Cushite.
        Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will
        have no reward for the news?
018:023 But come what may, [said he], I will run.  He said to him, Run.
        Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
018:024 Now David was sitting between the two gates:  and the watchman
        went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up
        his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
018:025 The watchman cried, and told the king.  The king said,
        If he be alone, there is news in his mouth.  He came apace,
        and drew near.
018:026 The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called
        to the porter, and said, Behold, [another] man running alone.
        The king said, He also brings news.
018:027 The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is
        like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.  The king said,
        He is a good man, and comes with good news.
018:028 Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well.
        He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth,
        and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up
        the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
018:029 The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom?
        Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant,
        even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know
        what it was.
018:030 The king said, Turn aside, and stand here.  He turned aside,
        and stood still.
018:031 Behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my
        lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all
        those who rose up against you.
018:032 The king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young
        man Absalom?  The Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord
        the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt,
        be as that young man is.
018:033 The king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,
        and wept:  and as he went, thus he said, my son Absalom,
        my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for you, Absalom,
        my son, my son!
019:001 It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
019:002 The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people;
        for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.
019:003 The people got them by stealth that day into the city,
        as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
019:004 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
        my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!
019:005 Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed
        this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved
        your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters,
        and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;
019:006 in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you.
        For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are
        nothing to you:  for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived,
        and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.
019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably
        to your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't
        go forth, there will not stay a man with you this night:
        and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has
        happened to you from your youth until now.
019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.  They told to all
        the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate:
        and all the people came before the king.  Now Israel had fled
        every man to his tent.
019:009 All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
        of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of
        our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines;
        and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.
019:010 Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
        Now therefore why don't you speak a word of bringing
        the king back?
019:011 King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
        Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last
        to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all
        Israel is come to the king, [to bring him] to his house.
019:012 You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh:
        why then are you the last to bring back the king?
019:013 Say you to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh?
        God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain
        of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.
019:014 He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of]
        one man; so that they sent to the king, [saying], Return you,
        and all your servants.
019:015 So the king returned, and came to the Jordan.  Judah came to Gilgal,
        to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.
019:016 Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim,
        hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
019:017 There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
        the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
        twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan
        in the presence of the king.
019:018 A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household,
        and to do what he thought good.  Shimei the son of Gera fell
        down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.
019:019 He said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me,
        neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely
        the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem,
        that the king should take it to his heart.
019:020 For your servant does know that I have sinned:  therefore, behold,
        I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go
        down to meet my lord the king.
019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be
        put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?
019:022 David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah,
        that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there
        any man be put to death this day in Israel? for don't I know
        that I am this day king over Israel?
019:023 The king said to Shimei, You shall not die.  The king
        swore to him.
019:024 Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king;
        and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard,
        nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until
        the day he came home in peace.
019:025 It happened, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
        that the king said to him, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?
019:026 He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me:
        for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may
        ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.
019:027 He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord
        the king is as an angel of God:  do therefore what is good
        in your eyes.
019:028 For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king;
        yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table.
        What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more
        to the king?
019:029 The king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters?
        I say, You and Ziba divide the land.
019:030 Mephibosheth said to the king, yes, let him take all,
        because my lord the king is come in peace to his own house.
019:031 Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went
        over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old:
        and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay
        at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
019:033 The king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I
        will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.
019:034 Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years
        of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
019:035 I am this day eighty years old:  can I discern between good
        and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
        can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
        women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my
        lord the king?
019:036 Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king:
        and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
019:037 Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die
        in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother.
        But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord
        the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.
019:038 The king answered, Chimham shall go over with me,
        and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you:
        and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.
019:039 All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over:
        and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned
        to his own place.
019:040 So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him:
        and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half
        the people of Israel.
019:041 Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king,
        Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away,
        and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan,
        and all David's men with him?
019:042 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king
        is a close relative to us:  why then are you angry for this
        matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or has
        he given us any gift?
019:043 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,
        We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right]
        in David than you:  why then did you despise us, that our
        advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?
        The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words
        of the men of Israel.
020:001 There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba,
        the son of Bichri, a Benjamite:  and he blew the trumpet,
        and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance
        in the son of Jesse:  every man to his tents, Israel.
020:002 So all the men of Israel went up from following David,
        and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah
        joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
020:003 David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
        women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house,
        and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance,
        but didn't go in to them.  So they were shut up to the day
        of their death, living in widowhood.
020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together
        within three days, and be here present.
020:005 So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed
        longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
020:006 David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us
        more harm than did Absalom:  take your lord's servants,
        and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities,
        and escape out of our sight.
020:007 There went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went
        out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came
        to meet them.  Joab was girded with his apparel of war that
        he had put on, and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened
        on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
020:009 Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother?
        Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
        so he struck him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels
        to the ground, and didn't strike him again; and he died.
        Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:011 There stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who
        favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.
020:012 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway.
        When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa
        out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him,
        when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went
        on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:014 He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah,
        and all the Berites:  and they were gathered together,
        and went also after him.
020:015 They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast
        up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart;
        and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall,
        to throw it down.
020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, "Hear, hear!
        Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"
020:017 He came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab?  He answered,
        I am.  Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid.
        He answered, I do hear.
020:018 Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in
        old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel:
        and so they ended [the matter].
020:019 I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
        you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel:
        why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?
020:020 Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should
        swallow up or destroy.
020:021 The matter is not so:  but a man of the hill country
        of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted
        up his hand against the king, even against David;
        deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.
        The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown
        to you over the wall.
020:022 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom.
        They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri,
        and threw it out to Joab.  He blew the trumpet, and they
        were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent.
        Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
020:023 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son
        of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
020:024 and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor;
        and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
020:025 and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
020:026 and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
021:001 There was a famine in the days of David three years,
        year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh.
        Yahweh said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house,
        because he put to death the Gibeonites.
021:002 The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites
        were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of
        the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them:
        and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children
        of Israel and Judah);
021:003 and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
        And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless
        the inheritance of Yahweh?
021:004 The Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold
        between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put
        any man to death in Israel.  He said, What you shall say,
        that will I do for you.
021:005 They said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised
        against us, [that] we should be destroyed from remaining
        in any of the borders of Israel,
021:006 let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang
        them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.
        The king said, I will give them.
021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
        of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath that was between them,
        between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
        whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
        sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel
        the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
021:009 He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
        hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and they fell [all]
        seven together.  They were put to death in the days of harvest,
        in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
021:010 Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
        for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water
        was poured on them from the sky; and she allowed neither
        the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals
        of the field by night.
021:011 It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine
        of Saul, had done.
021:012 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan
        his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from
        the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them,
        in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;
021:013 and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones
        of Jonathan his son:  and they gathered the bones of those
        who were hanged.
021:014 They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country
        of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father:
        and they performed all that the king commanded.
        After that God was entreated for the land.
021:015 The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down,
        and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines.
        David grew faint;
021:016 and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight
        of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight,
        he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.
021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck
        the Philistine, and killed him.  Then the men of David swore
        to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle,
        that you don't quench the lamp of Israel.
021:018 It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the
        Philistines at Gob:  then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph,
        who was of the sons of the giant.
021:019 There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan
        the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath
        the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like
        a weaver's beam.
021:020 There was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
        who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes,
        four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
021:021 When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother,
        killed him.
021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell
        by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
022:001 David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day
        that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,
        and out of the hand of Saul:
022:002 and he said, Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
        even mine;
022:003 God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield,
        and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge.
        My savior, you save me from violence.
022:004 I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised:
        So shall I be saved from my enemies.
022:005 For the waves of death surrounded me.  The floods of ungodliness
        made me afraid.
022:006 The cords of Sheol were around me.  The snares of death caught me.
022:007 In my distress I called on Yahweh.  Yes, I called to my God.
        He heard my voice out of his temple.  My cry [came] into his ears.
022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations of heaven
        quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
022:009 Smoke went up out of his nostrils.  Fire out of his mouth devoured.
        Coals were kindled by it.
022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness
        was under his feet.
022:011 He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he was seen on the wings
        of the wind.
022:012 He made darkness pavilions around himself:  gathering of waters,
        and thick clouds of the skies.
022:013 At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.
022:014 Yahweh thundered from heaven.  The Most High uttered his voice.
022:015 He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
022:016 Then the channels of the sea appeared.  The foundations of
        the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast
        of the breath of his nostrils.
022:017 He sent from on high and he took me.  He drew me out
        of many waters.
022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me,
        for they were too mighty for me.
022:019 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh
        was my support.
022:020 He also brought me out into a large place.  He delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.
022:021 Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.
        He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
022:022 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.
022:023 For all his ordinances were before me.  As for his statutes,
        I did not depart from them.
022:024 I was also perfect toward him.  I kept myself from my iniquity.
022:025 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
        According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
022:026 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
        With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.
022:027 With the pure you will show yourself pure.  With the crooked
        you will show yourself shrewd.
022:028 You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on
        the haughty, that you may bring them down.
022:029 For you are my lamp, Yahweh.  Yahweh will light up my darkness.
022:030 For by you, I run against a troop.  By my God, I leap over a wall.
022:031 As for God, his way is perfect.  The word of Yahweh is tested.
        He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
022:032 For who is God, besides Yahweh?  Who is a rock, besides our God?
022:033 God is my strong fortress.  He makes my way perfect.
022:034 He makes his feet like hinds' [feet], and sets me on
        my high places.
022:035 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
022:036 You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
        Your gentleness has made me great.
022:037 You have enlarged my steps under me.  My feet have not slipped.
022:038 I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.  I didn't turn
        again until they were consumed.
022:039 I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they
        can't arise.  Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
022:040 For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
        You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
022:041 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I
        might cut off those who hate me.
022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh,
        but he didn't answer them.
022:043 Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
        I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
022:044 You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.
        You have kept me to be the head of the nations.
        A people whom I have not known will serve me.
022:045 The foreigners will submit themselves to me.  As soon as they
        hear of me, they will obey me.
022:046 The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out
        of their close places.
022:047 Yahweh lives!  Blessed be my rock!  Exalted be God, the rock
        of my salvation,
022:048 even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down
        peoples under me,
022:049 who brings me away from my enemies.  Yes, you lift me up
        above those who rise up against me.  You deliver me from
        the violent man.
022:050 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.
        Will sing praises to your name.
022:051 He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness
        to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.
023:001 Now these are the last words of David.  David the son of Jesse says,
        the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God
        of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:
023:002 The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me.  His word was on my tongue.
023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me,
        one who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,
023:004 [He shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises,
        a morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springs]
        out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.
023:005 Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet he has made
        with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things,
        and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire,
        although he doesn't make it grow.
023:006 But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away,
        because they can't be taken with the hand,
023:007 But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and
        the staff of a spear.  They shall be utterly burned with fire
        in [their] place.
023:008 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had:
        Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains;
        the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain
        at one time.
023:009 After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite,
        one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied
        the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle,
        and the men of Israel were gone away.
023:010 He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary,
        and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great
        victory that day; and the people returned after him only
        to take spoil.
023:011 After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite.
        The Philistines were gathered together into a troop,
        where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people
        fled from the Philistines.
023:012 But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it,
        and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.
023:013 Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David
        in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop
        of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
023:014 David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the
        Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
023:015 David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink
        of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
023:016 The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines,
        and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was
        by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
        but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.
023:017 He said, Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this:
        [shall I drink] the blood of the men who went in jeopardy
        of their lives? therefore he would not drink it.
        These things did the three mighty men.
023:018 Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
        of the three.  He lifted up his spear against three hundred
        and killed them, and had a name among the three.
023:019 Wasn't he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made
        their captain:  however he didn't attain to the [first] three.
023:020 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
        who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel
        of Moab:  he went down also and killed a lion in the midst
        of a pit in time of snow.
023:021 He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man:  and the Egyptian had
        a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff,
        and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
023:023 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
        to the [first] three.  David set him over his guard.
023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son
        of Dodo of Bethlehem,
023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
023:027 Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai
        of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
023:030 Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam
        the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
023:035 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers
        to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
023:038 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
023:039 Uriah the Hittite:  thirty-seven in all.
024:001 Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved
        David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
024:002 The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him,
        Go now back and forth through all the tribes of Israel,
        from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people,
        that I may know the sum of the people.
024:003 Joab said to the king, Now Yahweh your God add to the people,
        however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes
        of my lord the king see it:  but why does my lord the king
        delight in this thing?
024:004 Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab,
        and against the captains of the army.  Joab and the captains
        of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number
        the people of Israel.
024:005 They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right
        side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad,
        and to Jazer:
024:006 then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi;
        and they came to Dan Jaan, and round about to Sidon,
024:007 and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities
        of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out
        to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.
024:008 So when they had gone back and forth through all the land,
        they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
024:009 Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king:
        and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
        men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
        hundred thousand men.
024:010 David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people.
        David said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I
        have done:  but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity
        of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
024:011 When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came
        to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
024:012 Go and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things:
        choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven
        years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee
        three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall
        there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise you,
        and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
024:014 David said to Gad, I am in a great strait:  let us fall
        now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great;
        and let me not fall into the hand of man.
024:015 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even
        to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan
        even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
024:016 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem
        to destroy it, Yahweh repented him of the evil, and said
        to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough;
        now stay your hand.  The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing
        floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:017 David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people,
        and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely;
        but these sheep, what have they done?  Please let your hand
        be against me, and against my father's house.
024:018 Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar
        to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:019 David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
024:020 Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming
        on toward him:  and Araunah went out, and bowed himself
        before the king with his face to the ground.
024:021 Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?
        David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar
        to Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
024:022 Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up
        what seems good to him:  behold, the oxen for the burnt offering,
        and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen
        for the wood:
024:023 all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.  Araunah said
        to the king, Yahweh your God accept you.
024:024 The king said to Araunah, No; but I will most certainly
        buy it of you at a price.  Neither will I offer burnt
        offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.
        So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty
        shekels of silver.
024:025 David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings
        and peace offerings.  So Yahweh was entreated for the land,
        and the plague was stayed from Israel.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
