NOTES

FURTHER NOTES ON DERIVATION OF THE WORD "NEWS".

Without being what the Germans would call a _purist_, I cannot deem it
an object of secondary importance to defend the principles of the law
and constitution of the English language. For the adoption of words we
have no rule; and we act just as our convenience or necessity dictates:
but in their formation we must strictly conform to the laws we find
established. Your correspondents C.B. and A.E.B. (Vol. ii., p. 23.) seem
to me strangely to misconceive the real point at issue between us. To a
question by the latter, why I should attempt to derive "News" indirectly
from a German adjective, I answer, because in its transformation into a
German noun declined as an adjective, it gives the form which I contend
no English process will give. The rule your correspondents deduce from
this, neither of them, it appears, can understand. As I am not certain
that their deduction is a correct one, I beg to express it in my own
words as follows:--There is no such process known to the English
language as the formation of a noun-singular out of an adjective by the
addition of "_s_": neither is there any process known by which a
noun-plural can be formed from an adjective, without the previous
formation of the singular in the same sense; except in such cases as
"the rich, the poor, the noble," &c., where the singular form is used in
a plural sense. C.B. instances "goods, the shallows, blacks, for
mourning, greens." To the first of these I have already referred;
"shallow" is unquestionably a noun-singular; and to the remaining
instances the following remarks will apply.

As it should be understood that my argument applies solely to the
_English_ language, I think I might fairly take exception to a string of
instances with which A.E.B. endeavours to refute me from a vocabulary of
a language very expressive, no doubt, yet commonly called "slang". The
words in question are not English: I never use them myself, nor do I
recognise the right or necessity for any one else to do so; and I might,
indeed, deem this a sufficient answer. But the fact is that the language
in some degree is losing its instincts, and liberties are taken with it
now that it would not have allowed in its younger days. Have we not seen
participial adjectives made from nouns? I shall therefore waive my
objection, and answer by saying that there is no analogy between the
instances given and the case in point. They are, one and all, elliptical
expressions signifying "black clothes, green vegetables, tight
pantaloons, heavy dragoons, odd chances," &c. "Blacks" and "whites" are
not in point, the singular of either being quite as admissible as the
plural. The rule, if it be worth while to lay down a rule for the
formation of such vulgarisms, appears to be {82} that characteristic
adjective, in constant conjunction with a noun in common use, may be
used alone, the noun being understood. Custom has limited in some
measure the use of these abridged titles to classes or collective
bodies, and the adjective takes the same form that the noun itself would
have had; but, in point of fact, it would be just as good English to say
"a heavy" as "the heavies" and they all become unintelligible when we
lose sight of the noun to which they belong. If A.E.B. should assert
that a glass of "cold without," _because_, by those accustomed to
indulge in such potations, it was understood to mean "brandy and _cold_
water, _without_ sugar," was really a draught from some "well of purest
English undefil'd," the confusion of ideas could not be more complete.

Indeed, I very much doubt whether our word "News" contains the idea of
"new" at all. It is used with us to mean intelligence and the phrases,
"Is there any thing new?" and "Is there any news?" present, in my
opinion, two totally distinct ideas to the English mind in its ordinary
mechanical action. "Intelligence" is not necessarily "new", nor indeed
is "News:" in the oldest dictionary I possess, Baret's _Alvearie_, 1573,
I find "Olde newes or stale newes." A.E.B. is very positive that "news"
is plural, and he cites the "Cardinal of York" to prove it. All that I
can say is, that I think the Cardinal of York was wrong: and A.E.B.
thought so too, when his object was not to confound me, as may be seen
by his own practice in bloc concluding paragraph of his
communication:--"The _newes_ WAS of the victory," &c. The word "means,"
on the other hand, is beyond all dispute plural. What says Shakspeare?

  "Yet nature is made letter by no mean
  But nature makes that mean."

The plural was formed by the addition of "_s_:" yet from the infrequent
use of the word except in the plural, the singular form has become
obsolete, and the same form applies now to both numbers. Those who would
apply this reasoning to "News," forget that there is the slight
difficulty of the absence of the _noun_ "new" to start from.

I do not feel bound to furnish proof of so obvious a fact, that many of
the most striking similarities in language are mere coincidences. Words
derived from the same root, and retaining the same meaning, frequently
present the most dissimilar appearance, as "eveque" and "bishop;" and
the most distant roots frequently meet in the same word. When your
correspondents, therefore, remind me that there is a French word,
_noise_, I must remind them that it contains not one element of our
English word. Richardson gives the French word, but evidently discards
it, preferring the immediate derivation from "_noy_, that which noies or
annoys." I confess I do not understand his argument; but it was
referring to this that I said that our only known process would make a
plural noun of it. I have an impression that I have met with "annoys"
used by poetical license for "annoyances."

"Noise" has never been used in the sense of the French word in this
country. If derived immediately from the French, it is hardly probable
that it should so entirely have lost every particle of its original
meaning. With us it is either _a loud sound_, or _fame, report, rumour_,
being in this sense rendered in the Latin by the same two words, _fama,
rumor_, as News. The former sense is strictly consequential to the
latter, which I believe to be the original signification, as shown in
its use in the following passages:--

  "At the same time it was noised abroad in the realme"

_Holinshed_.

  Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies
  instantly.

_Ant. and Cleo._, Act i. Sc. 2.

  _Cre_. What was his cause of anger?
  _Ser_. The noise goes, this.

_Troil. and Cres._, Act. i. Sc. 2.

Whether I or your correspondents be right, will remain perhaps for ever
doubtful; but the flight that can discover a relationship between this
word and another pronounced[1] as nearly the same as the two languages
will admit of, and which gives at all events one sense, if not, as I
think, the primary one, is scarcely so eccentric as that which finds the
origin of a word signifying a loud sound, and fame, or rumor, in
"nisus"; not even _struggle_, in the sense of _contention_, an endeavour
an effort, a strain.

[Footnote 1: I do not think it necessary, here, to defend my
pronunciation of German; the expressions I now use being sufficient for
the purpose of my argument. I passed over CH.'s observation on this
subject, because it did not appear to me to touch the question.]

MORE BORROWED THOUGHTS.

  O many are the poets that are sown
  By nature men endowed with highest gifts,
  The vision and the facility divine,
  Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse,
  Nor having e'er, as life advanced, been led
  by circumstance to take the height,
  The measure of themselves, &c.

Wordsworth's _Excursion_, B. i.

This admired passage has its prototype in the following from the
_Lettere di Battista Guarini_, who points to a thought of similar kind
in Dante:--

"O quante nolili ingegni si perdono che riuscerebbe mirabili [in poesia]
se dal seguir le inchinazione loro non fossero, o da loro appetiti o da
i Padri loro sviati."

Coleridge, in his _Bibliographia Literaria_, 1st ed., vol. i. p. 28.,
relates a story of some one who desired {83} to be introduced to him,
but hesitated because he asserted that he had written an epigram on "The
Ancient Mariner," which Coleridge had himself written and inserted in
_The Morning Post_, to this effect:--

  "Your poem must eternal be
  Dear Sir! it cannot fail;
  For 'tis incomprehensible,
  And without head or tail."

This was, however, only a Gadshill robbery,--stealing stolen goods. The
following epigram is said to be by Mr. Hole, in a MS. collection made by
Spence (penes me), and it appeared first in print in _Terrae Filius_,
from whence Dr. Salter copied it in his _Confusion worse Confounded_, p.
88:--

  "Thy verses are eternal, O my friend!
  For he who reads them, reads them to no end."

In _The Crypt_, a periodical published by the late Rev. P. Hall, vol. i.
p. 30., I find the following attributed to Coleridge, but I know not on
what authority, as it does not appear among his collected poems:--

JOB'S LUCK, BY S. T. COLERIDGE, ESQ.

    "Sly Beelzebub took all occasions
    To try Job's constancy and patience;
    He took his honours, took his health,
    He took his children, took his wealth,
    His camels, horses, asses, cows,--
  Still the sly devil did not take his spouse.
    "But heav'n, that brings out good from evil,
    And likes to disappoint the devil,
    Had predetermined to restore
    Two-fold of all Job had before,
    His children, camels, asses, cows,--
  Short-sighted devil, not to take his spouse."

This is merely an amplified version of the 199th epigram of the 3d Book
of Owen:

  "Divitias Jobo, sobolemque, ipsamque salutem
    Abstulit (hoc Domino non prohibens) Satan.
  Omnibus ablatis, misero, tamen una superstes,
    Quae magis afflictum redderet, uxor erat."

Of this there are several imitations in French, three of which are given
in the _Epigrammes Choisies d'Owen_, par M. de Kerivalant, published by
Labouisse at Lyons in 1819.

STRANGERS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.

(Vol. ii., p. 17.)

As far as my observation extends, i.e. the last thirty-one years, no
alteration has taken place in the practice of the House of Commons with
respect to the admission of strangers. In 1844 the House adopted the
usual sessional order regarding strangers, which I transcribe, inserting
within brackets the only material words added by Mr. Christie in 1845:--

    "That the Serjeant-at-Arms attending this house do, from time to
    time, take into his custody any stranger or strangers that he
    shall see or be informed of to be in the house or gallery
    [appropriated to the members of this house, and also any
    stranger who, having been admitted into any other part of the
    house or gallery, shall misconduct himself, or shall not
    withdraw when strangers are directed to withdraw] while the
    House or any committee of the whole House is sitting, and that
    no person so taken into custody be discharged out of custody
    without the special order of the House.

    "That no member of the House do presume to bring any stranger or
    strangers into the house, or the gallery thereof, while the
    House is sitting."

This order appears to have been framed at a time when there was no
separate gallery exclusively appropriated to strangers, and when they
were introduced by members into the gallery of what is called the "body
of the house." This state of things had passed away: and for a long
series of years strangers had been admitted to a gallery in the House of
Commons in the face of the sessional order, by which your correspondent
CH. imagines their presence was "absolutely prohibited."

When I speak of strangers being admitted, it must not be supposed that
this was done by order of the House. No, every thing relating to the
admission of strangers to, and their accommodation in the House of
Commons, is effected by some mysterious agency for which no one is
directly responsible. Mr. Barry has built galleries for strangers in the
new house; but if the matter were made a subject of inquiry, it probably
would puzzle him to state under what authority he has acted.

Mr. Christie wished to make the sessional order applicable to existing
circumstances; and, it may be, he desired to draw from the House a
direct sanction for the admission of strangers. In the latter purpose,
however, if he ever entertained it, he failed. The wording of his
amendment is obscure, but necessarily so. The word "gallery," as
employed by him, can only refer to the gallery appropriated to members
of the House; but he intended it to apply to the strangers' gallery. The
order should have run thus, "admitted into any other part of the house,
or into the gallery appropriated to strangers;" but Mr. Christie well
knew that the House would not adopt those words, because they contain an
admission that strangers _are_ present whilst the House is sitting,
whereas it is a parliamentary fiction that they are _not_. If a member
in debate should inadvertently allude to the possibility of his
observations being heard by a stranger, the Speaker would immediately
call him to order; yet at other times the right honourable gentleman
will listen complacently to discussions {84} arising out of the
complaints of members that strangers will not publish to the world all
that they hear pass in debate. This is one of the consistencies
resulting from the determination of the House not expressly to recognise
the presence of strangers; but, after all, I am not aware that any
practical inconvenience flows from it. The non-reporting strangers
occupy a gallery at the end of the house immediately opposite the
Speaker's chair; but the right hon. gentleman, proving the truth of the
saying, "None so blind as he who will not see," never perceives them
until just as a division is about to take place, when he invariably
orders them to withdraw. When a member wishes to exclude strangers he
addresses the Speaker, saying, "I think, Sir, I see a stranger or
strangers in the house," whereupon the Speaker instantly directs
strangers to withdraw. The Speaker issues his order in these
words:--"Strangers must withdraw."

_Strangers in the House of Commons_.--As a rider to the notice of CH. in
"NOTES AND QUERIES," it may be well to quote for correction the
following remarks in a clever article in the last _Edinburgh Review_, on
Mr. Lewis' _Authority in Matters of Opinion_. The Reviewer says (p.
547.):--

"_This practice_ (viz., of publishing the debates in the House of
Commons) _which, &c., is not merely unprotected by law--it is positively
illegal_. Even the presence of auditors is a violation of the standing
orders of the House."

THE HYDRO-INCUBATOR.

Most, if not all, of your readers have heard of the newly-invented
machine for hatching and rearing in chickens, without the maternal aid
of the hen; probably many of them have paid a visit (and a _shilling_)
at No. 4. Leicester Square, where the incubator is to be seen in full
operation. The following extract will, therefore, be acceptable, as it
tends to show the truth of the inspired writer's words, "There is no new
thing under the sun:"--

    "Therefore ... it were well we made our remarks in some
    creatures, that might be continually in our power, to observe in
    them the course of nature, every day and hour. Sir _John
    Heydon_, the Lieutenant of his Majesties Ordnance (that generous
    and knowing gentleman and consummate souldier, both in theory
    and practice) was the first that instructed me how to do this,
    by means of a furnace, so made as to imitate the warmth of a
    sitting hen. In which you may lay several eggs to hatch and by
    breaking them at several ages, you may distinctly observe every
    hourly mutation in them, if you please. The first will be, that
    on one side you shall find a great resplendent clearness in the
    white. After a while, a little spot of red matter, like blood
    will appear in the midst of that clearness, fast'ned to the
    yolk, which will have a motion of opening and shutting, so as
    sometimes you will see it, and straight again it will vanish
    from your sight, and indeed, at first it is so little that you
    cannot see it, but by the motion of it; for at every pulse, as
    it opens you may see it, and immediately again it shuts, in such
    sort as it is not to be discerned. From this red speck, after a
    while, there will stream out a number of little (almost
    imperceptible) red veins. At the end of some of which, in time,
    there will be gathered together a knot of matter, which by
    little and little will take the form of a head and you will, ere
    long, begin to discern eyes and a beak in it. All this while the
    first red spot of blood grows bigger and solider, till at length
    it becomes {85} a fleshy substance, and, by its figure, may easily
    be discern'd to be the heart; which as yet hath no other inclosure
    but the substance of the egg. But by little and little, the rest
    of the body of an animal is framed out of those red veins which
    stream out all about from the heart. And in process of time,
    that body encloses the heart within it by the chest, which grows
    over on both sides, and in the end meets and closes itself fast
    together. After which this little creature soon fills the shell,
    by converting into several parts of itself all the substance of
    the egg; and then growing weary of so strait a habitation, it
    breaks prison and comes out a perfectly formed chicken."--Sir
    Kenelm Digby's _Treatise of Bodies_, Ch. xxiv. p. 274. ed. 1669.

Could Sir Kenelm return to the scenes of this upper world, and pay a
visit to Mr. Cantelo's machine, his shade might say with truthfulness,
what Horace Smith's mummy answered to his questioner,--

  "--We men of yore
  Were versed in all the knowledge you can mention."

The operations of the two machines appear to be precisely the same: the
only difference being the Sir Kenelm's was an experimental one, made for
the purpose of investigating the process of nature; while Cantelo's, in
accordance with "the spirit of the iron time," is a practical one, made
for the purposes of utility and profit. Sir Kenelm's Treatise appears to
have been first published in the year 1644.

ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "PARLIAMENT."

It has been observed by a learned annotator on the _Commentaries of
Blackstone_, that, "no inconsiderable pains have been bestowed in
analysing the word 'Parliament;'" and after adducing several amusing
instances of the attempts that have been made (and those too by men of
the most recondite learning) to arrive at its true radical properties,
he concludes his remarks by observing that

    "'Parliament' imported originally nothing more than a council or
    conference, and that the termination '_ment_,' in parliament,
    has no more signification than it has in _impeachment_,
    _engagement_, _imprisonment_, _hereditament_, and ten thouand
    others of the same nature."

He admits, however, that the civilians have, in deriving testament from
_testari mentem_, imparted a greater significance to the termination
"ment." Amidst such diversity of opinion, I am emboldened to offer a
solution of the word "Parliament," which, from its novelty alone, if
possessing no better qualification, may perhaps recommend itself to the
consideration of your readers. In my humble judgment, all former
etymologists of the word appear to have stumbled _in limine_, for I
would suggest that its compounds are "_palam_" and "_mens_."

With the Romans there existed a law that in certain cases the verdict of
the jury might be given CLAM VEL PALAM, viz., _privily_ or _openly_, or
in other words, by _tablet_ or _ballot_, or by _voices_. Now as the
essence of a Parliament or council of the people was its representative
character, and as secrecy would be inconsistent with such a character,
it was doubtless a _sine qua non_ that its proceedings should be
conducted "_palam_," in an open manner. The absence of the letter "_r_"
may possibly be objected to, but a moment's reflection will cast it into
the shade, the classical pronunciation of the word _palam_ being the
same as if spelt _PARlam_; and the illiterate state of this country when
the word Parliament was first introduced would easily account for a
_phonetic_ style of orthography. The words enumerated by Blackstone's
annotator are purely of English composition, and have no _correspondent_
in the dead languages; whilst _testament_, _sacrament_, _parliament_,
and many others, are Latin words Anglicised by dropping the termination
"_um_"--a great distinction as regards the relative value of words,
which the learned annotator seems to have overlooked. "_Mentum_" is
doubtless the offspring of "_mens_", signifying the mind, thought,
deliberation, opinion; and as we find "_palam populo_" to mean "_in the
sight of the people_," so, without any great stretch of imagination, may
we interpret "_palam mente_" into "_freedom of thought or of
deliberation_" or "_an open expression of opinion_:" the essential
qualities of a representative system, and which our ancestors have been
careful to hand down to posterity in a word, viz., _Parliament_.

"INCIDIS IN SCYLLAM, CUPIENS VITARE CHARYBDIM."

I should be sorry to see this fine old _proverb in metaphor_ passed over
with no better notice than that which seems to have been assigned to it
in Boswell's _Johnson_.

Erasmophilos, a correspondent of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ in 1774,
quotes a passage from Dr. Jortin's _Life of Erasmus_, vol. ii. p. 151.,
which supplies the following particulars, viz.:--

1. That the line was first discovered by Galeottus Martius of Narni,
A.D. 1476.

2. That it is in lib. v. 301. of the "Alexandreis," a poem in _ten_
books, by Philippe Gualtier (commonly called "de Chatillon," though in
reality a native of Lille, in Flanders).

3. That the context of the passage in which it occurs is as follows:--

      "-- Quo tendis inertem
  Rex periture, fugam? Nescis, heu perdite, nescis
  Quem fugias: hostes incurris dum fugis hostem.
  Incidis in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim."

where the poet apostrophises Darius, who, while {86} flying from
Alexander, fell into the lands of Bessus. (See _Selections from Gent.
Mag_. vol. ii. p. 199. London, 1814.)

C. FORBES.

This celebrated Latin verse, which has become proverbial, has a very
obscure authority, probably not known to many of your readers. It is
from Gualtier de Lille, as has been remarked by Galeottus Martius and
Paquier in their researches. This Gualtier flourished in the thirteenth
century. The verse is extracted from a poem in ten books, called the
"Alexandriad," and it is the 301st of the 5th book; it relates to the
fate of Darius, who, flying from Alexander, fell into the hands of
Bessus. It runs thus:--

  "-- Quo flectis inertem
  Rex periture, fugam? Nescis, heu perdite, nescis,
  Quem fugias; hostes incurris dum fugis hostem;
  _Incidis in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim_"

As honest JOHN BUNYAN, to his only bit of Latin which he quotes, places
a marginal note: "The Latin which I borrow,"--a very honest way; so I I
beg to say that I never saw this "Alexandriad," and that the above is an
excerpt from _Menagiana_, pub. 1715, edited by Bertrand de la Monnoie,
wherein may also be found much curious reading and research.

A NOTE OF ADMIRATION!

Sir Walter Scott, in a letter to Miss Johanna Baillie, dated October 12,
1825, (Lockhart's _Life of Sir W. S._, vol. vi. p. 82.), says,--

    "I well intended to have written from Ireland, but alas! as some
    stern old divine says, 'Hell is paved with good intentions.'
    There was such a whirl of laking, and boating, and wondering,
    and shouting, and laughing, and carousing--" [He alludes to his
    visiting among the Westmoreland and Cumberland lakes on his way
    home, especially] "so much to be seen, and so little time to see
    it; so much to be heard, and only two ears to listen to twenty
    voices, that upon the whole I grew desperate, and gave up all
    thoughts of doing what was right and proper on post-days, and so
    all my epistolary good intentions are gone to Macadamise, I
    suppose, 'the burning marle' of the infernal regions."

How easily a showy absurdity is substituted for a serious truth, and
taken for granted to be the right sense. Without having been there, I
may venture to affirm that "Hell is _not_ paved with good intentions,
such things being _all lost or dropt on the way_ by travellers who reach
that bourne;" for, where "Hope never comes," "good intentions" cannot
exist any more than they can be formed, since to fulfil them were
impossible. The authentic and emphatical figure in the saying is, "The
_road_ to hell is paved with good intentions;" and it was uttered by the
"stern old divine," whoever he might be, as a warning _not_ to let "good
intentions" miscarry for want of being realized at the time and upon the
spot. The moral, moreover, is manifestly this, that people may be going
to hell with "the best intentions in the world," substituting all the
while _well-meaning_ for _well-doing_.

THE EARL OF NORWICH AND HIS SON GEORGE LORD GORING.

As in small matters accuracy is of vital consequence, let me correct a
mistake which I made, writing in a hurry, in my last communication about
the two Gorings (Vol. ii., p. 65.). The Earl of Norwich was not under
sentence of death, as is there stated, on January 8, 1649. He was then a
prisoner: he was not tried and sentenced till March.[2]

The following notice of the son's quarrels with his brother cavaliers
occurs in a letter printed in Carte's bulky appendix to his bulky _Life
of the Duke of Ormond_. As this is an unread book, you may think it
worth while to print the passage, which is only confirmatory of
Clarendon's account of the younger Goring's proceedings in the West of
England in 1645. The letter is from Arthur Trevor to Ormond, and dated
Launceston, August 18, 1645.

    "Mr. Goring's army is broken and all his men in disorder. He
    hates the council here, and I find plainly there is no love
    lost; they fear he will seize on the Prince, and he, that they
    will take him: what will follow hereupon may be foretold,
    without the aid of the wise woman on the bank. Sir John
    Colepeper was at Court lately to remove him, to the discontent
    of many. In short, the war is at an end in the West; each one
    looks for a ship, and nothing more.

    "Lord Digby and Mr. Goring are not friends; Prince Rupert yet
    goes with Mr. Goring, but how long that will hold, I dare not
    undertake, knowing both their constitutions."

It will be observed that the writer of the letter, though a cavalier,
here calls him _Mr. Goring_, when as his father was created Earl of
Norwich in the previous year, he was _Lord Goring_ in cavalier
acceptation.

He is indiscriminately called Mr. Goring and Lord Goring in passages of
letters by cavaliers relating to the campaign in the West of 1645, which
occur in Carte's _Collection of Letters_ (vol. i. pp. 59, 60. 81. 86.).

A number of letters about the son, Lord Goring's proceedings in the West
in 1645 are printed in the third volume of Mr. Lister's _Life of Lord
Clarendon_.

The Earl of Norwich's second son, Charles, who afterwards succeeded as
second earl, commanded a {87} brigade under his brother in the West in
1645. (Bulstrode's _Memoirs_, p. 142.; Carte's _Letters_, i. 116. 121.)

Some account of the father, Earl of Norwich's operations against the
parliament in Essex in 1648, is given in a curious autobiography of
Arthur Wilson, the author of the _History of James I_., which is printed
in Peck's _Desiderata Curiosa_, book xi. part 5. Wilson was living at
the time in Essex.

An interesting fragment of a letter from Goring the son to the Earl of
Dorset, written apparently as he was on the point of retiring into
France, and dated Pondesfred, January 26, 1646, is printed in Mr. Eliot
Warburton's _Memoirs of Prince Rupert_, iii. 215.

Mr. Warburton, by the way, clearly confounds the father with the son
when he speaks of the Earl of Norwich's trial and reprieve (iii. 408.).
Three letters printed in Mr. W.'s second volume (pp. 172. 181, 182.),
and signed "Goring", are probably letters of the father's, but given by
Mr. Warburton to the son.

I perceive also that Mr. Bell, the editor of the lately published
_Fairfax Correspondence_, has not avoided confusion between the father
and son. In the first volume of the correspondence relating to the civil
war (p. 281.), the editor says, under date January, 1646,--

    "Lord Hopton in the meanwhile has been appointed to the command
    in Cornwall, superseding Goring. Also has been sent off on
    several negociations to France."

    Goring went off to France on his own account; his father was at that
    time Charles I.'s ambassador at the court of France.

I should like to know the year in which a letter of Goring the son's,
printed by Mr. Bell in vol. i. p. 23., was written, if it can be
ascertained. As printed, it is dated "Berwick, June 22." Is _Berwick_
right? Is there a bath there? The letter is addressed to Sir Constantine
Huygens, and in it is this passage--

    "I have now my lameness so much renewed that I cannot come to
    clear myself; as soon as the bath has restored me to my
    strength, I shall employ it in his Highness's service, if he
    please to let me return into the same place of his favour that I
    thought myself happy in before."

I should expect that this letter was written from France after Goring's
abrupt retreat into that country. It is stated that the letter comes
from Mr. Bentley's collection.

The Earl of Norwich was in Flanders in November 1569, and accompanied
the Dukes of York and Gloucester from Brussels to Breda. (Carte's
_Letters_, ii. 282.)

CH.

If the following account of the Goring family given by Banks (_Dormant
and Extinct Peerage_, vol. iii. p. 575.) is correct, it will appear that
the father and both his sons were styled at different times. "Lord
Goring," and that they may very easily be distinguished.

    "George Goring, of Hurstpierpont, Sussex, the son of George
    Goring, and Anne his wife, sister to Edward Lord Denny,
    afterwards Earl of Norwich, was created Baron Goring in the
    fourth of Charles I., and in the xx'th of the same reign
    advanced to the earldom of Norwich, which had become extinct by
    the death of his maternal uncle above-mentioned, S.P.M.

    "He betrayed Portsmouth, of which he was governor, to the king,
    and rendered him many other signal services. He married Mary,
    one of the daughters of Edward Nevill, vi'th Baron of
    Abergavenny, and had issue four daughters, and two sons, the
    eldest of whom, George, was an eminent commander for Charles I.,
    and best _known as 'General Goring_,' and who, after the loss of
    the crown to his royal master, retired to the Continent, and
    served with credit as lieutenant-general to the King of Spain.
    He married Lettice, daughter of Richard Earl of Cork, and died
    abroad, S.P., in _the lifetime of his father_, who survived till
    1662, and was succeeded by _his only remaining son_, Charles
    Lord Goring, and second Earl of Norwich, with whom, as he left
    no issue by his wife, daughter of ---- Leman, and widow of Sir
    Richard Beker, all his honours became extinct in 1672. He was
    unquestionably the Lord Goring noticed by Pepys as returning to
    England in 1660, and not the old peer his father, who, if
    described by any title, would have been styled 'Earl of
    Norwich.'"

QUERIES

JAMES CARKASSE'S LUCIDA INTERVALLA, AN ILLUSTRATION OF PEPYS' DIARY.

I met lately with a quarto volume of poems printed at London in 1679,
entitled:

    "_Lucida Intevalla_ containing divers miscellaneous Poems
    written at Finsbury and Bethlem, by the Doctor's Patient
    Extraordinary."

On the title-page was written in an old hand the native of the "patient
extraordinary" and author _James Carkasse_, and that of the "doctor"
_Thomas Allen_. A little reading convinced me that the writer was a very
fit subject for a lunatic asylum; but at page 5, I met with an allusion
to the celebrated Mr. Pepys, which I will beg to quote:--

  "Get thee behind me then, dumb devil, begone,
  The Lord hath eppthatha said to my tongue,
  Him I must praise who open'd hath my lips,
  Sent me from Navy, to the Ark, by Pepys;
  By Mr. Pepys, who hath my rival been
  For the Duke's[3] favour, more than years thirteen;
  But I excluded, he high and fortunate,
  This Secretary I could never mate; {88}
  But Clerk of th' Acts, if I'm a parson, then
  I shall prevail, the voice outdoes the pen;
  Though in a gown, this challenge I may make,
  And wager win, save if you can, your stake.
  To th' Admiral I all submit, and vail--"

The book from which I extract is _cropped_, so that the last line is
illegible. Can the noble editor of Pepys' _Diary_, or any of your
readers, inform me who and what was this Mr. James Carkasse?

MINOR QUERIES.

_Epigrams on the Universities_.--There are two clever epigrams on the
circumstance, I believe, of Charles I. sending a troop of horse to one
of the universities, about the same time that he presented some books to
the other.

The sting of the first, if I recollect right, is directed against the
university to which the books were sent, the king--

  "--right well discerning,
  How much that loyal body wanted learning."

The reply which this provoked, is an attack on the other university, the
innuendo being that the troops were sent there--

  "Because that learned body wanted loyalty."

I quote from memory.

Can any of your readers, through the medium of your valuable paper,
favour me with the correct version of the epigrams, and with the
particular circumstances which gave rise to them?

_Lammas Day_.--Why was the 1st of August called "Lammas Day?" Two
definitions are commonly given to the word "Lammas." 1. That it may mean
_Loaf-mass_. 2. That it may be a word having some allusion to St. Peter,
as the patron of _Lambs_.

O'Halloran, however, in his _History of Ireland_, favours us with
another definition; upon the value of which I should be glad of the
opinion of some of your learned contributors. Speaking of Lughaidh, he
says:--

    "From this prince the month of August was called Lughnas
    (Lunas), from which the English adopted the name _Lammas_, for
    the 1st day of August."

J. SANSOM.

_Mother Grey's Apples_.--At the time I was a little girl,--you will not,
I am sure, be ungallant enough to inquire when that was, when I tell you
I am now a woman,--I remember that the nursery maid, whose duty it was
to wait upon myself and sisters, invariably said, if she found us out of
temper--"So, so! young ladies, you are in the sulks, eh? Well, sulk
away; you'll be like 'Mother Grey's apples,' you'll be sure to come
round again." We often inquired, on the return of fine weather, who
Mother Grey was, and what were the peculiar circumstances of the apples
coming round?--questions, however, which were always evaded. Now, as the
servant was a Cambridge girl, and had a brother a _gyp_, or bedmaker, at
one of the colleges, besides her uncle keeping the tennis court there, I
have often thought there must have been some college legend or tradition
in Alma Mater, of Mother Grey and her apples. Will any of your learned
correspondents, should it happen to fall within their knowledge, take
pity on the natural curiosity of the sex, by furnishing its details?

_The Plant "Haemony_."--Can any of your readers furnish information of,
or reference to the plant _Haemony_, mentioned in Milton's _Comus_, l.
638.:--

  "--a small unsightly root,
  But of divine effect,...
  The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,
  But in another country, as he said,
  _Bore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil:_
  --More medicinal is it than that Moly,
  That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave;
  He called it _Haemony_, and gave it me,
  And bade me keep it as of sov'reign use
  'Gainst all enchantments," &c. &c.

The Moly that Hermes to Ulysses gave, is the wild garlick, [Greek: molu]
by some thought the wild rue. (_Odyss_. b. x. 1. 302.) It is the [Greek:
moluza] of Hippocrates, who recommends it to be eaten as an antidote
against drunkenness. But of _Haemony_ I have been unable to find any
reference among our ordinary medical authorities, Paulus Aeginata,
Celsus, Galen, or Dioscorides. A short note of reference would be very
instructive to many of the readers of Milton.

_Ventriloquism_.--What evidence is there, that _ventriloquism_ was made
use of in the ancient oracles? Was the [Greek: pneuma puthonos] (Acts,
xvi. 16.) an example of the exercise of this art? Was the Witch of Endor
a ventriloquist? or what is meant by the word [Greek: eggastrimuthos] at
Isai. xix. 3., in the Septuagint?

"Plutarch informs us," says Rollin (_Ancient History_, vol. i. p. 65.),
"that the god did not compose the verses of the oracle. He inflamed the
Pythia's imagination, and kindled in her soul that living light which
unveiled all futurity to her. The words she uttered in the heat of her
enthusiam, having neither method nor connection, and coming only by
starts, to use that expression [Greek: eggastrimuthos] from the bottom
of her stomach, or rather from her belly, were collected {89} with care
by the prophets, who gave them afterwards to the poets to be turned into
verse."

she conscious of the deception she practised?

they were believed to hold heterodox opinions in religion and politics;
but were their lives or their writings immoral?

"_that his aunt was a justice of peace, and his sister a captain of
horse_"? It is alluded to somewhere {90} in Swift's _Letters_ or
_Miscellanies_; and I was told by a person whose recollection, added to
my own, goes back near a hundred years, that it was supposed to be a
_political satire_, and may have been of Irish origin, as I think there
is some allusion to it in one of Goldsmith's plays or essays.

REPLIES

PUNISHMENT OF DEATH BY BURNING.

Probably some of the readers of "NOTES AND QUERIES" will share in the
surprise expressed by E.S.S.W. (Vol. ii., p. 6.), yet many persons now
living must remember when spectacles such as he alludes to were by no
means uncommon. An examination of the newspapers and other periodicals
of the latter half of the eighteenth century would supply numerous
instances in which the punishment of strangling and burning was
inflicted; as well in cases of petit treason, for the murder of a
husband, as more frequently in cases of coining, which, as the law then
stood, was one species of high treason. I had collected a pretty long
list from the _Historical Chronicle_ in the earlier volumes of the
_Gentleman's Magazine_, but thought it scarcely of sufficient importance
to merit insertion in "NOTES AND QUERIES." Perhaps, however, the
following extracts may possess some interest: one as showing the manner
in which executions of this kind were latterly performed in London, and
the other as apparently furnishing an instance of later date than that
which Mr. Ross considers the last in which this barbarous punishment was
inflicted. The first occurs in the 56th vol. of the Magazine, Part 1. P.
524., under the date of the 21st June, 1786--

    "This morning, the malefactors already mentioned were all
    executed according to their sentence. About a quarter of an hour
    after the platform had dropped, Phoebe Harris, the female
    convict, was led by two officers to a stake about eleven feet
    high, fixed in the ground, near the top of which was an inverted
    curve made of irons, to which one end of a halter was tied. The
    prisoner stood on a low stool, which, after the ordinary had
    prayed with her a short time, was taken away, and she hung
    suspended by the neck, her feet being scarcely more than twelve
    or fourteen inches from the pavement. Soon after the signs of
    life had ceased, two cartloads of faggots were placed round her
    and set on fire; the flames soon burning the halter, she then
    sunk a few inches, but was supported by an iron chain passed
    over her chest and affixed to the stake."

The crime for which this woman suffered was coining. Probably the method
of execution here related was adopted in consequence of the horrible
occurrence narrated by Mr. Ross.

In vol. lix. of the same Magazine, Part 1. p. 272, under the date of the
_18th of March_, 1789, is an account of the executions of nine
malefactors at Newgate; and amongst them,--

    "Christian Murphy, alias Bowman, for coining, was brought out
    after the rest were turned off, and fixed to a stake, and burnt,
    being first strangled by the stool being taken from under her."

From the very slight difference in dates, I am inclined to think that
this is the same case with that alluded to by Mr. Ross.

(Vol. i. p. 383.)

Your correspondent L.C. has started a most interesting inquiry, and your
readers must, I am sure, join with me in regretting that he should have
been so laconic in the third division of his Query; and have failed to
refer to, even if he did not quote, the passages from "late Greek," in
which "horns" are mentioned as a symbol of a husband's dishonor. The
earliest notice of this symbolical use of horns is, I believe, to be
found in the _Oneirocritica_ of Artemidorus, who lived during the reign
of Hadrian, A.D. 117-138:

[Greek: "Pepi de ippon en to peri agonon logo proeiraeiai. Elege de tis
theasameno tini epi kriou kathaemenpo, kai pesonti ex autou ek ton
euprosthen, mnaesteuomeno de kai mellonti en autais tais haemerais tous
gamous epetelein, proeipein auto hoti hae gunae sou porneusei, kai kata
to legomenon, kerata soi poiaesei kai outos apethae, k.t.l."--Artem.
_Oneirocritica_, lib. ii, cap. 12.]

See Menage, _Origines de la Langue Francoise_, Paris, 1650, in verb.
"Cornard." I have only seen Reiff's edition of Artemidorus, 8vo. Lipsiae,
1805. His illustrations of the passage (far too numerous to be quoted)
seem to be curious, and likely to repay the reader for the trouble of
examination. His note commences with a reference to Olaus Borrichius,
_Antiqua Urb. Rom. facies_:--

    "Alexander Magnus ....successores ejus..... in nummis omnes
    cornuti quasi Jovii, honore utique manifesto, donee cornuum
    decus in ludibria uxoriorum vertit somnorum interpres
    Artimidorus."

On which he observes,--

    "Bene. Nam ante Artimidorium nullus, quod sciam, hujus scommatis
    mentionem fecit. Quod enim Traug. Fred. Benedict. ad Ciceron.
    _Epist. ad Div._ 7.24. ad voc. 'Cipius' conjecit, id paullo
    audientus mihi videtur conjecisse."

I have not succeeded in obtaining a sight of this edition of the
Epistles. And I should feel much obliged to any one who would quote the
"conjecture," and so enable your readers to gauge its "audacity" for
themselves. Is it not odd that Reiff should have made no remark on the
utter want of connection between the "honor manifestus," and the
"ludibria" of Olaus? or on the [Greek: kata to legomenon] of the author
that he was illustrating? {91} Artemidorus may certainly have been the
first who _recorded_ the _scomma_; but the words [Greek: kata to
legomenon] would almost justify us supposing that

          "--The horn
  Was a crest ere he was born."

Menage (referred to above) evidently lays some stress on the following
epigram, as an illustration of the question:--

  [Greek: "Ostis eso purous katalambanei ouk agorazon,
  Keinou Amaltheias hae gunae esti keras."]

Parmenon. _Anthol._ lib. ii.

But I confess that I am utterly unable to see its point and therefore
cannot, of course, trace its connection with the subject. Falstaff, it
is true, speaks of the "horn of abundance," but then he assigns it to
the husband, and makes the "lightness of the wife shine through it."

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES

_Shipster_ (Vol. ii., p. 30.).--If C. B. will consult Dr. Latham's
_English Language_, 2nd ed., he will find that the termination _ster_ is
not merely a _notion_ of Tyrwhitt's, but a fact. Sempstress has a
_double_ feminine termination. _Spinster_ is the only word in the
present English which retains the old feminine meaning of the
termination _ster_.

_Three Dukes_ (Vol. ii., p. 9.).--I should like a more satisfactory
answer to this Query than that I given by C. (Vol. ii., p. 46.). I can
give the I names of _two_ of the Dukes (viz. Monmouth and Albermarle);
but who was the _third_, and where can a _detailed account_ of the
transaction be found? In Wades' _British History chronologically
arranged_, 3rd edit. p. 230, is the following paragraph under the date
of Feb. 28, 1671 (that is, 1670-1):--

    "The Duke of Monmouth, who had contrived the outrage on
    Coventry, in a drunken frolic with the young Duke of Albemarle
    and others, deliberately kills a ward-beadle. Charles, to save
    his son, pardoned all the murderers."

The date given in the _State Poems_ is Sunday
morning, Feb. 26th, 1670-71. Mr. Lister, in his
_Life of Edward, Earl of Clarendon_ (vol. ii. p. 492.),
alludes to the affair:--

    "The King's illegitimate son Monmouth, in company with the young
    Duke of Albemarle and others, kills a watchman, who begs for
    mercy, and the King pardons all the murderers."

_Bishops and their Precedence_ (Vol. ii., p. 9.).--I believe bishops
have their precedence because they are both _temporal_ and _spiritual_
barons. Some I years ago, I took the following note from the
_Gentleman's Mag_. for a year between 1790 and 1800; I cannot say
positively what year (for I was very young at the time, and
unfortunately omitted to "note" it):--

    "Every Bishop has a temporal barony annexed to his see. The
    Bishop of Durham is Earl of Sudbury and Baron Evenwood; and the
    Bishop of Norwich is Baron of Northwalsham."

Query, where may the accounts of the respective baronies of the
bishoprics be found?

_Why Moses represented with Horns_.--Your correspondent H.W. (Vol. i, p.
420.) refers the origin of what he calls the strange practice of making
Moses appear horned to a mistranslation in the Vulgate. I send you an
extract from Coleridge which suggests something more profound the such
an accidental cause; and explains the statement of Rosenmueller (p.
419.), that the Jews attributed horns to Moses "figuratively for
power:"--

    "When I was at Rome, among many other visits to the tomb of
    Julius II, I went thither once with a Prussian artist, a man of
    great genius and vivacity of feeling. As we were gazing on
    Michael Angelo's Moses, our conversation turned on the horns and
    beard of that stupendous statue of the necessity of each to
    support the other; of the superhuman effect of the former, and
    the necessity if the existence of both to give a harmony and
    _integrity_ both to the image and the feeling excited by it.
    Conceive them removed, and the statue would become _un_natural
    without being _super_natural. We called to mind the horns of the
    rising sun, and I repeated the noble passage from Taylor's _Holy
    Dying_. That horns were the emblem of power and sovereignty
    among the Eastern nations; and are still retained as such in
    Abyssinia; the Achelous of the ancient Greeks; and the probable
    ideas and feelings that originally suggested the mixture of the
    human and the brute form in the figure, by which they realised
    the idea of their mysterious Pan, as representing intelligence
    blended with a darker power, deeper, mightier, and more
    universal than the conscious intellect of man; than
    intelligence--all these thoughts passed in procession before our
    minds."--Coleridge's _Biographia Literaria_, vol. ii. p. 127.

[The noble passage from Taylor's _Holy Dying_, which Coleridge
recreated, is subjoined.]

    "As when the sun approaches towards the gates of the morning, he
    first opens a little eye of heaven, and sends away the spirits
    of darkness, and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark to
    matins, and by and bye gilds the fringes of a cloud, and peeps
    over the eastern hills, thrusting out his golden horns like
    those which decked the brows of Moses, when he was forced to
    wear a veil, because himself had seen the face of God; and
    still, while a man tells the story, the sun gets up higher, till
    he shows a fair face and a full light, and then he shines one
    whole day, under a cloud often, and sometimes weeping great and
    little showers, and sets quickly; so is a man's reason and his
    life."

_Leicester and the reputed Poisoners of his Time_ (Vol. ii., p.
9.).--"The lady who had lost her hair and her nails," an account of whom
is requested by your correspondent H.C., was Lady Douglas, daughter of
William Lord Howard of Effingham, and widow of John Lord Sheffield.
Leicester was married to her after the death of his first wife Anne,
daughter and heir of Sir John Robsart, and had by her a son, the
celebrated Sir Robert Dudley, whose legitimacy, owing to his father's
disowning the marriage with Lady Sheffield, in order to wed Lady Essex,
was afterwards the subject of so much contention. On the publication of
this latter marriage, Lady Douglas, in order, it is said, to secure
herself from any future practices, had, from a dread of being made away
with by Leicester, united herself to Sir Edward Stafford, then
ambassador in France. Full particulars of this double marriage will be
found in Dugdale's _Antiquities of Warwickshire_.

The extract from D'Israeli's _Amenities of Literature_ relates to
charges against Leicester, which will be found at large in _Leicester's
Commonwealth_, written by Parsons the Jesuit,--a work, however, which
must be received with great caution, from the author's well-known enmity
to the Earl of Leicester, and his hatred to the Puritans, who were
protected by that nobleman's powerful influence.

_New Edition of Milton_ (Vol. ii., p. 21.).--The Rev. J. Mitford, as I
have understood, is employed upon a new edition of Milton's works, both
prose and verse, to be published by Mr. Pickering. I may mention, by the
way, that the sentence from Strada, "Cupido gloriae, quae etiam
sapientibus novissima exuitur," which is quoted by Mr. Mitford on
Lycidas, Aldine edition, v. 71. ("Fame, that last infirmity of noble
minds"), is borrowed from Tacitus _Hist_. iv. 6. Compare _Athenaeus_, xi.

_Christian Captives_ (Vol. i., p. 441.).--There is an unfortunate hiatus
in the accounts of this parish from 1642 to 1679, which prevents my
stating positively the amount of the collection here made; but in 1670,
Jan 1., there occurs the following:--

    "Item. To Mr. Day for Copying ouer the fower parts that was
    gathered in the parish for the Reliefe of Slaues in Algiears - -
    - - 0 2 0"

Mr. Day was curate of Ecclesfield at that time; and in another part of
the book there is, in his handwriting, a subscription list, which,
though only headed "Colected by hous Row for the ..." is more than
probably the copy referred to. From it the totals collected appear to
have been,--

                  _s_.  _d_.
Ecclesfield        6    7-1/2

The above are the four byerlaws, or divisions of the parish, and the
four churchwardens used separately to collect in their respective
byerlaws; and then a fair copy of the whole was made out by the curate
or schoolmaster. An ordinary collection in church, upon a brief,
averaged 7_s_. 6_d_. at this period.

_Borrowed Thoughts_ (Vol. i., p. 482.).--The number of "NOTES AND
QUERIES" here alluded to has unluckily not reached me; but in Vol. ii.,
p. 30., I observe that your correspondent C., in correcting one error,
has inadvertently committed another. Monsieur de la Palisse is the hero
alluded to in the popular song which was written at the commencement of
the eighteenth century by Bernard de la Monnoye, upon the old ballad,
composed after the battle of Pavia, and commencing,--

  "Helas! La Palice est mort,
    Il est mort devant Pavie;
  Helas! s'il n'estait pas mort,
    Il serait encore en vie!"

_North Sides of Churchyards_ (Vol. ii., p. 55.).--A portion of many
churchyards is said to have been left unconsecrated, though not to be
used as playground for the youth of the parish, but for the burial of
excommunicated persons. This was {93} not, however, always on the north
side of the church, as is evident from the following extract from the
Register of Hart, Durham:--

    "Dec. 17. 1596, Ellen Thompson, Fornicatrix (and then
    excommunicated), was buried of e people in e chaer at the
    entrance unto e eate or stile of e churchyard, on the east
    thereof."

Nor is the north side of the church always the less favourite part for
burial. I could name many instances where this is the only part used.

The churchyard now within two hundred yards of me contains about an acre
of ground; the larger portion of which lies to the south of the church,
but has been very little used for sepulture till of late years, though
the churchyard is very ancient. Even now the poor have an objection to
bury their friends there. I believe the prejudice is always in favour of
the part next the town or village; that on the other side of the church
being generally called "the backside."

I find various notices of excommunicated persons being very strangely
buried, and in extraordinary places, but I have not as yet met with any
act or injunction on the subject. If any of your readers can supply such
a document, it would be extremely interesting and useful.

_Churchyards, Epitaphs_ (Vol. ii., p. 56.).--I beg to submit the
following observations in answer to the Queries under this head.

Fairs, and also markets, were held in churchyards until put a stop to in
1285 by an enactment in the 13 Edw. I. c. 6:--

    "E communde le rey e defend qe feire ne marche ne seient tenuz
    en cimeter pur honur de seint eglise."

Previous to the passing of this act, the king had forbidden the keeping
of Northampton fair in the church or churchyard of All Saints in that
town; and Bishop Grostete, following the monarch's example, had sent
instructions through the whole diocese of Lincoln, prohibiting fairs to
be kept in such sacred places. (See Burn's _Eccl. Law_, tit. "Church,"
ed. 1788.) Fairs and markets were usually held on Sunday, until the 27
Hen. VI. c. 5. ordered the discontinuing of this custom, with trifling
exceptions. Appended to the fourth Report of the Lincolnshire
Architectural Society is a paper by Mr. Bloxan on "Churchyard
Monuments," from which it appears that in the churchyards of Cumberland
and Cornwall, and in those of Wales, are several crosses, considered to
be as early as, if not earlier than, the twelfth century: that in the
churchyards of the Isle of Man are other crosses of various dates, from
the eighth to the twelfth century and that in some of the churchyards in
Kent, of which those of Chartham, Godmersham, and Godneston are
specified, there are remaining some of the most simple headstone crosses
that can be imagined, most of which the writer apprehends to be of the
twelfth or thirteenth century, though he adds, "there is no sufficient
reason why they should not be of later date." Several other instances
between the periods particularised are also given. The Report is not
published, but perhaps a copy might be obtained from the printer, W.
Edwards, Corn Market, Louth. See further the _Archaeological Journal_,
passim, and Mr. Cutt's work on _Sepulchral Crosses and Slabs_. The
privilege of sanctuary was taken from churchyards, as well as from all
other places, in 1623, by the 21 Jac. I. c. 28., which provides,

    "That no sanctuary or privilege of sanctuary shall be hereafter
    admitted or allowed in any case" (sec. 7.).

_Umbrella_ (Vol. i., p. 415; vol. ii., p. 25.).--Seeing that the Query
respecting this useful article of domestic economy has been
satisfactorily answered, may I be allowed to mention that umbrellas are
described by the ancients as marks of distinction. Pausanias and
Hesychius report that at Alea, a city of Arcadia, a feast called Scieria
was celebrated in honour of Bacchus, in which the statue of the rosy god
was carried in procession, crowned with vine leaves, and placed upon an
ornamental litter, in which was seated a young girl carrying an
umbrella, to indelicate the majesty of the god. On several bas-reliefs
from Persepolis, the king is represented under an umbrella, which a
female holds over his head.

_Chantrey's Sleeping Children_ (Vol. ii., p. 70.)--Your correspondent
PLECTRUM is anxious to know on what grounds I attribute to Stothard any
part of the design of the monument in Lichfield Cathedral known as
Chantrey's "Sleeping Children?" I will endeavour to satisfy him.

The design, suggested, as it were, by the very nature of the commission,
was communicated by Chantrey to Stothard with a request that he would
make for him two or three sketches of sleeping children, at his usual
price. What Stothard did, I have heard my father say, was very like the
monument as it now stands. The sketch from which Chantrey wrought was
given to me by my father a few months before his death, and is now
suspended on the wall of the room in which I write.

It is a pencil-sketch, shaded with Indian ink, and is very Stothard-like
and beautiful. It wants, however, a certain sculptural grace, which
Chantrey gave with a master feeling; and it wants the snow-drops in the
hand of the younger sister,--a touch of poetic beauty suggested by my
father.

The carver of the group (the person who copied it in marble) was the
late Mr. F.A. Lege, to whom the merit of the whole monument has been
foolishly ascribed.

I should be sorry to impress the world with the belief that I mean in
any way to detract from the merit of Chantrey in making this statement.
I have divulged no secret. I have only endeavoured to explain what till
now has been too often misunderstood.

PETER CUNNINGHAM.

The following statement may perhaps give to PLECTRUM the information he
requires.

Dining one day alone with Chantrey, in Jan. 1833, our conversation
accidentally turned upon some of his monuments, and amongst other things
he told me the circumstances connected with the monument at Lichfield to
the two children of Mrs. Robinson. As I was leaving Chantrey, I asked
him if I might write down what he had told me; his reply was,
"Certainly; indeed I rather wish you would." Before I went to bed I
wrote down what I now send you; I afterwards showed it to Chantrey, who
acknowledged it to be correct. It was hastily written, but I send it as
I wrote it at the time, without alteration.

Nicholson, the drawing master, taught Mrs. Robinson and her two
children. Not long after the death of Mr. Robinson, the eldest child was
burnt to death; and a very short time afterwards the other child
sickened and died. Nicholson called on Chantrey and desired him to take
a cast of the child's face, as the mother wished to have some monument
of it. Chantrey immediately repaired to the house, made his cast, and
had a most affecting interview with the unhappy mother. She was desirous
of having a monument to be placed in Lichfield Cathedral, and wished to
know whether the cast just taken would enable Chantrey to make a
tolerable resemblance of her lost treasure. After reminding her how
uncertain all works of art were in that respect, he assured her he hoped
to be able to accomplish her wishes. She then conversed with him upon
the subject of the monument, of her distressed feelings at the
accumulated losses of her husband and her two children, in so short a
space of time; expatiated upon their characters, and her great
affection; and dwelt much upon her feelings when, before she retired to
bed, she had usually contemplated them when she hung over them locked in
each other's arms asleep. While she dwelt upon these recollections, it
occurred to Chantrey that the representation of this scene would be the
most appropriate monument; and as soon as he arrived at home he made a
small model of the two children, nearly as they were afterwards
executed, and as they were universally admired. As Mrs. Robinson wished
to see a drawing of the design, Chantrey called upon Stothard, and
employed him to make the requisite drawing from the small model: this
was done; and from this circumstance originated the story, from those
envious of Chantrey's rising fame, that he was indebted to Stothard for
all the merit of the original design.

_Separation of the Sexes in Time of Divine Service_.--I note with
pleasure that traces of this ancient usage still exist in parts of
Sussex. In Poling Church, and also in Arundel Church, the movable Seats
are marked with the letters M. and W. respectively, according as they
are assigned to the men or women. On the first Sunday in the year I
attended service in Arundel Church, and observed, with respect to the
benches which were placed in the middle of the nave for the use of the
poorer classes, that the women as they entered proceeded to those at the
eastern end, which were left vacant for them, whilst the men by
themselves {95} occupied those at the western end. The existence of a
distinction of this kind in regard to the open seats only, affords
strong proof, if proof were necessary, that it was the introduction of
appropriated pews which led to the disuse of else long established, and
once general, custom of the men occupying the south side of the nave,
and the women the north.

_Error in Winstanley's Loyal Martyrology_.--Winstanley, in _The Loyall
Martyrology_ (London, printed by Thomas Mabb, 1665), p. 67., says of
Master Gerard, the author of that elaborate herbal which bears his
name--"This gallant gentleman, renowned for arts and arms, was likewise
at the storming of that (Basing) House unfortunately slain." According
to Johnson, who edited his Herbal in 1633, Gerard was born at Namptwich,
in Cheshire, in the year 1545; and died about 1607. Basing House was
stormed Oct. 1645: had Gerard served there, he would have been 100 years
old. It appears that Winstanley has confounded Gerard with his editor
Thomas Johnson above mentioned, who was killed during the siege of
Basing House, anno 1644. (See Fuller's _Worthies_, vol. iii. p. 422.
edit. 1840. London.)

E.N.W.


_Preaching in Nave only.--Prayers and Preaching distinct Services_--In
Ely Cathedral the old and proper custom of sermons being delivered in
the nave only is still maintained. And this observance has doubtless led
to the continuance of another, which is a sufficient answer to those who
object to the length of our service, as it shows that formerly in
practice, as still in principle, prayers and preaching were distinct
services. In the morning of Sunday there is no sermon in either of the
parish churches in Ely, but prayers only; and those of the respective
congregations who wish to hear a sermon remove to the cathedral, where
they are joined by the ecclesiastics and others who have "been to
choir". Consequently, any one may "go to sermon" (I use the language of
the place) without having been to prayers, or to prayers in one of the
parish churches, or the choir, without necessarily hearing the sermon.

I think it would be very interesting, if your widely scattered
correspondents would from time to time communicate in your columns such
instances of any variation from the now usual mode of celebrating divine
service as may fall under their _personal_ observation.

It has been frequently, more frequently, perhaps than justly, objected

upon the illustration of the works of the great dramatist. That the
Council would gladly publish works more immediately in connection with
Shakspeare and his writings, if the materials for them could be found,
is proved by the fact of their having just published the _Remarks of
Karl Simrock on the Plots of Shakspeare's Plays_, which that gentleman,
whose name is honoured by all lovers of early German poetry and romance,
appended to the third volume of the _Quellen der Shakspeare_, a
collection of Novels, Tales, &c., illustrative of Shakspeare, which
Simrock collected and translated in conjunction with Echtermeyer and
Henschel, and which somewhat resembles Mr. Collier's _Shakspeare's
Library_. The translation of these remarks, made for the Society, was
placed in the hands of Mr. Halliwell, and forms, with the notes and
additions of that gentleman, a volume containing much new and curious
information upon a very interesting point in Shakspearian literature.

Now Publishing, The Churches of the Middle Ages. By HENRY BOWMAN and
JOSEPH S. CROWTHERS, Architects, Manchester. To be completed in Twenty
Parts, each containing Six Plates, Imperial Folio. Issued at intervals
of two months. Price per Part to Subscribers. Proofs, large paper,
10_s_. 6_d_.; Tinted, small paper, 9_s_.; Plain, 7_s_. 6_d_. Parts 1 to
8 are now published, and contain illustrations of Ewerby Church,
Lincolnshire; Temple Balsall Chapel, Warwickshire; and Heckington
Church, Lincolnshire.

"Ewerby is a magnificent specimen of a Flowing Middle-Pointed Church. It
is most perfectly measured and described: one can follow the most
recondite beauties of the construction, mouldings and joints, in these
Plates, almost as well as in the original structure. Such a monograph as
this will be of incalculable value to the architects of our Colonies or
the United States, who have no means of access to ancient churches. The
Plates are on stone done with remarkable skill and distinctness. Of
Heckington we can only say that the perspective view from the south-east
presents a very vision of beauty; we can hardly conceive anything more
perfect. We heartily recommend this series to all who are able to
patronize it." --_Ecclesiologist_ Oct. 1849.

the illustration of similar Remains in England, by WILLIAM J. THOMS,
F.S.A., Secretary of the Camden Society. With numerous Woodcuts. 8vo.

"The best antiquarian handbook we have ever met with--so clear is the
arrangement, and so well and so plainly is each subject illustrated by
well-executed engravings.... It is the joint production of two men who
have already distinguished themselves as authors and
antiquarians."--_Morning Herald._

"A book of remarkable interest and ability.... Mr. Worsaae's book is in
all ways a valuable addition to our literature.... Mr. Thoms has
executed the translation in flowing and idiomatic English, and has
appended many curious and interesting notes and observations of his
own."--_Guardian._

"The work, which we desire to commend to the attention of our readers,
is signally interesting to the British antiquary. Highly interesting and
important work."--_Archaeological Journal._

has brought to light many points previously unknown, corrected many
errors, and shown such ample knowledge of his subject as to conduct it
successfully through all the intricacies of a difficult investigation,
and such taste and judgement as will enable him to quit, when occasion
requires, the dry details of a professional inquiry, and to impart to
his work, as he proceeds, the grace and dignity of a philosophical
history."--_Gent. Mag._

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
