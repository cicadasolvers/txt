PREFACE


1. MSS. AND EDITIONS.

The poem _The Bruce_, by John Barbour, is preserved in only two
manuscripts, one in the library of St. John's College, Cambridge,
and the other in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. The former is
hereafter denoted by the letter C, the latter by E. Of these E alone
is complete in the sense of having both beginning and end; the first
three Books and Book IV. 1-56 are missing in C. On the other hand, C
bears to have been completed in 1487, E in 1489. Other things being
equal, the earlier MS. must, of course, be preferred. Here, however,
intervenes a series of extracts, numbering 280 lines from Books I.
and II., embedded in Wyntoun's _Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland_, and
the two MSS. of the _Cronykil_ are actually older than those of _The
Bruce_. This raises a difficulty, as Wyntoun's extracts show a goodly
proportion of variations in language from the corresponding passages
in E, the only other MS. which covers the same ground. Professor Skeat
considers that Wyntoun's lines are "in a better form (in the main)"
than those of E;[1] but, on the other hand, we do not know Wyntoun's
method of working in such a case--how far he transcribed verbatim, how
far "he modified the language of the MS. which he must have had before
him."[2] Many lines he omits, and others he obviously paraphrases;
he incorporates matter from another source; and his version of _The
Bruce_ lines may quite well be due to memorial reproduction after a
hurried reading. It is not otherwise easy to account for scraps of
a few lines of the poem being here and there embedded in narrative
independently worded or derived. There is thus no warrant for erecting
this chopped-up, second-hand version of the lines in question into a
canon or standard for a purely scribal transcript made for its own
sake. It is needful to enter this plea in view of the separatist theory
of Mr. J. T. T. Brown, for whom the passages in Wyntoun represent so
much of the original or _ur_-Bruce, out of which our MS. and printed
versions have been elaborated by a fifteenth-century editor, who, to
do so, borrowed freely and with no great cunning from the works of
contemporary authors.[3]

The earliest printed versions of _The Bruce_ raise yet another issue
bearing on the purity of the text. The first is apparently of the year
1571, and only one copy is known to exist.[4] It does not, however,
differ materially from that of "Andro Hart" (H), published at Edinburgh
in 1616. In this the language is modernized; still more so is it in the
edition of four years later from the same publisher. And these seem
to have been the basis of the gradually worsening issues so common in
the eighteenth century, until in 1790 Pinkerton reverted to the sound
critical method of having a transcript made directly from the Edinburgh
MS. This again was the origin of Jamieson's more careful edition of
1820, reprinted with a few corrections in 1869. Meantime Cosmo Innes
had prepared for the Spalding Club (1856) a version which, for the
first time, introduced readings from the Cambridge MS., but which, in
being dressed up in a "consistent orthography," so far reverted to the
evil example of Hart. Subsequently, for the Early English Text Society,
and later, for the Scottish Text Society, Professor Skeat, basing on
C, but also utilizing E and H with a few readings from Wyntoun and
Anderson's issue of 1670, produced, for the first time, a full and in
all respects competent text. To Skeat's edition the present one is
essentially indebted.

[3] _The Wallace and The Bruce Restudied_, p. 74 and _passim_. See also
Appendices E, F.

[4] For a detailed account of the different editions see Skeat's
_Preface_ to the E.E.T.S. or S.T.S. issues.

The main point about Hart's edition (H) is that it supplies 39 lines
not found in either MS., with an expansion of two others into eight,
45 new lines in all. The expanded portion Skeat perforce relegates to
the footnotes. Twelve lines from Hart in the last book he at first
accepted as genuine, but finally discarded as an interpolation.[5] He
might justifiably have gone further, for he seems to me to have erred
in attaching undue importance to Hart's unsupported contributions.

[5] See Appendix D.

This is made clear by considering the question as between C and E. Each
MS. has portions not found in the other. The scribe of E furnishes
his own excuse; his copy was "hurriedly written" (_raptim scriptus_).
Consequently we are not surprised to find that he has dropped 81 lines
found in C. On the other hand, the more careful Cambridge scribe has
overlooked, as the best of copyists might, 39 lines preserved in the
Edinburgh version. Upon analysis of these two groups a satisfactory
test of character emerges. In one case only--C, Bk. VI. *85-*92, E,
Bk. VI. 101-106--do we find an unexplained confusion, traces of two
alternative accounts of one incident, a possibility to which Barbour
refers in several instances. One line from C Skeat rejects because it
results in a triple rhyme.[6] Having eliminated these, we find that of
the remaining omissions in E two lines are the result of the misplacing
of one;[7] eight lines are couplets which have been overlooked; four
lines are necessary to complete couplets, so that their loss is due
to sheer carelessness; while the bulk of the missing lines, 57 out of
80, is accounted for by the recurrence of the same word or words at
the beginning or end of the line, whereby the eye of the scribe has
run on from, _e.g._, "Toward the toun" in Bk. IX. *374 to "Toward the
toun" in 374, and from "thai fand" in Bk. XIII. 446 to "thai fand,"
in *450, missing all between. A parallel result is given by analysis
of the 39 lines wanting in C but present in E. Six are involved in
the mutual perplexity of Bk. VI.; one is merely a careless oversight,
and the remaining 32 come under the main category of omission through
recurrence, within a short space, of the same word or rhyme. On the
whole, then, with the reservation noted above, the condition of
things as between the two MSS. is quite normal; the omissions are
explicable on ordinary grounds, and as the missing lines, with but one
real exception, take their places again without disturbance of their
neighbours, we may conclude that C and E are individual versions of a
single original poem, and complementary to each other. But copyists
were only mortal; an author too might see cause to alter a MS.; and the
variations of reading, even with those of Wyntoun thrown in, after all
supply a less serious illustration of such possibilities than do the
MSS. of the _Canterbury Tales_ from the Ellesmere to the so disturbing
Harleian.

[7] VIII. *493, *495.

As for the lines found only in Hart's edition, their every feature
arouses distrust and suspicion. Skeat's judgment of "almost certainly
genuine" he has had to retract for 18 out of the total of 45, including
the eight-line version of a couple in the MSS.[8] Those on the
heart-throwing episode, Bk. XX. *421-*432, have been referred to above.
Not a single example of the remaining accretions meets the test of
repetition operative in the case of the MSS., or suggests its own
explanation. The couplet in Bk. II., p. 25, is nothing either way;
that on p. 283 is awkward; the intrusive lines on p. 321 are neither
sense nor grammar; those on pp. 215, 216 can find a place only by an
unwarrantable alteration of the succeeding line in both MSS., a liberty
which Mr. Brown, on purely speculative grounds, lightly accepts from
the very passage in question.[9] On the untimeous harangue into which
Bruce is made to pass on p. 239 I have spoken in its place. In general
it may be said that Hart's contributions are clear misfits. Moreover,
the circumstantial evidence seems to clinch the main conclusion.
Hart, or his editor, had a turn for rhyme: to him are due the rhyming
rubrics, and he added at the close of the poem a halting colophon of
six lines, which in the later corrupt editions was simply merged in the
poem, and is quoted as a specimen thereof in a critical historical work
of 1702.[10] In XX. 610 he has barefacedly substituted a line for that
of the MSS., which introduces a detail not found before the time of
Bower and no doubt taken from him.[11] This throws a strong light on the
origin of other lines in the same Book.[12] Thus we prove capability and
inclination. Hart "modernized" the language of _The Bruce_, and from
"modernization" to "improvement" is a tempting transition.

2. THE SCRIBES.

The Cambridge MS. bears witness that it was completed on August 18,
1487, by the hand of "John de R., chaplain"; the Edinburgh MS. that
it was "hurriedly written" by "John Ramsay" in 1489, for a Fife
vicar; and the latter signature is attached to the only MS. of _The
Wallace_, which accompanies that of _The Bruce_ but was transcribed
two years earlier. Skeat immediately pronounces that the names signify
but one person, that "John de R." is also "John Ramsay," apparently
on the logic of Wonderland, because both surnames begin with the
same letter.[13] Mr. Brown, however, points out that this equation
of alternative forms was highly improbable for fifteenth-century
Scotland, and substitutes a reading of his own whereby the scribes are
still merged in one personality as "John Ramsay" otherwise "Sir John
the Ross," one of Dunbar's _makars_, the real author of _The Wallace_,
and the wholesale redactor of _The Bruce_. The details of Mr. Brown's
argument and all that flows therefrom must be read in _The Wallace
and The Bruce Restudied_.[14] Mr. Brown (if I may say so) never fails
to be suggestive and interesting, and even the light which led him
astray was real critical illumination; but John Ramsay, who, "as a
chaplain"--which _he_ does not claim to have been--"was entitled to
the courtesy title of _Sir_,"[15] and took his alternative name from
his office as "Ross Herald or Ross Secretary";[16] who lightened the
toil of transcribing Acts of Parliament by dropping into verse on the
margin--an unjustifiable accusation;[17] and who, from the seed of
Blind Harry's "gests," raised the prickly bloom of _The Wallace_, and
grafted enough borrowed material on to the rough stock of the original
Bruce to make it something substantially different, and did all this
without leaving even a cipher as a hint to posterity--of this complex
and composite personage Mr. Brown is the only begetter, and his brief
and inglorious career may be followed in _The Athenaeum_, November
17-December 8, 1900, February 9, 1901. Mr. Brown, of course, can still
claim that the problem of late redaction remains, whoever the guilty
one may have been.[18] On this understanding I deal with it
elsewhere.[19]

[13] The Bibliography of the _Cambridge History of English Literature_,
vol. ii., recklessly says: "As the colophon informs us (!) all three
MSS. were written by John Ramsay" (p. 447).

[19] Appendix F.

For the MSS., it needs but a slight examination to show that they
are from different hands. The fifteenth century had no "consistent
orthography," but a scribe would probably have of himself; would
not, at the least, exhibit the systematic differences that mark the
MSS. in question. That the differences _are_ due to the scribes is
indicated by their occurrence even in proper names where E is, on the
whole, much more accurate than C.[20] Add that C offers more traces
of southern English influences; that it invariably gives the weak
form _I_ for the _Ic_ or _Ik_ of E, and substitutes _can_ for the
latter's _gan_; that it regularly prefers _of_ to the _off_ which
distinguishes E and in certain positions _i_ for _y_--these with other
minor peculiarities, not being vital in character, are certainly due
to individual idiosyncrasies in spelling. Ramsay is an honest scribe,
who, at places, cannot read his original, and leaves a blank which
must be supplied from the copy of the chaplain.[21] There is thus not
the faintest reason for supposing but one scribe to have been at work.
At the same time the essential agreement of the two transcripts shows
that we are dealing with a single, complete, familiar poem which has
suffered in precision of copying from the usual mishaps incident to its
manner of publication and preservation.

[20] And Koeppel, while granting the general superiority of C, gives as
his opinion that in not a few cases E, nevertheless, where it differs
from C, preserves the genuine, original reading (_Englische Studien_,
x., p. 377, note).

3. THE PRESENT EDITION.

The present edition of _The Bruce_ is based upon the printed text of
the Cambridge MS., collated throughout with that of E--that is, upon
the versions of Skeat and Jamieson. I have, however, adopted rather
more readings from E than does Skeat, also a few more from Wyntoun, and
offer some slight emendations--_e.g._, _luffys_ for _liffys_ in Bk. II.
527, _oft_ for _off_ in III. 194, _Fyn all_ for _Fyngall_ in II. 69,
etc. I have profited, too, by criticism of the published text as in the
adoption of Dr. Neilson's _corn-but_ in Bk. II. 438. The question of
Hart's version has been discussed above; it is valid only as a check
upon the MSS. Variants of any interest or importance are given in the
footnotes.

There has been no modernization of the language save in the case of the
rubrics, which are no part of the text proper and have been contributed
by the scribes or editors in order to facilitate the understanding
of the poem. I have thus adhered to the spirit while modifying the
letter of their work. But while avoiding any change in the language
of the poem or even any attempt at a uniform spelling, I have taken
a few harmless liberties with its alphabet and restricted certain of
the letters to their modern values, substituting for others a modern
equivalent. Skeat did this in the matter of the ancient "thorn" letter
= _th_. In consideration of the general reader, I have gone somewhat
farther, viz.:

1 The _s_ with the ornamental curl I read as merely _s_; Jamieson and
Skeat take it as, generally, = _ss_. But such alternative forms as
_Parys_,[22] _purches_,[23] and _purpos_,[24] on the one hand, and the
actual use of the tailed letter following the ordinary type in _dress_,
_press_,[25] fix the usage I have adopted.[26] There are a few
exceptions in which this letter is probably a contraction for
_is_--_e.g._, II. 366, 459.

[22] I. 345.

[23] II. 572.

[24] III. 287.

[25] XIV. 246; XVI. 253.

[26] _Cf._ also in Gregory Smith's _Specimens of Middle Scots_, p. xxx.

2. I have distributed their modern values to _i_, _j_, _u_, _v_, _w_.
There is no advantage in preserving such forms as _iugis_, _Evrope_,
_wndyr_: the hedge of the language--to use Lowell's simile--is prickly
enough without these accessories. Moreover, I have throughout written
_Edward_ for _Eduuard_ or _Eduard_ and _Inglis_ for _Ynglis_ (C).

3. As Skeat has substituted "_th_" for the "thorn" (þ), I have done
likewise with the ancient English _g_ ([yogh]), the "yok" letter,
resolving it into the digraph _yh_. As ultimately, in almost every
case, significant of the consonantal _y_, I might have simply
replaced it by that letter. But alternative forms, nearly without
exception, show the digraph, both in _The Bruce_ and in Wyntoun, giving
_yhe_, _yhet_, _yharnit_, _fenyhe_, etc., and in Wyntoun's extracts
_feyhnnyng_, _senyhoury_, _yhystir-day_, _bayhllys_, etc. Even with the
original letter the _h_ is added as often as not. Apparently the usage,
which had practically disappeared from the southern practice, was in a
transitional stage on its way to its full revival in later Scots, where
it became fixed, at the hands of the printers, as _z_, and survives in
such forms as _Cadzow_, _capercailzie_, etc.[27] In I. 16, however, it
has been read as _g_ in _forget_, though _foryhet_ is to be found in
_Ratis Raving_, and in XV. 75 it is obviously _z_ in _Fi(t)z-Waryne_.

[27] _Cf._ Murray's _Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland_, p.
*92; and _New. Eng. Dict._, G.

4. The placing of the capital letters and the punctuation are, of
course, modern.

Further, the poem in MSS. is not divided into Books, but paragraphs
are denoted by the insertion of a large capital; these, as in C, are
similarly marked in the text. The division into twenty Books was first
made by Pinkerton, and, as the most convenient, has been adopted by
Skeat in his editions. From Pinkerton also Skeat adopts the numbering
of the lines. Jamieson, however, made a division into fourteen Books
with a numbering to suit. Cosmo Innes gave up the Books in favour of
Cantos, with a fresh renumbering. To avoid confusion I have adhered
to Skeat's divisions and numbering, which are those of Pinkerton;
inconvenient though the duplicate numbers certainly are, a totally new
and fourth arrangement would be much more so. To break up and make more
accessible the matter, I have also introduced, where possible, the
paragraphs of Jamieson distinguished by spaces, some of these, however,
being found in C. They are merely for the convenience of the reader. I
may, perhaps, draw attention to the critical treatment of _The Bruce_
as an historic document without which we move greatly in the dark. The
historical notes of the early editors are few and superficial. Skeat
does not profess to deal with the work strictly on this line (_note_,
vol. ii., p. 224), though he does not fail to pass unnecessary censure
at several places. But some such examination as I have tried to make
seems necessary in the interests of Scottish historiography.

INTRODUCTION


1. "THE BRUCE" AS ROMANCE.

The literary relationships of _The Bruce_ may be briefly indicated. It
stands at the beginning of Scottish literature; of its predecessors
and contemporaries we have but the names, or possible versions whose
place of origin is in dispute. In form and technique, including the
octosyllabic couplet, it plainly depends on the French metrical
romance, the most fruitful branch of a literature which, for quite two
centuries, had been the mother of literatures in Western Europe. The
opening line of _The Bruce_ characterizes at once the poem itself,
and what was best and most abundant in the literature of the Middle
Ages. Barbour, too, it is never overlooked, announces his work as
a "romance," but as such, we gather from what precedes, only in a
technical sense; and no mediaeval writer would consider this popular
method of treatment incompatible with strict accuracy and reality of
subject: that is a modern refinement. Barbour certainly did not, nor
did those who followed and used him; his selection of the model is
simply the expression of his desire to do his work in "gud manere."
He anticipated Macaulay's ambition in that his history was to differ
from the most attractive literary matter only in being true. There were
already in French many examples of contemporary history presented in
this way as a succession of incidents on the lines of personal memoirs,
though history had in the end succeeded in widening its outlook, and
consequently found more fitting expression in prose. But that was of
Barbour's own age, and indeed Froissart had made his first essay, as an
historian, in verse, which later he recast and continued in the form
we know. All the necessities of Barbour's case, however, led him the
other way--the despised condition of the prose vernacular as a literary
medium, from which, indeed, it never fully emerged; the character of
his audience, which would be either learned or aristocratic; and the
nature and associations of his subject, for which only the literature
of romance could furnish a parallel or supply the appropriate setting.
The literary qualities of _The Bruce_ are, therefore, those of its
model; it is a clear, vivid, easy-flowing narrative, and if it is also,
as romances tended to be, loose in construction and discursive, it
is never tedious, for it deals with real persons and events of real
interest, depicted with an admiring fidelity.


2. JOHN BARBOUR.

The year of John Barbour's birth we do not know, an item which is
lacking also for Chaucer: 1320 is a good round guess. Nor have we any
knowledge of his family. If, however, the _St. Ninian_ in the _Legends
of the Saints_ be of Barbour, a claim for which there is much to be
said,[28] it may give us a clue. The adventure of Jak. Trumpoure,
there told, connects with the fact that Jaq. (James) Trampour had
land in Aberdeen bordering on that of an Andrew Barbour.[29] It may be
conjectured that the latter was John Barbour's father, or other near
relative, since the vivid personal details of the affair in the _St.
Ninian_ must have come from Trumpour himself, and the fact that he was
a neighbour of the Barbours would explain how.

The name Barbour (_Barbitonsoris_) is obviously plebeian. Some ancestor
followed the business of barber, as some one of Chaucer's possibly
did that of "hose-making." The established spelling, Barbour, shows
a French termination which takes also the form Barbier, whence Mr.
Henderson concludes that John Barbour "was of Norman origin."[30] But
the spelling is merely an accident of transcription; the oldest form is
Barber(e) (1357, 1365),[31] which the scribe of the Edinburgh MS. also
uses, and which Wyntoun rhymes with _here_ and _matere_; in a few cases
it is Barbar. As we might expect, the name was common enough in the
English-speaking districts of Scotland.

[28] See Neilson in _Scottish Antiquary_, vol. xi., p. 102 ff., and
Buss, _ex adverso_, in _Anglia_, Band ix., p. 495.

[29] Jamieson's _Memoir_, p. iv.

[30] _Scottish Vernacular Literature_, p. 41.

[31] For this reason Buss always gives the name as Barbere.

All our information about John Barbour, except the little to be
gleaned from the complimentary references of later authors, is drawn
from official sources,[32] and is thus, of course, perfectly precise,
but meagre and uncharacteristic. We learn something of what Barbour
did and got, but not what sort of man he was, or what he was like. By
1357, at the latest, he is Archdeacon of Aberdeen, the most important
official of the diocese after the bishop, having as his prebend the
parish of Rayne, in Garioch; and in the same year (August 13) he has
a safe-conduct to go with three scholars, for purposes of study, to
Oxford, where he may have seen John Wycliffe. There was, of course,
no University in Scotland as yet, and scholars desirous of academic
advantages had to seek them at least across the Border, a patronage
which Edward III., in his own interests, readily encouraged. Seven
years later he is again in England on a similar mission with four
horsemen,[33] and on October 16 of the year following he goes to St.
Denis, near Paris, this time with six companions on horseback; in
1368-69 he once more visits France "with two servants (_vallettis_)
and two horses." The University of Paris had the highest reputation
for the study of philosophy and canon law, and Barbour, whose duty it
was to administer the jurisdiction of his bishop, would necessarily
be something of a lawyer, though his allusion to the clerkly
"disputations" in this field does not suggest much personal interest in
legal refinements.

[32] These have been brought together by Skeat in his first volume, pp.
xv-xxv.

[33] Skeat here takes _equitibus_ to be "knights," but this is not a
military business. They were, we may judge, the attendants proper to
his rank.

His next appearance is in a different though related capacity. In 1372
he is clerk of the audit of the King's household, that of Robert II.,
who had come to the throne in the previous year as the first of the
Stewart Kings. The year after he is also an auditor of exchequer. The
Stewarts were good friends to Barbour, and we see the result in his
kindly, almost affectionate, references to the family in his poem.
He wrote up their genealogy, but that piece of work is lost. After a
long interval he reappears as an auditor of exchequer in 1382, 1383,
1384. For some part, at least, of this interval he was engaged upon
_The Bruce_, and its completion in the course of 1376[34] suggestively
approximates to a grant of L10, by the King's order, from the customs
of Aberdeen, first recorded in the accounts of March 14, 1377. So also
does a pension of twenty shillings sterling from certain revenues of
the same city, granted on August 29, 1378, to himself and his assignees
for ever.[35] Accordingly, two years later Barbour assigned his pension,
on his death, to the cathedral church of Aberdeen, as payment for a
yearly mass for his own soul and for the souls of his relatives and all
the faithful dead. The practice of these payments can be traced for a
considerable time afterwards, but the financial readjustments of the
Reformation sent Barbour's legacy elsewhere.

[34] See on Bk. XIII. 702.

[35] The account of 1429 is the first to state expressly that this
perpetual pension was "for the composition of the book of the deeds of
the erstwhile King Robert the Bruce" (_Excheq. Rolls_, iv., p. 520).

But the royal bounty had not dried up. In 1386 the poet had gifts
of L10 and L6 13s. 4d., no doubt in recognition of further literary
labours. And on December 5, 1388, he had a fresh pension of L10 for
life "for faithful service," to be paid in equal portions at Pentecost
and Martinmas. This he enjoyed for only a few years. On April 25, 1396,
the first payment of twenty shillings is made to the Dean and Chapter
of Aberdeen, so that Barbour must have been dead before April 5, 1395,
when the accounts for the year began. As his "anniversary" fell on
March 13, that date in 1395 was, in all probability, the day of his
death. Thus born under the great Bruce, he had lived through the reigns
of David II. and Robert II., and five years of Robert III.

Some stray notices of Barbour in other connections add nothing of
importance. One, however, lets us know that he was responsible for the
loss of a volume on law from the library of his cathedral.

We have really learned nothing as to the personality of the poet. That
he was a keen student and a great reader as well as a trustworthy
official, and stood high in the royal favour, may be inferred. The
respectful and admiring references of Wyntoun and Bower attest his
high reputation as a writer and authority on history. But _The Bruce_
of itself would suggest neither the cleric nor the accountant. His
pious reflections would be commonplaces even for a lay writer, and his
handling of figures is not in any way distinctive. Even of Scotland
in the background we get but casual, fleeting glimpses. Barbour is
occupied entirely with his heroes and their performances. It is these
he undertakes to celebrate, not, primarily, even the great cause which
called them forth; and personal loyalty is his master virtue.[36] That
he so conceived and developed his subject, his hurried passage from
incident to incident, his grim, practical humour, his impatience
of inaction or commonplace achievement, his actively descriptive
vocabulary, and his vivid realization of the details of movement
and conflict--all contribute to the impression of a man of lively,
energetic temperament, with a delight in action and the concrete,
and so, as his time and circumstances would make him, an amateur and
idealist of chivalry.

[36] "His theme was Freedom," writes Mr. Cosmo Innes. Barbour gives out
his "theme" in the first thirty-six lines, and never once mentions it.

Besides _The Bruce_, Wyntoun credits Barbour with _The Stewartis
Oryginalle_, a metrical genealogy starting from "Sere Dardane, lord
de Frygya"(!), which has not survived.[37] Skeat has also suggested,
basing on certain references by Wyntoun, that Barbour wrote a _Brut_
on the mythical colonization of Britain by Brutus, but the inference
is disputed by Mr. Brown,[38] and Wyntoun's language is too vague for a
definite opinion. On better grounds there has been attributed to him a
_Trojan War_ or _Troy Book_, portions of which have been used to fill
up gaps in a MS. of Lydgate's _Siege_ with the rubric, "Here endis
Barbour and begynnis the monk," and again conversely. An independent
MS. gives a larger number of lines in continuation. These fragments
have been subjected to close linguistic and metrical criticism by P.
Buss in _Anglia_, ix., pp. 493-514, and by E. Koeppel in _Englische
Studien_, x., pp. 373-382, and their reasoning on differences of verbal
and grammatical usages has been summarized by Skeat,[39] who concurs
with their conclusion against Barbour's authorship. But there are other
elements of evidence, and the sceptical discussion of Medea's alleged
astronomical powers with the affirmation,

  Bot na gude Cristene mane her-to
  Sulde gif credence--that I defend,[40]

is significantly similar to the argumentation on astrology in _The
Bruce_, Bk. IV. 706 to end.[41] Faced with the plain statement of the
fifteenth-century scribe, Skeat can only suggest that the poem was not
by our Barbour, but by another person of the same name--surely the
extremity of destructive literary criticism. And every argument of the
German scholars against the _Troy_ fragments would clinch the case
for Barbour's claims on the _Alexander_, with which I deal elsewhere.
The garrulous and dreary _Legends of the Saints_ probably contain, at
least, contributions by Barbour; even Buss admits peculiar features in
the _St. Ninian_,[42] and _St. Machar_ is a purely Aberdeen worthy, in
whom the poet, too, professes a special interest; these may well have
come from Barbour's pen as the uncongenial but meritorious labour of
his old age. Such, at any rate, was the normal progress of a poetic
clerk, from translation to original work, to decline at the close upon
versions of saintly biographies.

[37] The editor of _The Exchequer Rolls_, vol. ii. p. cv., says: "Bower
accuses Barbour of misrepresenting the origin of the Stewarts." That
is not so. According to the summary in Bower, Barbour had it that they
came from Wales, and in fact the family was settled in Shropshire
on the Welsh March. It had its origin, he said, from one who was
called "Le Fleanc de Waran," who may equate with Alan FitzFlaald,
who, however, apparently did not marry a daughter of Warine, the
sheriff of that county (Round, _Studies in the Peerage_, p. 116).
He affirms, rightly enough, that the first of them in Scotland was
Walter, in the days of King William (twelfth century). Where he goes
wrong genealogically, according to Bower, is in saying that Walter's
son, Alan, was in the First Crusade, which was obviously impossible;
but Alan FitzAlan, uncle of Alan FitzFlaald, was in that expedition.
Barbour was dealing with remote personages through family tradition,
and whatever his errors as represented by Bower, he does not appear,
as is too lightly assumed, to have been the source of the myths of
later historians in this connection. Bower's language does not admit of
a Banquo. See _Cupar and Perth MSS._, in _Scotichronicon_, Lib. IX.,
chap. xlviii.

3. HISTORIC VALUE OF "THE BRUCE."

A comparison of judgments on the value of _The Bruce_ as a contribution
to history plunges us into a thicket of contradictions. Green's verdict
that it is "historically worthless"[43] is but a petulant aside.
It repeats itself, however, in the pronouncement of Mr. Brown that
"in no true sense is it an historical document,"[44] but Mr. Brown
selects, as illustrative of this, examples, such as the Simon Fraser
identification,[45] and the Stanhope Park inference,[46] which recoil
to the confusion of the critic.[47] Mr. Cosmo Innes has sought to
discriminate, unfortunately upon wrong lines. Of Barbour as historian,
he writes: "Satisfied to have real persons and events, and an outline
of history for his guide, and to preserve the true character of things,
he did not trouble himself about accuracy of detail."[48] As it happens,
it is just in his outline--that is, in his dates and succession of
events--that Barbour may be adjudged most careless; his details contain
the most remarkable examples of his accuracy. The latest expression of
opinion on this head is not even self-consistent. In the _Cambridge
History of English Literature_ it is thus written of _The Bruce_:
first, that "it is in no real sense a history ... though, strange
to say, it has been regarded from his own time to this as, in all
details, a trustworthy source for the history of the period"--a clear
exaggeration;[49] and then a few pages farther on: "While Barbour's
narrative contains a certain amount of anecdotal matter derived from
tradition, and, on some occasions, deviates from the truth of history,
it is, on the whole, moderate, truthful, and historical"[50]--which is
quite another pair of sleeves.

[44] _The Wallace and The Bruce_, p. 93.

[45] See on II. 239.

[46] XIX. 486.

[47] An article on Barbour's _Bruce_ in the _Saturday Review_, 1872,
vol. xxxiii., p. 90, has all the marks of the "belabouring" method
of Professor Freeman. Barbour's "historical value," it is affirmed,
"is as low as value can be," and there are intermittent shrieks of
"shameless falsehood," "conscious liar," etc. The usual play is made
with the supposed identification of the two Bruces, and it is declared
that on this "the whole story hangs," which, in its own way, is a
statement just as unwarranted and absurd. It is easy to fix on the
error as to Edward being in the Holy Land when the question arose as
to the succession, and the antedating of his death. But the critic,
with full opportunity for being correct, can sin as to dates quite as
egregiously. "In authentic history," he says, "somewhat more than three
years passed between the death of Alexander III. in Lent, 1289, and the
coronation of John Balliol on St. Andrew's Day, 1292." Quite wrong.
In "authentic history" Alexander was killed on March 19, 1286 (1285
by old reckoning). This is a criticism of Barbour's "six years" in I.
39! He objects to the statement that the Queen was put "in prison,"
because she was entertained in one of her husband's manors. But she
is always officially spoken of as "in custody," and the stone walls
of a manor even make a good enough prison. This is mere carping, and
most of the rest is of the same sort, where it does not depend on a
forcing or misunderstanding of the text. Barbour, he complains, makes
the difference between Bruce and Balliol "one between male and female
succession." So, in a sense, it was (see on I. 54), but the critic has
not taken the trouble to understand how. Barbour, however, is certainly
confusing.

The fact is that these wayward judgments rest upon too narrow a
basis of induction, and that induction, too, usually irrelevant or
uncertain--considerations as to the nature of Romance, Barbour's
literary awkwardness and literary dressing, with inadequate examination
of the external evidence. But if Barbour professes to write history,
as he does profess, and as he gives every evidence of honestly trying
to do, he can surely claim to be tried by the appropriate tests--those
of official records or other contemporary accounts, and, in the last
resource, by his performance so far as these carry us, and by an
estimate of the probable sources of what is peculiar to himself. Nor
must the quality of his critical equipment be overlooked; he frankly
lets us know that of certain incidents different versions were in
circulation--some said that the fatal quarrel between Bruce and Comyn
fell otherwise than as he has related, and he includes the divergent
accounts of how Bruce and his man escaped the hound; and there are
other matters for which, lacking certainty himself, he is content to
cite popular report. Towards prevailing and attractive superstitions,
necromancy, astrology, and the like, his attitude is bluntly sceptical;
yet an apparently well-attested case of prophecy--not one, it must
be owned, exhibiting any exceptional degree of penetration--he does
record, with very distinct reservation of judgment.[51] There is no
supernatural machinery in _The Bruce_, no visions, miraculous agencies,
or other such distractions: for these we must go to sober prose. But
such is not the manner of popular romance with which it has been
usual to class the manner of _The Bruce_. Barbour is not writing a
conventional romance with historic persons and incidents for his
material; he is writing history which has all the qualities of romance
in real life. Of the same type were the exploits of Edward Bruce, which
of themselves, he says, would furnish material for many romances.[52]

So comes it, then, that a careful and most competent investigator like
Joseph Bain can authoritatively pronounce _The Bruce_ to be "of the
highest value for the period,"[53] and affirm that "in these details
he is almost always correct, with occasional errors in names."[54]
Barbour's errors, indeed, lie on the surface, and are typical of his
time, not wilful perversions on his part--events are transposed, wrong
dates given, figures almost always exaggerated. On the other side a
study of the notes to the present volume will show how trustworthy he
is in the main, and, repeatedly, how strikingly and minutely accurate.
His profession to tell a truthful story, so far as his knowledge will
take him, must be accepted as fully borne out.

[51] Bk. IV. 767-774. Contempt for astrology, indeed, had already gone
pretty far--Chaucer's _Franklin_ has it (_F.s'_ Tale); but the contrary
opinion still held most ground, and prophecy was in the enjoyment of
full respect. Theological authority was divided and uncertain on the
matter.

Moreover the reflection is forced upon us at many points that, in
addition to the oral accounts of which he makes use, those of actual
participators like Sir Allan of Cathcart, and John Thomson for the
Irish campaigns, besides relations and reminiscences otherwise derived,
Barbour had various contemporary writings at his command. Such was
certainly the case with Sir Thomas Gray, who wrote, a prisoner in
Edinburgh Castle, twenty years before. His _Scalacronica_ embodies
the results of research in the library of his prison where he found
Scottish chronicles in verse and prose, in Latin, French, and English,
and he expressly refers to such chronicles in his account of Bruce,
letting us know that there was in existence a description of the
Battle of Bannockburn, and, incidentally, that Barbour even has not
exhausted the fund of stories of adventure told of the fugitive King.
More curious and suggestive is the citation, in the bye-going, by Jean
le Bel, Canon of Liege, of a "history made by the said King Robert"
(_en hystoire faitte par le dit roy Robert_), that is the King Robert
whom, he tells us, Edward I. had chased by hounds in the forests.[55]
It is an allowable inference that these accessible materials were
known to the learned and inquiring Barbour, when he took to deal with
a subject familiar to him from his earliest years, and so congenial to
his instincts, literary and national.

It is worth noting that Sir Walter Scott, on the publication of the
_Lord of the Isles_, which draws so handsomely upon _The Bruce_,
was accused of a lack of proper patriotism, meaning the pungent and
rather aggressive patriotism of a long-irritated Scotland distinctive
of _The Wallace_ and certain subsequent productions, but not of _The
Bruce_, the spirit of which, too, was in harmony with that of the great
reviver of romance. There is no malice in _The Bruce_; the malice and
bitterness are in the contemporary war-literature of the other side.
And Barbour is no sentimentalist; his patriotism is not pretentious
or exclusive, nor such as leads him to depreciate an opponent, and
is therefore not a distorting influence on facts, as Mr. Henderson
postulates it must have been.[56] It is not possible to point to a
single error on Barbour's part which is fairly traceable to this cause.
And his faults and errors, such as they are, may be paralleled over and
over again from the most reputable of that century's historians, to say
nothing of those who, in later times, had to weave their web from less
tangled and broken material.

Thocht he be nevir sa wys na wycht,
For wyt, worschip, price, na renoun,

Then with a will till him thai yhede;
And ane him by the bridill hynt:
But he raucht till him sic a dynt,

With that ane othir gan him ta

Went his way, but mar letting,
And left his brothir with the King.

That wes joyfull off this tithing:
For he wend thai had all bene slayne.
Tharfor he turnyt in hy agayne,
And wan Mantrybill and passit Flagot;                                455

And tharfor venesoun to get
In twa partys ar thai gayne.

And Schir James off Dowglas                                          475

And huntyt lang quhill off the day;
And soucht schawys, and setis set;
Bot thai gat litill for till ete.                                    480
Then hapnyt at that tyme percas,
That the Erle of the Levenax was
Amang the hillis ner tharby;
And quhen he hard sa blaw and cry,
He had wondir quhat it mycht be;                                     485
And on sic maner spyryt he,
That he knew that it wes the King
And then, for-owtyn mar duelling,
With all thaim off his company,
He went rycht till the King in hy,                                   490
Sa blyth and sa joyfull, that he
Mycht on na maner blyther be.
For he the King wend had bene ded;
And he wes alsua will off red,
That he durst rest in-to na place                                    495
Na, sen the King discumfyt was
At Meffan, he herd nevir thing
That evir wes certane off the King.
Tharfor in-to full gret daynte,
The King full humyly haylsit he;                                     500
And he him welcummyt rycht blythly,
And kyssyt him full tendirly.
And all the lordis, that war thar,
Rycht joyfull off thar meting war,
And kyssyt him in gret daynte.                                       505

  Thocht I say that thai gret, sothly

And weyt the eyne on sic avys,
That it is lik to be greting,
Thocht it to be nocht sua in all thing.
For quhen men gretis enkrely,
The hart is sorowfull or angry.                                      530

Off rewth that in it closyt is.

And with glaid hart it thaim gaiff he;
And thai eyt it with full gud will,
That soucht nane othir sals thar-till                                540

For rycht weill scowryt war thar stomakys.

And till our Lord syne lovyng maid,
And thankit him, with full gud cher,                                 545

And tauld thaim petwisly agayne
The noy, the travaill, and the payne,
That he had tholyt, sen he thaim saw.                                555

And thame full manly governit thai;
Till on the tend day at the King,                                    460
With all that war in his ledyng,
Arivit in-to that cuntre,
With thretty small galais and thre.
The King arivit in Arane;                                            464
And syne to the land is gane,

Giff ony man couth tell tithand                                      468

"Of strange men I can yhow say,
"That ar cumin in this cuntre,                                       472

Followand hir as scho thame led,

  The Kyng, that herd all hir carpyng,                               668
Than thankit hir in mekill thing;
For scho confortit hym sumdeill:
The-quhethir he trowit nocht full weill
Hir spek, for he had gret ferly                                      672
How scho suld wit it sekirly:
As it wes wounderfull, perfay,
How ony man throu steris may
Knaw the thingis that ar to cum                                      676
Determinabilly, all or sum,
Bot gif that he enspirit war
Of him, that all thing evirmar
Seis in his presciens,                                               680
*As it war ay in his presens:
As David wes, and Jeromy,
Samuell, Joell, and Ysay,
That throu his haly grace can tell
Feill thingis that eftirward befell.                                 684
Bot thai prophetis so thyn ar sawin,
That nane in erd now is knawin.
Bot feill folk ar sa curious,
And to wit thingis sa covatous,                                      688
That thai, throu thair gret clergy,
Or ellis throu thair devilry,
On thir twyn maners makis fanding
Of thingis to cum to haf knawing.                                    692
Ane of thame is astrology,
Quhar-throu clerkis, that ar witty,
May knaw conjunctione of planetis,
And quhethir that thair cours thaim settis                           696
In soft segis, or in angry;
And of the hevyn all halely
How that the disposicioune
Suld apon thingis wirk heir doune,                                   700
On regiones, or on climatis,
That wirkis nocht ay-quhar a-gatis,
Bot sum ar les, sum othir mair,
Eftir as thair bemys strekit air,                                    704
Owthir all evin, or on wry.
Bot me think it war gret mastry
Till ony astrolog to say
This sall fall heir, and on this day.                                708
For thouch a man his liff haly
Studeit swa in astrology,
That on the sternis his hed he brak,
Wis men sais he suld nocht mak,                                      712
His liftyme, certane domys thre;
And yheit suld he ay dout quhill he
Saw how that it com till ending:
Than is thar na certane demyng.                                      716
Or gif thai men that will study
In the craft of astrology,
Knaw all mennis nacioune,
And als the constillacioune                                          720
That kyndly maneris giffis thaim til,
For till inclyne to gud or ill;
How that thai throu craft of clergy,
Or throu slicht of astrology,                                        724
Couth tell quhatkyn perell apperis
To thame that haldis kyndly maneris;
I trow that thai suld faill to say
The thingis that thame happyn may.                                   728
For quhethir sa men inclynit be
Till vertu or to mavite,
He may richt weill refrenyhe his will,
Outhir throu nurtour or throu skill,                                 732
And to the contrar turne him all.
And men has mony tymis seyn fall,
That men, kyndly to ivill giffin,
Throu thair gret wit away has drivin                                 736
Thair evill, and worthyn of gret renoune,
Magre the constillacioune.
As Arestotill, gif, as men redis,
He had followit his kyndly dedis,                                    740
He had beyn fals and covatous;
Bot his wit maid him virtuous.
And syn men may on this kyn wis
Wirk agane that cours, that is                                       744
Principal caus of thair demyng,
Me think thair dome na certane thing.
  Nigramansy ane othir is,
That kennys men on syndry wis,                                       748
Throw stalward conjuraciones,
And throw exorcizaciones,
To ger spiritis to thame apeir,
And gif ansuer on seir maneir.                                       752
As quhilom did the Phitones,
That, quhen Saull abasit wes
Of the Philistianis mycht,
Rasit, throu hyr mekill slycht,                                      756
Samuelis sperit als tit,
Or in his sted the evill spirit,
That gaf rycht graith ansueir hir to.
Bot of hir-self rycht nocht wist scho.                               760
And man is in-to dreding ay
Of thingis that he has herd say,
And namly of thingis to cum, quhill he
Have of the end the certante.                                        764
And sen thai ar in sic wenyng,
Fourouten certane witting,
Me think, quha sayis he knawis thingis
To cum, he makis gret gabbingis.                                     768
Bot quhethir scho that tald the King
How his purpos suld tak ending,
Wenit, or wist it witterly;
It fell eftir all halely                                             772
As scho said: for syne king wes he,
And of full mekill renomme.

Of the King's Handseling in Carrick at his First Arrival.

This wes in vere, quhen wyntir tyde,
With his blastis hydwis to byde,

And for to mak in thair synging

And melody plesande to here.                                           8

To wyn the heling of thar hevede.

And all grevis begouth to spryng.
In-to that tyme the nobill King,
With his flot and a few menyhe,
Thre hundir I trow thai mycht weill be,                               16

  Thai rowit fast with all thar mycht,
Till that apon thame fell the nycht,                                  20
That it wox myrk on gret maner,
Swa that thai wist nocht quhar thai wer.
For thai na nedill had na stane;
Bot rowyt alwayis in-till ane,                                        24
Stemmand alwayis apon the fyre,
That thai saw byrnand licht and schire.
It wes bot aventur that thame led:
And thai in schort tym swa thame sped,                                28
That at the fyre arivit thai,
And went to land but mair delay.
And Cuthbert, that has seyn the fyre,
Wes full of angir and of ire,                                         32
For he durst nocht do it away;
And he wes alsua doutand ay
That his lord suld pas the se.
Tharfor thair cummyng watit he,36
And met thame at thair ariving.
He wes weill soyne brocht to the King,
That sperit at hym how he had done.
And he with sair hert tald him sone,                                  40
How that he fand nane weill willand,
Bot all war fais that evir he fand:
And at the lord the Persy,
With neir thre hundreth in cumpany,                                   44
Was in the castell thar besyde,
Fulfillit of dispit and pride.
Bot mair than twa part of his rowt
War herbreit in the toune tharout;                                    48
"And dispisis yhow mair, Schir King,
"Than men may dispis ony thing."
Than said the Kyng, in full gret ire,
'Tratour, quhy maid thou on the fyre?'                                52
"A! Schir," said he, "sa God me se!
"That fyre wes nevir maid on for me.
"Na, or this nycht, I wist it nocht;
"Bot fra I wist it, weill I thocht                                    56
"That yhe, and haly yhour menyhe,

[25: E _Sterand all tyme_.]

[27: E omits _that_, and with _aventur_ accented as in line 69 it
seems superfluous.]

  The King wes of his spek angry,
And askit his preve men in hy,
Quhat at thame thocht wes best to do.
Schir Edward ferst answerd thar-to,                                   64
His brothir that wes so hardy,
And said: "I say yhow sekirly
"Thar sall na peralis that may be,
"Dryve me eftsonis to the se.                                         68
"Myne aventure heir tak will I,
"Quhethir it be eisfull or angry."
'Brothir,' he said, 'sen thou will sa,

Here the King secretly enters the Town and slays All.

  Quhen this wes said thai went thare way;
And till the toun soyn cumin ar thai,
Sa prevely, bot noys making,
That nane persavit thair cummyng.                                     92
Thai scalyt throu the toune in hy,
And brak up dures sturdily,
And slew all that thai mycht ourtak:
And thai that na defens mycht mak,                                    96
Full pitwisly couth rair and cry;
And thai slew thame dispitwisly,
As thai that war in-to gud will
To venge the angir and the ill,                                      100

And throu the myrknes of the nycht.

  In the castell the lorde Persy
Herd weill the noyis and the cry:                                    108
Sa did the men, that with-in wer,
And full effraytly gat thair ger.
But off thaim wes nane sa hardy,
That evir ischyt fourth to the cry.                                  112
In sic afray thai baid that nycht,
Till on the morn that day wes licht:
And than cesit in-to party
The noyis, slauchtir, and the cry.                                   116
The King gert be departit then
All haill the reif amang his men;
And duelt all still thair dais thre.
Sic hansell to the folk gaf he,                                      120

A Certain Lady, a Relative of the King, comes to him with Forty Men.

  Qwhen at the King and his folk ware
Arivit, as I tald yhow are,                                          124

With fourty men in cumpany,
And betacht thame all to the King,
To help hym in his warrayng.                                         140
And he resavit thame in daynte,

To stynt bettir his fayis mycht.                                     184
In all that tym wes the Persy,
With a full sympill cumpany,
In Turnberyis castell lyand;
For the King Robert sua dredand,                                     188
That he durst nocht ysche out to fair,
Fra thine to the castell of Air,
That than wes full of Inglismen;
Bot lay lurkand as in a den,                                         192

Now in Ingland is the Persy,
Quhar he, I trow, a quhill sall ly,
Or that he schap hym for to fair
To warray Carrik ony mar.                                            220
For he wist that he had no richt;
And als he dred the Kyngis mycht,

Quhar the mast strynth wes of the land.                              224

The presoners has tane alsone;
And with thame of his cumpany
Towart the castell went in hy,                                       376

On this maner distroit he.                                           396
All the vittale outakin salt,
As quhet, flour, meill and malt,
In the wyne-sellar gert he bryng;
And sammyn on the flure all flyng.                                   400
And the presoners that he had tane
Richt tharin gert he hed ilkane;
Syne of the tunnys the hedis out-strak:
A foull melle thair can he mak.                                      404
For meill, malt, blude, and wyne,
Ran all to-gidder in a mellyne
That wes unsemly for to se;
Tharfor the men of that cuntre                                       408
For sic thingis thar mellit were,
Callit it "the Douglas Lardenere."
Syne tuk he salt, as I herd tell,
And ded hors, and fordid the well;                                   412

And lay still in the castell than,
Till he gat spering at a man
Of Carrik, that wes sle and wicht,

  Now, bot God help the nobill King,

With thai wordis, forouten hoyn,

For the tratouris wes neir cumand.                                   604
The fader had a suerd but mair,
The tothir bath suerd and hand-ax bair,
The thrid a suerd had and a speir.

'A! Schir, umbethinkis yhow,' said he,
'How neir to yhow that I suld be;

A gyrd rycht to the King can mak,
And with the ax he him ourstrak.
Bot he, that had his suerd on hicht,
Raucht him sic rout in randoun richt.                                632

Saw his brothir sa fallin ther,                                      636

Defendand him full douchtely,                                        240
Till in the crag he clam sum-deill;
And fand a place enclosit weill,
Quhar nane but ane mycht him assale.
Thair stude he and gaf thame battale:                                244
And thai assalit evirilkane;
And oft fell, quhen that he slew ane,
As he doun to the erd wald driff,
He wald beir doun weill four or fiff.                                248
Thair stude he and defendit swa,
Till he had slane thame half and ma.
A gret stane than by him saw he,
That throu the gret anciente,                                        252
Was lowsyt reddy for to fall;
And quhen he saw thaim cumand all,
He tumlit doun on thaim the stane;
And aucht men tharwith has he slane,                                 256
And sua stonait the remanand,
That thai war weill neir recryand.
Then wald he preson hald no mare,
Bot on thame ran with suerd al bare,                                 260
And hewit and slew with all his mayn
Till he had nyne and fourty slane.
The constabill syne can he ta,
And gert him suere that he suld ga                                   264

  Yhe that this redis, jugis yhe,
Quhethir that mair suld presit be:

Undirtuk sic hardyment                                               272
As for to stynt, him ane but fer,

Fra thai had rasit on him the cry,                                   276
Throu hardyment that he had tane,
Wan fifty men all him allane.
Thai did thair dede bath in the nycht,
And faucht bath with the monys licht;                                280

In this maner that I haf tald,
The King, that stout wes, stark and bald,
Wes fechtand on the furdis syde,
Gyffand and takand rowtis ryde;                                      288
Till he sic martirdome thair maid

That nane of thame mycht till him ryde.
Than thoucht thame foly for to byde,                                 292

And went hamward quhar thai com fra.
For the Kingis men with that cry
Walknyt, and full affraitly,                                         296

Howgat that he assalyheit was;                                       308

And thai fand liand in that sted                                     312

Than lovit thai God fast, all-weldand,
That thai thar lord fand haill and feir;
And said, "Thaim byrd on na maner                                    316

How Douglas slew Thirlwall.

[Sidenote: 1307] _Thirlwall would seize the Castle_]

The King in Carrik duelt all still:
His men assemblit fast him till,
That in the land war travalande,
Quhen thai of this deid herd tithand.                                376
For thai thar ure with him wald ta,

  Bot yheit than James of Douglas
In Douglasdaill travaland was;                                       380
Or ellis weill neirhand thar-by,
In hiddillis sum-deill prevely.
For he walde se his governyng,
That hade the castell in keping:                                     384
And gert mak mony a juperdy,
To se quhethir he wald ysche blithly.
Quhen he persavit weill that he
Wald blithly ysche with his menyhe,                                  388
He maid a gaddering prevely
Of thame that war of his party;
That wes so feill that thai durst ficht
With Thrillwall and all the mycht                                    392
Of thame that in the castell were.
He schup him in the nycht to fare
To Sandylandis; and neir thar-by
He him enbuschit prevely,                                            396
And fand a few a trayn to ma;
That sone in the mornyng can ta,
Cattale, that wes the castell by,
And syne with-drew thame halely                                      400
Toward thame that enbuschit ware.
Than Thrillwall, forouten mare,
Gert arme his men forouten baid;
And yschit with all the men he had,                                  404
And followit fast eftir the ky.
He wes arayit at poynt clenly,
Outakyn that his hede wes bair.
Than, with the men that with him war,                                408
The cattale followit he gude speid,
Richt as a man that had no dreid,
Till that he of thame gat a sicht.
Than prikit thai with all thair mycht,                               412
Followand thame out of aray;
And thai sped thame fleand, quhill thai
Fer by thar buschement war all past;
And Thrillwall evir chasit on fast.                                  416
And than thai that enbuschit war
Yschit till him, bath les and mar,
And rasit suddandly the cry;
And thai that saw sa suddandly                                       420

Sum of thaim fled, and sum abaid:
And Douglas, that thar with him had
A gret menyhe, full egirly
Assalit, and scalit thame hastely,                                   428
And in schort tym cummerit thaim sua,

Thrillwall, that wes thair capitane,
Wes thair in-to the bargane slane,                                   432
And of his men the mast party;
The laif fled full affrayitly.
Douglas his menyhe fast can chas,
And the flearis thair wais tais                                      436
To the castell in full gret hy;

Bot the chassaris sped thame so fast,
That thai ourtuk sum at the last,                                    440
And thame forout mercy can sla.
And quhen thai of the castell swa
Saw thaim slay of thair men thaim by,
Thai sparit the yhettis hastely,                                     444
And in hy to the wallis ran.

At thai about the castell fand;                                      448

Thusgat yschit Thrillwall that day.

Qwhen Thrillwall on this maner
Had yschit, as I tell yhow heir,                                     452

Buskit thame all sammyn then,
And went thair way toward the Kyng
In gret hy; for thai herd tithyng                                    456

Thiddir went James of Douglas,                                       464

And quhen he tald had that tithing,
How that Schir Amer wes cumand
For to hunt hym out of the land                                      468
With hund and horn, rycht as he were
A wolf, a theif, or thefis fere;
Than said the King: "It may weill fall,
"Thouch he cum and his power all,                                    472

About ane hill he held his way,
And held hym in-to covert ay,                                        528

But wavering, as he passit was.                                      584
And quhen that Johne of Lorn saw
The hund so hard eftir hym draw,
And followit straucht eftir thai twa,
He knew the Kyng wes ane of thai,                                    588
And bad five of his cumpany,
That war richt wicht men and hardy,
And als on fute spediast ware
Of all that in that rout war thar,                                   592
Ryn eftir hym, and him our-ta,
And lat him na wys pas thaim fra.


Here Five Chosen Men are sent to take the King.

  And fra thai herd had the biddyng,
Thai held the way eftir the Kyng.                                    596
And followit hym so spedely,
That thai him weill soyn can our-hy.
The King than saw thame cumand ner,
And wes anoyit in gret maner,                                        600
For he thoucht, gif thai war worthy,
Thai mycht hym travale and tary,
And hald hym suagat taryand
Till the remanand suld cum at hand.                                  604
Bot had he dred bot anerly
Thame five, I trow all sekirly
He suld nocht haf full mekill dreid.
And till his fallow, as he yheid,                                    608
He said, "Yhon five ar fast cumand:
"Thai ar weill neir now at our hand.
"Swa is thair ony help with the?
"For we sall soyn assalit be."                                       612
'Yha, Schir,' he said, 'all that I may.'
"Thou sais weill," said the Kyng, "perfay.
"I se thame cumand till us neir.
"I will na forthir, bot richt heir                                   616

  The Kyng than stude full sturdely,
And the five soyn, in full gret hy,                                  620
Com with gret schoyr and mannasyng.
Thre of thame went on-to the Kyng;
And till his man the tothir twa
With swerd in hand can stoutly ga.                                   624
The Kyng met thame that till hym socht,
And till the first sic rowt he rocht,
That ere and cheik doun in the hals
He schare, and of the schuldir als                                   628
He ruschyt doun all desaly.
The twa, that saw sa suddanly
Thair fallow fall, effrayit war,
And stert a litill ouirmair.                                         632
The Kyng with that blenkyt him by,
And saw the twa full sturdely
Agane his man gret melle ma.
With that he left his awn twa,                                       636
And till thame that faucht with his man
A lowp richt lychtly maid he than,
And smat the hed of of the tane.
To mete his awn syne is he gane.                                     640
Thai com on hym rycht hardely.
He met the first sa egyrly,
That with his swerd, that scharply schare,
The arm he fra the body bare.                                        644
Quhat strakis thai gaf I can nocht tell,
Bot to the Kyng so fair befell,
That, thouch he travale had and payn,
He of his famen four has slayn.                                      648
His fostir brothir eftir soyn
The fift has out of dawis done.

  And when the King saw that all fiff
War on that wis broucht out of lif,                                  652
Till his fallow than can he say,
"Thou has helpit richt weill, perfay."
'It likis yhow to say sua,' said he,
'Bot the gret part to yhow tuk yhe,                                  656
'That slew four off the fyve, yhow ane.'
The Kyng said; "As the glew is gane,
"Bettir than thou I mycht it do,
"For I had mair lasair thar-to.                                      660

"And for-thi that thai dred me nocht,
"Noy thaim fer out the mair I moucht."
With that the Kyng lukyt hym by,
And saw of Lorn the cumpany                                          668
Neir, with thair sleuthhund fast cumand;
Than till a wod, that wes neir hand,

BOOK VII.


How John of Lorn sought the Good King Robert Bruce with
the Sleuth-hound.

[Sidenote: 1307] _Bruce takes to the Water_]

The Kyng toward the wod is gane,
Wery, for-swat, and will of wayn.
In-till the wod soyn enterit he,
And held doun toward a vale                                            4
Quhar throu the wod a wattir ran.
Thiddir in gret hy went he than,
And begouth to rest hym thair,
And said he mycht no forthirmar.                                       8
His man said; "Schir, that may nocht be:
"Abyde yhe heir, yhe sal soyn se
"Five hundreth yharnand yhou to sla,
"And thai ar fele aganis twa;                                         12
"And, sen we may nocht deill wyth mycht,
"Help us all that we may wyth slycht."
The King said; 'Sen that thou will swa,
'Ga furth, and I sall with the ga.                                    16
'Bot I haf herd oftsis say,
'That quha endlang a wattir ay
'Wald wayd a bow-draucht, he suld ger
'Bath the sleuthhund and the ledar,                                   20
'Tyne the sleuth men gert him ta,

'For war yhon devillis hund a-way,
'I roucht nocht of the layff, perfay.'                                24


Here the Sleuth-hound lost his Scent.

  As he devisit thai haf done,
And enterit in the wattir sone,
And held on endlang it thar way,
And syne to the land yheid thai,                                      28
And held thair way as thai did ere.
And John of Lorn, with gret effere,
Com with his rout richt to the place,
Quhar that his five men slan was.                                     32
He menyt thame quhen he thaim saw;
And said, eftir a litill thraw,
That he suld wenge in hy thar blude:
Bot othir wayis the gammyn yhude.                                     36
Thair wald he mak no mair duelling,
Bot furth in hy followit the King,
Richt to the burn thai passit ar;
Bot the sleuth-hund maid stynting thar,                               40
And waveryt lang tyme to and fra,
That he na certane gat couth ga;
Till at the last than Johne of Lorn
Persavit the hund the sleuth had lorn,                                44
And said; "We haf tynt this travell;
"To pas forthir may nocht avale;
"For the wode is bath braid and wyde,
"And he is weill fer be this tyde.                                    48
"Tharfor I rede we turn agane,
"And wast no mair travale in vayn."
With that releyt he his menyhe,
And his way to the host tuk he.                                       52


Or else he was Slain with an Arrow.

[Sidenote: 1307] _The King Escapes_]

Thus eschapit the nobill Kyng.
Bot sum men sais, this eschaping
Apon ane othir maner fell
Than throu the wading; for thai tell                                  56
That the Kyng a gud archer had,
And quhen he saw his lord swa stad,
That he wes left swa anerly,
He ran on fut alwayis him by,                                         60
Till he in-till the wod wes gane.
Then said he till hym-self allane,
That he arest rycht thair wald ma,
And luk gif he the hund mycht sla.                                    64
For gif the hund mycht lest on lif,
He wist full weill that thai wald drif
The Kyngis tras till thai hym ta;
Than wist he weill thai wald him sla.                                 68
And for he wald his lord succour,
He put his lif in aventur.
And stud in-till a busk lurkand
Quhill that the hund com at his hand,                                 72
And with ane arrow soyn him slew,
And throu the wod syne hym withdrew.
Bot quhethir his eschaping fell
As I tald first, or now I tell,                                       76
I wat it weill, without lesyng,
At that burn eschapit the King.


How the Three Men that bare the Wedder Sheep thought
to have slain King Robert Bruce.

The King has furth his wayis tane.
And Johne of Lorn agane is gane                                       80
To Schir Amer, that fra the chas
With his men than reparit was,
That litill sped in thair chassing;
For thow that thai maid following                                     84
Full egirly, thai wan bot small;
Thair fayis neir eschapit all.

Chassand, the Kyngis baner wan;                                       88
Quhar-throu in Ingland wyth the Kyng
He had rycht gret price and lovyng.
Quhen the chaseris releit war,
And Johne of Lorn had met thaim thar,                                 92
He tald Schir Amer all the cas,
How that the King eschapit was;
And how that he his fif men slew,
And syne he to the wod hym drew.                                      96
Quhen Schir Amer herd this, in hy
He sanyt hym for the ferly,
And said; "He is gretly to pris;
"For I knaw nane that liffand is                                     100
"That at myscheif can help hym swa.
"I trow he suld be hard to sla
"And he war bodyn all evynly."
On this wis spak Schir Amery.                                        104


Here Three Traitours meet the King, with a Wedder.

  And the gud Kyng held furth his way,
He and his man, ay quhill that thai
Passit owt throu the forest war;
Syne in a mure thai enterit ar.                                      108
That wes bath hee and lang and braid;
And or thai half it passit had,
Thai saw on syde thre men cumand,
Lik to licht men and waverand.                                       112

And ane of thame apon his hals
A mekill bundyn weddir bare.
Thai met the Kyng, and halsit him thar:                              116
And the Kyng thame thar halsing yhald,
And askit thame quhethir thai wald.
Thai said, Robert the Bruce thai socht,
To meit with hym gif that thai mocht,                                120

"Haldis furth yhour way with me,
"And I sall ger yhow soyn him se."                                   124

And held nocht in the first stat;                                    128
For thai war fayis to the Kyng;

And duell with hym quhill that thai saw

Till a wast husbandis hous; and thar
Thai slew the weddir at thai bar,                                    152
And slew fyre for to rost thar met,
And askit the Kyng gif he wald et,
And rest hym till the met war dicht?
The Kyng, that hungry wes I hicht,                                   156
Assentit to thair speke in hy:
Bot he said, he wald anerly

In the end of the hous suld ma
Ane othir fyre; and thai did swa.
Thai drew thame in the hous end,
And half the weddir till him send;                                   164
And thai rostit in hy thair met,
And fell rycht frakly for till et.
The King weill lang he fastyt had,
And had rycht mekill travale made:                                   168

And quhen he etyn had hastely,
He had to slepe sa mekill will,

For quhen the wanys fillit ar,
The body worthis hevy evirmar;
And to slepe drawis hevynes.
The Kyng, that all for-travalit wes,                                 176
Saw that hym worthit slep neidwais;
Till his fostir brothir he sais,

'Yha, Schir,' he said, 'till I may dre.'
The Kyng than wynkit a litill we,
And slepit nocht full ynkurly,
Bot gliffnyt up oft suddandly;                                       184
For he had drede of thai thre men,
That at the tothir fyre war then.

Tharfor he slepit as foul on twist.                                  188

Here he slew the three traitors.

[Sidenote: 1307] _Bruce's Foster-Brother is Slain_]

  The Kyng slepit bot litill than,
Quhen sic a slepe fell on his man
That he mycht nocht hald up his e,
Bot fell on slepe and routit he.                                     192

And saw his man slepand him by,                                      204
And saw cumand the tratouris thre.
Delyverly on fut gat he,
And drew his suerd out and thame met,
And, as he yheid, his fut he set                                     208

Gaf hym a strake in his rysyng,
Swa that he mycht help hym no mair.
The Kyng so stratly stad wes thair,                                  216

Na war the armyng that he had,

Throu Goddis grace and his manheid.
His fostir-brothir thair wes ded.                                    224
Than wes he wounder will of wayn,
Quhen he saw he wes left allane.

Here the King goes to his Tryst.

The Kyng went furth wrath and angry,
Menand his man full tendirly,                                        232

On this maner eschapit was,
He blew his home, and than in hy
His gud men till hym can rely;
Than hamwardis buskit he to fair,                                    492

Stoutly towart his fayis gais,

The King a few men of thame slew,
For thai rycht soyn thair gat can ga;                                604

That of the Kingis men he slew
A part, and othir-sum thaim withdrew,
And fled thair way toward the King,                                  216

Sesit to thame in gret fusioune
Men, armyng and marchandis,                                          440
And othir gudis on syndri wis;
Quhill thai, that war eir pouer and bare,
Of that gude rych and mychty war.
Bot thair wes few slayne; for the King,                              444

On gret payn, thai suld slay nane,
That, but gret bargane, mycht be tane;
That thai war kynde to the cuntre                                    448

On this maner the toun wes tane.
And syne the towris everilkane
And wallis gert he tummyll doune:                                    452

And till his pes tuk all the land;
Wes nane that durst him than withstand.


Here All Scots obey the King except Lorn.

  Apon north half the Scottis Se                                     460

Outane the Lord of Lorn, and thai
Of Argile that wald with him ga.

And hatit hyme atour all thing.

Vengeans of his gret cruelte,                                        468
And that him sair repent sall he,
That he the King contraryit ay,
May fall, quhen he no mend it may.

Wes till the King in neir degre
Of blude, for his sister him bare.                                   732
And on the morn, forouten mare,
Toward the nobill King he raid,
And with him bath thai twa he had.
The King of his cummyng wes blith,                                   736
And thankit him tharof feill sith.
And till his nevo can he say,
"Thou has a quhill renyit thi fay;
"Bot thou reconsalit now mon be."                                    740

Qwhen Thomas Randol, on this wis

And send to duell in gud keping,
For the speke he spak to the King;                                     4
The gud King, that thoucht on the scath,
The dispit and felony bath,
That John of Lorne had till him done,
His host assemblit he than soyn,                                       8
And toward Lorn he tuk the way,
With his men in-to gude aray.
Bot Johne of Lorn of his cummyng,
Lang or he com, had witteryng;                                        12
And men on ilk syde gaderit he,
I trow twa thousand thai mycht be;
And send thame for to stop the way,
Quhar the King behufit to ga:                                         16
And that wes in ane evill place,
That so strat and so narrow was,
That twa men sammyn mycht nocht ryde
In sum place of the hyllis syde.                                      20
The nethir half wes perelous;
For a schoir crag, hye and hyduous,
Raucht till the se, doun fra the pas.
On the owthir half ane montane was                                    24
So cumrous and ek so stay,

Woundit so felly in the face,

For dreid thai suld behynd assalyhe.                                 724

And him reskewit with hard fichting;

Of him that knawis and wat all thing.
Tharfor, in stede of prophesye,                                      740
Scho left ane takyne richt joly,
That is that scho in hir chapell
Gert weill be portrait ane castell,
A leddir up to the wall standand                                     744
And a man thar-on clymande,
And wrat owth him, as old men sayis,
In Franch, _Gardis vous de Francois_.
And for this word scho gert writ swa,                                748

Scho wrat that as in prophesy:                                       752
And it fell eftirward suthly
Richt as scho said; for tane it was,
And _Francois_ led thame up that place.

[742: E _That is yheit in-till_; but _cf._ line 746.]

On this wis Edinburgh wes tane;                                      756
And thai that war tharin ilkane

Thair gudis haff thai sessit all,

Sesand the cuntre till his pes.
Of this deid, that so worthy wes,
The Erll wes prisit gretumly.                                        776
The King, that saw him sa worthy,
Wes blith and joyfull our the laif,
And to manteym his stat, him gaff
Rentis and landis fair eneuch.                                       780
And he to sa gret worschip dreuch,

His fayis gretly stonayit he,
For he fled nevir throu fors of ficht.                               784
Quhat sall I mair say of his mycht?
His gret manheid, and his bountee
Gerris him yheit oft renownyt be.


How Sir Edward won Ru'glen peel
And Dundee, then Stirling, besieged well.

Had all Galloway and Nyddis-daill                                    792

And doungyn doune the castellis all

And wonnyn it in schort tym has he.
Syne till Dunde he tuk the way,                                      800

Agane the King; tharfor in hy
He set ane sege thar-to stoutly,
And lay thar quhill it yholdyn was.                                  804

Fra the Lenteryne, that is to say,

The winning of Stirling by Sir Edward the Bruce, though the
Battle was set over a Year and a Day, betwixt him and

Richt soyne he went on-to the King.
And tald quhat tretis he had maid,                                    35
And quhat day he thame gevyn had.

"That wes unwisly done, perfay;
"I herd nevir quhar so lang warnyng
"Wes gevin to so mychty ane Kyng                                      40

Schir Edward said; 'Sa God me reid!
'Thouch he and all that he may leid
'Cum, we sall fecht, all war thai ma.'                                55
Quhen the King herd his brothir swa
Spek to the battale so hardely,
He prysit hym in his hert gretly,
And said; "Brothir, sen swa is gane
"At this thing thus is undirtane,                                     60

  All thai consentit to that saw,
And than, in-till ane litill thraw,
Thair four battalis ordanit thai.
And to the Erll Thomas, perfay,                                      305
He gaf the vaward in leding;
For in his nobill governyng
And in his hye chevelry
Thai assoueryt rycht soveranly.
And, for to maynteym his baner,                                      310
Lordis, that of gret worschip wer,

The tothir battale wes gevin to lede
Till hym that douchty wes of dede,                                   315
And prisit of gret chevelry,

That, how sa evir the gammyn ga,
His fayis to plenyhe sall mater haf.                                 320
And syne the thrid battale he gaf
To Waltir Stewart for to leid,
And till Dowglas douchty of deid.
Thai war cosyngis in neir degre,
Tharfor till hym betaucht wes he,                                    325
For he wes yhoung; but nocht-for-thi

How King Robert gart pots make
And cover them well, I undertake.

[Sidenote: JUNE 21, 1314] _The Scots march to the New Park_]

The King thus, that wes wicht and wis,
And richt worthy at all devis,
And hardy als atour all thing,                                       350
Ordanit his men for the fechting.
And on the morn, on Settirday,
The King herd his discurrouris say
That Inglis men with mekill mycht
Had lyin at Edinburgh that nycht.                                    355
Tharfor, forouten mair delay,
He to the New Park held his way
With all that in his leding war,
And in the Park thame herbryit thar.
And in ane playne feld, by the way,                                  360
Quhar he thoucht neid behufit away
The Inglis men, gif that thai wald
Throw the Park to the castell hald,
He gert men mony pottis ma,
Of a fut breid round, and all tha                                    365
War deip up till ane manis kne,
Swa thik, that thai mycht liknyt be
Till ane wax-cayme that beis mais.
All that nycht travaland he was;
Swa that, or day wes, he had maid                                    370
Thai pottis, and thame helit had
With stikis and with gyrs al greyne,
Swa that thai mycht nocht weill be seyne.

[350: E omits. In C and H. E gives after line 351 _In gud aray in

  On Sonday than in the mornyng,
Weill soyn eftir the sonne-rising,                                   375
Thai herd the mes full reverently.
And mony shraf thame devotly,
That thoucht till de in that melle,
Or than to mak thar cuntre fre.
To God for thair richt prayit thai.                                  380
Thair dynit nane of thame that day,
Bot, for the vigill of Sanct Johne,
Thai fastit bred and wattir ilkone.
The King, quhen that the mes wes done,
Went for to se the pottys soyne;                                     385
And at his liking saw thaim maid.
On athir syde the way weill braid
It wes pottit, as I haf tald.
Gif that thair fais on hors will hald
Furth in that way, I trow thai sall                                  390
Nocht weill eschew foroutyn fall.
Throu-out the host syne gert he cry
That all suld arme thame hastely,
And busk thame on thar best maner.
And quhen thai all essemblit wer,                                    395
He gert aray thame for the ficht,
And syne our all gert cry on hicht,
That quhat sa evir he war that fand
His hert nocht sekir for till stand
To wyn all or de with honour,                                        400
For to maynteyme that stalward stour,
That he be tyme suld tak his way;
And nane suld duell with him bot thai
That wald stand with him to the end,
And tak the ure that God wald send.                                  405
Then all ansuerd with a cry,
And with a voce said generaly;
That nane for dout of dede suld fale,
Quhill discumfit war the battale.

Qwhen the gud King had herd his men                                  410
Sa hardely him ansuer then,
Sayand that nouthir ded no dreid
Till sic discomfort suld thame leid,
That thai suld eschew the fechting,
In hert he had gret rejosyng.                                        415
For him thoucht men of sic covyne,
So gud so hardy and so fyne,
Suld weill in battall hald thair rycht
Agane men of full mekill mycht.
Syne all the small folk and pouerale                                 420
He send with harnase and vittale
In-till the Park, weill fer him fra,
And fra the battall gert thame ga;
And as he bad, thai went thair way;
Twenty thousand weill neir war thai.                                 425
Thair way thai held till ane vale,
The King left with ane clene menyhe;
The-quhethir thai war thretty thowsand.
I trow they stalwardly sall stand,
And do thair devour as thai aw.                                      430
Thai stude than rangit all on raw,
Reddy for till byde battale,
Gif ony folk wald thame assale.


How the King bad the Earl Murray
To keep beside the Kirk the way.

  The King gert thame all buskit be,
For he wist in-to certante                                           435
That his fayis all nycht lay
At the Fawkirk, and syne at thai
Held toward him the way all straucht,
With mony men of mekill mawcht.
Tharfor till his nevo bad he,                                        440
The Erll of Murreff, with his menyhe,
Besyd the kirk till kepe the way,
That na man pass that gat away,
For-out debat, to the castele.
And he said, that him-self suld wele                                 445
Kepe the entre with his battale,
Gif that ony wald thair assale.
And syne his brothir, Schir Edward,
And yhoung Waltir, the gud Steward,
And the lord Dowglas alsua,                                          450

Quhilk of thaim had of help mister,
And help with thame that with him weir.

  The King send than James of Douglas
And Schir Robert of Keth, that wes                                   455

The Inglis mennys com to se.
And thai lap on and furth thai raid;
Weill horsit men with thame thai had:
And soyn the gret host haf thai seyne                                460
Quhar scheldis schynand war so scheyne,
And basnetis weill burnyst bricht,
That gaf agane the sonne gret licht.
Thai saw so fele browdyn baneris,
Standartis, pennownys and speris,                                    465
And so feill knychtis apon stedis,
All flawamand in-to thair wedis,
And so fele battalis and so braid,

And swa arayit for to ficht.
Quhen the discurrowris has had sicht                                 475
Of thair fais, as I herd say,
Towart the King thai tuk the way,
And tald him, in gret prevate,
The multitude and the bewte
Of thair fais, that comme so braid,                                  480
And of the gret mycht at thai had.
Than the King bad thame thai suld ma
Na contynans that it war swa;
Bot bad thame in-to commoune say
That thai com in-till evill aray,                                    485
And confort his man on that wis.
For oftsis of ane word may ris
Discomfort and tynsall with-all.
And throu a word, als weill may fall,
Confort may ris and hardiment,                                       490

And on the sammyn wis it did her;
Thair comfort and thair hardy cher
Confortit thame so gretumly,
That of thar host the lest hardy                                     495
Be countinans, wald formast be
For till begin the gret melle.

How with a hundred the Earl Murray
To eight hundred battle gave.

Apon this wis the nobill King
Gaf all his men reconforting,
Throu hardy countynans and cher                                      500

For, gif that thai mycht weill cum thair,

And toward Strevilling tuk the way.
The New Park all eschewit thai,                                      535
For thai wist weill the King wes thair;
Beneth the New Park can thai fair,
Quhill neuth the kirk, in-till a rout.
The Erll Thomas, that wes so stout,
Quhen he saw thame swa tak the playne,                               540
In gret hye went he thame agane
With fif hundreth, forouten ma,
Anoyit in his hert and wa
That thai so fer war passit by.
For the King had said hym roydly,                                    545
That ane rose of his chaplet
Wes faldyn; for, quhar he wes set
To kep the way, thai men war past.
Tharfor he hastit hym so fast
That cummyn in schort tyme wes he                                    550
To the playn feld with his menyhe.
For he thoucht that he suld amend
That he trespassit had, or than end.
And quhen the Inglis men him saw
Cum on, forouten dreid or aw,                                        555
And tak sa hardely the playne,

And quhen the Erll saw that menyhe                                   560
Cum so stoutly, tiil his said he;
"Beis nocht abasit for thair schor,

  And as he bad thame thai haf done;
And the tothir come alsoyne.
Before thame all thair com prikand                                   570
A knycht, hardy of hert and hand;
He wes a weill gret lord at hame,
Schir Wilyhame Dencort wes his name;
He prekit on thame so hardely,
And thai him met so sturdely,                                        575
That he and hors war born all doune
And slayne rycht thair for-out ransoune.
With Inglis men gretly wes he
Menyt that day, and his bountee.
The layffe com on thame sturdely;                                    580
Bot nane of thame so hardely
Ruschit emang thame as did he.
Bot with fer mair maturite,
Thai assemblit all in ane rout,
And enveronyt thame all about,                                       585
Assalyheand thame on ilka syde.
And thai with speris woundis wyde
Gaf to the hors that com thame neir:
And thai that rydand on thame weir,
That doune war born, lossit the lyvis.                               590
And mony speris, dartis and knyvis,
And wapnys apon seir maneir,
Kest emang thame that fechtand weir,
That thame defendit so wittandly
That thair fayis had gret ferly.                                     595
For sum wald schut out of thar rout,
And of thame that assalyheit about,
Stryk stedis, and ber doune men.
The Inglis men so roydly then
Kest emang thame swerdis and mas,                                    600
That inwith thame ane montane was
Of wapnys, that war warpit thair.
The Erll and his thus fechtand war
At gret myscheiff, as I yhow say;
For quhenar, be full fer, war thai                                   605
Than thair fayis, and all about
Enveronyt war, quhar mony a rout
War roucht, and full dyspitfully--

Qwhen the Cliffurd, as I sayd air,                                   335

Quhen thai all haill the bak can ta:

How Thomas Randall tuk the playne
With few folk, and how he has slayne                                 350

And how at thai war put agane,                                       355
And part of thair gud men wes slane:

For in punyheis is oft hapnyne

Qwhen that thir twa first batellis wer

The Steward, Walter that than was,
And the gud lord als of Douglas,
In a battale quhen that thai saw                                       5
The Erll, for outen dreid or aw,
Assemmyll with his cumpany
On all the folk so sturdely,
For till help him thai held thar way
With thar battale in gud aray,                                        10
And assemmyllit so hardely
Besyd the Erll a litill by,
Thair fais feld thair cummyng weill;
For with wapnys stalwart of steill
Thai dang on thame with all thar mycht.                               15
Thar fayis resavit them weill, I hycht,
With swerdis, speris, and with macys.
The battale thair so felloune was,
And sua richt gret spilling of blud,
That on the erd the flus it stud.                                     20
The Scottis men so weill thame bar,
And sua gret slauchtir maid thai thar,
And fra so feill the livis revit,
That all the feild wes bludy levit.
That tym thir three battalis wer                                      25
All syde be syde fechtand weill neir.
Thar mycht man her richt mony dynt,
And wapnys apon armour stynt,
And see tummyll knychtis and stedis,
With mony rich and ryoll wedis                                        30
Defoulit roydly under feit.
Sum held on loft, sum tynt the suet.
A long quhill thus fechtand thai wer,
That men no noyis na cry mycht her;
Men hard nocht ellis bot granys and dyntis                            35
That slew fire, as men dois on flyntis.
Sa faucht thai ilkane egirly,
That thai maid nouthir noyis no cry,
Bot dang on othir at thar mycht,
With wapnys that war burnyst brycht.                                  40

The Marschall and his cumpany
Wes yheit, as to yhow ere said I,                                     90
Amang the archeris, quhar thai maid
With speris rowme quhar at thai raid,
And slew all that thai mycht ourta.
And thai weill lichtly mycht do swa,
For thai had nocht a strak to stynt,                                  95
Na for to hald agane a dynt.

Withdrawin thaim in full gret hy,
And sum war fled all utrely.

That for thair awne folk had no space
Yheit than to cum to the assemblyng,                                 105
In agane smertly can thai ding
The archeris, that thai met fleand,
That than war maid so recryand,
That thair hertis war tynt cleirly,
I trow thai sall nocht scath gretly                                  110
The Scottis men with schot that day.
And the gud King Robert, that ay
Was fillit of full gret bounte,
Saw how that his battellis thre
So hardely assemblit thar,                                           115
And so weill in the ficht thame bar,
And so fast on thair fais can dyng
That him thoucht nane had abaysing,
And how the archeris war scalit then,
He was all blith, and till his men                                   120
He said; "Lordingis, now luk that yhe

  Quhen this wes said, thai held thar way,

So stoutly, that at thar cummyng
Thair fais wer ruschit a gret thing.

With all thar mycht and all thar mayne

And quhar thai with full strak mycht hit,
Thar mycht no armyng stynt thar strak;                               145

Thar wes the battell strikyn weill.
So gret dynnyng ther wes of dyntis,
As wapnys apon armor styntis,
And of speris so gret bristing,                                      155
And sic thrawing and sic thristing,

For Scottis men thame hard assait,

Quhar all the feild of blud wes red.

With blud wes swa defowlit thar,

Qwhen the feld, as I said air,

Joyfull and blyth war and mery
Of the grace that thame fallyn was,                                  505

"Tui quhat man art thou presoner?"
'To nane,' he said, 'bot till yhow her
'I yheld me at yhour will to be.'
"And I resaiff the, Schir," saide he.                                530

Com for till help the Inglis men,                                    555

And the lord Douglas and his men                                     575
Thoucht thai wald nocht purpos then
For to ficht with thame all planly,

That of the henmast ay tuk he:
Micht nane behynd his fallowis be                                    580

And syne lap on, and furth thai fair;                                600
And he wes alwais by thame neir;

And gif ony stad war swa,

Sesit all soyne in hand he was.
Thai convoit thame apon this wis,

In rout; bot, and we suth sall say,

Or thai come thar; bot nocht for-thi,
Thai come till Berwik weill; and thar                                625
In-till the toune resavit war;

And quhen the lord Douglas has seyne
That he had lesit thar his payne,
Toward the King he went agane.                                       630

Of men of armys and archeris,

And in a nycht syne and a day,

Haym to Schir Edward raid thai then,
And said weill thai war mony men.

"The mair honour allout have we,
"Gif that we beir us manfully.                                       275

All said thai than, thai weill suld do.

With speris perssit thar armyng,
And stekit hors, and men doune bar.
Ane felloune fechting wes than thair.

Of wapnys, armyng, and ded men
The feld wes haly strewit then.

That twis in-to battell wes he
Discumfit with ane few menyhe.

Lawch by a brym, he gert thame ta

For till betrais thame wes his thoucht.
In sic ane place he has thame broucht,

That mony of Schir Edwardis men                                      115

And till suppris thame suddanely;
For thai thoucht thai suld traistly ly,                              120

Schir Edward wist of this na thing,
For of tresoune had he na thoucht.                                   125
Bot for the trewis he lefit noucht

For till warn hym of thair ysching,
Warnit him in-till full gret hy.

The myddis of the toune he tais.
With that neir cummand war his fais,

And his men that I tald of ere,
On all that rout so hardely
Assemblit, that it wes ferly.                                        180

All in a lump, on athyr hand,
And he, redy to dey, throwand.                                       230

Na wald nocht heir men mak menyng.

  The Douglass thair weill hard wes stad,
Bot the gret hardyment that he had                                   370

And thai that chassit sum has slayne,
And turnyt the prayis haill agane.
The hardest fechting forsuth this wes

Quhen evir he com till hard assay,                                   390

The word weill fer sprang of this deid,
Swa that in Ingland neir thar-by

Wonnyt at Berwyk, neir besyde
The marchis, quhar the lord Dowglas
In the Forest reparande was,
And had at him full gret invy,                                       405
For he him saw so manfully
Mak his boundis ay mar and mar.

Spek of the lorde Dowglasis mycht,
And how forsy he wes in fycht,                                       410
And how hym oft fell fayr fortoune.
He wrethit him thar-at all soyne,
And said, "Quhat weyn yhe, is thar nane
"That evir is worth bot hym alane?
"Yhe set hym as he war but peir:                                     415

Of this avow soyne bodword was
Brocht till Schir James of Douglas,

Apon ane nycht he tuk the way;
Swa that, in the mornyng airly,

Before Berwyk; and thair he maid                                     435
Men to display his baner braid.
And of his menyhe sum send he
For till burne townys twa or thre,
And bad thame soyn agane thame speid;

That Dowglas cummyn wes so neir,
And saw all braid stand his baneir,
Than with the folk that with hym wer,                                445
(And he had a gret menyhe thar;
For all the gud of that cuntre
In-till that tyme with hym had he;
Swa that he with hym thar had then
Weill may then wes the Scottis men)                                  450
He held his way up till ane hill,
And said; "Lordyngis, it war my will
"Till mak end of the gret deray
"That Dowglass makis us ilk day.
"Bot me think it speidful that we                                    455
"Abyde, quhill his men scalit be
"Throu the cuntre to tak the pray:
"Than fersly schute on hym we may,
"And we sall have thame at our will."
Thus all thai gaiff consent thar-till,                               460
And on the hill abaid huvande.

Thoucht it wes foly mair till byde.                                  465
Toward the hill than can he ryde;
And quhen the Nevell saw at thai
Wald nocht pass furth to the forray,
Bot pressit till thame with thar mycht,
He wist weill than that thai wald ficht,                             470
And till his menyhe can he say;

"Heir is the flour of this cuntre,
"And ma than thai alsua ar we.
"Assemmyll we than hardely:                                          475

Than in a frusche assemblit thai.

To his brother with great gathering.

  Quhen Schir Edward, as I tald air,
Had discumfit Richard of Clair,
And of Irland all the barnage
Thris, throu his worthy vassalage,
And syne with all his men of mayne                                     5
Till Cragfergus wes cummyn agayn,

Tuk leiff in Scotland for till pas.
And he hym levit with a gruching,
And syne him chargit to the King,                                     10
Till pray him specialy that he
Suld cum in Irland him to se.
For, war thai bath in-to that land,
Thai suld fynd nane suld thaim withstand.

And till his schippes is he gane,
And salit out weill our the se,
In Scotland soyne arivit he.

And he resavit hym gladsumly;                                         20
And sperit of his brotheris fair,
And of journeis that he had thair;
And he him tald all but lesyng.

For till manteym weill the cuntre.

[Sidenote: 1316] _The Month of May_]

King Robert, apon thiskyn wis,
In-till Irland arivit is:                                             50

With all thar folk, thar wayis hald
Throu all Irland, fra end to othir.                                   55
Schir Edward than, the Kingis brothir,
Befor in the avaward raid;
The Kyng him-self the reirward maid,
That had in-till his cumpany
The Erll Thomas, that wes worthy.                                     60
Thair wayis furthwarde haf thai tane,
And soyne are passit Inderwillane.
This wes in the moneth of May,
Quhen byrdis syngis on the spray;
Melland thair notys with sydry sowne,                                 65
For softnes of that sweit sesoune;
And levis on the branchis spredis,
And blomys bricht besyd thame bredis
And feldis florist ar with flowris
Well savourit, of seir colowris;                                      70
And all thing worthis blith and gay;
Quhen that this gud king tuk his way
To ryd furthward, as I said are.
The wardane than, Richard of Clare,
Wist the Kyng wes arivit swa,                                         75
And wist that he schupe for till ta
His way toward the south cuntre.
Of all Irland assemblit he
Bath burges and chevalry
And hobilleris and yhumanry;                                          80
Quhill he had neir fourty thousand.
Both he wald nocht yheit tak on hand
With all his fayis in field to ficht,
But umbethoucht him of a slicht;
That he with all that gret menyhe                                     85
Wald in a wode enbuschit be,
And prevely besyde the way,
Quhar at thar fayis suld pas away,
And let the vaward pas fer by,
And syne assemmyll hardely                                            90

In a wode thai enbuschit wer:
The Scottis hoost raid by thame nere;
For thai na schawing of thame maid.                                   95
Schir Edward weill fer forrouth raid
With thame that war of his menyhe;
To the reirward na tent tuk he.

  And Schir Richard of Clare in hy,

At the wode-syde thame bykkirrit thar,
And schot emang the Scottis men.                                     105

Five thousand wicht and ek hardy,
Saw thai twa sa abaundonly
Schut emang thaim, and cum so neir;
He wist richt weill, withouten weir,                                 110

Tharfor a bydding has he mad,
That no man suld be so hardy
Till prik till thame, but sarraly
Ryde reddy ay in-till battale,                                       115

"For we sall soyne, I undirta,"
He said, "haf for till do with ma."

  Bot Schir Colyne Cammell, that ner
Wes by quhar thai twa yhomen wer,                                    120

And, in his gret malancoly,
With ane trunsione in-till his nave
To Schir Colyne sic dusche he gave,                                  130

So stoutly than on thame thai raid,
And assemblit so hardely                                             155

Ruschit in sa gret fusioune than,

Dang on othir so hardely,                                            170
With wapnys that war bricht and bar,
That mony a wicht man ded wes thar.

And frontly with thar fayis can ficht,

So hard ane fichting wes nocht seyne:

And in syndry battelis off thai

With trappit hors richt to the feit.                                 185

For ane, bot he swa bar him then,                                    190

Confortit swa all his menyhe,

For, quhar he saw the thykkest pres,
So hardely on thame he raid,                                         195

Raid furthwarde in-to bettir aray,
And neir to-giddir than ere did thai.
Throu all the land planly thai raid;

And how scho furth suld caryit be,
Or evir he fure, than ordanit he.

For he thoucht for till make infair,                                 340

In Rychmond wes thar wonnand then

Fifty, that worthy war and wicht,
At all poynt armyt weill and dicht;
And of archeris a gret menyhe                                        375
Assemblit als with hym had he.
A place thar was thar in the way,
Quhar he wist weill thai wald away,
That had wode apon athir syde;
The entre wes weill large and wyde;                                  380
And as ane schelde it narrowit ay
Quhill that, in-till ane place, the way
Wes nocht a penny-stane cast of breid.
The lord of Douglas thidder yheid,
Quhen he wist thai war neir cumand,                                  385

  Bot soyn thar ordinans brak thai;

All scalit, throu the toun to-ga;

That thai ran richt as thai war woude,
And sesit housis and slew men.
And thai that saw thair fais then
Cum apon thame suddanly,
Throu-out the toun thai rasit the cry,                               110
And schot to-gidder heir and thair:
And ay, as thai assemblit war,

Quhan thai the baner saw sympilly
Swa standand, stuffit with sa quhoyn,                                135
Thar yhettis haf thai opnyt soyn,

And als the gude lord of Douglas,
With the few folk that with thame was,                               140
Met thame stoutly with wapnys seir;

And with all mychtis can thame payne                                 145

I trow thai had swa done, perfay,
For thai war fewar far than thai,

And put him till sa hard assay,
And sic dyntis about him dang,                                       155

And till the castell held thair way.
And at gret myscheiff enterit thai,
For thai war pressit thair so fast,                                  165
That thai feill lesit of the last;
Bot thai that enterit, nocht-for-thi,

And in hy to the wallis ran,
For thai war nocht all sekir than.                                   170

The toune wes takyn on this wis
Throu gret worschip and hye empris;

Wes sesit smertly in-till hand.
Vittaill thai fand in gret fusionne,                                 175
And all that fell till stuff of toune;
That kepit that fra distroying,
And syne has word send to the King.
And he wes of that tithing blith,
And sped him thiddirward full swith.                                 180
And as he throu the cuntre raid
Men gaderit till him, quhill he had
A mekill rout of worthy men.
And the folk that war wonand then
In-till the Mers and Tevidaill,                                      185
And in the Forest als all haill,

On yhond half Tweid durst weill apeir.

Quhen thai thair fais in sic plente

And had na hope of reskewyng,                                        195

Till se quhethir farar war him till

And assaill quhill it wonnyne war,
Or than in Ingland for till fare                                     840
And reskew his land and men.
His consell fast discordit then;
For Southren men wald that he maid
Arest thar, quhill he wonnyn had
The toune and the castell alsua.                                     845
Bot Northir men wald no-thing swa,

And raid for till reskew the land.
Of Longcastell, I tak on hand,
The Erll Thomas wes ane of thai
That consalit the King hame to ga.
And, for that mair enclynit he                                       855
Till the folk of the south cuntre
Than till the northir mennys will,

That he gert turs his geir in hy,
And with his batall halely,                                          860

Till Ingland hame his way he tais.
But leiff he hame has tane his gat:
Tharfor fell eftir sic debat

Tuk hym syne in-to Pomfret,
And on the hill besyde the toune
Strake of his hede but ransoune;                                     870
Tharfor syne drawin and hangit wes he,
And with him weill a fair menyhe.

And his harnas tursit has he
And in-till Ingland hame can far.                                    885
The Scottis men, that distroyand war
In Ingland, herd soyne tell tithyng
Of this gret sege the departing.
Tharfor thai tuk westward the way,
And by Carlele hame went ar thai                                     890

And othir gudis on seir maneris.

And the laiff has thar wayis tane;

Magre them all that with hym war.
For he had nocht than in that land
Of all men, I trow, twa thousand,
Outane the kyngis off Erischry

The Death of Good Sir Walter Steward.

In this tyme that the trewis war
Lestand on marchis, as I said ar,

At Bathket a gret seknes tais.

Quhill men persavit by his fair,
That hym worthit neyd to pay the det
That na man for till pay may let.                                    210

As gud Crystyn the gast he gaf.
Than mycht men heir folk gret and cry,                               215

All men hym menyt comonly,
For of his elde he wes worthy.                                       220
Quhen thai lang tyme thar dule had maid,
The cors to Paslay haf thai had,
And thar with gret solempnite,
And with gret dule, erdyt wes he.
God, for his mycht, his saull he bring                               225
Quhar joy ay lestis but endyng!

For till haf lestit thretten yheir,
Quhen twa yheir of thame passit weir,                                230
And ane half, as I trow, alsua,

And of the men als that war slane;
Bot continuit thair mavite                                           235

To thair lordis thai tald it then.

The Inglis host; "Yha, Schir, but weyne."
'Quhat folk ar thai?' "Schir, mony men."
The Erll his ayth has suorn him then,

And sperit at him of his abaid;
And he tald how a carll him maid
With his club richt ane felloune pay,
That met him stoutly in the way,                                     610

For till help, gif thai myster had.
And, als soyne as the lord Dowglas
Met with the Erll of Murreff was,
The Erll sperit at hym tithing
How he had farn in his outyng.                                       620
"Schir," said he, "we haf drawyn blude."
The Erll, that wes of mekill mude,
Said, 'And we had all thiddir gane,
'We had discumfit thame ilkane.'
"It mycht haf fallyn weill," said he,                                625
"Bot sekerly enew war we

  The Erle said, 'Sen that it swa is,
'That we may nocht with juperdis
'Our felloune fais fors assale,

Lord Douglas said then; "Be Saint Bryd,                              635

How the Fox played with the Fisher.

  'How did the fox?' the Erll can say.
He said; "A fischar quhilome lay                                     650

NOTES

_For fuller details of the more important works referred to see
Bibliographical List._


BOOK I.

4 _on gud maner._ The best expansion of this phrase as an expression of
Barbour's ideal of style is in the _Alexander_:

  "To mak it _on sa gud manere,
  Sa oppin sentence and sa clere
  As is the Frenche_" (p. 441).

15 _tyme of lenth._ In modern phrase, "length of time," and Skeat
accordingly follows Hart's edition in so reading it. But "of lenth"
is a common attributive phrase and may quite well stand here, though
awkward to modern ears. In line 531 we have _this warld of lenth_ for
"the length of this world," which is a close enough parallel, and will
not admit of alteration. In _Wyntoun_, too, occur such phrases as, "a
merke schot large of lenth" (_Bk._ ix. 27, 419).

37 _Quhen Alexander the King was deid._ As in the first line of the
well-known double verse given by Wyntoun as a fragment of the time;
"Quhen Alexander our Kinge was dede." Wyntoun, in his extract from _The
Bruce_, here reads _oure_. Alexander III. was killed by falling, with
his horse, over the cliff at Kinghorn in Fife, on March 19, 1286.

39 _six yher._ Rather less. Alexander "was dead" on March 19, 1286,
which Barbour would reckon as 1285. The dispute over the succession
began on the death of Queen Margaret on September 26, 1290.

40 _lay desolat._ Barbour, it may be from considerations of space or
symmetry, or as a Bruce partisan, omits all mention of the child-Queen
Margaret (1286-1290); Bruce "the Competitor," indeed, held that his
claim was superior to hers, and on Alexander's death started a rising
apparently against the succession of a female contrary to the ancient
customs of the country. In his pleadings before Edward he claims to be
"higher in degree and more worthy in blood" even than she (_Palgrave_,
pp. 30-31). To the reign of Balliol (1292-1296) there is reference
later; but no notice is taken of the rising under Wallace (1297-1298)
nor of the Barons' War (1299-1304); the former was carried on in the
name of King John, and the latter was mainly a Comyn affair. Robert
Bruce (King) took a fitful share in both operations on the national
side, but ended as an active partisan of Edward I. (but see note on
611).

49 _sum wald haiff the Balleol king._ The active heads of his party
were Sir John Comyn of Badenoch and William Fraser, Bishop of St.
Andrews, two of the Guardians (_Palgrave_, p. 18). These two had
assumed the control of the government (p. 16).

51 _eldest systir was._ The direct line of William the Lyon having
failed, recourse was had to that of his brother, David Earl of
Huntingdon. David's only son died without issue. His eldest daughter,
Margaret, was the mother of Devorgoil, or Devorgilla, mother of John
Balliol who was thus the great-grandson of the Earl, and of the senior
female branch. David's second daughter, Isabella, had married Robert
Bruce of Annandale father of the Competitor, who was thus the son of
the second daughter, as Devorgilla was the daughter of the first.

54 _in als nere degree._ The legal phraseology used throughout by
Barbour corresponds with the pleadings submitted by Bruce. These
(Anglo-French) are given in full by Palgrave in his _Documents and
Records_, vol. i.; the Latin version from the _Great Roll_, printed
in Rymer's _Foedera_, vol. i., is only a notarial summary. Barbour,
however, does not put the issue clearly. In the "branch collaterale"
(_en lyne collateral_) of Earl David, Bruce was "in als nere degre"
(_aussi pres en degre_) as Devorgilla. But Devorgilla was dead before
the vacancy in the throne occurred; she had never been vested in the
succession, and thus had no rights to transmit to her son (_cf._ 59,
60). The heritage, therefore, on the death of its possessor, came
by law to him who was then nearest in blood--that is, to Bruce, as
grandson of Earl David; for John Balliol, as great-grandson, was a
degree further away (_qe en Sire Roberd de Brus meilleur dreyt deit
reposer qe est plus procheyn du saunk qe en Sire Johan de Balliol qe
est en plus loyngteyn degree._--_Palgrave_, p. 34, Sec. 8). Though modern
historians have scouted Bruce's plea, it was quite sound for the Middle
Ages. Bruce himself cites a contemporary case in Castile, where a
younger brother was, by the law of the Visigoths--_i.e._, their version
of Roman law--preferred to the son of the elder.

58 _nocht to lawer feys lik._ Balliol urged that the same law applied
to kingdoms as to earldoms, and that thus a kingdom should pass to the
next heir by seniority, "without any regard to nearness of degree"
(_Palgrave_, 27, Sec. 3). To this Bruce replies that kings are above the
laws, and that the right to a kingdom should not be judged by common
law, nor by laws applying to subjects and subject fiefs (29, Sec. 5; 27,
Sec. 3), but by "the laws by which kings reign," the "law of nations"
(_dreit naturel_, 25, Sec. 5); and he therefore appeals to Edward as "his
Emperor" to judge accordingly (29, Sec. 6), on the analogy of the German
or Holy Roman Emperor, who was, in theory, the superior of Christian
kings in temporal matters (_cf._ on 153). Balliol rebuts this with
the further contention that the issue is not one of "imperial law,"
since "the kingdom of Scotland is held of the Crown of England and of
no Empire"; and that it would be to the prejudice of Edward's Crown
rights (_en prejudice de la coroune notre Seigneur le Roi_) if he
judged the matter in his Court by imperial law (p. 43). Bruce, it will
be observed, takes higher ground than Balliol, and presents a special
interpretation of the (alleged) overlordship, on which see further note
on 153. The distinction may seem over-refined to modern minds, but to
the medieval mind, with its own "imperial" idea, it was both real and
important. Bruce had other pleas in support of his main position, but
on these Barbour does not touch (_cf._ on 153).

61 _in lyne evyn descendand._ The correct reading is fixed by the legal
phrase, _en la dreyte lyne descendant_ (_Palgrave_, p. 31, Sec. 2).

62 _Thai bar ... on hand._ Skeat says that "to bear on hand often
signified to 'assert strongly,'" and interprets it here as, "They
asserted." But this is meaningless in the present context, and the
correct significance is as in Chaucer, "For _he bar hir on honde_ of
trecherye" (_Complaynt of Faire Anelida_, line 158); and in _Troilus_
(1154-1155), "She _bar him on honde_ that this was don for malice":
hence, here "accused" in the sense of "controverted," on the lines laid
down in 59-64. The weaker sense is probably seen in _Prologue of the W.
of B.'s Tale_, 380, 575, etc.

67 _Erle off Carryk._ The Competitor was not Earl; it was his son,
father of King Robert, who married the widowed Countess of Carrick.

71-5. _thai all concordyt._ "The nobles, by unanimous consent, decreed
among themselves to send serious (_solemnes_) messages to Edward King
of England that in this cause he should be their higher judge" (Fordun,
_Gesta Annalia_, lxx.). The parties were at bitter variance, and there
was no other authority strong enough to enforce a decision (_ibid._).
In fact, civil war was impending. On this account, Bishop Fraser of St.
Andrews had already written to Edward on the matter (October, 1290).
From this letter we gather that Balliol was about to approach Edward
on his own behalf. The "Seven Earls" appealed in support of their own
rights to elect a king (_Palgrave_, p. 14). Bruce submitted his claim
to Edward, as against the guardians, who favoured Balliol (_ibid._,
pp. 17, 18). Hemingburgh says that the Guardians of Scotland, fearing
a popular outbreak, by the advice of the magnates sent to the King
of England, that in a matter of such great doubt they might have the
benefit of his advice (_ejus consilio fruerentur_, ii., p. 31).

88 _as freyndsome compositur_--_i.e._, "as a friendly arbiter" (_cf._
Hemingburgh in previous note). Fordun urges that the appeal did not
imply any confession of overlordship, but Edward was appealed to as
a "friendly and distinguished neighbour" (_amicabilis et vicinus
praestantior_), to settle the difference "in the manner of a friendly
compositor and for the sake of neighbourliness" (_Gesta Annalia_,
lxx.). The first notice in Sir Thomas Gray's _Scalacronica_ puts it
that the Scots asked Edward to interfere in the interests of peace,
and that he replied that he would consider the matter. At Norham
the Scottish magnates are said to have asked him to try the case as
sovereign lord (pp. 112, 119).

100 _Walis ... Ireland._ Edward I. crushed the main Welsh rising in
1282, and in 1284 annexed the principality. He took no special part in
the conquest of Ireland, which belongs to the reign of Henry II. (1171).

103 _ryn on fute._ This, I take it, reflects the fact that Edward
usually drew upon Wales and Ireland for the foot in his army. At
Falkirk, indeed, Hemingburgh says that nearly all the English foot were
Welsh. _Cf._ also XIII. 419 _ff._

140 _on Saracenys warryand._ Edward was in England. His crusading took
place before he ascended the throne (1270-1272). The _Scalacronica_
says he was at Ghent (p. 112).

146 _ane assemble._ Edward met the prelates and barons of Scotland at
Norham, May 10, 1291. In his safe-conduct granted to these, Edward
declares "that this shall not be a precedent to the prejudice of
Scotland" (Bain's _Calendar_, ii., No. 474): _i.e._, their meeting him
on English ground.

151 _all the senyhowry._ Edward had meanwhile (March 8, 23) sent writs
to the cathedrals and chief monasteries of England, requesting to be
furnished with extracts from histories and chronicles respecting the
relations between England and Scotland. The responses are given in
_Bain_, ii., No. 478, and _Palgrave_, pp. xcvii-cxv (see next note).

153 _to Robert the Bruys said he._ Palgrave points out that Bruce
was the first to appeal to Edward as overlord, in conjunction
with the "Seven Earls" with whom he was acting; all submitting
themselves--relatives, friends, adherents, lands and goods--to the
protection of the King and Crown of England (pp. xlviii, 15, 18). In
this he finds nothing inconsistent with the speech here attributed to
Bruce, which he takes, not from Barbour, but from Fordun, who gives the
same account as Barbour of Edward's offer and Bruce's reply (_Gesta_,
lxxii.). For Palgrave regards the original historic supremacy as a
vague imperial relation, to which Edward tried to give a narrow feudal
precision (p. xliii). Bruce, he says, could properly regard himself "as
the _Laensman_ of the Monarch who represented the Bretwald, the Emperor
or Basileus of Albion, or of Britain, and not the vassal of the King of
England and Duke of Normandy" (p. xlix). Bruce, indeed, in one section
of his pleadings addresses Edward as "his Sovereign Lord and his
Emperor" (p. 29, Sec. 6), but his pleading was against the purely feudal
relationship (see on 58), the holding "_in cheyff_" (154), which would
allow Edward the _dominium_ or ownership of Scotland, as contrasted
with the _suzerainty_, which would grant a power of control. Edward
insisted on the former.

169 _Assentyt till him._ After a delay of three weeks (June 2-3, 1292),
nine of the Competitors made full acknowledgment of the supremacy of
the King of England; the others acquiesced on August 3 (_Bain_, ii.
483, 507). The issue was finally narrowed down to a consideration of
the respective claims of Balliol and Bruce. Barbour is misleading.

171 _He was king._ Judgment in favour of Balliol was given on November
17, 1292, at Berwick. Balliol resigned "his kingdom and people to" the
King of England on July 7, 1296, "a litill quhile," three years and
seven months after.

173 _For litill enchesone._ Balliol was treated as an ordinary vassal,
and finally summoned, with the Scottish magnates, to attend Edward on
an expedition into France (June 29, 1294). Balliol, however, made a
treaty with King Philip IV. In October he wrote Edward renouncing "the
homage extorted from him by violence" (_Bain_, ii., No. 722). This was
followed up by a raid into England in the spring of 1296. Meantime the
government had been taken out of Balliol's hands, and was administered
by twelve Scottish barons and prelates.

189 _And stuffyt all._ The list of castles and towns committed to
Englishmen and Scottish supporters of Edward is given in _Bain_,
ii., No. 853. Gray says Edward took possession of all the castles of
Scotland (_Scala._, p. 123).

193 _He maid off Inglis nation._ The offices of Governor, Treasurer,
and Justiciar, as well as minor ones, were filled by Englishmen. Some
of the appointments of Sheriffs, etc., are given in _Bain_ as above,
and in Stevenson's _Historical Documents_, II., pp. 90, 91. Barbour
overstates the case.

194 _That worthyt than sa ryth felloune._ Gray says that the revolt of
the conquered territories in Scotland under Robert Bruce was in great
measure due to "the bad government of the ministers of the King, who
governed them with too great harshness for their own personal gain"
(_qi trop asprement lez governoient pur singuler profit._--_Scala._, p.
140).

250 _in disputacioun._ For the "disputations" of clerks, _cf._ Chaucer,
_Nun's Priest's Tale_ and _Franklin's Tale_, 162.

259 _I leve all the solucioun._ As Mr. Neilson has pointed out (_An
English Miscellany_, p. 383), this is a quite serious reference to a
class of questions discussed by ecclesiastical lawyers. A whole book
(ix.) is devoted to the _Redditio Debiti Conjugali_ in the volume by
Thomas Sanchez, one of the Salamanca doctors (_De Sto. Matrimonii
Sacramento_; Venice, 1625). Chaucer's _Wife of Bath_ has some
characteristic remarks on the same subject:

  "Why sholde men elles in hir bookes sette
  That man shal yelde to hys wyf hire dette?"

  (_Prologue_ to _Tale_, 129, 130. _Cf._ also 154, 155).

282 _Put in presoun Sir Wilyham was._ Sir William Douglas, "the bold"
(_le Hardi_), joined Bruce and the other lords who followed Wallace in
rising, and formed a camp at Irvine in July, 1297. When these submitted
and surrendered, Douglas, for not fulfilling his terms of surrender,
was confined in Berwick Castle. Thence he was taken to the Tower, where
he died before January, 1299. His Scottish lands were given to Sir
Robert de Clifford (_cf._ lines 285-7).

293 _that hym ne dred._ _Cf._ note on _Bk._ XX. 514.

313 _James of Douglas._ "James is, in general, dissyllabic in Barbour"
(Skeat).

323 _will off wane._ See glossary, and note on _Bk._ II. 471.

339 _Erle off Artayis._ This is probably the Count Robert of Artois,
who was a friend of Queen Isabella and her son Edward III. He was
driven from France (_Le Bel_, i., chap. xix., and notes in ed. 1904).
He wandered from place to place, after quarrelling with King Philip,
for three years; then crossed to England, disguised as a merchant
(1334), which fact Barbour probably has here in his mind (_Memoires de
l'Academie Royale_, vol. x., p. 635. Paris, 1733).

343 _Catone sayis._ Dionysius Cato, a writer of the fourth century.
The reference is to his line, "To pretend foolishness is, at times,
the highest wisdom" (_Stultitiam simulare loco prudentia summa est._
_Disticha de Moribus_, Bk. ii. xviii; Ed. Amsterdam, 1754, p. 178).

346 _then come._ See on 282.

354 _the byschop._ William Lamberton. Edward sent to the Pope a lengthy
list of charges against Lamberton, who had broken his most solemn oaths
of fealty and shared in the "rebellions" against him. He had, when
Chancellor of Glasgow, supported Wallace, and had himself chosen Bishop
of St. Andrews, on Fraser's death, without Edward's consent. Then,
with other lords, he went to France to do all the mischief he could
there against Edward, and sent letters of encouragement to Wallace.
After the suppression of the rising, he again submitted and took the
oaths (see on 412), and was made chief of the Guardians of Scotland. He
was suspected of complicity in the murder of Comyn (see on 611), and
immediately supported Bruce. Arrested after Methven, he was imprisoned
with Bishop Wishart of Glasgow, though not guilty of so many perjuries
as he. These two bishops (with the other Scottish clergy), were the
principal "abettors and maintainers" of Bruce's rising (_Palgrave_, pp.
331-340; also _Bain_, ii., as indexed). Lamberton was released in 1308,
on giving securities for good behaviour and swearing fealty to Edward
II. (_Bain_, iii., No. 50). Thereafter he acted as a negotiator between
England and Scotland (_Bain_, iii.). He was excommunicated, and was one
of the four bishops (St. Andrews, Dunkeld, Aberdeen, Moray) summoned by
the Pope in 1319 to answer for their support of Bruce (_Lanercost_, p.
423). He died some time before June, 1329 (_Bain_, iii., p. 316).

356 _forouth him to scher._ So did Chaucer's Squire: "And carf biforn
his fader at the table" (_Prologue_, 100).

381-2. _But he wes nocht so fayr, etc._ _Cf._ of Porrus, in the
_Alexander_:

  "Bot he was nocht so fare suthly,
  That men _need_ speke of him gretly,
  For he was broun red in visage" (p. 176).

399 _And wlyspit alsua._ Guido delle Colonne says that Hector
"stammered a little in his speech" (_parum vero erat balbutiens in
loquela._ See on 525): and so in the _Gest. Hystoriale_ of Hector, "a
little he stotid" (stammered) (line 3881).

403 _Till Ector._ In the _Alexander_ that monarch is the incomparable
hero:

  "Bot Alexander I tak beforne,
  To him I mak na man compeir" (p. 110).

406 _lovyt._ "praised" (see Glossary).

412 _Byschop Wylyhame._ Lamberton, as Edward says, went to him at
Stirling on May 4, 1304, and again took the oath of fealty, receiving
from Edward's hands the temporality of his bishopric (_Palgrave_, p.
334). "Strevellyne," with several variations of spelling, is the usual
form in contemporary records.

429 _my fay feloune._ See on 282.

455 _thaim thai._ "Thaim" refers to the Scots; "thai" to the English.
Barbour is particularly careless in the use of this pronoun. In 458
"thai" is again the English, who were sometimes rather more ("erar
may") in proportion; in 460 "thaim" is the Scots.

466 _in the Bibill._ The deeds of the Jewish patriots, as recorded in
the apocryphal Books of the Maccabees, were, of course, included in
the Vulgate Bible of the Church. The rising of the Maccabees and their
supporters against the over-rule of the Seleucids in the latter half
of the second century B.C. was, for the medieval writers, the prime
example of a national uprising against foreign dominance. (See also
_Bks._ II. 330; XIV. 313.)

477 _I spak of ayr._ Here Barbour appears to refer to the Competitor,
last mentioned in line 153, thereby confusing him with his grandson
Robert the King. Much grave reproof has accordingly been wasted upon
the poet. According to Maxwell, the poem "has been almost irretrievably
discredited as a chronicle by a monstrous liberty which the author
takes in rolling three personages" (Competitor, Robert "the elder," and
the King) "into one ideal hero" (_Robert the Bruce_, p. 6). Mr. Brown
accuses Barbour of having "deliberately and consciously perpetrated the
fabrication" of making his hero a trinity of these three (_The Wallace
and Bruce Restudied_, p. 93). Barbour, it is to be observed, at worst
only combines two, grandson and grandfather--he says nothing of the
intermediate Robert; unless we force what is said in line 67 to this
sense. One chronicler alone distinctly achieves the feat of making the
three one person--Geoffrey Baker of Swinbroke (pp. 100-1)--but so far
he has escaped censure, and no one rejects his work on that account.
Surely in Barbour's case it is but a striking case of his frequent
carelessness of reference (see on 445). He started with King Robert,
his subject, in line 25, and it is not too much to ask that "I spak
of ayr" goes back to that point. This is a simpler way out than that
inconsistently taken by Mr. Brown, who argues that, after all, the
reading is probably wrong, and proposes to restore "the original"
from Wyntoun's lines, a paraphrase of Barbour (p. 95). Wyntoun was
not deceived, nor was anyone likely to be. Barbour had nothing to
gain by purposeless perversity, not even a literary point as has been
suggested, for the "Romance" proper begins at line 445, and for it
there is but one Robert.

478 _swa forfayr._ "Going to ruin." _Cf._ _Gest. Hystoriale_, "Fele
folk _forfaren_," ready to perish (1438). Modern Scots in sense of
"neglected," as in Thom's _Mitherless Bairn_; "sairly _forfairn_."

485 _Said till him._ Gray gives a similar account of the alternative
proposals here made, putting them, however, into the mouth of Robert
Bruce, who, with him, takes the initiative, and stating that they
were made upon the occasion of the meeting in the Greyfriars Church,
where Comyn refused to listen to them. It must be remembered that
Barbour admits the existence of various accounts. Gray supplies also
the significant motive: "for now is the old age of the present English
King" (_qar ore est temps en veillesce de cesty roy Engles_, p. 130).
Bruce, in this account, speaks of the land being in servitude to the
English by fault of Balliol, "who suffered his right and his freedom
of the kingdom to be lost" (_qe son droit et la fraunchise du realme
ad lesse perdre_, p. 129). The account in Fordun gives Bruce the
initiative in making the offer on the ride from Stirling, and dates it
1304 (_Gesta Annalia_, cxiii.). See note on _Bk._ II. 35.

525-6 _Dares ... and Dytis._ These two represented to the medieval mind
the more trustworthy authorities on the Siege of Troy; Homer, whom they
knew only through the Latin classics, being obviously biassed in favour
of the Greeks, a strong objection to historians who loved to attribute
the beginnings of their nation to a colony of Trojan fugitives--_e.g._,
Brutus, who founded Albion or Britain. Dares Phrygius, whose _De
Excidio Trojae_ is merely a good-sized pamphlet, here comes first as
the favourite. Figuring as a priest of Hephaestus, he gives the Trojan
side. The point of the present reference is that he makes Troy fall
by the treachery of AEneas and others, who admit the Greeks by night
at the Scaean gate on the outside of which "was painted the head of a
horse" (ed. London, 1825, p. 336); thus rationalizing the story of the
wooden horse as he does Homer's other remarkable incidents. The book
is in Latin, and is late--not much earlier than the twelfth century.
It professes, however, to have been translated from a Greek manuscript
found at Athens by the translator, Cornelius Nepos! Dictys Cretensis,
styled companion of Idomeneus, stands for the Greek side, giving,
however, a more impartial account than Homer. His MS. (_Ephemeris
Belli Trojani_) was found, it is alleged, in Gnossus, Crete, in one
of the tin (lead) coffers, examples of which have been found in the
recent explorations of the great palace. It was translated from the
original Punic into Greek in the time of Nero and again translated
into Latin. It is the older production of the two by a few centuries;
both, of course, are fabrications. On them Benoit de Sainte-More based
his _Roman de Troie_, which Guido delle Colonne turned into a Latin
_Historia Trojana_ and successfully passed off on the Middle Ages as
his own work. Scotland came under the spell of Guido, and it is from
him Barbour takes his information.

533 _throw pusoune._ The account of the medieval romances of Alexander.
He really died in 323 B.C., of a combination of malarial fever and hard
drinking--which was much too tame an end for his admirers.

542 _fryst maid emperour._ A usual medieval error, but Julius Caesar
did not become Emperor. Chaucer says the same thing (_Monk's Tale_).
Geoffrey of Monmouth speaks of "Julius Caesar and the rest of the Roman
kings"--a double error (_Edit. Giles_, 1844, p. 176). See below on 554.

549 _Als Arthur._ Arthur's European conquests are enumerated in the
contemporary, _Morte Arthure_, p. 2. The Eastern ones, such as "Surry"
(Syria), follow the triumph over Rome.

554 _Lucius Yber._ "Sir Lucius Iberius, the Emperor of Rome," is a
leading figure in _Morte Arthure_. Wyntoun observes that his correct
title was Procurator, as the Emperor proper was Leo, but excuses the
earlier author for calling him Emperor on that ground that,

  "Ane empyroure in propyrte (in especial)
  A comawndoure suld callyt be" (_Bk._ v., Chap. xii.):

_i.e._, Emperor is simple _imperator_. In fact, Geoffrey styles him
"Lucius Respublicae procurator" to begin, but in the account of his
death, "Lucius imperator" (ed. cited, pp. 174, 198). In the _Gest.
Hystoriale_, Agamemnon is "Emperor" of the Greeks. On conclusions from
this passage, see _Appendix_ F.i.c.

611 _The endentur, the seile to se._ Fordun, too, tells of "endentures"
(_indenturas_) between the barons, and of Comyn's disclosure to Edward,
but gives a different account of Edward's action and Bruce's escape.
Wyntoun adopts Barbour's version in his own words, so that we may
take it that, substantially, the story was the current explanation
in Scotland. Gray, too, it must be remembered, drew upon a Scottish
chronicle (see on 485 and _Introd._, ii.). It may just be that there
was a confusion as to the origin of the indenture which caused the
mischief. There actually was an indenture or bond between Bruce and
Bishop Lamberton, drawn up, too, in 1304, the year to which Fordun
attributes that between Bruce and Comyn. In this the parties bound
themselves to act together, in matters affecting them, against all
persons whatever, and provided that neither should attempt any
"difficult business" without consulting the other, and that, in the
case of any peril threatening, each should warn and shield the other
to the utmost of his power. The implication is clear: a fresh rising
was in contemplation, probably on the death of Edward I. (_cf._
Gray in note on 485). A copy of this document came into Edward's
hands--certainly not, however, through the agency of Comyn--and
Lamberton was charged before witnesses at Newcastle on August 3, 1306.
He was asked whether the seal was his (_cf._ line 612), and whether it
had been affixed with his will and knowledge; to which he answered in
the affirmative (_Palgrave_, 323-5). The story of this endenture may
have got worked into what was known of Comyn's refusal to co-operate
with Bruce. The records give no hint of anything else of the kind in
Edward's possession, and the knowledge of it, had it existed, would not
have been suppressed (see also note on _Bk._ II. 17).

625-6 _into bourch, etc._ _I.e._, Bruce pledges his lands as bail for
his appearance. There is no record of such a Parliament, nor is any
such procedure at all probable.


BOOK II.

17 _Thai raid._ The account in Fordun is that one night, "when the wine
was giving its colour in the cup" (_cum merum splenderet in calice_),
Edward, on his way to bed, explained that on the morrow Bruce would
lose his life. Thereupon the hint of his danger was conveyed to Bruce
by the Earl of Gloucester (_i.e._, Randolph or Ralph de Monthermer), in
the form of twelve silver pennies and a pair of spurs (_Gesta Annalia_,
cxiv.). Gloucester was presently in the field against Bruce. Edward
declared that up to the time of the rupture, Bruce had enjoyed his
"full confidence" (_Foedera_, ii., p. 988).

17 _on the fyften day._ Bower says the seventh day (_Scotich_, Lib.
xii., Cap. vii.). But the news of Comyn's murder on February 10 seems
to have reached Edward (at Winchester) not long before the 23rd,
probably only a day or so (_Bain_, ii., No. 1746), and this would be
carried quickly.

18 _Louchmaban._ Bruce's castle in Annandale.

32 _Schyr Jhone the Cumyn._ According to both Gray and Hemingburgh,
Bruce first sent his two brothers, Thomas and Neil, to ask Comyn
to meet him at Dumfries; Gray says that they might kill him on the
way, which, to Bruce's disquiet, they failed to do; Hemingburgh that
he might discuss with Bruce certain matters affecting them both
(_Scala._, p. 129; _Chronicon_, ii., p. 245). Sir John Comyn "the Red"
was Balliol's nephew, the son of his third sister (_Scala._, p. 121),
and his wife was a sister of Aymer de Valence. He came to Dumfries from
Dalswintion, not far away.

33 _In the Freris, at the hye awter._ Edward informed the Pope that
Comyn was murdered "in the church of the Friars Minor (Franciscans)
of Dumfries, near the high altar" (_Palgrave_, i., pp. 335, 346). The
"high altar" is part of the setting in all the accounts. The date is
February 10, 1306.

34 _with lauchand cher._ Hemingburgh says they embraced in the cloister
(_mutuo se receperunt in osculum_, p. 245).

35 _The endentur._ According to Fordun, Bruce, on his way home, had
met a messenger of Comyn carrying to Edward letters advising the
imprisonment or death of Bruce. He had killed the messenger and taken
the letters, and it was with these he now confronted Comyn (_Gesta
Annal._, cxv.). Gray relates that Bruce now made Comyn the proposal
described in note on _Bk._ I. 485, which Comyn refused to entertain,
whereupon Bruce said: "I had other hopes of you from the promises of
both you and your friends; _you have betrayed me to the King by your
letters_, and, since you cannot live to accomplish my wish, take your
reward" (_pur quoi viaunt ne pusse eschever moun voloir, tu auras toun
guerdon._--_Scala._, p. 130). Hemingburgh's version is that Bruce
accused Comyn of treason, _in that he had denounced him to the King
of England_, and lowered his standing to his loss (p. 246). Edward's
account to the Pope is that Comyn would not assent to the treason
which Bruce proposed--that is, to renew the war against him, and make
himself, by force, King of Scotland (_Palgrave_, 335).

36 _hym reft the lyff._ The other accounts are more detailed, and agree
in stating that Bruce merely wounded Comyn, and that his followers
completed the work: "In the middle of the church, before the altar,"
says Gray; "on the steps of the high altar, which was stained with his
blood," according to Hemingburgh (as cited).

37-38 _Schyr Edmund Comyn ... And othir mony._ Barbour is wrong in the
name; it was Sir Robert Comyn, John's uncle (_Fordun_, _Lanercost_,
_Gray_, _Hemingburgh_, _Palgrave_, as cited). Sir Edmund fell at
Bannockburn (_Annal. London_, p. 251). No other fatalities are
mentioned. Hemingburgh adds that Bruce took the Castle and forced the
English justices, then holding court, to surrender, but allowed them to
depart in safety (p. 246).

40 _that debat fell othir wayis._ "That the quarrel came about
otherwise." Barbour was familiar with, at least, another version. _Cf._
previous notes.

67 _drawyn and hangit._ See note on _Bk._ IV. 322.

81 _the byschop of Androws towne._ On June 9 Lamberton writes to Aymer
de Valence, Edward's lieutenant in Scotland, that no blame attached to
him in the matter of the death of John Comyn and his uncle, or for the
beginning of this war (_Palgrave_, p. 322).

86 _Thomas prophecy._ Thomas of "Hersildoune" is Thomas of Ercildoune
(now Earlston), or Thomas Rhymer whose alleged prophecies had a great
vogue in Scotland for hundreds of years, especially at a national
crisis. One such was current with the Jacobites of the Forty-Five.
A MS. of the first quarter of the fourteenth century gives a long
prediction by Thomas in answer to the question when the Scottish War
should end (_Thomas of Ercildoune_, E.E.T.S., pp. xviii, xix). It
contains the line, "When Bambourne (? Bannockburn) is donged wyth dede
men." _Cf._ _Bk._ XIII. 336-340.

92 _befor the byschop schar._ See note on _Bk._ I. 356.

96 _the burdys down war laid._ _I.e._, the boards which formed the
table were removed from the trestles after dinner.

107 _wald disherys._ Bruce's lands had been immediately confiscated and
distributed to others (_Bain_, ii.; s.v. Earl of Carrick).

112 _the Clyffurd._ See note on _Bk._ I. 282.

118 _Ferrand._ Also the name of the horse of Emynedus, Alexander's
comrade, in the _Alexander_. "Ferrand" means "iron-grey," as in _Morte
Arthure_: "one _ferant_ stedez" (2259, etc.). Like "Blanchard" (white)
a common name for a horse.

148 _Aryk stane._ At the head of Annandale.

179 _wes maid king._ On the Feast of the Annunciation, March 25, 1306
(_Lanercost_, 203; _Hemingburgh_, 247; _Scala._, 130).

187 _went out our the land._ Malise, Earl of Strathearn, presented
a memorial to the King of England, explaining how Bruce, after his
coronation, had summoned him to give homage, how he had refused at
first, but was apprehended, and submitted in order to save his life
(_Palgrave_, pp. 319-21). According to Hemingburgh, it was after
Comyn's murder that Bruce went round Scotland (_circuivit terram
Scociae_), seizing and fortifying castles, etc. (II., p. 246). There
was scarcely time at that stage.

200-1 _Schir Amer the Vallang._ Sir Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke,
sent to put down Robert Bruce, etc., April 15, 1306 (_Bain_, ii., No.
1762). In Barbour's spelling the "g" is soft. Valence had taken an
active part in the Scots' war since Falkirk, and figures, as before
that date, in the _Wallace_. He was now about twenty-six years of age
and practically a professional soldier.

204 _in all hy._ Valence was to enter Scotland at once; the Prince of
Wales and then Edward himself were to follow. Edward, however, wished
to hear of "some good exploit, if possible, before their arrival"
(_Bain_, ii., No. 1773).

205 _And byrn, and slay, and rais dragoun._ Edward, writing to Valence
on June 12, is "well pleased to hear he has burned Sir Simon Fraser's
lands in Selkirk Forest." He is "to do the same to all enemies on his
march," "to burn, destroy, and waste their houses, lands, and goods"
(_Bain_, ii., No. 1782). In later letters these commands are repeated
for specific instances. On June 28 he is "referring to his orders to
put to death all enemies and rebels already or hereafter taken" (No.
1790). The expression "rais dragoun" has been fully explained and
illustrated by Mr. Neilson in the _Scottish Antiquary_, vol. xii.,
No. 48. His summary is as follows: "In the middle of the fourteenth
century, and later, there was still prevalent the conception ...
that the dragon banner was a token of hostility more deadly than the
ordinary conditions of feudal and chivalric warfare countenanced.
Its display in every example adduced was against subjects in revolt,
however supposititious, as at Crecy, the claim of sovereignty might be"
(p. 151). The origin and development of this association is the subject
of Mr. Neilson's article. _Cf._ also in _Morte Arthure_, "For thare es
noghte bot dede _thare the dragone es raissede!_" (line 2057).

211 _Philip the Mowbray._ He is among those with Valence given by Gray
(_Scala._, p. 130). See on Mowbray, _Bk._ XIII. 363.

212 _Ingram the Umfravill._ He had taken an active part in previous
years on the national side. He is among the "Scotsmen and late rebels"
who, on October 10, 1305, had their lands in Scotland and England
restored on renewing their fealty to Edward (_Bain_, ii., No. 1696).

215 _off Scotland the maist party._ It is not clear what Barbour
precisely means. But, according to Gray, Valence had with him several
Scottish barons, friends of Comyn, opposed to Bruce (_Scala._, p.
130); and a fortnight before the battle Edward was requesting Valence
"to inform the King's foresters of Selkirk how they have loyally and
painfully served the King, and done well" (_Bain_, ii., No. 1782).
Fordun says that Valence had in Perth "a great power of both English
and Scots" (_Gesta Annalia_, cxix).

235 _Levynax._ _I.e._, Lennox, otherwise _Levenauch_. Malcolm "Comte de
Levenaux" is on _Ragman Roll_ (_Bain_, ii., p. 209). He was the fifth
in the line of Celtic Earls. _Cf._ on 482.

Atholl is John de Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl. He was among the first
to join Bruce, and it was by his advice that the safe-conduct to
Strathearn was broken and the Earl confined in Inchmacolm (see on 187).
He was captured after Methven, and, as he was of royal blood, was
spared torture, but was hanged "higher than the rest" (_Hemingburgh_,
ii., p. 250): on a gallows thirty feet higher (_Scala._, p. 131). He
was alleged to be the son of Edward's aunt, but see _Genealogist_, N.S.
xxii., p. 105.

236 _Edward the Bruce._ Robert's brother.

237 _Thomas Randell._ Thomas Randolph, the King's nephew, afterwards
Earl of Moray. For his change of side, see on 463. _Hew de le Hay_ is
on Ragman Roll, apparently of Fife (_Bain_, ii., p. 204); brother of
Gilbert de la Hay, afterwards Constable of Scotland and ancestor of the
Earls of Errol.

238 _David the Berclay._ David de Berkele on Ragman Roll (_Bain_, ii.,
209); of Cairns, in Fife (_Hailes_, ii., p. 2. Ed. 1797). _Cf._ on
_Bk._ XIX. 19.

239 _Fresale, Somerveile, and Inchmertyn._ _Fresale_ is "Alexander
Fraser" (see line 407). Jamieson identifies him as "the brother of
Simon Fraser, of Oliver Castle, in Tweeddale," which is Hailes's
statement (_Annals_, vol. ii., p. 2), and Skeat follows, whence arises
a serious confusion in _Bk._ VIII. 397. Sir Simon Fraser, "filius," of
Oliver, to distinguish him from his father ("pater"), and grandfather
of the same name, the hero of the English defeat at Roslin in 1302,
was captured and executed as a traitor in 1306. His brother was Thomas
Fraser, and neither seems to have left any descendants (Lord Saltoun's
_Frasers of Philorth_, ii., p. 94). This Alexander Fraser was of the
same stock, but was the elder son of Sir Andrew Fraser of Touch-Fraser,
Stirlingshire, Sheriff of Stirling in 1293, and was afterwards
Bruce's Chamberlain of Scotland (_ibid._, p. 125). He was not "Sir"
Alexander till after 1312 (_ibid._, i., pp. 49, 54). Bruce granted him
"Tulch-fraser" afresh (_Reg. Mag. Sig._, p. 17, 86). He had a brother
Simon, but a different Simon from the one Jamieson refers to (see note
on _Bk._ VIII. 397). "Fresale," Jamieson adds, "is still the vulgar
pronunciation of the name in Lothian." _John de Somerville_ was second
son of Sir Walter de Somerville of Linton and Carnwath (_Memorie of
the Somervills_, i., 83, 86). _Inchmertyn_ is David de Inchmartyn, who
was, according to Hailes, the ancestor of the Earls of Findlater and
Airlie, and of Lord Banff (_Annals_, vol. ii., p. 3, note. Ed. 1797).
_John de Somerville_ and _David de Inchmartyn_ are among the fifteen
Scots captured at Methven and sentenced to death at Carlisle on August
4, without being allowed to plead, under the charge of "feloniously and
wickedly slaying some of the King's liegemen" at that battle. They were
all hanged (_Bain_, ii., No. 1811).

*243 _Cristall of Setoun._ See line 418 and note on _Bk._ IV. 16. He
was married to Cristina Bruce, Robert's sister (_Bain_, ii., No. 1910):
twenty-eight years of age.

*244 _Robert Boyd._ Ancestor of the Viscounts of Kilmarnock
(Robertson's _Index of Charters_, p. 6, No. 46). He was captured at
Kildrummy (_Bain_, ii., No. 1829), but must either have escaped or been
released, as he appears again. See _Bk._ IV. 342; VIII. 415.

247 _Sanct Johnstoun._ Perth. The church was dedicated to St. John.

248 _bad Schyr Amery isch to fycht._ Hemingburgh writes that Bruce
sent a message that the English should either come out to fight or
surrender (ii., p. 248); Gray that Bruce offered battle to the Earl
(of Pembroke), and remained before the town from the early morning
till after noon (_Scalacronica_, p. 130). Noon would be dinner-time.
Trivet briefly says that Bruce "invited" Valence to come out and fight
(_Annals_, p. 409); similarly Rishanger (_Chronica_, p. 230).

252 _Schir Ingram._ According to Gray, Pembroke acted on the advice of
his Scottish lords, and lay low (_se teint tot coy_, p. 130).

279 _bot gyf thai faile._ "If they do not fail on their part."

301 _on the morn cum._ The English, "seeing they were fewer in number,
cautiously replied that they would not come out then, because it was
a feast day (Sunday, June 26), but would gladly fight with him on the
morrow" (_Hemingburgh_, ii., p. 249. _Cf._ also Trivet's _Annals_, p.
410; Rishanger, _Chronica_, p. 230).

305 _went to the forray._ The English had calculated that the Scots
would be occupied in preparing food (_Hemingburgh_).

310 _Ischyt in-forcely._ At vespers (_Hemingburgh_: _Trivet_).

313 _wes unarmyt then._ Had put off his armour. Hemingburgh says they
found the Scots carelessly resting (_recumbentes secure_: as cited);
Trivet that they came on the Scots suddenly, and slew many unarmed (p.
410). Bruce and some others speedily armed themselves and resisted
(_ibid._).

319 _on thair hors lap._ According to Hemingburgh, the English attacked
before all the Scots could mount. Gray says they formed up hastily, and
all on horseback attacked the English (_Scala._, p. 131).

330 _For multitud mais na victory._ "For the victory of battle standeth
not in the multitude of an host" (I. _Maccabees_, Chap. iii., 19).

340-1 _Cf._ in _Alexander_:

  "Quha for his Lord dois he sall be
  Harbreid with Angellis gle" (p. 21).

365 _all the renk._ Skeat has a note on this word explaining renk as "a
rank of fighting men," and citing "the plur. form renges" in Chaucer's
_Knight's Tale_ (Globe, _Chaucer_, A 2594). But while there is a form
_renk_ = rank, that is not the word or the sense here. The proper
explanation comes from the _Alexander_, in such examples as:

  "Ane _renk_ about him hes he made,
  Quhair evir he straik nane him abade" (p. 145, 8-9).

and

  "Ane _renk_ about him hes he maid,
  He sparit nane that him abaid" (p. 231, 20-21);

while we have a similar use in the _Morte Arthure_:

  "Ryde thrughte all the rowtte, rerewarde and other,
  Redy wayes to make, and _rennkes full rowme_."

Another passage from the _Alexander_ gives us the sense in the setting
and phraseology of the passage on hand:

  "The woundit gave cryis and granes,
  Trumpettis and hornes blew atanes,
  _It seemit all the countre quok_" (p. 412, 29-31).

_Renk_, then, has nothing to do with "rank," but signifies "an open
or clear space"; here "all the place about them quaked." It is, in
fact, our modern "rink," and appears to be a form of "ring," as in
"prize-ring" (Skeat's _Etymol. Dict._). It has nothing to do with
"range" in the sense of "rove," as Mr. Amours thinks (_Alliterative
Poems_, S.T.S.). H actually reads _rinke_.

415 _hynt hys rengyhe._ The account in Gray is that Bruce's rein was
seized by John de Haliburton, who let him go immediately when he saw
who he was. The difficulty about recognition was due to the fact that
Bruce showed no coat of arms, having on a white tunic (_un chemys
blank._--_Scalacronica_, p. 131). Hemingburgh says that all the mounted
Scots, in their approach to Perth, had these white overalls (_super
omnia arma vestem lineam_), so that they could not be identified (ii.,
p. 248).

438 _corn-but._ This reading for the obscure _torn-but_ of E (_t_ and
_c_ are often indistinguishable in MS.) and _combat_ of H is due to Mr.
George Neilson, basing on a passage in the _Morte Arthure_ (_Scottish
Antiquary_, July, 1902, p. 51). The "heathen king" is down with a
mortal wound from Sir Cador, who exclaims:

  "Thow has _corne botte_, sir kynge, there God gyfe the sorowe,
  Thow killyde my cosyn, my kare is the less" (1837-8).

Though the general meaning of "revenge," "tit-for-tat," is clear,
no satisfactory analysis of the phrase has been offered. Skeat and
Gollancz think that the first part of the term is French--_corne_,
a horn "as the symbol of pride"--and that the compound signifies
"a requital for pride, a taking down." The passages will scarcely
bear this. Moreover, _bot_ is admittedly old English--"remedy,
atonement"--and one shies at a solitary compound in such a case.
_Mann-bot_ was a fine paid to the lord of a murdered man; _brycgbot_
was a levy for the repair of bridges; _corn-gesc(e)ot_ was a
contribution of corn. _Corn-bot_ may thus have been a fine for the
destruction of corn, and have taken on a general sense of requital or
revenge. It does not seem to require the force of a specially intense
revenge (_auserlessene busse._ Holshausen), but appears to have been a
slang term, whence its rare occurrence in literature. It is not given
in the _New English Dic._ (See further _Scottish Antiquary_. June,
1903, pp. 121-123; _Notes and Queries_, 9 Series, x. 61, 115, 253).

463 _Thomas Randell._ He was given in ward to Sir Adam de Gordon to
be kept till the King's arrival in Inverkip Castle (_Bain_, ii., No.
1807). Gray says he was released at the instance of Gordon, when he
remained English till his recapture (_Scala._, p. 131).

467 _sum thai hangyt._ See on 235, 239.

471 _will of wane._ "Astray in thought (weening); distracted, at
a loss. _Will_ = modern English _wild_, astray, bewildered (Icel.
_villr_). _Cf._ in the _Gest. Hystoriale_: "All wery I wex and _wyll of
my gate_" = out of my way (line 2369).

479 _the Boroundoun._ This name has puzzled editors and given rise to
a good deal of conjecture. But a Sir Walter de Borondone was constable
of Carstairs Castle in 1305-1306 (_Bain_, ii., No. 1880), and he is the
same person as Sir Walter de Bourghdon, constable there in 1301-1302
(_ibid._, No. 1290), of Roxburghshire (_ibid._, p. 199). He was an
English officer.

482 _The Erle of the Levenax wes away._ Fordun, however, says that
Lennox and De la Hay alone followed Bruce, and became "his inseparable
companions (_comites individui_) in every tribulation" (_Gesta Annal._,
cxxi.). _Cf._ _Bk._ III. 591.

491 _Schir Nele Cambell._ Ancestor of the Campbells of Lochow, or Loch
Awe, and so of the Argyll family. He married Mary Bruce, the King's
sister, but not, it would seem, before 1312 (_Scots Peerage_, i., p.
323; but see on xvi. 119). The grant of "Lauchaw" was to their son
Colin (Robertson's _Index_, pp. 16, 18).

494 _the Month._ "The mountain which is called the Mound, which
stretches from the western to the eastern sea" (_De Situ Albaniae_, MS.
Paris; cited in _Historians of Scotland, Innes' Essay_, p. 412). The
modern Grampians.

513 _Nele the Bruys ... and the Queyn._ _Neil_ or Nigel (Nigellus)
Bruce was the King's brother. His Queen was Bruce's second wife, a
daughter of Richard de Burgh Earl of Ulster.

514 _othir ladyis._ Fordun says all the ladies went with their husbands
and the King, hiding in the woods, etc. (_Gesta Annal._, cxix.).

529 _King Adrastus._ One of "the Seven against Thebes," and the only
one who returned home in safety. Barbour follows neither the Greek
sources nor the Thebaid of Statius, but one of the many French romances
on the subject. See _Appendix_ F.

534 _Campaneus._ Properly _Capaneus_, who was struck with lightning by
Zeus, whom he had defied, while attempting to scale the walls of Thebes.

542 _the tour._ See note on _Bk._ XVII. 224.


BOOK III.

1 _The Lord of Lorne._ Strictly this should be Alexander Macdougall of
Argyll or of Lorn, but probably his son, John of Lorn, is meant, as
on September 14 Edward writes to the Prince of Wales how "Sir John of
Argyll has well served him and the Prince" (_Bain_, ii., No. 1830).

3 _his emys sak._ Alexander of Argyle, according to Wyntoun (_Bk._
viii., Chap, vi., 1171) had married an aunt of the murdered John
Comyn, a daughter of Sir John Comyn "the Red" (!), of Badenoch, his
grandfather. He was thus the "eym" or uncle of Comyn, not his nephew
(_Scots Peerage_, i., 507).

15 _thar fryst metyng._ According to Fordun, this skirmish took
place at Dalry ("the King's field"), near Tyndrum, in the west of
Perthshire, on August 11, 1306 (_Gesta Ann._, cxx.). Bruce was making
his way westwards by Glen Dochart. There is the usual "King's Cave" in
Balquhidder (Jamieson).

62 _ane sik aw._ "In such awe." For this form, _cf._ _Alexander_ (78,
5), "he stude of thame lytill aw," and _Wallace_ (_Bk._ v. 929), "On
thaim he raid, and stud bot litill aw." This usage is a stage in the
grammatical development of the modern phrase from the original type,
"Awe of one stood men" (_dat._), for which see N.E.D.

67 _Marthokys sone._ Jamieson suggests _Marthok_ to be for
_Muratach_ (_Muredach_) = _Murdoch_; so "Marthokys sone" = MacVurich
(_MacMhuirich_).

69 _Fyn all._ Here E gives _hym all_, which is clearly wrong. Skeat
adopts _Fyngall_ from H and A. Better, however, is the more ancient
and correct form, _Fyn_, which the scribe has turned into _hym_,
while the "all" is preserved to balance the "all" in the next line.
Golmakmorn is _Goll mac Morna_, head of the Clann Morna, the rivals of
the _Fianna_, and the reference is to the detachment of members of his
band from Finn by Goll; Finn, indeed, perished in a conflict with rebel
followers.

75 _in Gadyrris the forrayours._ The reference is to one of the later
episodes in the _Romance of Alexander_, appearing in the Scottish
_Alexander_ as _The Forray of Gadderis_ (_La Fuerre de Gadres_).
Alexander, while besieging Tyre, sends out a body of men to forage in
the "vale of Josaphas." On their return with the cattle, they are set
upon by a large army under Betys of "Gaderis," one of whose followers
was Gaudifer. Only the timely arrival of Alexander saved his men,
and, on the flight of Betys, Gaudifer maintained the struggle till he
was slain. Skeat says that Barbour could not have used the Scottish
translation, dated 1438, but "must have seen it in an earlier form."
Lines 81, 82, however, correspond literally, with one exception, to the
passage in the _Alexander_, and, according to Neilson, they have no
place in the original French (_John Barbour_, p. 55):

  "For to defend all the flearis
  And for to stony the chassaris" (p. 88, 20).

_Coneus_ (line 85) is there _Corneus_ (pp. 88, 89), and _Danklyne_,
_Danclyne_ or _Danclene_--in the French original _Corneus_ and _Dans
Clins_. _Cf._ Brown's _Wallace_ and _Bruce_, p. 101, where, however,
Mr. Brown's transcription of the names in the _Alexander_ must be
checked; and see further _Appendix_ E. In the _Wallace_ there is a
similar reference to _The Forray_, _Bk._ x. 340-2.

101 _"the Durwarth sonnys."_ "The Durward or door-ward's sons," a
translation of the Gaelic name _Mac-na-dorsair_, "son of the door-man."
Skeat has a long note, contributed by Dr. Murray, claiming that "no
writer seems to have seen the point of this passage." Reference is
accordingly made to the trouble caused by Alan Durward in the reign
of Alexander III., and the connection of Durward with Nicholas de
Soulis, one of the Competitors (see also on _Bk._ XIX. 11). Whence it
is inferred that these "men were the clansmen of Alan the Durward,
who, like the Comyns of Badenoch, the Baliols, and others, were almost
more dangerous to Bruce than the arms of England." That can scarcely
have been the case, since it must also be taken into account (1) that
the Bruces were of the Durward party in the reign of Alexander III.,
and (2) that an Alan Durward was hanged with Nigel Bruce at Berwick,
having, apparently, been captured at Kildrummy (_Scala._, p. 131).

153 _a baroune Maknauchtan._ The chief of the Macnaughtons (? Ferchar
or Farquhar), whose father was of the time of Alexander III., an
ancient clan having lands near Loch Awe (_Cf._ _Coll. de Reb. Alb._, p.
51). There is no "Duncan" (Jamieson following Nisbet, _Heraldry_) in
the genealogy.

162 _his owtrageous manheid._ _Cf._ in _Alexander_, "outtragius
hardement" (p. 184, 16). This use of "outrageous" = extreme or
excessive, is common, if not peculiar, to the _Alexander_ and the
_Bruce_. _Cf._ in _Bruce_, vi. 126; viii. 270; ix. 101; xi. 32:
_Alexander_, 235, 8; 258, 30; 335, 9.

172 _"sa our Lord me se."_ "May our Lord watch over me," as in
Chaucer's _Pardoner's Tale_, "Now, lordes, God yow see" (Group C, line
715).

208 _Hanniball._ The reference is to Hannibal's crushing defeat of
the Romans at Cannae, 216 B.C. Barbour takes his details in a rather
huddled fashion from _Martinus Polonus_, a popular monkish historian
of the thirteenth century (_Chronicon de Gestis Romanorum_, etc.),
who again bases on _Paulus Orosius_, of the beginning of the fifth
century. Wyntoun confessedly reproduces the chapters of Polonus at
greater length and more accurately than Barbour, and on this fact,
viewed in the light of the general relation of Wyntoun to Barbour, and
certain peculiarities in the present case, Mr. Brown bases an argument
that the Hannibal passage is "derived from the _Cronykil_" and "an
interpolation" in the _Bruce_. On this see _Appendix_ F, v. Mr. Brown
gives in full the relevant portions of the text of Polonus and Orosius
(_Wallace and Bruce_, pp. 120-7).

211 _thre bollis, etc._ "Tres modios aureorum anulorum Carthaginem
misit, quos ex manibus interfectorum nobilium extraxerat" (_Mart.
Pol._).

216 _Scipio the king._ For the medieval usage in titles, _cf._ also
note on _Bk._ I. 554. Polonus calls Scipio _Tribunus militum_; Barbour
(and Wyntoun) translate _milites_, from the contemporary use of the
word, as "knights"; whence "the Tribune of the knights" naturally
suggests the title "King," Wyntoun preferring "chyftane." _Cf._ also
what is said in the footnote. It may, however, be considered that in
the _Alexander_ we have "Gaudifer the yhing" (121, 20), and "Ideas the
yhing" (161, 26).

221 _knychtis._ Really only "soldiers" (_milites fecerunt_).

231 _Thai ischit._ Barbour hurries over the interval of four years
between the Battle of Cannae and Hannibal's appearance before the walls
of Rome, 212 B.C.

234 _throw mycht of Goddis grace._ _Divina miseratio_ in _Mart. Pol._
and _Orosius_.

242 _twys thar-eftir._ No; only twice altogether. But Barbour is
apparently summarizing from memory, though Mr. Brown repudiates the
suggestion (p. 126).

281-2 _That hym thocht, etc._ From Lucan's _Pharsalia_: _Nil actum
credens, si quid superesset agendum_ (ii. 657).

337 _Kildromy._ Kildrummy Castle, in Aberdeenshire, on the Don, a royal
castle which Edward had ordered Bruce, in September, 1305, to place "in
the keeping of one for whom he shall answer" (_Bain_, ii., No. 1691).

365 H has flatly misunderstood this line, and Skeat's partial
emendation therefrom introduces a use of _the quhilk_ rare in Barbour
(see on XVIII. 225). Moreover, as Koeppel further points out, the
sense of the passage implies an antithesis such as E gives. The only
difficulty is the redundant syllable _yt_, and for _confort_ alone,
_cf._ V. 210, XV. 371 (_Englische Studien_, x., p. 380, note).

373 _to the wynter ner._ Kildrummy fell before the middle of September,
1306, but August is scarcely "near" winter, even in Scotland.

390 _hys werdis, etc._ "Follow out his fate (werdis) to the end."

392 _Nele Cambel._ See note on _Bk._ II. 491.

437 _Ferambrace._ The romance of _Fierabras_ or _Ferumbras_ (_ferri
brachium_, "iron-arm" or "strong-arm") was the most popular of the
Charlemagne romances. It still circulates among the French peasantry.
There are two versions of it in English of the fifteenth century, _Syr
Ferumbras_ (E.E.T.S.) and _The Sowdone of Babylone_ (E.E.T.S.). The
latter also has the peculiar form _Lavyne_ from _Laban_ for _Balan_,
the Sowdone or Sultan and father of Fierabras. On these points see
_Appendix_ F, iii. _Olyver_ (439) is Oliver, one of the "duk-peris"
(440) or "twelve peers" (_douze pairs_) of Charlemagne, and _Syr
Ferumbras_ opens with the account of how he defeated Fierabras in
single combat, which also begins the second division of the Sowdone.
The French knights are, however, trapped by the Saracens and confined
in the castle of _Egrymor_ (441), or Aigremont, in Spain, but are
released and joined by Floripas, the daughter of Balan, and make
themselves masters of "the tower" (449). They are the twelve peers,
though Barbour makes them "bot eleven" (444), probably with reference
to the one who was slain in the defence. But they lack provisions, and
news of their plight is carried to Charlemagne by Richard of Normandy
(450). Charlemagne, who, supposing them slain, was on his way home to
France, turned back with his army, seized the marble bridge over the
river _Flagot_, which was warded by a giant, and captured the great
tower of _Mantrible_ on the other side (445). Thereafter Lavyne, or
Balan, is defeated and captured, and, later, executed; the Christians
recover from Floripas the sacred relics carried off by Fierabras from
St. Peter's, Rome. The "sper" (459) is the spear with which the side
of the crucified Jesus was pierced by the Roman soldier; the crown is
the crown of thorns; "the naylis" are the nails with which he was fixed
to the cross. In the _Complaynt of Scotlande_ (E.E.T.S., p. 63) is a
reference to the _Tail_ (tale) _of the Brig of the Mantrible_. Readers
of _Don Quixote_ will recall "the balsam of Fierabras," which also
figures in the romance. On Mr. Brown's treatment of this passage, see
_Appendix_ F, iii.

493 _will of red._ "At a loss what to do"; _red_ = "rede," counsel,
advice. See note on _Bk._ II. 471.

517 _but anger._ "Without trouble or sorrow."

561 _To tell of paynys, etc._ An allusion to Virgil: _Forsan et haec
olim meminisse juvabit_ (_AEneid_, i. 203).

578 _mony frely fute._ "Many a handsome _child_" is Skeat's
explanation, taking "fute = fode, one fed or nourished up." But in
the _Morte Arthure_, Gawain says to Mordred, who was no child, "Fals
fosterde _foode_, the fende have thy bonys" (3376); and "frely" also
occurs as in, "Thow arte _frely_ and faire," etc. (970); whence Barbour
just means, "many a goodly or handsome person."

584 _the hyde leve on the tre._ "They left the skin on the wood of the
oars," being unaccustomed to the rough work of rowing.

588 _To furthyr thaim, etc._ "To carry them on in their floating."

658 _our stycht._ "Our fixed purpose or determination." _Cf._ A.S.
_stihtan_, to establish (Skeat). The _Morte Arthure_ has the related
verb, "styhtyll tha steryn men"--_i.e._, "place these stern men" (line
157): _styhtlen_, to dispose.

659 _Angus of Ile._ Angus Macdonald, known as Angus Oig ("the
younger"). His elder brother, Alexander of Islay, or of the Isles,
was in the English interest, and had married Juliana of Lorn, sister
of John of Lorn. Their father, Angus Mor ("the big or elder"), had
supported the Bruce party during his life, taking an active part with
it in 1286. Angus also was English (_Rot. Scot._, i., 40, 41) till the
appearance of Bruce. His lands were in Kintyre (see further _Scots
Peerage_, i., 36, 37).

666 _Donavardyne._ The castle of Dunaverty, at the south end of
Kintyre. It was being besieged, for some days at least, before
September 22, by the English pursuing Bruce (_Bain_, ii., Nos. 1833,
1834), who believed that he was inside (_Hemingburgh_, ii. 249;
_Trivet_, p. 410).

680 _Rauchryne._ Now Rathlinn, off the north coast of Ireland towards
Kintyre. Dean Monro (1549) calls it _Rachlinn_, but Jamieson gives
ten variations of the name from Archdall's _Monastic. Hibern._,
including _Rachryne_ and _Rochrinne_, "from the multitude of trees
with which it abounded in ancient times." Surprise has been expressed
that Bruce should have chosen for retreat an island four miles off the
Irish coast, which was within the territory of the Bissets of Antrim,
strong English partisans, and in which he could be trapped by a fleet.
Not, however, till January 29-30, 1307, do we find a fleet in being,
supplied by Hugh Bysset and John de Mentieth, which was to operate in
"the Isles on the Scottish coast" "in putting down Robert de Brus and
his accomplices lurking there, and destroying their retreat" (_Bain_,
ii., p. xlix, Nos. 1888, 1889). Hemingburgh says (and _Trivet_, 410)
that Bruce had gone "to the farthest isles of that region" (_in
extremas insulas_, ii. 249). "Was lurking in remote island" is the
account in _Lanercost_, p. 205.

688 _strait off Marrok._ The Strait of Gibraltar, so called also by
Chaucer in the _Man of Lawes Tale_.

696 _the mole._ The "Mull" of Kintyre. Gaelic _maoil_ = a promontory, a
borrow of the Norse _muli_. It is "le Moel de Kintyr" in an indenture
in _Bain_, ii., No. 1941.

745 _loud and still._ A romance phrase for "in all ways," "under all
circumstances." Henryson has it in his _Robene and Makyne_, "I haif
thee luvit _loud and still_."


BOOK IV.

10-12 _off na degree ... Nothir of the kyrk_, etc. The Lanercost writer
notes that among those hanged at this time were not only "common folk
and countrymen" (_simplices laici et rurales_), but also "knights,
clerics, and prebendaries"--the latter in spite of their profession
that they were "members of the church" (p. 204).

13 _byschop Robert._ Robert Wischard, or Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow
since 1273. He had been, at one time, a Guardian of the Kingdom, and up
to 1306 had taken the oath of fealty to Edward six times. He had taken
a share in the rising of Wallace, had absolved Bruce for his murder
of Comyn, and had furnished the robes for his coronation, further
stirring up the people by declaring that to fight against Edward was as
meritorious as to go on a Crusade. Edward sent to the Pope a long list
of charges on these lines (_Palgrave_, pp. 340-350). He was captured,
"as a man of war," in the castle of Cupar, Fife, shortly before June
18 (_Bain_, ii., No. 1780; _Palgrave_, p. 349); at which Edward was
"almost as much pleased as if it had been the Earl of Carrick" (_Bain_,
ii., 1786). He was kept a prisoner till after Bannockburn (see note on
_Bks._ I. 354, XIII. 687; and _Scot. Hist. Rev._, vol. v., pp. 86-88).

14 _Marcus of Man._ Mark, Bishop of Sodor (_i.e._, of the "Sudereys,"
the "South Isles," or Hebrides, or of Man and the Isles), had been
imprisoned with Wishart in 1299. He had taken a prominent part in
Scottish affairs on the national side, and had been one of the
"auditors" in the case of the Competitors (_Palgrave_, p. 53).
Apparently, however, he had died some years before, in 1303, so that
Barbour is post-dating his imprisonment (Keith's _Catalogue of Scottish
Bishops_, ed. 1824, p. 301).

16 _Crystoll of Seytoun._ See note on _Bk._ II. *243. Hemingburgh
says he was captured in "the castle of Lochdor," for which we should
probably read "Lochdon," which fixes the reading in the text (_Hem._,
ii. 250). Lochdon or Loch Doon, source of the river Doon, in Ayrshire,
had a castle of which Sir Gilbert de Carrick, ancestor of the Earls
of Cassilis, was hereditary keeper. Its traitorous surrender was the
subject of a remission "of all rancour of mind conceived" on this
account by King Robert to Sir Gilbert (_Reg. Mag. Sig._, i., p. 115,
8). The castle was being besieged on August 10 by Sir Henry de Percy,
and had fallen before October (_Bain_, ii., Nos. 1819, 1841). Jamieson
had identified his "London" with Lochdon, and has a long note on the
matter.

19 _Maknab._ In the remission above referred to, the castle is said to
have been surrendered "into the hands of the English" by Sir Gilbert's
son-in-law, when Seton was given up.

29 _in Ingland._ In this Barbour seems to be wrong. Hemingburgh says
Edward ordered him to be taken to Dumfries, and there to be drawn,
hanged, and beheaded (ii. 251). Gray, too, says he was executed at
Dumfries, but erroneously adds that he had been captured at Kildrummy
(_Scala._, p. 131). He was "the late" Christopher de Seton on October 4
(_Bain_, ii., No. 1841). Hemingburgh and Gray both explain that Seton
was an Englishman, and had killed a knight at Dumfries. Bruce founded
and endowed a chapel to his memory near that town (Robertson's _Index_,
p. 13, No. 89).

36 _Schyr Ranald Crauford._ Sir Ranald, or Reginald, Crauford, Edward's
Sheriff of Ayr in 1296 (_Bain_, ii., No. 853). Under March, 1307,
there is a list of rewards by Edward to Dougal Macdowall and others of
Galloway for the capture of "Sir Ranald de Crauford and other enemies"
(_Bain_, ii., No. 1915), these being Robert's brothers Alexander and
Thomas, and their friends, who made a descent on Galloway, with the
result stated above, February 17, 1307 (_Lanerc._, p. 205; _Bain_ iv.
p. 489).

37 _Schyr Bruce the Blair._ As Jamieson points out in his note, the
reading "Bruce" (S) should more properly be _Bryce_ or _Brice_. Sir
Bryce was an ancestor of the Blairs of Blair, in Ayrshire. In the
_Wallace_ it is "Schyr Bryss the Blayr" (_Bk._ vii. 209). Conversely
Brys for Bruce (IV. 61, etc.).

38 _a berne in Ar._ The _Bruce_ being undoubtedly one of the sources
of the _Wallace_ this is--in part, at least--the origin of the famous
outrage of "The Barns of Ayr," there told in _Bk._ VII. as before the
Battle of Stirling Bridge, 1297. Crawford and Blair are expressly named
among the sufferers on that occasion. Crawford is claimed as Wallace's
uncle (_Bk._ i. 25-27).

39 _dame Marjory._ Bruce's daughter by his first wife, Isabel, daughter
of Donald Earl of Mar. She afterwards married Walter, the High Steward
(see _Bk._ XIII. 689).

47 _the gyrth of Tayne._ The enclosure or "sanctuary" attached to
the chapel of St. Duthac, at Tain, Ross-shire, a favourite place of
pilgrimage with the Scottish kings, especially James IV. There was,
however, no privilege of sanctuary for treason. William Earl of Ross
was in the English interest, and on May 20, 1308, is the recipient of
thanks from Edward II. "for faithful service to his father and himself"
(_Bain_, iii., No. 43). Hemingburgh says "the new Queen" was taken
in Kildrummy (ii. 249); Gray that Cristina Bruce was captured there,
and the Queen and Nigel Bruce in Dunaverty (_Scala._, p. 131); Trivet
agrees with the second statement, but obviously confuses (p. 410);
according to Fordun the Queen was taken at Tain, and many ladies at
"Kyndrumy" (_Gesta Ann._, cxx.).

49 _thai of Ros._ Fordun says the Queen was seized at St. Duthac's by
the Earl of Ross (_Gesta Ann._, cxx.).

55 _put the ladyis in presoune._ On November 7, 1306, there are
"further orders for the custody of the Countesses of Carrick (the
Queen) and Buchan, Marie, and Christine, the sisters, and Margerie the
daughter, of Robert de Bruce ... three of the ladies to be in 'kages.'"
(_Bain_, ii., No. 1851). The Countess of Buchan, who had crowned Bruce,
was to be placed in a cage of wooden bars and lattice in one of the
turrets of Berwick Castle (_Palgrave_, p. 358; _Scala._, p. 131); Marie
Bruce in a "kage" in Roxburgh (_Palgrave_, 359); Marjory in a "kage" in
the Tower of London (359); Cristina in ward in England (_ibid._). The
Queen was to be in custody at "Brustewik" (p. 357); was removed thence
by an order of June 22, 1308 (_Bain_, iii., No. 48). Marjory was in
ward at Wattone in March, 1307 (_Bain_, ii., 1910). By 1311-1312 Maria
de Brus is a prisoner in Newcastle (_Bain_, iii., 227, 340).

57-65 The Cambridge MS. begins at line 57. Lines 59-66 do not read
satisfactorily in either MS., and the text is a composition from both
with a view to clearness.

80 _And set a sege._ The Prince of Wales was in command at Kildrummy
when it fell, shortly before September 13 (_Bain_, ii., No. 1829). Gray
says the castle was invested by Thomas Earl of Lancaster and Humphrey
de Bohun, Earl of Hereford (_Scala._, p. 131).

83 _He bad distroy._ _Cf._ note on _Bk._ II. 205.

96 _bargane at the barras._ "Barras" or "barrace" is a "barrier" or
outwork before a fortress, usually of wood. _Cf._ _Wallace_:

  "Off hewyn temyr in haist he gert thaim tak
  Syllys off ayk, and a stark _barres_ mak" (_Bk._ x. 829-30).

115 _the mekill hall._ One form of the tradition is that the corn or
forage was stored in the chapel of the castle and there set on fire
(O.S.A., xviii. 417); another, that on the east side is the "Black
Lardner," so called because it was burnt in the siege (Macfarlane's
_Geog. Coll._, i., p. 29). Fordun says simply that the castle was lost
by treachery (_Gesta Annalia_, cxx.).

134 _wes battalit all_, etc.--_i.e._, had battlements on the inside of
the wall, as well as on the outside. The former case was unusual, but
fortunate here because the besieged could thus shelter themselves from
the fire within.

181 _Snawdoune._ Kildrummy is said to have had seven towers, of which
one on the west side still stands, with the name of the "Snow Tower"
(_Geog. Coll._, i., p. 28). There was a "Snowdoun" also at Stirling,
and Sir David Lindsay, in the _Complaynt of the Papingo_, addresses
Stirling Castle as "fair Snowdoun." Nisbet speaks of a Snowdoun Castle
in the county of Ross as an ancient residence of the Scottish kings
(_Heraldry_, ii. 166). The name is, undoubtedly, old, and in its
present form probably a corrupt assimilation to more familiar syllables.

189 _in-to Northumberland._ Edward was certainly in Northumberland in
the autumn of 1306, being at Newcastle on August 8 (_Bain_, ii., No.
1816), at Newburgh, in Tynedale, August 28 (_Foedera_, ii., p. 1018).
He was delayed in Northumberland by sickness but passed the winter of
1306-1307 at Lanercost, near Carlisle, to which, on "account of old age
and weakness," he came by easy stages in a horse-litter, arriving on
September 29, and staying till Easter of the following year, March 26,
1307 (_Chron. de Lanercost_, p. 205). Barbour thus antedates his death,
which took place at Burgh-on-Sand, "three (about five) miles north of
Carlisle," on July 7, 1307 (_ibid._, 207; _Hem._, ii., p. 266).

211 _In Burch I wist weill_, etc. This is a familiar type of story, the
"dowbill undirstanding," told of several historic personages: of Henry
IV., to whom it had been prophesied that he should die in Jerusalem,
and who died in the "Jerusalem chamber," Westminster (Shakespeare's _2
Henry IV._, Act IV., Scene 5); of Cardinal Wolsey, and others.

220 _Ane spirit._ Archbishop Sharpe was reported to have a "familiar
spirit," which he carried in a snuff-box in the form of a bee!

241 _Erle Ferrandis moder._ Ferrand was an historical personage, a
Prince of Portugal, who, by marriage, became Earl of Flanders. The
story of the oracle which can be read in two ways, is also one of which
there are many examples from that of the utterance of the Delphic
oracle to Croesus, as told by Herodotus. Ferrand is in the _Morte
Arthure_:

  "One sir Feraunt before, upon a fayre stede,
  Was fosterde in Famacoste, _the fend was his fadyre_"

  (2760-61).

_Famacoste_ is Famagosta, in Cyprus.

249 _Bosbek_ or Busbecq was in Flanders, west of Courtrai.

253 _in Inglis._ Barbour calls his own language English, as the Scots
poets do down till the fifteenth century (see on _Language_, _Appendix_
G).

256 _Mynerff._ Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, etc. For the early
and mediaeval Christians, the ancient deities were demons.

282 _in the fechting._ Ferrand and the Emperor Otho IV. were defeated
at Bouvines, between Lille and Tournai, July 27, 1214.

322 _"hangis and drawis."_ It was Edward I. who regularized the
horrible form of punishment allotted to traitors, several examples of
which have already been noted. The victim was first drawn by horses
on a rough cart through the principal streets, as Fraser was through
the streets of London, then hanged, next taken down before he was dead
and decapitated. The head was then stuck up on a public place, if the
victim was sufficiently notorious, and the limbs might be similarly
exposed, as was done with Wallace. Fraser's heart and entrails
were burned, and his body was again hung up till about three weeks
afterwards, when it and the gallows were burned together. For Fraser's
case, see _Ann. Paul_, pp. 148, 149. For the grammatical forms, see
_Appendix_ H.

336 _To King Robert._ The narrative now goes back to the closing months
of 1306.

338 _till the wyntir neir wes gane._ Too long a period. On February
1, 1307, Edward is ordering out ships to hunt for Bruce "towards Ayr"
(_Bain_, ii., 1893).

367 _In-to Kintyre._ Hemingburgh has it that about September 29, 1306,
Bruce came back from the islands and waited in Kintyre, and sent
some men over to Carrick, who lifted his rents for Martinmas. Trivet
has an account which is simply a careless abridgment of Hemingburgh
(_Hemingburgh_, ii. 251; _Trivet_, 410). Nothing is said of Arran, but
these writers are not strong in geography. Hemingburgh says Bruce had a
force of "Irish" (_Hibernicis_) and Scots (_ibid._). "Irish" suggests
Rathlin, or they may be west-islanders.

384 _Schir John the Hastyngis._ Sir John de Hastings had been the most
important of the Competitors, next to Balliol and Bruce, being the
grandson of the youngest daughter of the Earl of Huntingdon. On May 22,
1306, he received from Edward a grant "of the Earldom of Mentethe in
Scotland, with the Isles" (_Bain_, ii., No. 1771). In July or August,
1307, he is one of the garrison of Ayr Castle (_ibid._, 1901).

388 _Brathwik._ Brodick.

421 _neid to fourty._ In line 405 he says the English were in all
"thretty and ma"!

464 _The King arivit._ On the west side of the island, opposite
Campbelltown, is the _King's Cove_, where, as tradition says, "King
Robert de Bruce and his retinue lodged ... for some time when taking
shelter in retired places" (_Old. Stat. Acct._, vol. ix., p. 167).

466 _in a toune._ Not "in a town" in the modern sense, but in the Scots
meaning of any group of houses or buildings--_e.g._, a farm "toun."

556 _Turnberys snuke._ Turnberry Point, on the coast of Ayrshire,
the site of the castle of the Earls of Carrick. The castle was in
possession of Henry Percy, to whom Edward had granted Bruce's Earldom,
as is stated in lines 599-600 (_Hem._, ii. 251). The point at Berwick
was known as "le Snoke" (_Hist. Docts._, ii. p. 160). S reads "nuk"
from C.

682-3 _Jeromy_ = Jeremiah. _Ysay_ = Isaiah.

720-1 "The constellation that gives to them kindly manners"--_i.e._,
natural dispositions. _Cf._ "kyndly" = naturally, in line 735. For
"manners" = character, _cf._ Chaucer. _The Dethe of Blaunche_:

  "She used gladly to do wel,
  These were hir _maners_ everydel" (1012-13).

747 _Nigramansy._ "Necromancy," or the art of revealing the future
through communication with the dead (Gr. _nekros_, a dead body);
appearing in mediaeval Latin as _nigromanteia_; O.F., _nygromancie_, the
first part of the compound being confused and identified with Latin
_niger_, black--whence "the black art."

753 _the Phitones._ The _Pithoness_ or _Pythoness_, which usually
appears in the M.E. writers as in the text. _Cf._ Chaucer's _Hous of
Fame_, iii. 171: "And _phitonesses_, charmeresses," etc. Pythia was
the oracle-giving priestess of Apollo at Delphi; hence a woman who
prophesies or divines. The name was given, as in the reference here, to
the witch of Endor (1 _Chron._ x. 13), as in Bacon, _Prophecies_, etc.,
"Said the _Pythonissa_ to Saul," etc.


BOOK V.

1 _in vere._ "In spring"--February, 1307 (see note on _Bk._ IV. 338.)
The description here is really of the "Poets' May."

23 _na nedill had na stane_; _i.e._, neither an actual needle
magnetized, nor a piece of magnetic iron, loadstone, to serve as a
compass.

24 _in-till ane._ "In a straight course," guiding themselves by the
fire.

90 _till the toune._ _Cf._ note on III. 556. Hemingburgh's account is
that Bruce, coming on him suddenly, attacked Percy by night and slew a
few of his company (ii. 251). _Cf._ 95, etc. Fordun says Bruce captured
and destroyed one of his own castles, slew the garrison, and divided
arms and other spoils among his men (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxi.). This is
not Barbour's version, which is the right one. _Cf._ on 107, 118.

104 _Makdowall._ Probably, as Jamieson suggests, the Dougall Macdowall
who, about this time, defeated and captured Bruce's brothers in
Galloway. See on _Bk._ IV. 36.

107 _In the castell._ See above on 90. According to Hemingburgh, "Bruce
besieged Percy in the castell till the siege was raised by an English
army" (ii. 251). There were desertions, February 18, among troops
called out to deal with Bruce (_Parliam. Writs_, i., p. 379).

118 _All haill the reif._ Bruce had captured their steeds and silver
plate (_Hemingburgh_, as cited); steeds and much other spoil (Trivet's
_Annals_, p. 410).

133 _a lady of that cuntre._ Fordun says that Bruce was assisted in
returning to Carrick by Christian "of the Isles," who "had a kindness
for him" (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxi.), but the lady here would seem to be
of Carrick, and a relative. _Cf._ on _Bk._ IV. 367. Fordun is probably
right as to the name, and Barbour as to the location, for "Cristiane de
Carric" had, afterwards, a pension of forty shillings "at the King's
(Robert's) pleasure" (_Excheq. Rolls_, i., p. 114).

151 _the Erle Adell._ See on _Bk._ II. 235.

153 _till his party war heldand._ There were others who were no longer
"inclining" to his party; Allan, "late Earl of Menteith," Sirs Patrick
de Graham, Hugh Lovel, William de Moray of Sandford, Walter de Moray,
and other adherents, had "come to the King's (Edward's) peace to be in
law" in November of the previous year; and Thomas Randolph, too, had
gone over (_cf._ _Bk._ II. 463 note).

156 _Cristole of Setoun._ See note on _Bk._ IV. 16.

174 _Bot quhar worschip_; _i.e._, in fair fight on the field of battle.

192 _Bot lay lurkand._ On February 6 there is a letter from Edward
to the Bishop of Chester, his Treasurer, expressing "great wonder at
hearing no news of Sir Aymer de Valence and his forces since he went to
Ayr," and requesting him to order Valence, Percy, Sir John de St. John
and others to send particulars of what they are doing and of the state
of affairs. He states also that "he hears they have done so badly that
they do not wish him to know" (_Bain_, ii., No. 1895). On February 11
there are letters to the same effect, sent direct to Valence, the Earls
of Gloucester and Hereford, St. John, and Percy (_ibid._, 1896).

203 _Schir Gauter the Lile._ Sir Walter de Lisle.

205 _schavalduris._ Skeat explains this as "wanderers," and says "the
right form seems to be _shaveldour_, a vagrant" (Glossary). Jamieson
takes it to mean "wanderers in the woods, subsisting by hunting." There
were bands of "schavaldurs" on the Border, who robbed and plundered
(_Bain_, iii., No. 675); but John de Harcla had "schavaldurs" in his
employment (_ibid._, p. 128). Clerk "Helias" was a _schavaldus nobilis_
(_Stevenson_, p. 2; _Bk._ XVI. 441 note). The exact force of the word
is not yet clear. Probably they were what later times knew as "broken
men."

231 _the Clyffurd._ _Cf._ note on _Bk._ I. 282. Ancestor of the
Cliffords, Earls of Cumberland.

256 _Toward Douglas._ In the valley of the Douglas (Gael: _dubh glas_,
black water), a tributary of the Clyde, in Upper Lanarkshire. In Bain's
_Calendar_ is a petition from one of the garrison in Douglas Castle,
"when Sir Robert de Brus and Sir James de Douglas attacked it, the year
when the late King (Edward I.) died" (iii., No. 682).

296 _manrent._ "Homage"; Scots form of "manred" (A.S. _mannraeden_,
homage, allegiance). "Bonds of manrent" are a familiar form of
association with some great noble in later Scottish history.

307 _Palme Sonday._ March 19, 1307.

317 _mantill._ For long a mantle or cloak was the upper garment of the
Scots, rich and poor.

336 _Sanct Brydis._ The church of Douglas was dedicated to St. Bridget,
or Bride, a Celtic Saint.

388 _With burdys set._ On trestles, as the dinner-table. _Cf._ note on
_Bk._ II. 96.

403 "Knocked out the heads of the wine barrels."

410 _the Dowglas Lardenere._ "The Douglas Larder," a North English
and Scottish form of A.F. _lardiner_: here with the double meaning of
a store of food and a slaughter. For the latter, _cf._ "The knyghtes
of the round table made soche _lardare_ through the field" (_Merlin_,
cited N.E.D.). In the _Alexander_ it is said of the slaughter
accomplished by Porrus:

  "Of handis and heidis baith braune and blude
  He maid ane _lardnare_ quhare he stood" (p. 233, 5).

Dr. Neilson says, "there is nothing corresponding in the French," and
claims that the lines in the _Bruce_ are the source of the "lurid and
telling phrase" (_John Barbour_, p. 56). But this does not follow, as
the word occurs in this sense elsewhere (see N.E.D.), and the simple
sense of "slaughter" in the _Alexander_ is not quite parallel to the
full significance of the word in the _Bruce_, where the "meile, malt,
blude and wyne" fill out the suggestiveness of its use. According to
Hume of Godscroft, the Douglas historian, the "wyne-sellar" of line 399
is identified with a cellar "called yet the Douglas Lairder" (_History
of the House of Douglas_, p. 28, ed. 1644).

460 _The thrill-wallis._ May be "John de Thirlewal, vallet of Sir Adam
de Swynburne," who, "with a barbed horse," was one of a company hunting
Bruce in Glentrool, April, 1307 (_Bain_, ii., p. 572).

483 _Schyr Ingrame Bell._ Evidently a misreading of "Ingrame
Umphrevell," as is clear from _Bk._ VI. 3; not the other way, as Skeat
puts it. There was no such person as "Bell." Umfraville was holding
Cumnock Castle on May 18 (_Bain_, ii., 1931). Later in the year he is
at Ayr, July or August, sent there by Valence (_ibid._, No. 1961).

575 _about his hals._ Hung from his neck. A two-handed sword too long
to be supported by a waist-belt.

642 _toym._ "Leisure." Modern Scots _toom_ = empty; not time. The
distinction is clearly marked in the _Gest. Hystoriale_: "But this
_tyme_ is so tore (inconvenient), and we no _tome_ have" (644).


BOOK VI.

3 _the Umphrevell._ See _Bk._ V. 483, 513, etc.

69 _Gilbert de la Hay._ See note on _Bk._ II. 237.

120 "Since he was provided with armour."

121 _thurt._ "Needed." The word occurs once in _Morte Arthure_, in the
present impersonal: "Hym _thare_ be ferde (afraid) for no faces" (403).
_Cf._ also _Bk._ VIII. 257.

128 _For litill strynth of erd._ "On account of a slight natural
defence in the character of the ground."

149 _fiff-sum._ "Five together." The compound is still familiar in
Scotland--_e.g._, a "three-some reel," a "four-some" in golf. _Cf._
"sex-sum" in line 231.

179 The story is from the _Thebaid_ of Statius through some
intermediate source which cannot now be identified. See _Appendix_ F, Sec.
iv.

195-6 "First the one should reign a year, then the other for a year
from the expiry of the previous term," and so on.

201 _his constabill._ Defined in the _Alexander_:

  "That of the duke's hoist all hale,
  Was _constabill_ and chief ledere" (73; 14, 15).

252 _the gret anciente._ "Through its great antiquity."

314 "Then they praised greatly God the all-mighty." The comparative
_fastar_ is in _Bk._ XIII. 129.

316 _Thaim byrd._ "It behoved or was necessary for them." (O.E.
_byrian_, impersonal verb). _Cf._ "Sa _byrd_ al Galouya hyme honoure"
(_Lives of the Saints, Ninian_, 932): "Me byrd be blyth" in same
(_Martha_, 152). Frequent in the _Alexander_. _Cf._ on _Bk._ I. 381.

336 _Worschip extremyteis has twa._ Valour as a mean between two
extremes is an Aristotelian notion (_cf._ line 347).

339 "And they are both to be avoided."

341 "Things which should be left alone as well as those which should be
done" (_cf._ lines 348-9).

463 _In Cumnok._ A town and parish in Kyle, Ayrshire.

481 _Johne of Lorn._ See note on _Bk._ III. 1.

483 _aucht hundreth men and ma._ On July 19, 1307, there is a command
from Aymer de Valence, the King's lieutenant, for aid to John of Lorn
"guarding the town of Ayr and parts adjacent." Lorn had 22 men-at-arms
and 800 foot, so that Barbour's statement is remarkably accurate, while
his details enable us to fix the date of the events (_Bain_ ii., No.
1957).

484 _A sleuthhund._ Jean le Bel has a reference to some such occurrence
as this, though he credits it to Edward I., and distorts the course
of events. He explains that one time Edward had Robert Bruce chased
through great forests for the space of three or four days, "by dogs and
sleuth-hounds" (_par chiens et limiers_), and gives as his authority
not only popular report (_ce dit on_), but also "an account composed by
the said King Robert" (_et le treuve on en hystoire faitte par le dit
roy Robert._ _Chronique_ i., chap. xxii.). Sleuth-hounds were common
for police purposes: "That thar sal nane lat (obstruct) a sluthe hund
passand or the men that are cumand with hym for to follow theyffis or
to tak mysdvaris," etc. (1289) (_Acta Parl. Scot._, I. 108). See on
VII. 17.

487 _a strecour._ A fast runner, a dog for the chase; from the verb
_streke_, to go rapidly (Skeat).

503 _his emys sak._ See note on _Bk._ III. 3.

507 _Schir Amery._ Valence is at Glenken, Kirkcudbrightshire, on July
24, and at Doon-side on July 31, 1307 (_Bain_ ii., Nos. 1958, 1959).

510 _Thomas Randale._ Thomas Randolph, on the English side. See note on
_Bk._ II. 463.

558 "He would pay no attention to the others."

650 _Out of dawis doyn._ "Done out of days"--_i.e._, killed.

657 _yhow ane._ "Yourself alone"--a rather awkward expression, but the
reading in H supports E.

665-6 "As they did not fear me, I could do them much more harm."


BOOK VII.

2 _will of wayn._ "Wild of weening" or thought--_i.e._, quite at a
loss. See on II. 471.

10 _yhe._ _Ye_ from an inferior to a superior; _you_ on the part of the
latter, as in line 15.

17 _I haf herd_, etc. In a note to the _Wallace_, _Bk._ v. 25, Jamieson
cites from "Bellenden, after Boece," a long passage on bloodhounds,
in which this occurs: "And thocht the thevis oftymes cors the wattir,
quhair thai pas, to caus the hound to tyne the sent of thaym and
the guddis, yit he serchis heir and thair with sic deligence, that
be his fut he fyndis baith the trace of the theiff and the guddis"
(_Description of Albion_, chap. xi.). See on VI. 484.

48 "And he is a good distance off by this time."

90 _price and loving._ "Honour and praise." _Cf._ 99, 294.

103 _war bodyn all evynly._ "Were armed equally well," equipped for
fighting.

132 _bryng hym than of daw._ "Bring him then out of day"--_i.e._, kill
him. _Cf._ on _Bk._ VI. 650.

163 _housis._ MSS. give "hous" with flourished "s," here expanded to
"is." See _Preface_ 3.

177 _slep._ "To sleep," infinitive, not a substantive.

188 _as foul on twist._ "Like a bird on a bough."

*302 _to-waverand._ "To-wavering"--_i.e._, distracted, uncertain.
_Waverand_ occurs in line 112 above, and in the _Wallace_ in "waverand
wynd" (_Bk._ iv. 340). "To" is intensive = German _zer_. In _Morte
Arthure_ we have "to-stonayede" = astounded (1436) and "to-briste" =
burst asunder (3982). Skeat gives for the text, "wandering uncertainly
in different directions," but "her and thar" follows.

330 _nakyt._ "Without armour," as always in the poem.

423 _for Jhon Cumyng's sak._ That this feeling did operate in certain
quarters we gather, further, from a story told in the _Scalacronica_,
citing "the chronicles of his (Bruce's) actions," in which two men
ferry Bruce, whom they did not know, over a passage between two
islands. They ask about Bruce, and express a wish that they had him
in their hands, that they might kill him. Bruce inquired why, and the
answer is, "Because he murdered John Comyn, our lord." This incident is
placed after Loudon Hill, and the precise locality is not mentioned.
Bruce discloses his identity in parting from them (_Scala._, pp. 132-3).

455 _top our teill._ "Top over tail," head over heels. The phrase
occurs in the _Alexander_ (72, 8).

468 _till him dreuch._ "Drew the man towards him."

494 _Glentruell._ Glen Trool and Loch Trool are in the west of
Kirkcudbright. See below on 622.

497 _the deir war in sesoun._ June or July, and so after Loudon Hill in
_Bk._ VIII.

561 _the Clyffurd._ Sir Robert Clifford. See note on 622 and on _Bk._
I. 282.

588 _his baneour._ "His banner-bearer," as in _Morte Arthure_, "He
byddys his _baneoure_, Buske yow," etc. (3732).

622 _Vaus._ "Vaux" = _de vallibus_, like Clifford, a Cumberland family.
Sir John de Vaus is on service under Valence against Bruce in June,
1307 (_Bain_, ii., No. 1938). We have a set of memoranda relative to
expeditions against Bruce in Galloway, dated February 12 to May 3,
1307, for wages to horse, foot, and archers under different commanders,
"in the valley of Nith," "beyond the water of Cree," "Glentruil, riding
in search of Robert de Brus," "on the raid to Glentruyl, against said
Sir Robert," "in Carrick and Glentruyl"; and among the leaders is Sir
Robert de Clifford (_Bain_, ii., No. 1923).

623 _raucht him a cole._ "Reached him a blow." Skeat explains _cole_ as
from O.F. _colee_, from _col_ (_cou_), the neck. _Cf._ _accolade_, a
blow with the flat of a sword in dubbing a knight.

624 "Both drew up their men in sides," for a fight.

632 _than he com of toune._ "Than when he set out," a general phrase.


BOOK VIII.

9 _Kyle._ The central division of Ayrshire, between _Carrick_ to the
south and _Cunningham_ (13) in the north.

14 _He gert helde._ "He made to submit" (O.E., _hieldan_, to incline;
Anglian _haeldan_). _Cursor Mundi_, "All folk to Rome suld _heild_"
(22,235, N.E.D.).

15 _Bothweill._ Bothwell Castle, on the Clyde. It had seen a good deal
of fighting in the earlier war. In August, 1301, the castle and barony,
which had belonged to William de Moray, were presented to Aymer de
Valence and his heirs (_Bain_, ii., No. 1214). See also note on _Bk._
xiii. 409.

21 _Philip the Mowbray._ More probably Sir John de Mowbray serving in
Ayr for Valence, with others, in June to August, 1307 (_Bain_, ii.,
Nos. 1938, 1961).

28 _Makyrnokis way._ Godscroft gives the name in the form _Machanacks_;
but David Macpherson, supporting the spelling in the text, says it is
"a narrow pass on the bank of Makyrnok wattyr," which he located near
Kilmarnock (_Geog. Illust._, s.v.).

34 _Edry-furd._ The meaning of this name appears to be given in the
line below, "betwix marras twa," in which case _Edry_ is for Gaelic
_Eadar_, "between," as in other ancient names--_e.g._, _Eddirdail_ for
the Black Isle, being _Eadar-da-dhail_, "between two dales." "Furd,"
of course, is English, and we may conjecture that the place was first
known as "the ford," with a Gaelic name beginning with _Eadar_, and
signifying "between the marshes"; then that the unwieldy title was
telescoped, the latter part of the Gaelic compound dropping out, and
reduced to the hybrid "Eadar-ford," finally to the form given.

95 _Kilwynnyn._ Kilwinning is west of Kilmarnock, near Ardrossan. At
Ardrossan they turned north by the coast road and passed Largs on to
Inverkip, where are still the remains of the castle. In 1301 Edward I.,
after capturing Bothwell Castle, went on to besiege that of Inverkip,
and in July, 1306, after Methven, Thomas Randolph was imprisoned there
(_Bain_, ii., Nos. 1224, 1807).

123 _Gawlistoun._ Galston is a little east of Kilmarnock. Beyond it
rises Loudon Hill.

133 _the tend day of May._ May 10. The memoranda cited in note to _Bk._
VII. 622, relating to the pursuit of Bruce in Galloway, extend to May
3. The battle of Loudon Hill was fought before May 15. See note on 362.

164 _The hye-gat._ "The high-road" to Ayr, as we learn also from the
_Wallace_, _Bk._ iii. That hero, with his men, there lay in wait for
"Persey's caryage," which was being convoyed up Avondale (78) to Ayr
(63). The waggons of supplies "took Loudon Hill" (116), on which
Wallace had prepared a position (100). Loudon Hill itself is a bold,
outstanding eminence commanding the valley of the Avon. The road must
have crossed the lower slope (line 165).

172 _thre dykis._ On each side of the road, but a bowshot (150 to 200
yards) away (169), was a moss, impassable for horsemen. Further to
narrow the hard ground (170), Bruce dug inwards from "the mosses" three
ditches up to the road (173), each a bowshot behind the other (175). In
the ditches he left gaps ("stoppis") for the road (179), wide enough
for 500 men to ride abreast (? 650 to 700 yards). Thus he could not be
outflanked (185) or attacked in the rear (186), and he had sufficient
men to deal with a frontal attack (187, 188). If he could not check
the English at the first ditch, he could retreat to the next, and so
to the third, if necessary (189-194). Bruce's tactics was thus to make
a position defensible by a small number on foot, and open only to an
attack in front. Maxwell's suggestion that the ditches were to shelter
the Scots from the archers has no warrant in the text (_Robert the
Bruce_, p. 164). In the _Wallace_:

  "A maner _dyk_, off stanys thai had maid,
  _Narrowyt the way_ quhar throuch thair thikar raid"

  (iii. 133-4).

The incident in the _Wallace_ is certainly derived from _The Bruce_,
but Barbour's "dykis" = ditches, as in the modern English sense, has
become a stone dike in the _Wallace_, where "dyk" has been taken in its
modern Scots sense = a wall.

216 _The sone wes rysyn schynand bricht._ So too in the _Wallace_.
He took up his position "in the gray dawing," and then "The sone was
rysyne our landis schenand brycht" (_Bk._ iii. 119).

232 _quhit as flour._ See on _Bk._ II. 415; XI. 131. Barbour here must
mean the white linen garment covering the armour--the surcoat.

257 _that us thar dout._ "Whom it needs us to fear." See for "thar" =
needs, note on _Bk._ VI. 121.

280 _cant and keyn._ _Cant_ = lively, brisk; _cf._ _canty_. _Keyn_
(keen) is probably in the sense of "bold" or "valiant." The words are
almost synonymous. _Cf._ _Morte Arthure_:

  "The knyhte coveride (got) on his knees with a _kaunt_ herte" (2195).

326 _skalyt in soppis._ "Scattered in groups." The _Wallace_ simply
paraphrases:

  "The Inglissmen, that besye was in wer,
  _Befors ordand in sondyr thaim to ber_" (163-4).

339 _At erd ane hundreth and weill mar._ So in _Wallace_:

  "A hundreth dede in feild was levyt thar" (205).

351 _to-ga._ A past tense: "went off in a hurry." See note on _Bk._
VII. *302.

362 _He gaf up thar his wardanry._ Loudon Hill was fought in May, 1307;
Valence was still "warden of Scotland" in July 31 (_Bain_, ii., No.
1959), but was replaced by Sir John de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond, on
September 13 (_Foedera_, iii., p. 10). An anonymous letter of May 15
says that "the King (Edward I.) was much enraged that the guardian and
his force had retreated before 'King Hobbe'"; also that James Douglas
"sent and begged to be received, but when he saw the King's forces
retreat, he drew back" (_Bain_, ii. 1979).

380 _For that victour._ There exists a letter written by "some high
official" at Forfar on May 15, which appears to refer to the events
of this year. Bain gives it in full in Anglo-French in vol. ii., pp.
536-7, and an abstract on p. 513. The writer says that "the news of
these parts are as follows: so far as I am able to understand, Sir
Robert de Bruys has never before had the good will of the people even
half so fully as at the present moment" (_ne avoyt onkes sa en arere
si avaunt la volunte des gentz ne la moyte si entierement cum il ad
ore aparmeymes_); "and that now they consider it manifest that he is
in the right, and that God is clearly on his side, since he has now
discomfited and defeated the full power of the King, as well English as
Scots" (_ausint bien les Engleis cum les Escoteys_), "on which account
the power of England is in full retreat before his men, not to return."

391 _Than wox his power._ According to Hemingburgh, who sets Bruce
riding through Lothian "a little after Easter," before the battle of
Loudon Hill, many then joined him who had been "exiled" by the English
justiciars in the former year when they "sat" upon malefactors and
supporters of "the new king." "And because, according to the English
law, they were sentencing them to burning, being drawn on horses and
hanging, on that account they rose unanimously and went with him
(Bruce), preferring to die rather than be judged by English laws" (ii.,
p. 265). Then follows the account of Valence's defeat at Loudon Hill,
the driving of the Earl of Gloucester into Ayr Castle, and Bruce's
subsequent defeat, after which he lurked "in moors and marshes" with
ten thousand foot; and how Bruce always "slipped out of the hands" of
his pursuers--clearly a misplaced account of the Galloway operations.
Of the late summer and autumn of this year the Lanercost chronicler
says that "Robert Bruce, with his brother Edward and many others
adhering to him, without any opposition from the English guardians,
wanders about in Scotland wherever he wished, and especially in
Galloway, and took tribute from that country on condition that it
should be left in peace; for, _on account of the number of people who
then adhered to him_, they were not able to resist him" (_Chron._,
p. 210). See also _Foedera_, iii., p. 14, for the official English
description of Bruce's raids on Galloway in August to September of this
year.

393 _Outour the Month._ The writer of the letter cited above says that
he learns from those who are watching the place beyond and on this side
of the mountains, "that if Sir Robert Bruce is able to get away in any
direction without inconvenience" (_saun dreytes_), "or towards the
districts of Ross, he will find them all ready to his will more wholly
than ever." For "the Month," see note on _Bk._ II. 494.

395 _Sir Alexander the Fraser._ See note on _Bk._ II. 239, and next
note.

397 _his brother Symon._ See on _Bk._ II. 239. Skeat thinks this
mention and that in _Bk._ IX. 10 "odd," because he identifies him
with the Sir Simon executed in 1306. Hence one of Barbour's "errors."
Sir Alexander Fraser, sheriff of Kincardine, and "Simon Fraser his
brother" are witnesses to a charter not dated, but later than 1312.
(_Fraser's of Philorth_, ii., p. 126). Simon Fraser is one of the
honorary burgesses of Aberdeen in 1317 (_Miscellany of Spalding Club_,
v., p. 283). He fell at Halidon Hill, 1333. In line 396 C reads
_frendis_ where E gives _cosyngis_ and H _cousings_ in the general
sense of "relatives." Bruce gifted the Earl of Atholl's lands in part
to Alexander Fraser's wife, Marie, his own sister (Robertson's _Index_,
p. 19, 105). The gift must be after 1315 (_Bk._ XIII. 490).

400 _Schir Johne Cumyne._ On September 26, 1306, John Comyn, Earl of
Buchan, is forgiven his debts to the Exchequer (England), on account of
the loss sustained "in the death of Sir John Comyn his cousin" (_Bain_,
ii., No. 1835).

401 _Schir Johne the Mowbray._ Had the custody of "the late John
Comyn's" lands in England from February 23, 1306; on duty in Ayr, June
and July, 1307 (_Bain_, ii., Nos. 1746, 1938, 1961).

402 _Schir David of Brechyne._ Also serving Edward in Ayr, July or
August, 1307 (_ibid._, No. 1961); of Forfarshire (_ibid._, p. 199). See
on _Bk._ IX. 293.

413 _The Erle of Lennox._ See on _Bk._ II. 235. With line 414 _cf._
extract from Fordun on _Bk._ II. 482.

415 _Schir Robert Boyd._ See on _Bk._ IV. 342.

425 _The forest of Selcryk._ Sir Walter Scott has a note (45) to _The
Lord of the Isles_ on "The forest of Selkirk, or Ettrick," which, he
says, "embraced the neighbouring dales of Tweeddale, and at least the
upper ward of Clydesdale." But Gray distinguishes between "the forests
of Selkirk and of Etryk" (_Scala._, p. 127); and Douglas, later, had
a grant of the forests of Ettrick, Selkirk, and Traquair (Robertson's
_Index_, p. 10, No. 24).

427 _Gedward Forest._ "Jedworth," or Jedburgh Forest. "The vulgar, and,
indeed, almost universal, pronunciation, Jethart" (Jamieson on the
_Wallace_, _Bk._ vii. 1277). See further on _Bk._ XVI. 363.

447 _Lanrik fair._ No doubt "Lanark" fair, as it appears in Godscroft's
account (_History_, p. 30, ed. 1644). "Lanerik" is an old form of the
name in charters, etc.

449 _gang on raw._ "Go in a row."

453 _Schir Johne of Webitoune._ In Godscroft "Sir John Walton,"
under which name Sir John de Walton, he figures in Scott's _Castle
Dangerous_. The citation from Godscroft will be found in the Appendix
to the Introduction to that tale.

492 _per drowry._ _Drowry_ is O.F. _druerie_, _droerie_, love,
friendship; here = "as a sweetheart," apparently in a sinister sense.
_Cf._ Chaucer:

  "To be loved is not worthy,
  Or bere the name of _druerie_."

  (_Romaunt of the Rose_, 5063).

In the _Alexander_, as here, "And yharnes to lufe _be droury_" (126,
21).


BOOK IX.

34 _Enverrowry._ Inverury, on the Don, fifteen miles north-west of
Aberdeen.

64 _a-pane._ A curious use of the French adverbial phrase _a peine_,
in, or with, difficulty; here = "hardly," "scarcely." The sense seems
to be that even in a case in which a company is successful without a
captain, which they can be only with difficulty, still they will not
accomplish as much as if they had one.

107 _the Slevach._ Sliach in Drumblade parish, about sixteen miles
north-west of Inverurie. Certain archaeological features in the district
are connected with Bruce's visit, the "Meet-hillock," "Robin's Height,"
etc. (_Old. Stat. Acct._, iv., p. 55; Macpherson's _Geograph. Coll._,
i., pp. 8, 19).

117 _And als frendis._ According to Fordun, whose account is
independent of that of Barbour, Buchan had many nobles, both English
and Scots, when he went to attack Bruce at Sliach (_Gesta Annalia_,
cxxii.).

118 _Schir Johne the Mowbray._ See note on _Bk._ VIII. 21.

127 _Martymes._ Martinmas, November 11, 1307.

153 _thai send._ This second "thai" refers to the Scots of Bruce's
party.

183 _begouth to fale._ "They retired, overcome with shame and in
confusion" (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxii.). But in Fordun the reference is to
Christmas Day. See below, 204.

188 _Strabogy._ Strathbogie.

190 _cover and ga._ "Recover and go about."

202 _Ald Meldrom._ About five miles north-east of Inverury.

204 _Before Yhoill-evyn nycht._ "One night before Christmas Eve."
Fordun records an attack by Brechin on Bruce on Christmas Day (see
above on 183), but the battle of Old Meldrum he puts on to 1308
(cxxiv.). But he sends Bruce north right away after his landing in
Carrick and capture of Turnberry to destroy Inverness and other
fortresses (cxxi.), whereas Bruce could scarcely go north before the
autumn, as he was in Galloway on September 30 (_Foedera_, iii., p. 14).
After his victory at Inverury, Bruce ravages Buchan, subdues the north,
and, according to Fordun, is in Argyll by August, 1308 (cxxvi.). This
would be quick work, even for Bruce, and Lord Saltoun therefore argues
that Barbour is right in his chronology (_Frasers of Philorth_, ii.
183-194).

221 _His horse ... he askit._ When the King heard of the attack, says
Fordun, "though he was still prostrated by great weakness, he rose from
the litter on which he was constantly carried, and ordered his men to
arm him and place him on his horse" (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxiv.).

249 _merdale._ "Rabble"; O.F. _merdaille_, "a dirty crowd." _Cf._
_Alexander_, "For thay war pure, small _mardale_" (379; 14); also
_Lives of the Saints; Ninian_, 921.

289 "The son of him (the Earl of Atholl) that was in Kildrummy." But
see note on _Bk._ XIII. 489. Atholl was English, and Barbour must be
wrong.

293 _Com syne his man._ But on May 20, 1308, Edward II. was expressing
his thanks to "David de Breghyn," etc. (_Bain_, iii., No. 43). This
would support Fordun's date for the battle, if, as Barbour says,
Brechin submitted soon after. But "Sir David de Breghyn" is receiving
wine from Edward II. on July 12, 1310 (_Bain_, iii., No. 121). See
further on _Bk._ XIX. 19.

296 _all Bouchane._ The district of Buchan is in the north-east of
Aberdeenshire.

307 _Toward Angus._ In the north of Forfarshire.

309 _the Scottis Se._ The Firth of Forth (see on 461). Of old it marked
the boundary between the land of the Gaelic-speaking Scots and the
English Lowlands.

312 _Philip the Forster of Platan._ Jamieson explains that there is
still a _Forest-muir_ in Angus, "the name of a great track of waste
ground a few miles to the north of Forfar" and about two miles east of
it, "a village vulgarly named _Forster-seat_ ... said to be properly
designed _Forester-seat_, as having been the place where the forester
anciently resided." He identifies _Platan_ with _Platter_, a forest
which is the subject of a grant by Robert Bruce (_Index Chart._, p. 4,
No. 43); while a charter of Robert II. confers on Alexander de Lindsay
the office of Forester of the Forest of Plater, "in the sheriffdom of
Forfar" (_ibid._, p. 120, 63).

330 _Till Perth is went._ According to Gray, it was the Earl of Atholl
who captured Perth for Bruce (_Scala._, p. 140). This is quite wrong;
Atholl was English.

335 _the wallis war all of stane._ Perth was an exceptional case, the
larger Scottish towns, except Berwick, being fortified only with ditch
and palisade (_de bons fossez et de bons palis._ _Le Bel_, I., xxii.).
And so was Berwick till 1296.

338 _Olyfard._ Barbour is about four years too soon with the capture
of Perth. William de Olifard (modern Oliphant) was still holding it
for Edward II. in February, 1312 (_Bain_, iii., No. 247). Oliphant
was a Scot, and the state of the garrison for July, 1312, shows a
great number to have been Scotsmen (_ibid._, pp. 425-7). Fordun says
Perth fell on January 8, 1313; the _Chron. de Lanercost_ gives the
date as January 10, 1313 (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxix., _Lanerc._, p. 221).
According to the Lanercost writer, the Scots climbed the walls on
ladders during the night, and captured the place through the neglect
or lack of sentinels and defenders (_propter defectum vigilum et
custodum_, p. 222).

340 _Of Stratherne als the Erll._ But see below on 433.

354 _the dik._ The burgesses of Perth had, by order, made "a pielle and
fosse"--_i.e._, a tower and a ditch--"when Robert de Brus broke the
peace" (_Bain_, iii., No. 68).

371, 373 _mak ledderis ... in a myrk nycht._ See above on 338.

377 _slepit all._ See on 338.

391 _A knycht of France._ In the _Wallace_ it is explained that this
was Sir Thomas de Longueville, a French pirate and a friend of Wallace.
Such an identification is in the usual plagiarising fashion of the
author of the _Wallace_.

405 _eftir the Kyng._ _Cf._ preceding note.

412 _the tothir man that tuk the wall._ "The second man to reach the
top of the wall."

433 _Malis of Strathern._ Barbour is quite wrong in placing the Earl
of Strathearn in Perth, and his son on the Scottish side. Both were
still in the English interest. Malise of Stratherne, son of the Earl
of Stratherne, is in English pay November, 1309 (_Bain_, iii., No.
121). The Earl appears to have been at Berwick during the winter of
1310-1311 (_Bain_, iii., No. 208); and it is no doubt his son who on
January 28, 1313, after the fall of Perth (see on 338), is still in
receipt of an allowance from Edward II. (_ibid._, No. 299). Malis, Earl
of Strathearn, is among the signatories to the 1320 letter to the Pope
(_Act. Parl. Scot._ I., p. 114).

448 _thai war kynde to the cuntre._ "They were related to the
country"--_i.e._, they were Scots (see on 338). The _Lanercost_
account is the contrary of this; it is there said that on the morrow
of the capture, a Tuesday, Bruce had the chief burgesses of the town
(_meliores burgenses_), who were of the Scottish nation, put to death,
but allowed the English to depart in freedom. This writer errs,
however, as to the fate of Olifard, a Scot, who, he says, was sent in
bonds (_ligatus_) far off to the Isles (p. 222); for Olifard was in
England a few months afterwards, and there is no mention of any escape
or exchange (_Bain_, iii., p. xviii). Fordun's version is that the
treacherous folk (_perfida gens_), both Scots and English, were slain,
but that Bruce, in his mercy, spared the common people (_plebi_), and
gave pardon to those who asked for it (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxix.).

452 _wallis gert he tummyll doune._ Bruce's usual policy with fortified
places. See on _Bk._ X. 496. The _Lanercost_ chronicler says he
completely destroyed the town (p. 222); Fordun that he destroyed the
wall and ditches, and burned everything else (_ibid._).

461 _Obeysit all._ Not quite, in 1308. Dundee was in English hands
in April, 1312, when reinforcements were being sent to its "rescue"
(_Bain_, iii., p. 401); and in 1313, according to Barbour himself
(_Bk._ X. 800-1). So was Banff (Watt's _History of Aberdeen and Banff_,
p. 68). Bain assigns to June, 1308, a note of instructions regarding
Scotland, in which two wardens are appointed for "beyond the Scottish
sea between the Forth and Orkeneye," with 120 men-at-arms, "besides
garrisons." The "guardians of Scotland," however, are told "that it
is the King's pleasure they take truce from Robert de Bruys, as from
themselves, as long as they can"--an indication of the growing power of
Bruce, emphasized by Barbour (_Bain_, iii., No. 47).

497 _With all the folk_, etc. The _Lanercost_ writer explains this
raid as being on account of the discord between the English King and
his barons. With Edward Bruce, he says, went Robert himself, Alexander
de Lindsay, and James Douglas, with their following, which they had
brought together "from the remote isles of Scotland" (p. 212).

500 _ryotit gretly the lande._ The people of Galloway had paid tribute
to be left alone (see on _Bk._ VIII. 391), but, says the _Lanercost_
writer, they made no account of this, and in one day slew many of the
more noble men of Galloway, and subjugated nearly the whole country,
the Galloway men who could escape flying to England (p. 212).

502 _Ingrame the Umphrevell._ In June, 1308, Umfraville, with two
others, was made a warden of Galloway, Annandale, and Carrick (_Bain_,
iii., No. 47).

509 _als Amery._ Amery St. John; but there is no one on record of this
name. Aymer de Valence was still a warden, but in September, 1307, when
Bruce was raiding Galloway (see on _Bk._ VIII. 391), John de St. John
was one of "the greater men" there (_Bain_, iii., No. 15). "Amery St.
John" is referred to again in _Bk._ XVI. 506.

517 _Besyde Cre._ The River Cre divides Kirkcudbrightshire from
Wigtown. Fordun says the battle was on the Dee, and dates it June
29, 1308 (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxv.). The Dee flows into the Solway at
the town of Kirkcudbright. Though Barbour's position is universally
accepted, Fordun is probably right. See next note.

522 _Buttil._ Here, at least, C is more correct in a place-name than
E, which gives Bothwell, on the Clyde, an absurd distance away, across
mountains. The castle is that at Buittle, near Dalbeattie, a Balliol
hold. It is a few miles east of the Dee, which seems to bear out Fordun
as in the preceding note; _cf._ also lines 533-5. Edward's operations
by the Cree could hardly be seen from Buittle.

547 _by Cre._ A second battle by the Cree, or, more probably, one
following on the English reverse by the Dee.

575 _Schir Alane of Catcart._ Cathcart is near Glasgow. Sir William
de Cathcart (Kethker) is a knight of Roxburgh garrison (English) in
December, 1309 (_Bain_, iii., No. 121).

610 "Directed their heads inwards again"--_i.e._, turned their horses
to make a fresh charge from the rear.

658 _Thretten castellis._ Small castles, Border "peels"--ditch and
palisade.

683 _the wattir of Lyne._ In Peeblesshire, flowing into the Tweed from
the north, a short distance west of Peebles.

692 _Alysander Stewart._ In C, _Alexander Bonkill_. Son of Sir
John Stewart, who married the heiress of Sir Alexander de Bonkyl
in Berwickshire, and grandson of the fourth High Steward. He died,
apparently, in 1319, and his son John was created by Bruce Earl of
Angus (_Scots Peerage_, i. 13, 169).

694 _Thomas Randole._ Randolph. See note on _Bk._ II. 463.

695 _Adame ... of Gordoun._ See note on _Bk._ II. 463; XI. 46; XV. 333.

728 _His emys son._ The mother of Douglas was Elizabeth, daughter of
Alexander, the fourth High Steward, and her elder brother was Sir John
Stewart, father of Alexander Stewart, of Bonkil. _Cf._ on 692. Thus
Douglas and Sir Alexander were cousins.


BOOK X.

9 _toward Lorn._ Barbour's chronology is here not specific, but he
apparently places the expedition against Lorn in the late summer or
autumn of 1308. So does Fordun (see on _Bk._ IX. 204). On the other
hand, there exists a letter from John of Lorn to Edward II., clearly
referring to the present expedition. Unfortunately, it is not dated
further than as an acknowledgment of the receipt of the King's letters
of March 11. About that date, in 1308, Bruce must have been in the
North, beyond the Mounth (see on _Bk._ IX. 204). On June 16, 1309,
Alexander of Lorn and John are in council with Edward at Westminster
(_Bain_, iii., No. 95). Meantime Alexander of Argyll is in the sederunt
of Bruce's first Parliament, March 16, 1309, at St. Andrews (_Act.
Parl. Scot._, vol. i., p. 160). Either, then, Bruce's expedition is to
be placed in the spring and early summer of 1309, or, after the defeat
at Loch Awe, John of Lorn held out during the winter, and Dunstaffnage
fell at some date between March 11, 1308, and June 16, 1309.

14 _twa thousand._ In the letter referred to above, John of Lorn says
that "Robert Bruce had approached his territories with 10,000 or 15,000
men, it was said, both by land and sea. He had no more than 800 to
oppose him, 500 of these being in his pay to keep his borders, and the
barons of Argyll gave him no aid.... He has three castles to guard,
and a lake 24 leagues (miles) long on which he has vessels properly
manned, but is not sure of his neighbours" (_Bain_, iii., No. 80).
Lorn's estimate of Bruce's strength is clearly exaggerated. Hemingburgh
similarly gives Bruce 10,000 men in his Galloway wanderings (ii., p.
265).

17 _Ane evill place._ From the description, the Pass of Brander through
which the River Awe flows from Loch Awe to Loch Etive, a sea-loch. The
Callander-Oban Railway follows this route. The Pass is three miles long.

27 _Crechanben._ Cruachan Ben, or Ben Cruachan, on the north side,
3,689 feet.

34-35 _on the se ... with his galays._ Skeat says this must be "Loch
Etive, a sea-loch, not the inland Loch Awe, from which the ships could
not have escaped." He is thinking of line 130, but the flight there
mentioned has no connection with the present case. Loch Etive is not
"weill neir the pas" (35; _cf._ also 97, 98), but Loch Awe is, and we
see from Lorn's letter (note on 14) that he had ships on that loch.
He says further that he "was on sick-bed" when he received Edward's
letters, "and had been for half a year"; which probably accounts for
his presence in a galley, or large Highland row-boat, as the Marquis of
Argyll was, for a like reason, when his forces were cut to pieces by
Montrose at Inverlochy in 1645.

46 _Williame Wisman._ A "William Wysman" was made Edward's Sheriff at
Elgin in 1305 (_Bain_, ii., p. 458). The wife of "Monsieur William
Wysman" was among the ladies captured in 1306, and was sent to Roxburgh
(_Foedera_, ii., p. 1014). William Wyseman was at the St. Andrews
Parliament, 1309 (_Act. Parl. Scot._, i., p. 160). It was a Moray name.

47 _Schir Androu Gray._ Ancestor of the Lords Gray. Sir Andrew Gray
received from Bruce in 1315 the barony of Longforgan and other lands
in Perthshire and Forfarshire, which had belonged to Edmond Hastings
(Robertson's _Index_, p. 26, No. 19; Crawford's _Peerage_, p. 179, ed.
1716).

82 _ane wattir._ The River Awe. The river here is wide, deep, and
broken by rapids.

88 _till brek it._ The bridge, of course, was of wood. It was probably
beyond the lower extremity of the Pass, somewhere near the present
bridge.

113 _Dunstaffynch._ In Fordun _Dunstafynch_; Dunstaffnage Castle at the
mouth of Loch Etive.

126 _And com his man._ As has already been noted (see on 9), Alexander
of Arygll is, with the other "barons" of Argyll and the Hebrides,
present at Bruce's Parliament at St. Andrews, which, if correct,
indicates that Barbour, so far, is right. Lorn wrote to Edward that,
"though he and his were few in respect of his power, Robert de Brus
had asked a truce from him, which he granted for a short space, and
received the like, till the King sends him succours. He hears that
Robert, when he came, was boasting and saying that the writer had come
to his peace at the report that many others would rise in his aid,
which God and the writer know is not true. Should the King hear this
from others, he is not to believe it" (_Bain_, as cited). Fordun's
story is that Bruce besieged Alexander of Argyll in Dunstaffnage, that
the castle was surrendered, but Alexander refused to do homage and
was allowed a safe-conduct for himself and friends to England (_Gesta
Annalia_, cxxvi.).

137 _at Lythkow wes than a peill._ Linlithgow "peel" was constructed
by Edward I. in 1301-1302. Barbour's chronology is again at fault, or
he is not concerned about it. Linlithgow was still being munitioned
against the Scots in August, 1313 (_Bain_, iii., No. 330). Barbour
appears to be simply grouping the different captures of castles
together (see lines 144-7). Strictly a "peel" was a fortification
consisting of a stockade and ditch, enclosing the buildings of the
garrison (see lines 144-7).

153 _Wilyhame Bunnok._ See note on 254. C reads _Bowne_ here, but
_Bunnok_ in line 194.

180 _the hede-soyme._ That is, the "trace" or "traces" connecting the
animals with the cart would be cut, when the waggon would block the
gateway. By a similar trick, in which the agents are dressed as carters
and the traces are loosened by withdrawing the pins, Oudenarde was
captured in 1384 (_Froissart_, Johnes, ii., chap. cli.).

185 _the harvist tyde._ September or October, 1313. See above on 137.

195 _To leid thair hay._ To "lead" the hay, still the usual country
phrase, is to bring it in from the field to the place of storage.
Bunnok was to gather the hay and cart it to the castle.

196 _but dangeir._ "Without difficulty," readily.

223 _callit his wayn._ "Drove" or "urged forward" his waggon. The word
occurs in this sense in the _Wallace_ "Thir cartaris ... _callyt_ furth
the cartis weill" (_Bk._ ix. 717-8), where, as usual, the incident is
borrowed from the _Bruce_. _Cf._ Burns: "Ca the yowes to the knowes."

232 _he leyt the gadwand fall._ "He" is not Bunnock, but the driver,
who drops his goad and cuts the trace.

254 _hym rewardit worthely._ According to Nisbet's _Heraldry_,
Bunnock is the same name as _Binning_, and the arms of Binning of
Easter-Binning are "placed on the bend of a waggon argent"; and he
gives as an explanation that "one of the heads of that family, with his
seven sons, went in a waggon covered with hay, surprised and took the
castle of Linlithgow, then in the possession of the English, in the
reign of David II." (I. 100, ed. 1816). The reference is clearly to the
present incident, though "sons" is a later development, and the date is
wrong. Jamieson is highly suspicious over the identification, and it
seems, in fact, to be a case of ancestry manufacture.

265-6 _Murref ... And othir syndri landis braid._ "Murref" is English
transcription of the Gaelic form, _muiraibh_, dative plural of _muir_,
the sea. The grant to Randolph was most extensive, including lands
from the mouth of the Spey to Lochaber and Mamore, and "the marches
of northern Argyll," and covering 2,550 square miles in Banff, Elgin,
Nairn, and Inverness (Robertson's _Index of Charters_, p. xlix;
Rampini's _Moray and Nairn_, p. 140).

324 _Schir Peris Lumbard._ Peter de Loubaud (Lybaud, Libaut) was
constable of Edinburgh Castle and the peel of Linlithgow in March, 1312
(_Bain_, iii., No. 254). Edinburgh Castle was captured during Lent,
1314 (_Chron. de Lanercost_, p. 223; Fordun says March 14, 1314), by
Randolph (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxx.); March 24, apparently, in _Gesta
Edw. de Carn._ (p. 45), where it is said that Roxburgh and Edinburgh
fell between February 29 and March 24, 1314. Hailes goes a year wrong
in these dates, and Skeat adopts. For the intrusion of "m" before "b,"
_cf._ _Ferumbrace_ for _Fierabras_ in _Bk._ III. 437.

327 _mystrowit hym of tratory._ So we have it in the _Vita Edw. Sec._
that Edinburgh Castle was captured "by the betrayal of a certain
Gascon, who was known as Peter de Gavestone, to whom the King had
committed the custody of the castle. He, a perjured traitor, adhered to
Robert the Bruce, and betrayed the castle" (p. 199). _Cf._ on 766.

360-1 _ledderis ... With treyn steppis_, etc. Ladders of this sort
are carefully described by the Carlisle friar as having been used at
an unsuccessful siege of Berwick by Bruce in 1312. Two strong ropes
were taken, of a length according to the height of the wall. These
were knotted at intervals of a foot and a half; on these knots rested
wooden (_treyn_) steps two and a half feet long by half a foot broad,
sufficient for one man at a time, and every third step had a projection
inwards, to keep the ladder out from the wall. At the top end was a
curved iron (_cf._ "a cruk ... of iron"), one end of which, about a
foot long, lay on the top of the wall, while the other hung down, was
pierced with a hole, and had a ring on each side for the rope. In the
hole a sufficiently long spear was inserted, by which the ladder was
put in position by two men. When the Scots had placed two ladders for a
night attack, a dog barked, and Berwick was saved, the Scots making off
and leaving their ladders behind to be hung up in derision of the Scots
by the garrison (p. 221).

372 _on the fasteryn evyn._ "Fastern's Eve," Shrove Tuesday, February
27, 1314. So, too, in Fordun (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxx.), and in
_Scalacronica_, the night of Shrove Tuesday (p. 140); in _Lanercost_
the capture is dated the day after, February 28, the first day of Lent,
1314 (p. 223). The castle was still in English hands on February 7,
1314 (_Bain_, iii., No. 352), but lost before May 29 (No. 358), in 1314
(894).

400 _up thair ledderis set._ "For James (Douglas) himself on a certain
night secretly approached the castle (of Roxburgh), and placed ladders,
which had been carried up in concealment (_latenter_) against the wall,
and so by these ascended the wall," etc. (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 200).

441 _The custom._ It was the custom to spend the day before the
beginning of the fast of Lent in feasting and jollity. This practice
continued in Scotland long after the Reformation, when Lent was no more
observed. The _Vita Edw._ says that the garrison were sleeping or off
their guard.

456-7 _Gylmyne de Fenis ... in the gret toure_, etc. "They (the Scots)
took the whole castle except one tower, to which, with difficulty,
had escaped the warden of the castle, Sir Gilminus de Fenes, a Gascon
knight, and his men with him, but that tower the Scots had soon
afterwards" (_Lanercost_, p. 223). Sir William de Filinge (Filling,
Felynges) was constable of Roxburgh since 1312 at least (_Bain_, iii.,
Nos., 332, 337, 351). On the conduct of Roxburgh garrison see on _Bk._
XI. 46.

479 _Woundit so felly._ According to Gray, "Guillemyng Fenygges" was
killed by an arrow while holding the great tower (_Scala._, p. 140).

496 _to tummyll it doune._ "And all this beautiful castle, as with all
the other castles which they were able to get, they laid level with the
ground, that the English might never afterwards by holding the castles
be able to dominate the country" (_Lanercost_, p. 223). So also _Vita
Edw. Sec._, p. 199, and _Gesta Edw._, p. 45, where it is alleged that
Bruce did this to prevent the Scottish nobles taking refuge therein
instead of helping him. See on _Bk._ IX. 452, and below on 771.

504 _Outane Jedworth._ There was fighting about Jedburgh in 1315, 1316
(_Bain_, iii., No. 494), but it was still in English hands in 1321
(_ibid._, 746).

509 _At Edinburgh._ Edinburgh Castle was still in English hands in
August, 1313 (_Bain_, iii., No. 330). See further note on 324.

513 _all his purchas._ "By his own procurement."

516 _voidry._ Skeat's suggestion. See footnote. It means "cunning,
stratagem" (S).

529 "Ere that siege should miscarry, or go wrong." _Cf._ on _Bk._ I.
478. The mood here is subjunctive, past tense.

530 _William Francas._ Francis or "Fraunceys" appears from Bain to have
been a common name in the Lothians. A "William Francis" got lands from
Bruce in Roxburgh in 1322. His grant just precedes one to John Crab
(Robertson's _Index to Charters_, p. 15, No. 20; _cf._ _Bk._ XVII. 239).

701 _The Erll has tane the castell all._ The _Lanercost_ historian
says the castle was captured in this manner: "Those besieging the same
castle, one day in the evening, made a bold assault on the south gate,
because on account of the position of the castle, there was no other
place where an assault could be given. But those within, all collecting
at the gate, resisted them stoutly; meanwhile, however, others of the
Scots climbed the rock on the north side, which was very high and
steep, up to the foundation of the wall, and there, placing their
ladders against the wall, they climbed up in such numbers that those
within could make no resistance; and so they (the Scots) opened the
gates and brought in their friends, and took the whole castle and slew
the English" (p. 223). The _Scalacronica_ account is that Moray took
the castle at the highest part of the rock, where there was no thought
of danger (_a quoi il ne se dotoit_) (p. 140).

708 _Lap fra a berfrois._ For a "beffroi," see on _Bk._ XVI. 597. O.F.,
"berfroi," etc. For form "belfry," _cf._ "pilgrim," from "peregrinus";
in English not before the fifteenth century. French dropped the "r"
(N.E.D.). The reference here is to one of the _Alexander_ romances,
of which there was no translation, and is indicative of Barbour's
familiarity with this literature. _Cf._ _Appendix_ E.

740 _in stede of prophesye._ "In the way of, or as, a prophecy."

742 _hir chapell._ St. Margaret's Chapel, built for Queen Margaret,
wife of Malcolm Canmore. She died in Edinburgh Castle in 1093. In 1336
the chapel was fitted with four windows of glass (_Bain_, iii., p.
335).

746 _as old men sayis._ The picture and inscription were, therefore, no
longer extant.

747 "Gardez-vous de Francois." "Beware of Francis or of the French."

766 _he becom the Kingis man._ Gray tells how "Lebaud" went over to
Bruce, but, because he was in heart English (_qil estoit Engles qe
quer_), Bruce had him accused of treason and hanged (_Scala._, p. 140).
The official record is that he was convicted of treason, and, from his
forfeitures, he seems to have received large holdings in Lothian (_Reg.
Mag. Sig._, where he is styled _Peter Luband_, p. 3, 3; p. 13, 63, 64,
66).

771 _myne doune all halely._ The _Lanercost_ writer adds that the Scots
levelled Edinburgh Castle to the ground, as they had done Roxburgh.

815 _Fra the lenteryne._ Lent, 1313. In the _Vita Edw._ it is said that
Mowbray brought the news of his pact at the beginning of Lent, which
must be Lent, 1314, suggesting a considerable difference in dates (p.
200).

816 _Quhill ... Saint Johnnis mess._ That is, by June 24, 1313, the
English garrison began to find their food running short. "Their victual
was insufficient" (_Vita Edw._, p. 200).

822-3 _it was nocht with battaill Reskewit._ So, too, in _Vita Edw.
Sec._, where the agreement is that Mowbray "would either procure the
King of England to come to the defence of the castle, or, if he should
not be able to induce the King to do this, that he would summarily
(_indilate_) surrender the castle." St. John's day is fixed as the
limiting date. The writer makes Robert Bruce himself conduct the siege
(p. 200). So does Gray, who says that the castle was to be surrendered,
"unless the English army came within three leagues of the said castle
within eight days after St. John's day in the summer next to come"
(_dedenz viii jours apres le Saint Johan en este adonques procheine
avenir_, p. 141). But _cf._ _Bk._ XI. 8-9.


BOOK XI.

32 _outrageous a day._ "Day" has here the meaning of "a space of time,"
as in Berners' _Froissart_. "The truce is not expired, but hath _day_
to endure unto the first day of Maye next" (I. ccxiii., N.E.D.): a
sense of the Latin _dies_. For "outrageous," see on _Bk._ III. 162.

44 _Akatane._ Aquitaine, the ancient southern duchy of France, the
hereditary possession of the Kings of England.

46 The _Lanercost_ chronicler affirms (1311) that in the war the Scots
were so divided that sometimes a father was with the Scots and his son
with the English, or brothers were on opposite sides, or even the same
person at one time on the Scottish side, at another on that of England;
but that it was a pretence, either because the English seemed to get
the better or to save their English lands, "for their hearts, if not
their bodies, were always with their own people" (p. 217). Thus, at
this time, there were still to be found among supporters of the English
King such names as Stewart, Graham, Kirkpatrick, Maxwell, St. Clair,
etc. (_Bain_, iii., _Introd._, pp. xvi, xvii). As many of these were
Border lairds--some, indeed, are of Annandale--even their Scottish
lands were specially exposed to English attack. Late in 1313 (October
or November) we have a _Petition to the King_ (of England) _from
the People of Scotland, by their envoys, Sir Patrick de Dunbar, Earl of
March, and Sir Adam de Gordon_, complaining of the great losses they
have suffered "by their enemies"--_i.e._, the Bruce party--also of the
brigandage of the English garrison in Berwick and Roxburgh (_Bain_,
iii., No. 337). One of the results of Bannockburn was to bring many of
these waverers over to the national side. Adam de Gordon, indeed, was
already under suspicion, and apparently was a waverer. He had, in fact,
a grant of the lands of Strathbogie in 1309, according to Robertson
(_Index_, p. 2; 40). _Cf._ also 103-4.* For Gordon, see also _Bk._ IX.
720, etc.; XV. 333; and on March, _Bk._ XIX. 776, note.

79-82 _Cf._, as bearing out Barbour's assertion, the comment by the
author of the _Vita Edwardi Secundi_ on the army when assembled at
Berwick: "There were in that assemblage amply sufficient men (_satis
sufficientes_) to traverse all Scotland, and, in the judgment of some,
if the whole of Scotland had been brought together, it could not make
a stand against the army of the King (_cf._ line 150). Indeed, it was
confessed by the whole host that, in our time, such an army had not
gone out of England" (_Chronicles of Ed. I. and Ed. II._, ii., pp.
201-2).

91 _Erll of Hennaut._ Count William of Hainault, Flanders. _Cf._ on
_Bk._ XIX. 262.

93. _Almanyhe_: Germany. Friar Baston says four German knights came
"gratis" (_Eng. Hist. Rev._, vol. xix., p. 507).

100 _of Irlande ane gret menyhe._ In _Foedera_ we have the list
of twenty-five Irish chiefs summoned to the campaign against the
Scots--O'Donald, O'Neil, MacMahon, O'Bryn, O'Dymsy, etc. The Irish
contingent was commanded by Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, Bruce's
father-in-law (III., pp. 476-478).

*103-4 See note on 46.

103 _Ane hundreth thousand men and ma._ See _Appendix_ C.

105 _Armyt on hors._ That is, the men alone wore armour, being thus
distinguished from the knights "with helit hors," or horses armoured
also in _bardings_ of leather or mail. Skeat rejects the reading of
E in favour of "playn male," taking "playn" to represent the French
_plein_ = "complete mail," on the ground of Innes's remark that the
distinction between mail or ring-armour and plate, "if known, was not
so specific in Barbour's age." But plates had been coming into use
since the last quarter of the thirteenth century, and by 1300 the
practice of attaching such additional defences was rapidly developing.
See note on 131. In 1316 we read of "200 men armed in plate," who were
sent to Ireland from England (_Bain_, iii., p. 99, No. 519).

114 _Of cartis._ "The multitude of waggons (_multitudo quadrigarum_),
if it had been extended in a line one behind the other, would have
taken up a space of twenty leagues" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 202). The
meaning of "league" is uncertain; apparently it was just a mile.

117 _veschall._ In _Vita Edw. Sec._ (pp. 206-7) the author speaks of
"costly garments and gold (or gilt) plate" (_vasa aurea_). Baker of
Swinbroke, in his _Chronicon Angliae_ (p. 55), also mentions the "plate
of gold and silver," and affirms that, in addition to an abundant
supply of victuals, the English brought with them things which were
wont to be seen only in times of peace on the luxurious tables of
princes. Among the ornaments of the high altar of Aberdeen Cathedral in
1549 was "an old hood made of cloth of gold ... from the spoil of the
Battle of Bannockburn" (_Reg. Episc. Aberd._, ii., p. 189).

119 _schot._ Arrows, and bolts for cross-bows. _Cf._ _Bk._ XIII. 311,
and below, note on 544.

130 _ryche weid._ The rich flowing housings or drapery of the steeds,
covering the armour, if any, as the "surcoat" of the knight did his.

131-*132. Armour was in a state of rapid transition, and so at this
time is very complicated. An English brass of 1325 shows a knight
wearing (1) a _gambeson_, or close-fitting quilted tunic, to ease the
pressure of the armour; (2) a _hauberk_ of _banded_ or _chain mail_,
with half-plates on the upper arm; (3) an _habergeon_ ("hawbyrschown"),
or lighter hauberk, apparently of small plates; (4) a _haketon_,
another padded coat like the gambeson; (5) and a short _surcoat_.
He has leggings of mail covering also the feet, and half-plates in
addition from the knees to the toes: a hood of mail continued upward
from the hauberk and a _bascinet_, or pointed, nut-shaped helmet, with
no visor. Over this he would wear in battle such a heavy, closed,
flat-topped _helm_ as we see on the seal of Robert I. He carries a
small triangular shield on his left arm, and his sword, a little more
than half the body in length, hangs in front from a waist-belt. Such
was probably the equipment of the leading knights at Bannockburn.

136 _Till Berwick._ The army was to assemble at Werk on the Tweed by
Monday, June 10, 1314 (_Foedera_, iii., p. 481). But the start was made
from Berwick on June 17 or 18 (_Vita Edw._, 201).

150 _Mannaustt the Scottis._ _Cf._ note on 79-82.

163 _Glowcister._ Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford,
nephew of the King, and a young man of twenty-three. _Herfurd._
Humphrey de Bohun, or Boun, Earl of Hereford and Essex, and Constable
of England. "The Earl of Gloucester and the Earl of Herford commanded
the first line" (_primam aciem_, _Vit. Edw. Sec._, p. 202). The
_Scalacronica_ says Gloucester commanded "the advance guard" (p. 141),
but does not mention Hereford (see note on _Bk._ XIII. 466).

174 _Schir Gylys de Argente._ Sir Giles d'Argentine, popularly regarded
as one of the three most eminent men of the time, the others being
the Emperor Henry and Robert Bruce (_Scotich. Lib._, xiii. 16). He
"guided the King's bridle" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 204). _Cf._ also
_Scalacronica_ (p. 143), _votre reyne me fust baillez_--"your rein was
entrusted to me": among others (p. 142).

210 _the Torwood._ Stretching north and west from Falkirk. It reached
to near Bannockburn, a little south of which is "Torwoodhead" Castle.

237 See note on 103.

250 _abaysing._ Fear which grew to panic. _Morale_, or firm courage, is
always an important element in warfare, but in medieval times it seems
to have been specially important (_cf._ IV. 191-200, and XII. 184-8).
The remarkable successes of the Scots against larger numbers were often
due to the "abaysing," for one reason or other, of their opponents.
Footmen were peculiarly liable to this loss of nerve, as they received
no mercy, as a rule, from the mounted knights. Bruce was all along most
anxious to guard against the rise of any such spirit of "funk" among
his men. "Success in battle," said Napoleon, "depends not so much upon
the number of men killed as upon the number frightened."

277 _the wayis._ As Bruce explains in the lines that follow, there were
two "ways" of advance to Stirling; one through the wooded New Park, and
the other by the level below St. Ninian's, extending to the "pools" or
lagoons along the side of the Forth. The trees of the New Park seem to
have extended from above the banks of the burn to St. Ninian's on the
one side and Stirling, or near it, on the other (_cf._ note on _Bk._
XII. 58). It was made as late as 1264 by Alexander III., and enclosed
with a paling in 1288 (_Excheq. Rolls_, I. 24, 38); whence the name
"New."

291 _licht armyng._ "Everyone of them (the Scots) was protected by
light armour" (_levi armatura_). (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 203). See
further, note on _Bk._ XII. 448.

296 _ficht on fut._ Fighting was still regarded as almost entirely the
business of armoured men on horseback, the footmen serving only for
minor purposes. That an army all on foot should oppose chivalry was a
new departure. Bruce was an original general. Sir Thomas Gray says that
the Scots "took example from the Flemings," who, in 1302, at Courtrai
had in this way defeated the French knights (_Scalacronica_, p. 142).
But this is an after-thought. The _Vita Edwardi Sec._ also draws the
parallel with Courtrai (p. 206). But the Scots could take the hint from
the tactics at Falkirk in 1298, where Wallace was only defeated by the
English archers. An English chronicler of about 1330 suggests that the
Scots were made to fight on foot to avoid the mischance at Falkirk when
their little body of cavalry fled at the sight of the English advance
(_Annales Johannis de Trokelowe_, p. 84).

300 _the sykis._ No doubt shallow lagoons with a muddy bottom, about
the Bannock, where it entered the Forth, flooded by the tide. Jamieson,
in his _Dictionary_, defines _syk_ as "a marshy bottom, with a small
stream in it." A rivulet in Selkirkshire is known as the Red Syke
(Chambers' _Popular Rhymes_, p. 17, ed. 1826).

333-6 Pinkerton suggests in his edition that Bruce could not trust the
Highlanders and Islesmen, and so put them in the rear, and stiffened
their ranks with his own followers from Carrick. For this there is no
warrant. The "barons of Argyll and Inchgallye" (the Hebrides) attended
Bruce's Parliament at St. Andrews in March, 1309 (_Acts Parl. Scot._,
i. 99). _Cf._ also note on X. 14. In any case on the Sunday afternoon
Bruce took the _front_ position in the New Park with these very men
(445, 446).

360 _ane playne feld by the way._ _I.e._, an open, level part by the
road through the park, just outside the wood. The historians have
shifted the position to suit their various and erroneous ideas of the
field of battle. Barbour, it is to be noted, says nothing of bogs, nor
of Buchanan's "calthrops of iron" (_Scot. Hist._, ed. 1762, p. 213).
Friar Baston, captured at Bannockburn, in his Latin poem, says there
were stakes in the pits (_Scotichronicon_, lib. xii., chap. xxii.).
Geoffrey Baker, of Swinbroke, enlarges them to long ditches covered
with hurdles, an utter misapprehension (_Chronicon_, pp. 56, 57. _Cf._
notes on _Bk._ XII. 536, 537). At Cressy (1346) the English dug "many
pits" (_multa foramina_) of the depth and width of a foot in front
of their first line as a defence against possible pursuit by the
French cavalry (_Baker_, p. 166). An analagous device is described by
Herodotus as having been successfully used by the Phocians to destroy
Messalian cavalry (Book viii., chap. xxviii.).

426 _till ane vale._ Apparently in the valley behind Coxet Hill.
"Gillies Hill" is said to have taken its name from these "gillies," or
servants (Nimmo's _History of Stirlingshire_, second edition, p. 219).
Barbour never calls them "gillies," and why a Gaelic name? The writer
of the description of the district in the _Old Statistical Account_
(1796) makes no mention of this "tradition," and suggests a derivation
from the personal name Gill or Gillies. "The names both of Gillies and
Morison occur in the muirlands" (vol. xviii., p. 392).

437 _the Fawkirk._ A Scots translation of the original Gaelic name
(in twelfth century) _Eaglais breac_, "the speckled or particoloured
church," in reference to the stone of which it was built. In "Falkirk"
the "l" has been substituted for "w," as a sign of length in the vowel
(see _Language l_, App. G). Local pronunciation does not sound the "l."
The English chroniclers write the name _Foukyrk_ (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p.
205), or _Faukirke_ (_Annales London._, p. 104).

440-453 Acting on the information received, and unaware, as yet, which
road the English would choose for an advance to Stirling, Bruce makes
a fresh disposition of his troops, departing from that laid down in
lines 305-347, so as to be ready for either line of advance. He himself
occupies the "entry" to the Park road, which was a continuation of
the medieval (Roman?) highway passing west of St. Ninian's, with
his mixed brigade of Highlanders and Lowlanders; while Randolph is
posted at St. Ninian's Kirk overlooking the level about seventy feet
below. Apparently (see below) both divisions are masked by the wood.
The others are in reserve to reinforce when it should turn out to be
necessary. The historians, ignoring this alteration in dispositions,
land themselves, as a result, in unintelligible confusion. Douglas
later trapped an English column in the "entre" of Jedburgh Forest
(_Bk._ XVI. 310 _et seq._).

486 _confort his men._ See note on 250.

523 _Aucht hundreth._ Gray says they were only three hundred,
under the command of Robert Lord de Clifford and Henry de Beaumont
(_Scalacronica_, p. 141). We learn from the same author that Philip de
Mowbray, constable of Stirling, went out and met Edward when the army
was _three leagues_, or miles, from the castle, and suggested that
he should advance no farther as, the English having come so far, and
being within touch, he considered himself relieved; besides, he said,
the Scots had blocked the narrow ways (_lez estroitz chemyns_) of the
wood--_i.e._, of the New Park. But from the conditions, as we have seen
(_Bk._ X. 822), the castle could not be held to be relieved so long as
the Scots were in force before it. We note that Mowbray also expected
the army to come by the Park roads. Now Barbour says that Clifford's
detachment left the main body _two miles_ away (515). Apparently,
then, this movement was the result of Mowbray's information (see next
note). However, it was known to Edward when he summoned his army that
the Scots had taken up a position between him and Stirling in strong,
marshy places difficult for horsemen (_Foedera_, ii., p. 481).

532 _it suld reskewit be._ So the Scots might conclude, but the version
of the _Lanercost_ chronicler better fits the case: "After dinner"
(_post prandium_--say, about midday) "the army of the King (Edward)
came to the neighbourhood of the Torwood" (he takes the Park to be an
extension of the larger forest), "and when it was known that the Scots
were in the wood" (from Mowbray), "the first line (_prima acies_) of
the King, whose leader was Lord Clifford, wished to surround the wood
so that the Scots should not escape in flight" (p. 225). This is in
harmony with the self-confidence of the English, and explains why the
horsemen did not, as they might have done, avoid Randolph's foot, if
they were only making for the castle. There was apparently no obstacle
to Mowbray communicating personally with the relieving army, and he
cannot have gone alone; so that the parties were actually in touch,
and, as Mowbray argued, a technical "relief" had been performed.

536 _thai wist weill._ From Mowbray probably, but _cf._ note on 523.
Aymer de Valence, too, had gone on before the army to prepare its line
of march and carefully examine the stratagems of the Scots (_insidias
Scotorum._ _Vit. Edw._, p. 201).

537 _Beneth the Park._ "Made a circuit upon the other side of the wood
towards the castle, keeping the open ground" (_as beaux chaumps._
_Scalacronica_, p. 141).

544 _thai so fer war passit by._ The English writers report the matter
as it appeared to them. "The Scots, however, suffered this" (Clifford's
advance) "until they had placed a considerable distance between
themselves and their friends, when they showed themselves, and cutting
off that first line of the King from the middle and rear divisions (_a
media acie et extrema_), rushed on it," etc. (_Chron. de Lanercost_,
225). "Thomas Randolph, ... who was leader of the advance guard of
the Scots, having heard that his uncle had repulsed the advance guard
of the English on the other side of the wood, thought that he must
have his share, and issuing from the wood with his division" (Barbour
says "five hundred men," line 542), "took the level plain" (_le beau
chaumpe_--Barbour's "playn feld") "towards the two lords aforesaid"
(_Scalacronica_, p. 141). Note that both Bruce at the "entry," and
Randolph at "the Kirk," were _in the wood_ (see on this also note on
_Bk._ XII. 58); and the reiterated use of the term "playn feld" for the
level below St. Ninian's.

546 _ane rose of his chaplet._ Hailes suggests a far-fetched
explanation of this: "I imagine that _rose_ implies a large bead
in a rosary or chaplet," when the dropping of a rose would imply
carelessness of duty (_Annals_, ii. 51, note). The _New English
Dictionary_ defines _chaplet_ as "A wreath for the head, usually a
garland of flowers or leaves," and cites this passage. Randolph in the
wood, keeping his eyes on the main body, could easily miss an advance
by his flank, which had started independently two miles away, and
probably kept to cover as far as possible.

547 _Wes faldyn._ Skeat explains this form as "fallen" with an
"excrescent _d_, due to Scandinavian influence," citing also _Bk._
XIII. 632. A form, _foolde_, occurs in _The Sowdone of Babylone_,
line 1428, where Hausknecht explains it as from _fealden_, "to fold,"
meaning "folded, bent down, fallen"; citing also "_Folden_ to grunde"
and "Fiftene hundred _Folden_ to grunden," from _Layamon_, 23,894 and
27,055-6. The result as to meaning is the same either way.

548 _war past._ Clifford then had passed the Kirk before Randolph made
a move. The scene of the conflict is usually placed at a position
half-way between St. Ninian's and Stirling, now known as Randolph's
Field. But this name is not older than the end of the eighteenth
century (_Old Stat. Acct._, vol. xviii., p. 408). The origin of the
nomenclature is two standing stones said to have been erected in memory
of the victory (Nimmo's _History of Stirlingshire_, ed. 1817, p. 216).
But standing stones are no uncommon feature in Scotland, and various
traditions attach to them; and why this preference in commemoration?
"Standing stones," on the other side of the Forth, are mentioned in the
_Wallace_ (_Bk._ v. 298).

557 _In hy thai sped thame._ Gray gives an account of this affair,
in which his father was taken prisoner, in the _Scalacronica_ (edit.
Maitland Club. p. 141): "Sir Henry de Beaumont said to his men, 'Let us
retire a little; let them [the Scots] come on; give them room [_donez
les chaumps_.]" His father, Sir Thomas, charging on the Scots, was
carried off a prisoner on foot, his horse having been slain on the
pikes. He, too, mentions the death of Sir William Deyncourt (line 573),
and says the squadron was utterly routed. If Beaumont--to whom, with
Deyncourt, Gray gives the command--proposed to allow the Scots more
room by retiring, his detachment cannot have gone far past Randolph's
original position (_cf._ also line 538). The remark seems absurd if
applied to the ground at Randolph's Field. Buchanan says Randolph had
horse, in which he is clearly wrong (_Rerum Scotic. Hist._, ed. 1762,
chap. xxxix.), and he is followed on this point in White's _History of
the Battle of Bannockburn_ (Edinburgh, 1871), p. 55.

573 _Schir Wilyhame Dencort._ See previous note.

598 _Styk stedis, and ber doune men._ An unhorsed knight in his heavy
suit of full armour was a cumbrous unit, and if he fell, might find
it impossible to rise in the press, or be assisted to do so, so as to
be remounted on a fresh steed by his squire, whose duty it was to see
to this, among other things. The author of the _Vita Edw._ notes as
a mischance deserving remark that in this day's fighting the Earl of
Gloucester was unhorsed (p. 202; see also on _Bk._ XII. 504).


BOOK XII.

22 _quyrbolle._ _Cuir-bouilli_, or "boiled leather," was not really
boiled, as in that case it would become horny and brittle and so quite
unsuitable for the purposes to which it was put--the strengthening of
armour in the transition period of the fourteenth century prior to the
full use of plate, and the making of sheaths, bottles, caskets, etc.
The leather was steeped in a warm mixture of wax and oil, which made it
pliable and fit to receive the designs cut or embossed on it. It was
then slowly dried. Helmet crests or other fittings were also made of
it, as here.

29 _the Boune._ Henricus de Boun in _Vita Edw. Sec._ (see below). The
name is variously spelled--_Bowme_ (C), _Bohun_, etc. He was the nephew
of Hereford. Barbour says "cosyne" in 31, but this, formerly, very
frequently denoted a nephew or niece (N.E.D.).

33 _merk-schot._ Jamieson's _Dictionary_ gives as explanation: "Seems
the distance between the _bow markis_ which were shot at in the
exercise of archery." In the _New English Dictionary_: "The distance
between the butts in archery" (citing this passage). E and H read
_bow-schote_ = 150 to 200 yards.

36 _his men._ That is, the men of his own battle at the "entry," not
the whole army drawn up in line, as is generally assumed. _Cf._ _Bk._
XI. 440-53, and note.

42 _his hors he steris._ _Cf._ with the account, professing to be based
on Barbour, in Scott's _Lord of the Isles_, canto vi., XV.: "The Bruce
stood fast," etc.

49 _in-till a lyng._ "They quickly took their positions so as to come
at each other in a line."

58 _And he doune till the erd can ga._ _I.e._, De Boun; but Sir Herbert
Maxwell says Bruce! (_Robert the Bruce_, p. 205). With this Scottish
version of the event _cf._ the following English one (_c._ 1326):
"When the English had now passed the wood"--_i.e._, the Torwood--"and
were approaching Stirling, behold! the Scots were moving about, as if
in flight, on the edge of the grove" (_sub memore_, _i.e._, the wood
of the New Park), "whom a certain knight, Henry de Boun, with the
Welshmen, pursued up to the entry" (_introitum_, Barbour's "entre") "of
the grove. For he had it in his mind that, if he should find Robert
Bruce there, he would either slay him or bring him back his captive.
But when he had come hither, Robert himself issued suddenly from the
cover of the wood" (_a latebris silvae_); "and the aforesaid Henry,
seeing that he could not resist the crowd of Scots, and wishing to
retire to his friends, turned his horse; but Robert withstood him, and
with the axe which he carried in his hand, smashed in his skull. His
squire, while endeavouring to shield and avenge his lord, is overcome
by the Scots" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 202). Gray says the advanced guard
under the Earl of Gloucester entered the road within the Park and were
repulsed (_tost furvont recoillez._ _Scala._, p. 141) by the Scots;
and that, as was reported, Robert Bruce here slew a knight, Peris de
Mountforth, with an axe. A John de Mountfort was slain at Bannockburn,
and in the list cited his name immediately precedes that of Henry de
Boun (_Annales Londonienses_, p. 231, in _Chronicles of Edward I. and
Edward II._, vol. i.). Buchanan places this incident at the beginning
of the main battle on Monday as something scarcely worth mentioning
(_parum quidem dictu_) (_Rer. Scot. Hist._, ed. 1762, chap. xxxix.).
Barbour, of course, concentrates on Bruce's performance, but the _Vita
Edwardi_ incidentally corroborates Gray in remarking that in this day's
fighting Gloucester was unhorsed (p. 202), which could have happened
only in the Park affair.

67 _thai com on._ As we see, the De Boun affair was part of a serious
skirmish, an attempt to force the road to Stirling through the Park,
in which the English van was repulsed. See above on 58, and hereafter
on 176. This important fact is usually overlooked, as in Hume Brown's
_History_, i., p. 158.

140 _The layff went._ Some, says Gray, fled to the Castle of Stirling
(_au chastel_), the others to the King's host (_Scala._, p. 141).

144-6 "Quickly took off their helmets to get air, for they were hot,
and covered with perspiration."

176 _twis._ _I.e._, repulsed in the De Boun skirmish, and in that of
Randolph and Clifford. These successes were clearly of the greatest
importance, in so far as they put heart into the Scots, and prevented
their being overawed, as they might well have been, by the greatness
and terrifying appearance of the English host. The author of the _Gesta
Edw. de Carnarvon_ thus notes that at Bannockburn "they fought on
both days" (_utrisque diebus pugnaverunt_), and the Scots "prevailed"
(_Chron. Edw. I. and Edw. II._, ii. 46).

194 _gif yhe think_, etc. Bruce here offers his men alternative
courses, either to stay and fight or to retreat. Gray tells us that
the Scots were on the point of retiring to a stronger position in
the Lennox, when Sir Alexander Seton, secretly deserting the English
side--no doubt because he saw that the chances of success were now with
the Scots--came to Bruce and told him of the shaken condition of the
English army, pledging his head that if Bruce attacked next day, he
would win easily, and with little loss (_Scala._, p. 141). Bruce did
attack. Seton was an English partisan in February, 1312 (_Bain_, iii.,
No. 245). Later he appears on the Scottish side (_ibid._, 767, etc.).

210 _Lordyngis_, etc. For Bruce's speech, see _Appendix_ B.

255-6 The various readings here show that to the scribes the sense was
somewhat obscure. Bruce says that, should the English find them weak,
and defeat them, they would have no mercy upon them. Skeat, by reading
_To_ in 255, and putting a period after _oppynly_, misses the point.
_That happyn_ and _that wyn_ are hypothetical subjunctives. E and H
have altered 256.

290 _my brothir Neill._ Nigel Bruce. See IV. 61, 176.

302 _enveronyt._ "The strength of this place shall prevent us being
surrounded"--always Bruce's special fear, his men being few in
comparison with the enemy. See note on _Bk._ XIII. 275.

357 _The Inglis men sic abaysing, Tuk._ Similarly Gray writes that the
English had "sadly lost countenance and were in very _low spirits_"
(_etoint de trop mal covyne_) from what had taken place (_Scala._,
p. 142). "And from that hour," says the _Lanercost Chronicle_, "fear
spread among the English and greater boldness among the Scots" (p.
225). The rhetorical John de Trokelowe, however, declares that the
English were "exasperated" (_exacerbati_), and firmly determined to be
revenged or vanquished on the morrow (_Chronica et Annales_, p. 83).
The last statement, though it would seem to be only a presumption on
the chronicler's part, may apply to the lords, who, Barbour says, urged
on their men to "tak a-mendis." Barbour, Gray, and the _Lanercost_
writer speak for the general mass, and their agreement establishes the
fact.

390 _bot he war socht._ The English certainly feared a night attack.
According to Gray, they passed the night under arms, with their horses
bitted (p. 142). In the _Vita Edwardi_ also we read that there was
no rest for them, and that they spent a sleepless night. "For they
thought the Scots would rather attack by night than await battle in the
daytime" (pp. 202-3).

392 _Doune in the Kers._ The Carse is the low-lying ground along Forth
side, on which were the "pools" (see note on _Bk._ XI. 300), and
which was thus in a generally marshy condition. The ancient limits
of the Carse proper seem to be indicated in the O.S. map by the
names Kerse Patrick, Kerse Mill, and Springkerse, all on the 40-feet
level. Eastwards the land sinks towards the Forth; westwards it rises
slightly to the 50-feet level at the foot of the ridge on which stands
St. Ninian's. This middle division is called "the dryfield lands" in
the _Old Stat. Act_, xviii., p. 388. Friar Baston also has the name:
"The dry land (_arrida terra_) of Stirling" (see note on XI. 360).
The English had to keep to the marshy land of the east in order to
be clear of the Scottish leaguer in the Park. They thus crossed the
Bannock (see below), and kept the "dryfield land" between them and the
Scots. Having crossed, they could advance to the "hard feld" (Barbour)
from their front. It is of the first importance to understand that
the English did camp here, for, if so, the battle was fought on the
strip of level, firm ground separating the armies. Gray corroborates
Barbour: "The host of the King ... had arrived on a plain towards the
water of Forth, _beyond Bannockburn_--a bad, deep morass with pools"
(_ruscelle_, _Scala._, p. 142.). Mr. Lang, seeing the difficulty of
reconciling this statement with the site of battle as fixed by him
and the other historians, says that Gray, in "_beyond Bannockburn_"
(_outre Bannockburn_), must mean "_south_ of Bannockburn, taking the
point of view of his father, at that hour a captive in Bruce's camp"
(_History_, i., p. 221). But Gray's hour of writing was forty years
later; and Barbour, who says the same thing, cannot be explained away
by supposititious hallucination.

407 _quhen it wes day._ "About the third hour of the day" (_Trokelowe_,
p. 84). On June 24 the sun rises about 4 a.m.

413 _Thai maid knychtis._ A usual ceremony before an important battle.
Those receiving the honour for distinguished conduct in the field were
known as "knights-banneret." Previously they had been only "bachelors,"
for which see Glossary.

421 _tuk the playne._ Note the reiteration of this expression, and
_cf._ what is said on _Bk._ XI. 544, and above on 392; also _Vita Ed._,
p. 203: "When he (Bruce) learned that the English battles had occupied
the plain (_campus_), he led out his whole army from the grove" (_de
nemore_).

426 _richt as angelis schane brichtly._ Probably in reference to the
white "surcoats" worn by the knights over their armour (_cf._ _Bk._
VIII. 232-35). Baston writes: "The English folk, like Heaven's folk,
in splendour shine" (_Anglicolae, quasi coelicolae, splendore nitescunt_,
_Scotich._ ed. Goodall, ii., lib. xii., chap. xxii.).

429 _a schiltrum._ A close-packed body of men of any order or size
(see Glossary). _Cf._ _Morte Arthure_, line 2, 922: "Owte of the
_scheltrone_ they schede (separated themselves), as schepe of a folde";
also several other uses in the same poem. Hemingburgh says that
Wallace's "schiltrouns" at Falkirk were round (_qui quidem circuli
vocabantur "schiltrouns,"_ ii., p. 180). Skeat questions this, for
philological reasons! (see note here).

448 _apon fut._ _I.e._, the Scots left the cover of the wood, and
advanced to meet the English chivalry on foot, contrary to all
contemporary rules of the art of war. _Cf._ what is said on _Bk._
XI. 296. "None of them (the Scots) mounted a horse, but every man of
them was protected by light armour such as a sword could not easily
penetrate.... They marched close-packed like a thick hedge, and such a
body could not be easily broken into" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 203). Also
of the Scots: "On their side all were on foot: moreover, chosen men of
the highest courage, suitably equipped with very sharp axes and other
weapons of war, packing their shields close together in front of them,
made the column (_cuneum_) impenetrable" (_Trokelowe_, p. 84). The
formation, in fact, was that of the famous "shield-wall" of Hastings
and other early English battles.

477 _Knelyt all doune._ So, too, in _Chron. de Lanercost_: "But when
the two armies had come very close all the Scots fell on their knees
to say a _Paternoster_, and committed themselves to God, and asked
help from heaven; when they had done this they advanced boldly against
the English" (p. 225). This ceremony was directed by Maurice, Abbot of
Inchaffray, afterwards Bishop of Dunkeld (Bower, _Scotich._, lib. xii.,
ch. xxi.).

488 _dout of ded._ "Fear of death."

498 _Schir Edward._ The author of _Vita Edw._ says it was commanded by
James Douglas, but in this he is wrong (p. 203).

504 _frusching of speris, etc._ The _Lanercost_ writer, who derived his
information, as he himself says, from a trustworthy eyewitness, has a
very similar description. The English chargers, he writes, galloped
against the Scottish spears as against a thick wood, "whereupon arose
an exceeding great and terrible noise from breaking spears and steeds
mortally wounded" (p. 225). The Scots, of course, would "stick" the
horses, so as to unseat the heavily armoured riders--a serious accident
for them (see note on _Bk._ XI. 598).

519 _With speris ... and axis._ Of the Scots it is said in _Vita Edw._:
"They had an axe by the side, and carried spears (_lanceas_) in their
hands" (p. 203). For the "weill grundyn" axes, _cf._ _Trokelowe_ above,
line 448.

535 _He held his way._ The Scots appear to have attacked with
successive battles, each coming up later than, and to the left of, its
predecessor--in echelon by the right. So we may infer from Barbour,
as well as from the rather obscure description in the _Lanercost_
chronicle: "But they so ordered their army, that two divisions (_duae
acies_) of it should precede the third, the first on the flank of
the second, so that neither should go in front of the other (_una ex
latere alterius, ita quod neutra aliam praecederet_), to be followed by
the third, in which was Robert" (p. 225). Gray simply says that the
advance guard of the Scots came on in line of schiltrons and engaged
the English (_Scala._, p. 142). Baker alone states that the Scots stood
drawn up in solid array behind an artificial "hurdle" covered ditch,
and waited the English attack (_Chron._, p. 56).

537 _The nyne battales._ Probably, as Mr. Oman suggests (_Art of
War_, p. 574), in the way the French were at Crecy, in three lines of
three battles each, the advance guard under Gloucester and Hereford
thus forming a separate body (_cf._ lines 435-7). Mr. Oman gives the
tenth, however, to "a reserve under the King" (_ibid._). Baker, whose
account is the latest and is really a summary essay on tactics, divides
the English army into three "wards" (_custodias_): first, the heavy
horsemen, which he tumbles into the "fragile" ditch (see above on 536,
and note on _Bk._ XI. 360); next, the foot with the archers reserved to
deal with the enemy in flight (see on _Bk._ XIII. 51); and, third, the
King himself, with the bishops and other "religious" men (_Chronic._,
56-7).


BOOK XIII.

32 _tynt the suet._ "Lost their lives." The phrase in this sense occurs
also in the _Wallace_: "The Scottis on fute gert mony _loiss the
suete_" (_The Wallace_, Jamieson's edition, _Bk._ xii., line 194).

36 _slew fire._ "Struck out fire." Also in _Wallace_, iv. 285: "_slew
fyr_ on flint." _Cf._ from _The Buik of Alexander_: "thare dyntis, That
_kest fyre_ as man dois flyntis" (p. 236, line 24).

51 _the archeris war perelous._ Baker says that the archers were not
given a suitable position, as in his time, being placed behind the
first line instead of on the wings (_cf._ note on _Bk._ XII. 537, and
below lines 102-5, and note on 104). "Some," he adds, "shot upwards
so that their arrows fell fruitlessly (_incassum_) on the helmets of
their adversaries; those who shot straight wounded a few Scots in the
breast, but more English in the back" (_Chron._, pp. 57-58). At Falkirk
(1298), after the failure of the first attack by the horsemen, Edward
I. brought up his archers to play on the Scottish masses till these
were broken, and then charged and dispersed them. Bruce anticipated
this manoeuvre, and made provision for it (see note on 98).

61 _Robert of Keth._ The Kethes or Keiths took their name from the
barony of Keith, in Lothian. This Robert was still in the English
service on May 23, 1308 (_Bain_, iii. 44), yet his name appears among
those present at Bruce's Parliament of March 16, 1309, as Robert de
Kethe, Marshall (_Acts Parl. Scot._, i., p. 99). Elsewhere he is said
to have joined Bruce at Christmas, 1308 (_Bain_, No. 245). He received
from Bruce the office of Earl Marshall as its holders, one of the
branches of the "Mareschals," were adherents of England, and continued
to be (_Bain_, iii., p. lxviii).

68 _at a syde._ "On one side," as in line 163, "in-till a front." This
movement is too vaguely described to be located exactly. Most probably
it was to the left of the three "battles" now engaged (English right),
on ground presently occupied by Bruce with his own division.

98 _nakit._ "Without defensive armour," as in _Bk._ VII. 330. The
two previous lines mean that the Scottish horsemen did not have to
stop a stroke or hold against a blow; _i.e._, the archers offered no
resistance. Bruce's intention, we may gather from lines 58-60, was
so to harass the archers on the flank as to occupy them with their
own defence and restrain their shooting. The attack, however, was so
successfully pushed home that the archers were wholly scattered.

104 _thair awne folk had no space._ We gather that the archers had
taken up a position on the right front of the main body, where they
blocked the advance of the horsemen directly behind. These received the
flying archers with blows, and pushed forward to take their place. The
_Lanercost_ chronicler says the battle began with a skirmish between
the opposing archers, and that the Scots archers were driven back.
This, again, suggests that the archers were somewhere in front. Mr.
Oman follows Baker in placing them behind the first line. See note on
51.

132 _on a syde._ See above on 68.

162 _All four the battelis._ The _Vita Edw. Sec._ (p. 203) and the
_Chron. de Lanercost_ (p. 225) divide the Scots into three battles
(_turmas_, _acies_), the usual medieval arrangement. The latter also
gives Robert the rear division, as here.

175 _in ane schiltrum all._ Gray says that the "battles" of the English
were crowded close together (_entassez estoint_), and could not repeat
their attacks upon the Scots (_remuerent devers eaux_), as their horses
were impaled by the pikes (p. 142). In the _Lanercost_ chronicle we
read that the English behind (_sequentes_) "were not able to reach
the Scots because of the interposition of the first line, nor in any
way to help themselves" (p. 224). The English, indeed, were too many
to be manoeuvred according to the simple tactics of the day, and were,
in addition, crowded on too narrow a front. There was no generalship.
These were Bruce's chief advantages. He was protected by the hill
and wood behind from being surrounded (_cf._ note on _Bk._ XI. 300).
Besides, his rapid and successive advance prevented the English from
developing any such intention. They could not well deploy among the
"pools" and marshes.

183 _quyntis._ "_Quyntis_ is merely the French _cointises_, signifying
finery or _quaint_ attire" (Skeat); generally, ornamental attachments
to the armour. E reads _quhytys_, and H _coates_, so that we may
have to do with the "white" surcoats. In viii. 232 Barbour speaks of
hauberks "quhit as flour."

208 _the Scottis archeris._ The effective part played by the Scottish
archers is usually overlooked.

283 _quhen the King of England saw his men fle._ The English writers
make no mention of the appearance of the camp-followers. They date the
break-up from the failure of Gloucester's attack with the van. As those
behind, says the _Lanercost_ chronicler, could not get forward (see
note on 275), nothing remained but to take measures for flight (pp.
225-6). The front line had fallen back only to add to the confusion
(_cf._ line 170, etc.). "When those who were with the King saw the
Earl's division smashed up (_contritum_) and their friends making
ready to fly, they said it was dangerous to stay longer," etc. (_Vita
Edw. Sec._, p. 205). Gray says the King went much against his will (as
Barbour reports one version in line 298), and that he knocked over
with his mace the Scots that were catching at his charger's housings
(_Scala._, p. 142). Trokelowe affirms that he laid about him "like a
lion," and brandished a sword dripping with blood (_Annales_, p. 86).

297 _By the renyhe._ "Those who had been assigned to the King's rein
were drawing the King forward by the rein out of the plain (_hors du
chaumpe_) towards the castle" (_Scala._, p. 142).

307 _I cheis heir to byde and de._ In _Vita Edw. Sec._ it is said he
hastened to assist the Earl of Gloucester when he saw him fall, and
perished with him, "thinking it more honourable to perish with such a
man than to escape death by flight" (p. 204). _Cf._ also _Scala._: "I
have never been accustomed to fly" (p. 143).

321 _thrid best knycht._ See note on _Bk._ XI. 174. He is highly spoken
of by both Baston and the _Vita Edw._ writer. According to Bruce's
English eulogist in the _Scotichronicon_, the other two were Bruce
himself and the Emperor Henry (lib. xiii., ch. xvi.).

328-9 _fra ... the King Wes fled, wes nane that durst abyde._ "When
the King's banner is seen to depart the whole army quickly disperses"
(_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 205).

335 _Fled to the wattir of Forth._ On no hypothesis other than that
the battle was fought on the plain between the Forth and the Bannock
can this fact be explained. Of the fact itself there is no question.
The _Lanercost_ chronicler, in his _Versus_, says: "Forth swallowed up
many well furnished with arms and horses" (p. 227). They were probably
seeking for a ford.

337 _And Bannokburn._ "The folk in the English rear fell back upon the
ditch (_fosse_) of Bannockburn, one tumbling over the other" (_Scala._,
p. 142). "Another unfortunate thing happened to the English, because,
since a little before they had crossed a great ditch into which the
tide flows--Bannockburn by name--and now in confusion wished to retire,
many knights and others, on account of the pressure, fell into it with
their horses (_cf._ Barbour, line 338), and some with great difficulty
got out, and many were quite unable to clear themselves of the ditch;
and on this account Bannockburn was on English lips for many years to
come" (_Lanercost_, 226). In _Vita Edw._ also mention is made of a
"certain ditch" (_fovea_) which "swallowed up (_absorbuit_) many," and
where a great part perished (p. 205). The Bannock turns sharply north
near the English rear, but the description in Barbour and the reference
above to the tide with the inclusion of the Forth, indicate the part
nearer the mouth.

341 _laddis_, etc. _I.e._, the camp-followers.

352 _Of slyk._ In _Chron. de Lanercost_ (p. 226) "Bannock's mud"
(_Bannoke limus_). Edmund de Malolacu (Mauley), Edward's steward,
met his death "in a certain slimy hollow" (_in quodam antro lutoso._
_Flores Historiarum_, iii., p. 159).

363 _Philip the Mowbray said._ Different interpretations were put
upon Mowbray's action, but the fact and the quite satisfactory reason
given by Barbour are borne out by the English chroniclers. "When the
King comes to the castle, thinking he will find refuge there, he is
repulsed like an enemy; the bridge is drawn up and the gate closed. On
this account the keeper of the castle was believed by many to be not
unacquainted with treason, and yet he was seen that very day in his
armour on the field, as it were ready to fight for the King. However,
I neither acquit nor accuse the keeper of treason, but confess that in
the providence of God the King of England did not enter the castle,
because if he had then been admitted he could not have failed to be
captured" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 205). In _Gesta Edw. de Carnarvon_ the
Governor is wrongly called Alexander de Mowbray, and the account is:
"The foresaid keeper, knowing that his supplies were not sufficient
for himself and his men, and also fearing that Robert Bruce, having
got the victory, would attack and capture the castle, did not wish to
expose his King of England to such great danger, and, preferring to
incur misunderstanding, refused on this account to open the castle of
the King" (p. 47). The castle was surrendered, and Mowbray entered the
service of Bruce.

379 _the Rownde Tabill._ Usually and quite wrongly identified with
the King's Knot--_i.e._, garden--a regular mound below the castle
rock. It is mentioned by Sir David Lindsay in the sixteenth century.
In 1302 Edward I. had a "Round Table" (_la table rounde_) ordained
(_ordinari_) at Falkirk (_Ann. Lond._, p. 104). To "hold a Round Table"
was a sporting function among knights; here some sort of building may
be referred to, like that described by Murimuth (1344), intended to be
built for the purpose at Windsor (_Chronicle_, p. 155). Probably, in
that case, it was only of Barbour's own time. I incline, however, to
the belief, from its associations in Lindsay's verse, that it was a
natural feature--the circular crags enclosing the western division of
the modern King's Park. It would thus be a place-name, like "Arthur's
Seat."

380 _the Park enveronyt thai._ Gray says the King was taken round the
Torwood and by the plains of Lothian (Lownesse, p. 143).

381 _held in hy._ The _Lanercost_ chronicler says that they had "as
guide a Scottish knight who knew by what route they could escape" (p.
227).

409 _wes tane in._ The _Lanercost_ chronicler writes that Hereford and
those with him were making for Carlisle when they were captured at
Bothwell Castle: "For the sheriff, the keeper of the castle, who up
to that time had held the castle for the King of England, seeing that
his countrymen had been victorious in the war, suffered the more noble
of them who had come there to enter the castle as if to have a safe
retreat, and when they entered seized them," afterwards surrendering
them to Bruce (p. 228). In the anonymous chronicle used by Stevenson
we have a similar account. Hereford and a few nobles were allowed to
enter the castle, where they found themselves in custody. The rest
remained outside the walls, and were suddenly set on by the Scots, who
slew them, except a few who surrendered (_Illustrations of Scottish
History_, p. 2). Barbour says three-fourths were taken or slain (416).
In _Ann. Lond._ Hereford is said to have been accompanied by a thousand
men-at-arms (p. 231). The _Lanercost_ estimate is 600 horse and 1,000
foot, Umfraville being of the company (_ibid._). Walsingham gives the
total of earls, barons, and baronets captured and slain as 154; of
clerics and squires an excessive number (_Historia Angl._, i., p. 154).
The name of the keeper was Gilbertson as in E; he appears on record as
"Fitz-Gilbert" (_Bain_, iii. No. 243, etc.). He joined Bruce and was
the ancestor of the great Hamilton family. Bothwell Castle is on the
Clyde.

417 _Moris de Berclay._ In _Vita Edw._ (p. 206) he is among those
captured at Bothwell. According to the _Lanercost_ historian, it was
Pembroke (Valence) who fled "on foot" with the Welshmen, and escaped
(p. 228). In _Ann. Lond._ de Valence is said to have fled _nudis
pedibus_ (bare-footed); that is, apparently, he removed his foot and
leg armour (p. 230).

456 _Thai dispendit haly that day, In spoulyheing._ The author of _Vita
Edw._ declares that it was the preoccupation of the Scots with the
plunder that allowed many English to escape. In his precise way, he
estimates that the valuable equipment which fell to the Scots was worth
L200,000 (p. 206), or at the ratio of 1:15 about L3,000,000 present day
(_cf._ note on 667-8).

463 _spuris rede._ _I.e._, gilt or gold spurs worn only by knights.
The 700 pairs of C would give us 700 knights slain; E's 200 is
probably nearer the truth. In _Ann. Lond._, (p. 231) we get a list of
thirty-seven knights slain at "the battle of Stirling." Of the foot and
squires, it is said, the most part (_maxima pars_) was not slain. Baker
says about 300 men-at-arms (_viri militares_) were among the slain
(57). Bower gives 200 knights slain besides Gloucester (_Scotich._
Goodall, edition 1759, ii., p. 250). Walsingham, from his MS. source,
fixes the number of knights and squires who fell at 700 (_Historia
Anglicana_, p. 141); Capgrave the lords, barons, and knights slain and
captured at 154. More than 500 were reported dead who were afterwards
found to be captives (_Chronicle_, p. 180) and had to be ransomed
(_Vita Edw._, p. 206). Fabyan gives forty-two noblemen slain, and
sixty-seven knights and baronets, while twelve "men of name" were taken
prisoner (_New Chronicles_, p. 420).

466 _Gilbert of Clar._ About twenty-three years of age (_Ann. Lond._,
p. 231). He fell in the first charge (_Vita Edw._; _Baker_). Baker says
the Scots would have gladly taken him alive for ransom had they known
who he was, but that he did not wear his surcoat (_toga_) with his coat
of arms (p. 57). _Cf._ lines 510-11. _That men callit_, says Barbour,
having in mind Ralph de Monthermer, his step-father who had previously
borne the title.

468 _Payne Typtot._ Paganus Typetot (_Vita Edw._) or Tybetot (_Ann.
Lond._). "Paganus Typetoft," or "Typetot," is the name in _Chron. de
Lanercost_.

472 _Wilyhame Vepownt._ Sir William de Vepont (Veteriponte) was a
Scotsman in the service of England till 1312, having been imprisoned on
capture during the Comyn resistance in 1302. He was under Valence in
Ayr in 1307 (_Bain_, ii., Nos. 1,283, 1,294; iii., No. 263). _Walter
the Ros_ was serving England in Linlithgow in 1312 (_Bain_, iii., p.
411).

486 _at rebours._ _I.e._, treated badly, held "in great dislike"
(Skeat). See Glossary. Edward had a son, Alexander, by Isabella of
Atholl (_Exchq. Rolls_, II. cxxxii.).

489-90 _Erll Davy of Adell._ Lord Hailes did not know "what judgment to
form of this story," in view of the fact that sentence of forfeiture
was not passed against Atholl till 1323 (_Annales_, ii. 58 note). But
his lands were forfeited by October, 1314, and granted to Sir Neil
Campbell (Robertson's _Index_, p. 26; ii. _Scots Peerage_), and he,
then being in England, received three manors from Edward II. "till he
recovers his Scottish possessions" (_Bain_, iii., p. 75). Atholl's
career is, however, puzzling. His wife was Johanna, daughter of the
murdered Comyn of Badenoch. Up till 1312 he is a supporter of England,
and in December of that year even seems to have sat in the English
Parliament. But in the previous October he is among those present in
Bruce's Parliament at Inverness (_Acta. Parl. Scot._, vol. i., 103);
next appears as Constable of Scotland, and, early in 1313, is a witness
to charters to the Abbey of Arbroath (_Scots Peerage_). Then comes a
blank till October, 1314, as above. There is thus room for Barbour's
story: Atholl did give a short-lived support to the national cause,
and a forfeiture of his lands did follow soon after Bannockburn. He
remained an active adherent of England till his death, January, 1327.

495 _Wilyhame of Herth._ Apparently William Mareschal of Erth (_Bain_,
iii. 343; _cf._ note on 61). Sir William de Erth was a supporter of
Comyn in the Barons' War, and capitulated with him and others at
Strathorde on February 9, 1304 (_Bain_, ii., No. 1,741). William de
Erth, knight, was alive in 1333 (_Bain_, iii. 1,099). Erth, or Airth,
is on the east of Stirlingshire, on the Forth.

510 _somdeill anoyit._ _Cf._ note on 466.

512 _till a kirk he gert hym be Brocht._ John de Trokelowe says that
Bruce sent the bodies of Gloucester and Clifford to King Edward while
at Berwick, to be buried as he wished, and this without demanding any
payment as ransom (_Annales_, p. 87).

533 _Betung_ in C is certainly wrong; E gives the correct form
_Twenge_. Marmaduke de Twenge appears on the list in _Foedera_ and
elsewhere. He was the hero of Stirling Bridge (1297), who cut his way
back over the bridge.

531 _trete hym curtasly._ Trokelowe says that Bruce caused his noble
prisoners to be treated so becomingly and courteously (_decenter ac
civiliter_) "that the hearts of many who were opposed to him he turned,
in a wonderful way, to feeling an affection for him" (_Annales_, p. 87).

544 _become of his dwelling._ "Became one of his company," as in _Bk._
IV. 481, where Bruce says of Douglas and his men in Arran: "Thai ar all
of my duelling."

553 _Lowrens_ = Lawrence. Probably the same Sir Lawrence de Abernethy
who in 1338 had provisions sent him by Edward III. for the Castle of
Hawthornden. He was thus "Inglis man" again (_Bain_, iii., p. 235, No.
1,291).

578-85 _He convoyit thame so narrowly, etc._ "Some, however, lagging
in the flight, were slain by the Scots, who followed them swiftly
(_velociter_)" (_Chron. de Lanercost_, p. 227). "The King escaped with
great trouble" (_a graunt payn_, _Scala._, p. 143).

587 _Wynchburch._ On the road from Linlithgow to Edinburgh.

592 _so feill._ According to the _Lanercost_ historian, the King was
accompanied by many knights and footmen (p. 227).

612 _Erll Patrik._ Of March. See note on _Bk._ XI. 46. "Patrick Earl of
March received him honourably, etc., for at that time he was his man"
(_soun homager_. _Scala._, 143.).

615-16 _A bate_, etc. "When he came thither (Dunbar) he embarked on a
ship, and with his own company put in at Berwick" (_Vita Edw. Sec._,
p. 205). "Thence the King went by sea to Berwick and afterwards to the
south" (_Scala._, 143). "At Dunbar the King, with his special friends,
embarked on a boat (_scapham_) for Berwick" (_Lanercost_, p. 227).
Barbour says they landed at Bamborough on the coast of Yorkshire, and
in line 645 gives the number who thus accompanied the King as seventeen.

619-21 _The laiff_, etc. "The others (see above), not having a ship,
come (to Berwick) by land" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 205). The King,
says the _Lanercost_ writer, left all the others to their fate, who,
however, came safe and sound to England (p. 228).

631 _The Kyng eschapit._ According to Baker, "no mortal ingenuity,
neither the swiftness of the horses nor the cover on the way
(_involucra locorum_) could have kept the King from capture by the
Scots," had not Christ Himself, at the intercession of His Mother,
brought him out of Scottish territory, as both the King and his
companions afterwards confessed. In his peril Edward vowed to found a
monastery dedicated to the "Mother of God," where twenty-four friars
might study theology (_Baker_, p. 58); and, in fulfilment thereof,
established Oriel College at Oxford (_Hailes_, ii. 57 note).

667-8 _The castell and the towrys ... doune gert he myne._ Stirling
Castle thus lay in ruins till 1336-7, when it was rebuilt for Edward
III. "after the conquest," probably on the old plan. Stone walls
and towers were erected, a "peel" of wood, to the north the walls
(_parietes_) of which were plastered over, and various inner buildings
for the garrison, etc., also of wood daubed with mortar and roofed with
turf (_Bain_, iii., pp. 364-8). The rebuilding and repairs cost L280,
equal to about L4,000 now (_Bain_, lviii.).

676 _he gaf._ See note on 409.

687 _The Erll wes changit._ In _Vita Edw. Sec._ (pp. 208-9) is recorded
the exchange of the Earl for the wife of Bruce and other Scottish
captives, including the Bishop of Glasgow. On October 2, 1314, "Robert,
Bishop of Glasgow, the Countess Carrick, wife of Robert de Brus, with
his sister and daughter and Donald de Mar," were at Carlisle Castle,
"to be taken thence to a place arranged by the Earl of Essex and
Hereford and the Sheriff" (_Bain_, iii., No. 393). Mar is, no doubt,
the "young earl" referred to in the _Vita Edw._, which says further
that Edward gave to his sister, Hereford's wife, all the Scottish
captives since the time of Edward I.--fifteen and more--to procure the
release of her husband (p. 208).

695 _wes King._ Robert II.

697 _Davy._ David II. (June 7, 1329 to February 22, 1371). He scarcely
deserved Barbour's epithet "worthy."

702 _Fif yheir._ In 1375 Robert was in the fifth year of his reign; he
would not have "passit" it till February 22, 1376. He was born March
2, 1316, and in 1375 was in his sixtieth year. The year in Scotland,
however, began on March 25, so that Barbour's cross-dating really
stands for what we should call the early spring of 1376. He was then
engaged on _The Bruce_.

705-6 _the gud King Robert._ _I.e._, Robert I. the Bruce, dead
forty-six years. It is curious to find this elaborate dating "of
the compyling of this book" here, and not at the end. Evidently the
mention of the marriage of the Steward, the reigning King's father, is
Barbour's cue. There is no reason to suppose that this was a subsequent
insertion, and we may conclude that the poem was completed somewhat
later.

736 _our-raid all Northumbirland._ "They (the Scots) plundered
the northern bounds of England as far as Richmond and returned,
devastating the country with fire and carrying off with them many
captives" (_Gesta Edwardi_, p. 47). _Cf._ Barbour, lines following. On
July 1, 1314, the Bishop of Durham writes the King regarding Scottish
preparations for an invasion of England, of which he has heard. On
October 7, 1314, the Prior and Convent of Durham pay the Earl of Murray
eight hundred marks to secure the bishopric immunity from invasion
for a stated period (_Letters from Northern Registers_, Nos. cxliv.,
cxlix.). According to the _Lanercost_ chronicler, the Scots entered
by Berwick, and burned almost all Northumberland, spared Durham for a
monetary consideration, penetrated to the Tees and to Richmond, and
returned, via Lanercost, with a great body of cattle and captives (pp.
228, 229).


BOOK XIV.

4 _Scotland to litill wes._ According to the Annalist, it was the Scots
who were not satisfied with their own country; but this is merely
a rhetorical comment (_Annals of Ireland_, p. 344). The anonymous
Chronicle in Stevenson's _Illustrations_ says that Edward Bruce,
elated by the success of the Scots, aspired to the name of King (_ad
nomen regium aspirans_, p. 3). Fordun's version is the same as that
of Barbour: "Edward Bruce was not willing to live in peace with his
brother unless he got half the kingdom for himself, and for this reason
the war was started in Ireland" (_Gesta Annalia_, cxxxiii.).

8 _had treting With the Erischry._ It was afterwards (1316-17) made a
charge against Walter de Lacy and Hugh de Lacy, Earl of Ulster, that
they had sent messengers and letters to invite Edward Bruce to Ireland.
The legal documents in the case are given in _Chartularies, etc., of
St. Mary's Abbey_ (vol. ii., pp. 407-9). This charge is also noted in
the _Annals of Ireland_ (Fragment), under February 2, 1317, where it is
said that, on inquiry, the Lacys were acquitted (p. 298). Nevertheless,
they and their relatives were fined L200 (_Preface_, p. cxxix). The
_Chronicle_ in Stevenson appears to refer to the same case, when it
says that Edward Bruce was persistently (_saepissime_) invited by a
certain Irish magnate with whom he had been educated in his youth (p.
3).

21 _Maii._ "The Scots first entered Ireland on May 26, 1315" (_die
Sancti Augustini Anglorum, mense Maii._ _Annals of Ireland_, p. 344).
The _Annals of Ulster_ fix his landing at the beginning of the year
(ii., p. 423); as do also _Annals of Loch Ce_ (i., p. 563). Edward
Bruce had a fleet of 300 ships (_Annals of Clonmacnoise_, p. 268).

25 _Philip the Mowbray._ _Cf._ _Bk._ XIII., line 544. Mowbray's name
does not appear in the _Annals_ as accompanying Edward Bruce, nor that
of Soulis or Ramsay, but others are mentioned (p. 344). Mowbray is
mentioned later (_Annals, Fragment_, p. 299), and in _Knighton_, i., p.
411.

28 _Schir Johne Steward._ Brother of Sir Walter Steward. See _Bk._
XVIII. 33 (_Annals_, 344).

29 _Ouchtirhouss_, or Auchterhouse, is in the south of Forfarshire.
From the _Wallace_ we learn that this was Alexander Ramsay, son of Sir
John Ramsay Wallace's friend.

  "His sone was called the flour of courtlyness;
  As witnes weill in to the schort tretty
  Eftir the Bruce, quha redis in that story."

  (_The Wallace_, _Bk._ vii. 900-2.)

31 _Fergus de Ardrossane._ Ardrossan is on the coast of Ayr. Fergus
had at first joined Bruce, was captured, and procured his release by
going over to Edward II., from whom he in 1312 received the "barony of
Bisshoplande," near Kirkintilloch (_Bain_, iii., Nos. 51, 227, 265).
Probably he reverted to Bruce after Bannockburn. He is among those
mentioned in the _Annals_ (p. 344). He received a fresh grant of the
lands of Ardrossan and others apparently in 1316 (_Reg. Mag. Sig._, pp.
10, 51).

33 _Wokingis Firth._ This name is evidently corrupt. Innes identifies
it with Larne Lough, and so also do Bain and Skeat, citing from Reeves
(_Eccles. History of Down and Connor_) forms such as Wolderfrith,
etc., and the present Olderfleet Castle on that Lough (_Bain_, iii.
xxxiv, note). In a letter of Edward II., 1311, we have "Wolrikesford,
near Knacfergus (Carrickfergus), in Ulster," whence a fleet is to sail
against Robert Bruce (_Bain_, iii., No. 216). In 1327 King Robert is
to get corn from the Ulster men delivered at "Ulringfirth" (_ibid._,
922). The _Annals_ say, first, that the Scots put it at "Clondonne," or
Glen Dun, in Antrim, south of Torr Head, the nearest point (eighteen
miles) to the Scottish coast, and, immediately after, that they entered
Ireland "near Cragfergus, in Ulster" (p. 344). Robert Bruce was at
"Glendouyne" when he executed the agreement mentioned above. Probably
the Scots touched at Glendun, and then coasted down to Larne Lough.

38 _sex thousand men._ Six thousand is the number in the _Annals_ (p.
344).

47 _Maundvell._ The Scots "drove out Sir Thomas de Maundevile and other
loyal men from their own land" (_Annals of Ireland_, p. 344). The
Bysets were descended from John Byset, who was banished from Scotland
by Alexander II., and who got land in Antrim under the de Burghs. The
Logans were large proprietors in the north of Ireland (Reeves's _Down
and Connor_ in _Innes_), as also were the Savages (_ibid._). John Logan
and Sir Hugh Byset are the heroes of a great slaughter of the Scots
in Ulster on November 1, 1316 (_Annals, Fragment_, p. 298). Sir Hugh
afterwards joined the Scots (_Bain_, iii., No. 632).

80 _In that battale._ Near the river Bann (_Annals_, 344). "_tane or
slane._"--The Earl of Ulster, Richard de Burgh, was put to flight; his
son, William de Burgh, and John de Statona were captured, and many
English slain. The Scots were successful (_Annals_, pp. 344-5).

102 _the kyngis._ _Reguli_, petty kings or important chiefs, a usual
Gaelic equivalent. _Cf._ _Bk._ XVIII. 9 and note.

105 _Makfulchiane_ (C), _Makgullane_, _Makgoulchane_ (H). Jamieson says
Irish Macleans (MacGillian); Innes suggests MacCoolechan: "MacEthelan"
is among the chiefs in _Foedera_ (iii., p. 476). Most likely we have
to do with _O'Fuillchain_ in the form _MacFuillchain_, from which, by
_MacFhuillchain_, could also come _MacGuillchain_, as in H.

106 _Makartane_, _Makmartane_ (C), _Macarthane_ (H). "Macartan" was one
of "the septs of Ire, son of Miletus" (_Annals of Clonmacnoise_, p. 30).

113 _Endwillane._ Innes suggests "the Pass of Emerdullam" (1343), which
he identifies with Moiry Pass, where Moiry Castle is about a quarter
of a mile from Kilnsaggart, or Kilsaggart. Apparently this is Moiry
Castle, north of Dundalk.

133 _At Kilsaggart._ Kilnasaggart ("cell of the priest"), about a
quarter of a mile from Moiry Castle; for which see on _Bk._ XVI. 62.

135 _Dundawk._ Dundalk, within the English Pale. For spelling, _cf._ in
XI. 437 and _Appendix_ G.

138 _Richard of Clare._ Barbour has been censured by his editors,
following the cue of Lord Hailes (_Annals_, ii. 70, note), for the
prominence given to Richard de Clare in the opposition to the Scots.
True, as Hailes pointed out and reasons from, he was not the Justiciar
of Ireland, a post occupied at this time by Sir Edmund de Butler
(_Historic and Munic. Docts., Ireland_, p. 328); after November 23,
1316, by Roger de Mortimer (_Patent Rolls_); and so was not technically
"in all Irland luf-tenand." Nevertheless it is perfectly certain that
Clare took the leading part, at this stage at least, in the defence
of English interests, and that Barbour's statement to this extent
is justified. Thus, in a letter to Edward of February 15, 1316, it
is mentioned, with respect to the operations of the Scots, that the
writer, to protect the King's honour, will take counsel with certain
lords and Richard de Clare, a reference which Bain (Index) interprets
to mean that Clare was in command in Ireland. The writer, too, thinks
it worth mentioning that Clare was not at the battle (of Arscoll).
Again, on May 16, Clare is pardoned an ancestral debt for his great
labour and cost repelling the disturbance stirred up in Ireland by
the Scottish enemies" (_Bain_, iii., Nos. 469, 488; _Patent Rolls_,
p. 459). And there is a further grant of same date to de Clare, "in
consideration of his great labours as above," of certain privileges,
castles, and lands, "to hold during pleasure, and the continuance of
the disturbance by the Scots, in aid of his maintenance on the King's
service" (_Patent Rolls_, p. 459).

142 _Erll of Kyldare._ The Geraldines, or Fitz-Geralds, had been Earls
of Kildare since 1294 (_Annals of Ireland_, p. 323 and Index).

143 _The Bremayne with the Wardune._ This pair appear in later
operations as "Richard de Birmingham" and "Robert de Verdon" (_Annals_,
p. 350). But on May 18, 1316, Nicholas de Verdun gets 200 marks for
losses sustained against the Scots (_Patent Rolls_).

145 _The Butler._ Edmund de Butler, Justiciary (_cf._ on 138).

146 _Moris le Fyss Thomas._ Maurice Fitz-Thomas, who married, in 1312,
the daughter of the Earl of Ulster, and afterwards (1329) was created
Earl of Desmond (_Annals_, p. 341).

172 _on the morn._ June 29, 1315 (_Annals_, p. 345).

188 _Half-deill ane dyner._ In the _Alexander_ Clarus says of the army
of Alexander:

  "And thay ar anely till dynare
  To our great hoste" (pp. 308-9).

224-6 "The Scots took the town, spoiled and burned, and slew all who
resisted" (_Annals_, 344).

252 _Kilross._ "(Cill-rois of Adamnan) is now Maghross, or
Carrickmacross" (_Innes_).

254 _Richard of Clare._ According to the _Annals_, Edmund de Butler (p.
345).

257 _A gret hoost._ "A great army"; and Richard de Burgh with "an
innumerable army" as well. They came together to the district of
Dundalk (p. 345).

270 _to ges._ Barbour usually "guesses" ten thousand to "a battle," as
here and elsewhere.

280 _gadering of the cuntre._ _I.e._, "mere countrymen not skilled
soldiers." This great army was raised from Munster, Leinster, and
Connaught (_Annals_, p. 345), and Edward Bruce's description is no
doubt right.

289 _stedis trappit._ See note on _Bk._ XI. 130.

300 _fled scalit._ "They fled--how is unknown" (_Annals_, p. 345). The
date is _circa_ July 22, 1315.

313 _Judas Machabeus._ See note on _Bk._ I. 466.

329 _Odymsy._ "Fyn O'Dymsy" among those summoned to Bannockburn
(_Foedera_, iii. 476). O'Dempsy was "dux Reganorum," or chief of the
_Ui' Riagain_; Iregan in Queen's County (_Annals_, p. 333). In the
_Annals of Clonmacnoise_ Bruce is taken north "by the procurement of
O'Neal and Ulstermen" (p. 269).

332 _To se his land._ _I.e._, in Leinster. He, of course, takes them
out of the way (_cf._ on 360).

337 _A gret revar._ Skeat holds that this is the Blackwater flowing
into the southern end of Lough Neagh, which was the boundary between
the English Pale and the independent country of the Tyrone O'Neils,
and was of old known as the Avon More, "the great river." But this
is inconsistent with lines 369-371, where one of the rivers is the
northern Bann, "ane arme of se," and Skeat's ingenious explanation
of the latter phrase, taking sea = Lough, Beg or Neagh, is quite
superfluous. In fact, he is astray as to vital details, as witness what
is said on Thomas Dun (line 376). Barbour himself is unsatisfactorily
vague in his geographical matter, and none of the _Annals_ makes any
mention of the trick here descanted upon, nor of the intervention of
the pirate Thomas. But the main features can be found in the _Annals of
Clonmacnoise_, pp. 269-271, and _Annals of Loch Ce_, 265-7. The Scots
and the Ulster men (Antrim and Down) were at Innis Kaeyne (Innishkeen),
seven miles west of Dundalk. The English marched to Louth, just south
of them. The Scots retired through Ulster (Antrim and Down), not, as
Skeat suggests, by the west shore of Lough Neagh, until they came
to Coleraine, not far from the Bann estuary. Then they crossed the
river by the bridge, which they broke down so that the English who
followed them could not cross, and the Bann lay between the two armies.
Thereupon the English plundered on the Ulster side, apparently among
the sympathizers with the Scots, finally retreating to Connor (_cf._
lines 396, 460). In the interval must have occurred the attempted
drowning out of the Scots and the passage back over the river by means
of Thomas of Dun, who had sailed up the estuary of the Bann (line 371).

354 _The ysche of a louch._ "The outlet of a loch"; from the hurried
nature of the operation necessarily a small loch or a narrow outlet;
possibly, too, a loch since drained off. It cannot be Lough Beg, for
that would be too far away for Thomas Dun. On the other hand, they must
have been brought some distance up the west side of the Bann, for after
they had crossed it was still not known where they were (line 386),
and they soon got in touch with the English, who were ten miles from
Connor, to which they afterwards retreated (460).

360 _With mekill payne._ To add to the difficulties of this passage,
the misleading of the Scots seems to be claimed for the Lacys in the
case regarding them (see on line 8). The Lacys explain that on the
occasion on which they had a conference (_parliamentaverunt_) with
Edward Bruce they, by their cunning (_per eorum cautelam_), led Edward
Bruce with his army among the Irish who were felons to the King--that
is, apparently, the North Ulster men (see on 337). Among them Edward
Bruce marched for fourteen days, and lost a great number of men and
horses on the march towards Leinster, to which he could have come in
two days if he had been rightly directed (_Chartularies of St. Mary's_,
I., p. 408). It is scarcely likely that Edward Bruce was twice tricked
in this way, and the Irishman, Dempsy or another, may have been the
agent of the Lacys. But to be able to follow the whole operation we
should require much more information than is available.

373 _Ullister._ Ulster in the ancient sense of Antrim and Down.

376 _Thomas of Dun._ Skeat compiles an hypothetical biography for
this "scummar of the se," but Thomas was an uncomfortably well-known
personage. He was the most notorious pirate on the west coast, as
John Crab was on the east (see _Bk._ XVII. 239). We learn from Bain's
_Calendar_ that on September 12, 1315, Thomas Dun and others, "with
a great 'navye' of Scots," plundered a ship in Holyhead Harbour (No.
451). He kept on his depredations with a crew of Scots (No. 549;
_Patent Rolls_, i., p. 696). He was captured in July, 1317, and gave
information about an intended attack by the Earl of Moray on the Isle
of Man (No. 562). Thereafter he disappears from notice, probably via
the gallows. He was hovering about between Ulster and Scotland at this
time, and Edward was ordering the Mayor and bailiffs of Drogheda to
chase him (_Hist. and Munic. Docts., Ireland_, p. 377).

380 _Thai knew him weill._ See previous note.

382 According to the _Annals_, Edward Bruce cautiously or cleverly
(_caute_) crossed the Bann in pursuit of the English army, retiring to
Connor (_Annals_, p. 346).

383 _in biggit land._ "Land with houses on it"--_i.e._, cultivated.

389 _With a gret host, Richarde of Clar._ In the _Annals_ it is the
Earl of Ulster (Richard de Burgh), with the Justiciar (Butler) and
other magnates, who had undertaken to bring Edward Bruce to Dublin
alive or dead. So, too, in _Annals of Clonmacnoise_ and of _Loch Ce_ it
is De Burgh, the "Red Earl."

394 _Coigneris._ Connor, to the north of the town of Antrim. "Conyers"
in _Annals_.

405 _Alane Stewart._ Cousin of Walter Stewart, and ancestor of the
Darnley Stewarts, Earls of Lennox. He is mentioned later in the
_Annals_ among the Scottish leaders (p. 359).

406 _Schir Robert Boyde._ Both E and H read _Robert_, probably
correctly, as there is no notice of the _Gilbert_ of C.

447 _On this wis._ This, or one of the later skirmishes, must be that
referred to in the _Annals_ when the Earl and some of his side were put
to flight, and several captured (p. 359).

460 _Thair wayis towart Coigneris._ After Edward Bruce crossed the Bann
the English army withdrew to Connor (_Annals_, p. 359).

515 _Fize Warin._ No doubt the Alan FitzWarin captured later by the
Scots (_Annals_, 349). See on xv. 75.

522 _Nycholl of Kylkenane._ Kilkenane was before the Reformation a
parish in Island Magee, the outer limb of Larne Lough (_Innes_). A
"Michael of Kylkenan" is on record in 1310 (Reeves, _History of Down_,
etc., _ibid._). Hart's edition here gives _Michell_, which is perhaps
the correct reading.


BOOK XV.

8 _In battale._ The date of the English defeat at Connor is on or
shortly after September 10, 1315. The _Annals_ are not clear on the
point, and the capture of William de Burgh on the 10th seems to refer
to one of the earlier skirmishes mentioned in the previous book
(_Annals_, p. 346).

39 _The barell-ferraris._ See _Glossary_. _Cf._ "_Barell-ferrers_ they
brochede, and broghte them the wyne" (_Morte Arthure_, line 2714).

56 _Quha mast_, etc. "Who most would get the upper hand."

63 _That evir durst_, etc. "No one dared to wait for his comrade."

75 _Fizwarine._ The _Annals_ suggest that he was not captured till
early in the following year, and he is not mentioned among the captives
at "Conyers" (pp. 349, 346).

83 _Mont-peleris._ Apparently Montpelier, then famous for its School of
Medicine, an Arab foundation.

98 _Syne thidder._ The account in the _Annals_ states that "Baron de
Donull" made head against the Scots, but that they chased his men
boldly as far as "Cragfergus" (p. 346). The castle had been provisioned
against the Scots (_Bain_, iii., No. 479).

100 _Palmesonday._ April 4, 1316. The garrison was suffering great
privations from lack of food (_Annals, Fragment_, p. 297).

101 _Tysday._ Tuesday in Easter-week, 1316, was April 13.

105 _Paske evin._ Saturday night, April 10.

107 _Devilling._ Dublin. According to the _Annals_, Maundeville came
with men from Drogheda, arriving at Carrickfergus on April 8, and
inflicting a defeat upon the Scots, who lost about thirty men (p. 350).

111 _The Mawndvell, ald Schir Thomas._ So also in _Annals_ (p. 350).

131 _the day._ April 11. The _Annals_ place this (the second) attack on
the Scots upon Easter-eve, April 10 (_in vigilia Pasche._, p. 350).
Similarly _St. Mary's Annals_, p. 282. Nothing is said about a breach
of truce. Barbour, however, gives evidence of having been thoroughly
well informed. See below on 205-9.

137 _the Kyng._ _I.e._, Edward Bruce, apparently not crowned King till
some weeks later, May, 1316, "a little after the feast of Philip and
James" (May 1). The _Annals_ really seem to fix it in 1315 (p. 345),
but they have already stated that Edward did not land till May 26. The
chronology is confused (_cf._ on _Bk._ xiv. 21). See also line 161.

181 _Gib Harpar._ Probably Gilbert the Harper, or minstrel. His fate is
told in _Bk._ XVIII.

183 _of his stat._ These words suggest that he was of some special
class.

192 _reft the liff._ Sir Thomas Maundeville was slain (_Annals_, p.
350; _St. Mary's Annals_, p. 282).

205-9 Skeat evidently thinks that these lines refer to the same
incident as that described above in lines 190-2, and actually prints
in his rubric "as I said" as a summary of Barbour, though Barbour has
nothing to suggest these words. But the person previously slain is
"_the_ Mawndvell"--_i.e._, Sir Thomas himself, whom Barbour has already
so denominated (111). The present victim is a Maundeville whose "propir
nayme" he does not know, but who, we learn from _St Mary's Annals_, was
"John Maundevyll," brother of Sir Thomas (p. 282).

259 _The castell till him yhalde._ Carrickfergus Castle was surrendered
(_Annals, Fragment_, p. 297; _Bain_, iii. 970) apparently in September,
1316 (_Fragment_, _ibid._). Thus, if begun after Connor, the siege must
have occupied the Scots for a year--the greater part of 1316.

260 _Till sauf thame thair liffis._ The defenders were granted life and
limb (_vita et membrum._ _Fragment_, p. 297).

272 _the Tarbard._ Tarbert, Kintyre: Gaelic _Tairbeart_, a portage, an
isthmus.

274 _draw thar schippes._ According to the _Magnus Saga_, chap. xx.,
Magnus, King of Norway, agreed with the King of Scotland, Edgar, in
1102, that he should have "all the islands to the west of Scotland,
between which and the mainland a helm-carrying ship could pass." Magnus
then had "a small ship" drawn across the isthmus at Tarbert, with
himself sitting at the helm, and so secured Kintyre. "There is a narrow
ridge between it (Kintyre) and Scotland, so that ships are often drawn
across it."

292 _Ald prophesy._ This probably derives from the incident told of
above.

299 _Johne of Lorne._ Barbour is quite wrong as to the career and fate
of John of Lorn or Argyll ("de Ergadia," "Daragille," in records). He
had escaped to England in 1309 (see _Bk._ 128), and was Admiral of
Edward's fleet in the west by 1311 (_Bain_, iii., No. 203). In the
summer of 1314 he went to the Irish coast with a fleet (355), and was
in command there in 1315-1316 (No. 479, _Hist. and Municip. Docts.,
Ireland_, p. 344). He returned from the Irish service in 1316 "impotent
in body," and received a pension from Edward II., but died a year and a
half later, probably towards the end of 1317, in London (_Bain_, iii.,
No. 912).

318 _the Forest._ Ettrick Forest.

321 _Eumond de Calion, a Gascoune._ Correctly, as in records, "Remon
Caillau," or "Reymound Cailough" (_Bain_, iii., Nos. 470, 477). He
was perhaps a relative of the Bishop of Durham who died in the same
year, 1316, "Recardus Kellow" (_Lanercost_, p. 233). Other Gascons
are mentioned as having taken part in this sally--Arnant de Poillant,
Pierres de Logar, etc. (_ibid._). The information in _Bain_ is
contained in letters from the Governor of Berwick (see next note), and
petitions to the King from some of the townspeople.

325 _He had than Berwik in keping._ No; Sir Moryz or Maurice de
Berkele(y) was "warden of Berwick-on-Tweed." Caillou was only one of
"the King's sergeant-at-arms" (_Bain_, iii., No. 477)--_i.e._, an
officer of the royal household.

327 _a gret cumpany._ A "great part of the garrison" went out on this
foray. They had been forbidden to go out by the warden, but Berwick
was in desperate straits for want of food, and they replied that "it
was better to die fighting than starve" (_Bain_, 477). The date of the
foray is February 14, 1316.

329 _the nethir end of Tevydaill_, etc. Teviotdale, locally so
pronounced. The forayers went as far as "within two leagues (miles)
of Melros Abbey" (_Bain_, 477). The Merse is South Berwickshire, the
"March," or frontier.

333 _Schir Adam of Gordoun._ See note on _Bk._ XI. 46. He became a
"Scottis man" apparently after Bannockburn. His lands of Gordon were in
East Lothian.

335 _drif away thar fe._ "They took many prisoners and cattle" (_Bain_,
470).

*337-*338. These lines mean that Gordon saw only small bodies
("scaill"; _cf._ line 344*) of the English in retreat, and the "swains"
in possession of the prey--_i.e._, driving the cattle. _Cf._ lines
*353-*354 and 339-341. "Scaill" is a noun here as in *353.

*354 _a childrome._ The scattered bands assembled in one body to
deal with the Scots in pursuit, and sent on the cattle in front. For
"childrome," or "schiltrome," see note on _Bk._ XII. 249.

341 _made a staill._ "Staill" is certainly to be preferred to "scaill,"
which is contrary to the sense of the passage. Skeat, in his note,
admits as much. _Cf._ similar use in _Bk._ XVII. 97. The forayers
"made a stand" to defend the cattle from the Scots. The fight was at
Scaithmoor. (_Scala._, p. 143).

351 _on his luf, etc._ "Let each man think on his love."

375-6 _thai wer, etc._ "Though the English were very many more than the
Scots." Barbour's usual reckless use of "thai."

377 _wes ded._ The writer in _Bain_ did not know whether Caillou was
dead or only a prisoner (No. 470).

381 _sum has slayne._ The foragers lost 20 men-at-arms and 60 foot,
killed or prisoners (_Bain_, No. 470). "The Gascons were slain to a
man" (_furount mors toutes playnes de Gascoins._ _Scala._, p. 143). The
Scots, of course, recovered the castle, and the Berwick garrison were
soon dying of hunger on the walls (_ibid._, No. 477).

392 _hap him fell._ "If it so happened."

393 _That._ _I.e._, the killing of the "cheftune," or leader of his
opponents.

405 _full gret invy._ Neville appears to have had a weakness in this
way. He had already slain a cousin of Robert Bruce in a quarrel as to
which was the greater lord (_Scala._, p. 143). He was known as "the
Peacock of the North," which significantly describes him (_Bain_, iii.,
p. xxv).

435 _Befor Berwyk._ The fight between Douglas and Neville took place at
Berwick (_Scala._, p. 143; _Gesta Edw. de Carn._, p. 56). The _Gesta_
dates it June, 1319; Barbour seems to place it in 1316, but says
nothing definite; nor does Gray, "another time" (_Scala._, p. 143),
introducing it, like Barbour, after the Skaithmoor fight, but unlike
Barbour, also after Lintalee.

477 _no mycht till us._ "Douglas with his yeomanry shall have no power
compared with ours."

503 _Schir Ralf the Nevell, etc._ There is on record a petition by
"Rauf de Neville" to the King asking for assistance in ransoming
himself, and explaining that he, with two of his brothers, was taken
prisoner on the day on which his brother Sir Robert was killed by the
Scots (_Bain_, iii., No. 527).

504 _the Baroun of Hiltoun._ Apparently Sir Robert de Hilton, who is
a witness in 1310 to a grant by the Bishop of Durham of a manor in
Scotland (_Bain_, iii., No. 1147). Hilton is near Berwick.

505 _othir of mekill mycht._ "Many of his (Neville's) company were
captured, and the rest put to flight" (_Gesta_, p. 56). _Cf._ line 510.


BOOK XVI.

8 _in Scotland for till pas._ Barbour, as he himself explains, now goes
back to the beginning of the siege of Carrickfergus after the victory
at Connor. According to the _Annals of Ir._, Moray crossed to Scotland
on September 15, 1315, to procure more soldiers, "at which time the
said Bruce was besieging the Castle of Carrickfergus" (p. 346). Moray
was back in November with five hundred men (p. 347). Barbour mentions
but one trip on which he returned with King Robert (line 43), but that
would have to be a year later. Further, he dates this journey _after_
the fall of Carrickfergus (see on 38).

16 _till his schippes._ He had four pirate vessels laden with Irish
plunder, of which one was sunk (_Annals of Ir._, p. 346). The Scots had
sent back their own ships (_Bk._ xiv. 35).

38 _Till Cragfergus._ According to Barbour's chronology, Robert Bruce
crossed to Ireland at some time after the fall of Carrickfergus, as
related in the previous book. But the news of King Robert's arrival
appears to have reached Dublin about the first week in September, 1316.
Carrickfergus fell some time later in the same month (_Frag._, p.
297). The _Annals of Ulster_ date the arrival about the end of 1316 or
beginning of 1317 (II., p. 429, and note). The _Annals of Clonmacnoise_
(p. 279) and the _Annals of the Four Masters_ (III., p. 515) place it
in 1317, by which time Carrickfergus, of course, was in possession of
the Scots.

62 _Inderwillane._ "Dr. Reeves believes this to be an old garbled name
for that pass, known later as _Bealach an Maghre_, or Moyry Pass. It
was on the old road; indeed, the only possible one, from Leinster to
Ulster. It is in the parish of Killevy, county of Armagh, but only a
few perches from the boundary of Lowth" (_Innes_).

63 _the moneth of May._ Must have been much earlier (see on 262).

74 _The wardane thair._ See on _Bk._ XIV. 638.

119 _Schyr Colyne Cammell._ Sir Colin Campbell, Bruce's nephew, as son
of his sister Marie by her marriage with Sir Neil Campbell (Robertson's
_Index_, p. 26; 11, 18). Bain strangely says that of Sir Neil's two
wives on record neither was a Bruce (_Calend._, ii., lix). Marie's
marriages are somewhat ravelled (see on _Bk._ viii. 397), but this one
is certain. Colin got the grant of Lochaw (Robertson, _ibid._). There
was another nephew of the same marriage, John (_Index_, p. 19; 105),
who also went on this occasion to Ireland (_Annals_, p. 344).

131 _That he dynnit on his arsoune._ "Knocked heavily against his
saddle." _Cf._ _Alexander_, where Gaudifer is struck with spears.
"Quhill on his arsoune dintit he" (p. 99).

132 _tyt hym doune._ "The King bade (the others) remove him quickly
from his horse," apparently because his horse was killed (line 126)
and he stunned; or, as Skeat suggests, that he should fight on foot,
instead, I suppose, of being rash on horseback.

141 _That we sall have, etc._ "That we shall have plenty to do
presently."

150 _In four battellis, fourty thousand._ _Cf._ on _Bk._ XIV. 270. The
numbers, of course, are improbable; but see next note.

179 _So hard ane fichting._ This battle I cannot trace in the _Annals_,
but Butler, the Justiciary, is said to have assembled an army of
30,000 against the Bruces, which did nothing; not, however, till April
(_Fragment_, p. 301).

182 _thre yheir._ Spring, 1315, to October, 1318.

185 _trappit horse._ See note on _Bk._ XI. 130.

187 _quhen lest wes he._ "He was always at the very least one to five."

262 _forrouth Devillyn._ The Scots and the Ulster men were at Swords,
eight miles north of Dublin (_Hist. and Municip. Docts._, p. 451); at
Castleknock in the immediate neighbourhood on the west (_St. Mary's
Annals_, p. 282; _Fragment_, 299), on the eve of St. Matthew's Day,
February 23, 1317 (_Fragment_). They moved to a position in the
vicinity, where they stayed for four days, burned a part of the town,
and spoiled the churches (_ibid._).

265 _Lunyk._ Correctly Limerick, which is not, however, the "southmast
toune" in Ireland. The Scots came to Limerick, but were defeated at
Castle Connell (_Annals_, p. 353).

293 _Northwarde agane._ On May 1, 1317, Bruce took the road to Ulster
(_Fragment_, p. 302).

295 _Conage._ Connaught; _Myth_, Meath; _Irell_, _i.e._, Uriel or Oriel
= Louth, Armagh and Monaghan; _Munser_, Munster; _Lainenser_, Leinster.
Limerick is, of course, in Munster, which should come first.

301 _The kyngis._ See note on _Bk._ XIV. 102.

336 _hawch of Lyntoun-le._ A "haugh" is low-lying level ground,
generally beside water, river, or sea. "Lentalee, in the forest of
Jedworth" (Jedburgh), as Gray has it, is about two miles south of that
town. Gray groups this incident, as Barbour does, with the Scaithmoor
and Berwick fights, but in a different position (see note on _Bk._ XV.
435; and _Scala._, p. 143). "Lentelee" in Stevenson (_Illustrations_,
p. 3). "Near Jeddeworth" is the location of the "foray" in _Bain_
(iii., No. 576).

337 _a fayr maner._ The anonymous chronicler in Stevenson says
that Douglas was passing the time (_moram traxit_) in a sort of
fortification (_municioni quadam_) with 200 men (_Illustrations_, p. 3).

339 _gert purvay him richt weill._ The English found "much victuals" in
the place (_Stevenson_, p. 3).

342 _wonnand then._ The date of the fight is about April 23, 1317
(_Stevenson_, p. 3).

343 _Schir Thomas._ Sir Thomas Richmond was not an earl, but a
Yorkshire knight, owner of Burton-Constable, and a well-known figure
on the Border (_Bain_, iii., p. xxv, No. 178). The "Earl" in command
was the Earl of Arundel, appointed guardian of the district between
the Trent and Roxburgh on February 2, 1317 (_Rotuli Scotiae_, i. 169;
_Illustrations_, p. 3). "Sir Edmund, Earl of Arundel, warden of the
March" (_Bain_, iii., No. 576).

352 _War passit than of the cuntre._ That is, King Robert and many
with him were in Ireland. So, too, in _Stevenson_: "The leaders of the
Scots being then engaged in war in Ireland, and Scotland being almost
destitute of men" (_Illustrations_, p. 3).

354-55 _the cuntre was Febill of men._ _Cf._ previous note.

357 _of the marchis._ But _cf._ note on 343.

360 _ten thousand men._ In Stevenson's chronicler "thirty thousand men"
(_Illust._, p. 3). Officially it was called "a foray" (_Bain_, iii.,
No. 576). The English exaggeration is worse than Barbour's.

363 _Till hewe doune Jedward forest._ Since the time of the Romans
and the disastrous march of Septimius Severus (third century) the
forests of Scotland had been recognized as the natural defences of the
country. They are, for the most part, the "strengths" which figure so
prominently in Barbour. See on Jedward, _Bk._ VIII. 427.

375 _And of archeris a gret menyhe._ _Cf._ note on 377.

380 _The entre._ As in the wood of the King's Park (_Bk._ XI. 446).

383 _a penny-stane cast._ A "penny-stane" was a flat stone used as a
quoit, hence "as wide only as the throw of a quoit."

384 _Douglas thiddir yheid._ "Douglas abandoned his position and
retired" (_Illustrations_, p. 3).

406 _on thame schot thai._ In _Stevenson_ this, the main attack,
follows the surprise at Lintalee (p. 4).

418 _reft the liff._ Richmond was slain (_Scala._, p. 143; _Stevenson_,
p. 4).

419 _Ane hat._ Hailes notes that "In _Histoire de Bretagne par
Lobineau_, t. i., p. 665, there is a portrait of Arthur de Richemont,
Duke of Brittany, with a _furred hat_, such as is described by Barbour"
(_Annals_, ii., p. 82 note). Richmond was identified by the hat on the
word of a prisoner. See lines 480-5.

441 _ane clerk, Elys._ "A clerk called Helias" (_Stevenson_, p. 3).
Stevenson says he was a "noble 'schavaldur.'" See on this _Bk._ V. 205
(note).

442 _thre hundreth enymys._ "With thirty comrades" (_Stevenson_, p. 3).

444 _herbery had tane._ Ellis and his companions occupied Douglas's
house, and took their fill (_se saciavit_) of the victuals there
(_Stevenson_, _ibid._).

450-1 _with suerdis.... Thai servit thame._ They despatched them with
the sword (_reliquos gladio jugulavit._ _Stevenson_, p. 4). The head of
Ellis was cut off, and placed in a humiliating position beside the body
(_ibid._).

458 "That addition to the repast was overmuch."

472 _Till wend hamward._ "The said Earl (Arundel) retreated southwards
without doing more" (_Scala._, p. 143).

504 _forrouth._ Before, in _Bk._ IX. 570-630.

509 _Schir Johne de Sowlis._ _Cf._ _Bk._ XIV. 25, and note.

512-4 _With fifty men_, etc. _I.e._, Soulis had the fifty, Harcla the
three hundred.

518 _Schir Androu ... has tane._ Harcla was a prisoner with the Scots
at some date in November, 1316, when he asks the King of England for
help towards his ransom (_Bain_, iii. 514, 515, 697). He was ransomed
with difficulty (_Scala._, p. 149). He was executed in 1323 for
treasonable dealings with the Scots.

549 _besyde Enverkethyne._ Inverkeithing, Fife. Near Donibristle, says
Fordun's continuator, showing that here he follows another source than
Barbour (_Scotic._, _Bk._ xii., chap. xxv.).

552 _The Erll of Fiff._ Duncan de Fife, the young Earl, with his mother
and step-father joined the Scots some little time before August 2,
1317, when his mother had her English manor forfeited (_Bain_, iii.,
No. 566). He came with a troop of five hundred armed men (_Scotic._, as
cited).

575 _Willyhame Syncler._ William St. Clair was the brother of Sir Henry
St. Clair of Roslin. He had been a canon of Dunkeld, and was elected
Bishop in 1312 (Dowden in _Scot. Hist. Rev._, vol. i., pp. 316-17). On
his return from Rome Edward II. tried to keep him in England (_Bain_,
iii. 301). In the _Wallace_ he figures as a Bishop already, and a
friend of the patriot (vii. 932; viii. 1225). He was among the four
bishops specially summoned to Rome to answer for their support of Bruce
in defiance of the Church.

592-3 _aucht weill to ma Of yhow._ "Should think highly of you!"

596 _The gilt spurs._ The sign of knighthood; to hew them off was a
ceremony of degradation (_cf._ line 598). So, too, in _Scotic._, as
cited.

635 _that yheit held unslayn._ "That had held or kept themselves from
being slain."

676 _the Scottis Se._ The Firth of Forth. See on IX. 309.


BOOK XVII.

13 _Redis Swyr._ The pass over Cheviot to the valley of the Rede, a
tributary of the Tyne. By it went the road from Jedburgh, and in it is
the site of the Battle of Otterburn, 1388. _Swyr_ is A.S. _swira_ or
_swera_, the neck.

15 _Outakin Berwik, it allane._ "One town in Scotland was left to the
King" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 234). On September 20, 1317, and January
30, 1318, certain burgesses were going to England and France to
purchase provisions "for the munition of the town" (_Bain_, iii., Nos.
575, 588). To save expense (_Scala._), the defence of the town itself
had been entrusted to the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses (_ibid._, No.
593; _Vita Edw._, p. 234; _Scala._, p. 148). According to Stevenson's
Chronicler, the citizens had begged to be entrusted with the defence
because of their ill-treatment by the royal garrison, August 1, 1317
(p. 5).

17 _That capitane was._ Roger de Horslee, Keeper of the Castle (_Bain_,
iii., No. 607). He had been appointed, August 19, 1317, to command the
castle when the city was committed to the burgesses (_Stevenson_, p. 5;
_Rot. Scot._, i., p. 175). _Cf._ on 224.

19 _tretit thame richt ill._ On February 4, 1318, Edward appointed a
commission of three to "inquire into the disputes arisen, or likely to
arise, between the burgesses and the garrison of Berwick, to the danger
of the town" (_Bain_, iii., No. 589). _Cf._ note on 15.

23 _a burges, Sim of Spaldyng._ "Peter de Spalding" in _Scala._, p.
144; _Lanerc._, p. 234; _Illustr._, p. 5; _Trokelowe_, p. 103, etc.
The _Annales Paulini_ adds John Drory and other accomplices (p. 282).
"Peter de Spalding" is on the roll of the garrison of Berwick in 1312
(_Bain_, iii., p. 399). He was an Englishman living in the town, and
received a large sum of money in addition to the promise of lands
(_Lanercost_, pp. 234-235). "A royal sergeant retained by the citizens
in the defence of the town." Douglas, it was said, "corrupted" him with
promises of L800 (_Stevenson_, p. 5). Spalding's request for his money
was "obnoxious" to the Scots, and he was put to death on a trumped-up
charge of treason (_ibid._).

28 _the marschall._ Sir Robert Keith.

35 _the Kow-yhet._ Still the Cow-port (gate) in the middle of the north
side of the town.

45 _Ane or othir suld wrethit be._ _I.e._, "if he chose anyone to help
him, somebody else was sure to be offended." Apparently he would have
to choose between Moray and Douglas. _Cf._ lines 55-7.

64 _Duns park._ A favourite rendezvous in that neighbourhood for the
Scots army. The "park" would be wooded. In June, 1315, Bruce was
reported to be collecting an army in "the Park of Duns," either to
invade England or to besiege Berwick (_Bain_, iii., No. 440).

67 _Athir with ane quheyne of men._ Bruce gets out of the dilemma by
choosing both leaders, each to bring a small party of his men.

72 _the day._ April 2, 1318 (_Lanerc._, p. 234; _Ann. Paul._, p. 282).
_Circa_ March 25 (_Illustrations_, p. 5). Edward is preparing to retake
Berwick on April 18, 1318 (_Rot. Scot._, i., p. 181).

94 _the nycht._ The Scots entered "about midnight after the Sabbath
day" (_Lanerc._, p. 234). Edward, "much enraged," reports that the
mayor and bailiffs "allowed the Scottish rebels to enter and take
possession," "through carelessness," and orders goods belonging to the
community of Berwick to be everywhere arrested; April 13, 15 (_Bain_,
iii., Nos. 593, 594).

97 _hald a staill._ "Occupy a position." _Cf._ _Bk._ XV. 341.

105 _till the gude._ "For the goods." Singular form as plural; see
Grammar. _Cf._ also _twa part_ in 103 for two parts.

125 _gat the castell._ "Got to the castle."

128 _in the bargane slane._ Few were slain apart from those who
resisted (_Lanerc._, p. 235; _Stevenson_, p. 5). According to Baker, in
the capture of the town and castle no one was slain who was willing to
submit (_qui voluit obedire_, p. 59).

134 _the baner._ Apparently the Scots had assembled ("stuffit") round
their banner in the "staill" (97).

150-1 _Wilyhame ... of Keth, and of the Gawlistoune._ Sir William Keith
of Galston, known by either surname, of Keith or of Galston (152).
Galston was in Kyle, Ayrshire, and there were Keiths in it at least a
hundred years after (_Reg. Mag. Sig._, p. 228; 17).

176 _all that fell_, etc. "All that would serve to provision the town."
_Cf._ on 15.

185 _the Mers and Tevidaill._ The part of Berwickshire next the Border,
"the March," and Teviotdale.

198 _on the sext day._ Gray says the castle held out for eleven weeks,
and as his father was then in garrison at Norham, he is probably about
right. The castle surrendered for lack of food (_Scala._, p. 144).
The account in Stevenson's _Chronicle_ also implies a siege longer
than five days; for he speaks of King Robert assailing the castle with
siege-engines, and failing, and of the Scots then settling down to
starve out the garrison (_Illust._, p. 5). Horslee was at Newcastle
with the garrison on July 20--that is, about sixteen weeks after the
fall of the town--so that the surrender of the castle must have taken
place somewhat earlier in the month. Horslee and his garrison had to
be supported by the town, and the account therefore would begin with
their arrival (_Bain_, iii., No. 607). _Cf._ on line 226.

200 _till thair cuntre syne went thai._ Life and goods were granted
them on surrender (_Stevenson_, p. 5). _Cf._ previous note.

203 _soyn eftir._ But, according to the account in _Stevenson_, King
Robert assisted at the attack on the castle. See on 198.

222 _At = that._ "That he took in hand to hold Berwick."

224 _Bath the castell, and the dungeoune._ In his former references
Barbour has used the term "castle" to include both the tower or
"donjon" or keep and the surrounding wall, apart from the wall of the
town proper. The wall (or "wallis"), he says in 169, 170, was not then
in a very defensible state. Here he goes back to an older and more
technical usage before these two independent elements--donjon and
enclosure fortified with a wall--had quite coalesced. The evidence
for this differentiation is given at length by Mr. Round in his
_Geoffrey de Mandeville_, Appendix O. One of the citations is precisely
parallel to Barbour's expressions here, the description of a grant of
Dublin--town, castle, and donjon--in 1172 to Hugh de Lacy:

  "Li riche rei ad dunc baille (has then entrusted)
  Dyvelin en garde, _la cite
  E la chastel e le dongun_,
  A Huge de Laci le barun."

These, then, are the three elements here: the town, which had its own
wall; the "castle," strictly speaking, or walled enclosure; and the
"donjon" within the latter.

226 _Ryde in-till Inglande._ The _Lanercost_ writer places this raid
in the month of May, and, it would seem, after the fall of the castle
(see on line 198). The Scots on this occasion penetrated England
farther than usual, reaching Ripon, Knaresborough, and Skipton, in
Craven--_i.e._, covering a large part of Yorkshire (p. 235). The _Gesta
de Carn._ also dates this raid in May, "soon after Easter," and says
the Scots went as far as Bolton Abbey (p. 55).

227 _gret plente of fee._ They brought back "a crowd of cattle
past numbering" (_Lanerc._, p. 236). They searched the woods of
Knaresborough for the cattle hidden there, and got possession of them
(p. 235).

228-9 _sum cuntreis trewit he For vittale._ _I.e._, "he made a truce
with some districts in return for a supply of victual." The Scots
spoiled Ripon, but refrained from burning the town on payment of 1,000
marks (_Lanerc._, p. 235).

236 _But burges and but oblesteris._ Skeat takes exception to
"burgesses," but the town had previously been defended by the burgesses
(_cf._ on 15), and some, no doubt, were willing "to obey" the Scots
(_cf._ on 128). E reads _burdowys_, which Jamieson supposed to mean
"men who fought with clubs," while Skeat suggests that it is "_burdouis
for burdonis_--_i.e._, mules!" Mules are a less probable part of
the garrison than burgesses. "Oblesteris" are _arblasters_--_i.e._,
crossbow-men, a minor but constant part of both English and Scottish
armies of the time.

239 _Johne Crab._ A famous sea-rover of the east coast, as on the west
was Thomas Dun (_Bk._ XIV. 376, note). In 1319 Edward was complaining
to the Count of Flanders of his "outrages," and the Count answered
(November 19) that "Crabbe" had been banished for murder, and that
"he will punish him on the wheel if he catches him" (_Bain_, iii.,
No. 673). He was captured in 1332 near Roxburgh, and because the
"ungrateful Scots" refused to ransom him he transferred his services to
the English (_Lanerc._, p. 270), and for his assistance at the Siege
of Berwick in 1333 was pardoned "all his homicides, felonies, etc., by
sea or land" (_Bain_, iii., 1090). He therefore cannot be the "Cryn, a
Fleming, an admiral of the sea, a robber," killed by Sir Thomas Gray
in 1321-2, as is supposed by Sir Herbert Maxwell (_Robert the Bruce_,
p. 267, note; _The Scalacronica_, trans., p. 63, note). Crab is on
record till 1347 (_Bain_, No. 1504). But "Cryn" may be his nephew "John
Crabbekyn" (_Bain_, iii., No. 417). The Scots slew his son (_Lanerc._,
p. 270). A John Crab gets lands from Bruce in Aberdeen, which, with
those in Berwick, are transferred to another in the reign of David II.
(Robertson's _Index_, 15, 21, etc. ... 32, 9), apparently on his going
over to England. He is not, therefore, likely to be the John Crab, a
burgess of Aberdeen in later times, and a member of Parliament (1365,
1367), as the editor of the _Exchequer Rolls_, II., postulates (p.
lxxxii., note: Index).

245 _engynis and trammys._ "Siege-engines and structures of wood."

246 _grec fyre._ In all probability "Greek fire," as Skeat suggests;
"t"and "c" are almost indistinguishable in the MSS. of the time. "Greek
fire" was the mother of gunpowder; it was a liquid made of sulphur and
saltpetre, with the addition of inflammable oils, and its purpose was
to set woodwork on fire (_cf._ Oman's _Art of War_, pp. 546, 547). It
was used at the Siege of Stirling in 1304 (_Bain_).

247 _Spryngaldis and schotis._ The _springal_ (_espringale_) was a
great crossbow on a frame, whose cord was drawn back by a winch; the
"shots" were its bolts, or "long darts": _springaldis, ad longa spicula
emittenda_ (_Lanercost_, p. 231) at the siege of Carlisle in 1315.

250 _gynis for crakkis._ Contrivances for making explosions--_i.e._,
guns, which at first seem to have been valued for this quality.

271 _ger dik thame._ _I.e._, the English were to surround their own
encampment at Berwick with a rampart for further security, and to keep
off the Scots who might come to its relief.

278 _thoucht all suth._ "Thought quite rightly."

285 _Of Lancister the Erll Thomas._ Bain says that, though Lancaster
was clearly summoned (_Foedera_, iii., p. 784), "Walsingham, who was
not contemporary, seems the only authority for his presence, and
if his men had been there they would have been found on the roll,"
where they are not given (iii., p. xxvi). But a letter from Hugh le
Despenser, the younger, printed by Stevenson in his notes to the
_Chronicle of Lanercost_, expressly names the Earl of Lancaster as
having been present (p. 422). Despenser also was at Berwick, and his
letter (Anglo-French) is dated September 21 at Newcastle. Strangest
fact, Bain, who knew the _Chron. de Lanerc._, overlooked the mention of
Lancaster having accompanied the King to Berwick on p. 239. In _Vita
Edw. Sec._, too, Lancaster is among those at Berwick (pp. 241, 244).
Also in _Annal. Paul._, p. 286; _Illustrations_, p. 56. _Cf._ notes
below. Maxwell, too, cites Barbour only for Lancaster's presence (p.
265, note).

286 _That syne wes sanctit._ See note on 874.

295 _all this menyhe._ According to the pay-sheet, August 1 to
September 24, 8,080 men, apart, however, from the following of
Lancaster (_cf._ on 285 and 852) and the sailors (_Bain_, iii., No.
668). In _Annal. Paul._ 30,000 horse! (p. 286).

298 _Ordanit ane felde._ The "Magdalen Fields" surrounding the town.
"The army was spread ont, on the land side, round the circuit of the
town" (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 242).

306 _all the havyn wes stoppit._ "On the side of the sea the sailors
present from the Cinque Ports (_Quinque Portubus_) so watched the
entries and exits that no one could possibly get out" (_Vita Edw._, p.
242).

318-9 _sib him ner, Or ... his allye._ "Either near relatives or those
closely attached to him by some personal tie." "Allye," Fr. _allie_,
is a trisyllable. It does not seem to signify, as Skeat suggests,
allied "by various marriages," but only the latter part of the phrase,
"relatives and personal friends."

335 _our Ladeis evin._ September 7, 1319. So Despenser, in his letter,
says Edward came before Berwick on September 7, and "laid siege to the
town, with all his host, by sea and by land" (_par myer et par terre._
_Lanerc._, p. 422). The English army entered Scotland on August 29
(_Ann. Paul._, p. 286).

343 _coveryngis._ Special protective dresses, such as the miner's
"basket" of wicker for those breaching the wall.

344 _howis ... staff slyngis._ The first were possibly picks on
long poles, so resembling hoes, used for pulling down defences. The
staff-sling consisted of a wooden shaft about a yard long, to one end
of which was attached a sling. The slinger held it by the other end
with both hands, and so could discharge a stone or bullet with great
force.

359 _ilk kyrneill._ Each casement or open interval of the battlement.
In the repairs of the castle in 1344 the portion of the wall renewed
was to be 8 feet broad at "the kernels" (_Bain_, iii., No. 1434).

380 _Sa law._ Edward I. had begun to surround Berwick with a stone
wall, but Hugh de Cressingham, his Treasurer (1297), had not spent on
it the money given for its completion (_Hemingburgh_, ii., p. 127).

409 _the brighous._ A barbican or outwork on which the drawbridge
rested. In January, 1316, Bruce tried to enter Berwick _inter brighous
et castrum_ (_Lanercost_, p. 232).

421 _scho ebbit._ _I.e._, the tide ebbed, and she grounded. A ship
grounding in a very low tide (neap) is still said to be "neaped."

501 _he wald nocht sa soyne assale._ The English chroniclers say he
would not venture to fight with the army of their King (_Lanerc._, p.
239; _Illust._, p. 6). On September 9 Edward writes to the Chancellor
that "he hears that Robert de Brus and his allies and supporters
(_fautours_) are bound by oaths and hostages to relieve the garrison of
Berwick on a fixed day, and will do everything they can" (_Bain_, iii.,
No. 664). He therefore summons to Berwick the whole array of York, but
Bruce took his own way of relieving.

505 _lordis twa._ As here, Moray and Douglas (_Lanerc._, p. 239; _Gesta
de Carn._, p. 57).

508 _xv. thousand._ "A very great army" (_Illustr._, p. 6); "no
small army" (_Gesta de Carn._, p. 57); "xx. thousand of the Scottis"
(_Capgrave_, p. 184).

515 _thair wiffis._ In their previous raid (see on 226) the Scots took
captive both men and women (_Lanerc._, p. 236).

528 _it wes pite._ "The Scots were raiding savagely in England"
(_Scotis in Anglia saeventibus._--_Trokelowe_, p. 103). "Clearing
(_depopulantes_) Northumbria, the bishopric of Durham and Alvertonshire
(York), they came as far as Burghbrig" (_Illust._, p. 66). "They burnt
the country and took captives and booty of animals, advancing as far as
Burghbrigge" (_Lanercost_, p. 239). "Burning and spoiling the country
on all sides" (_Gesta de Carn._, p. 57).

535 _Burrow-brig._ Boroughbridge, on the Ure, near its junction with
the Swale, Yorkshire; see previous note. According to Fordun, Moray
was at "Boru-brig" at the end of the month of August (_Gesta Annalia_,
cxxxiv.).

536 _Mytoun thar-by._ Myton is on the Swale, near its junction with the
Ure, and so a little east of Boroughbridge.

541 _Prestis, clerkis, monkis, and freris, etc._ There were two abbots,
monks, friars, many priests, with countrymen and townsfolk (_Illustr._,
p. 7; _Lanerc._, p. 239; _Scala._, p. 148).

544 _Weill twenty thousand._ Ten thousand in _Trokelowe_, p. 103; both
numbers excessive.

546 _The Archbischop of York._ William de Melton (_Gesta de Carn._,
p. 57; and _Lanercost_, _Illustr._, etc., as cited). He lost much
furniture in the battle, including silver and brass plate (_North.
Reg._, p. 295).

552 _other byschoppis._ Only the Bishop of Ely, then staying at York
(_Illust._, p. 7; _Lanerc._, p. 239).

559 _in-till battellis twa._ "The Scots gathered together, as their
wont was, in a single schiltron" (_Lanerc._, p. 239). They "divided" to
take up the chase (_ibid._).

573-4 _sic abasing Tuk thame._ The English accounts give it that
their men had no proper leader nor skill in war, while the Scots were
excellently equipped in both respects. The strangely assorted array
advanced in no proper order of battle, so that the Scots said: "These
are not soldiers, they are sportsmen; they won't be much good" ("_Hi
non bellatores sed venatores; non multum proficient._"--_Vita Edw._,
p. 244). The Scots then gave a great shout, and the English in terror
turned and fled (_Lanerc._, p. 239).

583 _weill ane thousand._ All accounts agree that there was a
considerable slaughter of the priestly and inexpert warriors, but the
English estimates of the slain are much higher than Barbour's: more
than a thousand, besides the drowned (_Ann. Paul._, p. 287); "2,000
slain with the sword" (_Illustr._, p. 7); 3,000 (_Trokelowe_, p. 103);
4,000 (_Lanerc._, p. 239); besides those drowned in the Swale, about
a thousand, says the _Lanercost_ writer (_ibid._); "more than the
sword slew" (_Gesta de Carn._, p. 58). There were also many captives,
afterwards redeemed; _cf._ line 579 (_ibid._, _Vita Edw._, p. 244). A
chantry chapel was afterwards erected for the souls of the slain, and
endowed by their friends; to this end a piece of ground was asked from
the King in October, 1325 (_Bain_, iii., No. 875).

597 _Of gret gestis ane Sow._ Probably, as Skeat hints, for
"gestis"--_i.e._, joists, great beams, which is more likely than Fr.
_gestes_, "deeds" to which it is hard to give, in this connection,
a suitable meaning. The famous "Sow" is referred to in _Lanercost_
(_suem_), p. 239. See below. It was otherwise known as the _cat_,
and was constructed of stout beams, being strictly a penthouse or
shelter for the men mining the wall. So here in line 600, and in the
_Lanercost_ account (_ad murum suffodiendum_, p. 239). But in the
present case it is combined with the _beffroi_, or movable tower (lines
601-2), giving the "sow-castle" or "cat-castle" (_cf._ Oman's _Art of
War_, pp. 548, 549). Hailes and Skeat miss this point.

598 _stalward heling._ A strong covering of hides, or, possibly, of
iron plates.

634 _the Rude-evyn._ The eve of the Exaltation of the Rood, September
13.

674 _draw the cleket._ Probably then "she" was a _mangonel_, in which
a movable beam, between uprights, was pressed back by ropes, and then
suddenly let go from a catch ("cleket"), discharges a stone; or a
_trebuchet_, in which the same result was obtained by poising the beam
in the middle, and loading the other end with a heavy weight, which
added to the force of the missile.

689 _set thar-to juntly._ "Set close up to." _Cf._ line 704. In the
_Wallace_, Stirling Bridge "off gud playne burd was weill and _juntly_
maid" (vii. 1148).

690 _bend in hy._ _Cf._ on 674.

691 _wappyt._ The correct Scots form. C has _swappit_. _Cf._ _Gest.
Historiale_, "_wappid_ (knocked) to ground" (7297), and "A _wap_ wi a
corner-stane o' Wolf's Crag wad defy the doctor" (Scott's _Bride of
Lammermoor_, Border edit., P. 349).

713 _top-castellis._ "Fighting-tops" on the mast, in addition to the
structures rising fore and aft above the deck, "fore-castle" and
"stern-castle."

756 _The barras._ The "barriers," a fortified post at the outer end of
the drawbridge. See _Glossary_.

757 _and brynt it doune._ Skeat, in his rubric, explains that they
"burnt the drawbridge"--a foolish thing to do if they wanted to cross
the ditch! But what seems to have happened was this: the besiegers
first seized the "barras," then brought "doune" the bridge by burning
the tackle, probably of ropes and beams, by which it was drawn up
against the gate, and so were able to cross, and make their attempt to
burn their way through the gate itself. So, too, they could retreat
(790) over the fallen bridge. _Cf._ in _Morte Arthure_:

  "Brittenes (destroys) theire barrers with theire bryghte wapyns,
  Bett down a barbycan, and the brygge wynnys."

  (2469-2470).

828 _on the morne._ _I.e._, of September 14, seven days after the
first attack. Despenser says that the news from England came "before
he had been at Berwick (_demorce_) eight days" (as cited), practically
corroborating Barbour.

829 _Thar come tithandis._ So in Despenser's letter; in _Lanercost_ (p.
239); _Gesta de Carn._ (p. 58).

842 _His consell fast discordit then._ The _Lanercost_ writer says the
King wished to send a part of his army into England to deal with the
Scots, and keep on the siege with the remainder; but the nobles were
unwilling to divide their army and not fight with the returning Scots,
and so the whole army started south for this purpose (p. 239).

852 _Loncastell._ Despenser attributes the raising of the siege to the
"procurement" of Lancaster (_Lanerc._, p. 422). Stevenson's chronicler
says the siege would have been successful "had not disturbers of
the peace sown discord between the King and the Earl of Lancaster"
(_Illust._, p. 6). As is here suggested, the friction had been going
on for some time according to the author of the _Gesta_, who explains
in detail how the mischief-making was done (p. 57). In the _Vita Edw.
Sec._ various accounts are collected regarding Lancaster's action,
including the "vulgar" story that he had been bribed by Bruce, and
there is a discourse of several pages on treason and avarice (p. 244
_et seq._).

855 _he._ Here is the King; in 858 _he_ is Lancaster. The King was
inclined to side with the Southerners, whose homes, of course, were in
no danger from the Scots. _Cf._ previous note.

862 _his way he tais._ According to the _Vita Edw._, the King went one
way to meet the retreating Scots, Lancaster another (as cited).

864 _fell eftir sic debat._ In 1321 Lancaster and his supporters took
up arms against the King and his advisers, the Despensers, on account
of misgovernment. Each party blamed the other for the misfortunes of
the Scottish war. In March of the following year the Lancastrians were
defeated at Boroughbridge by Sir Andrew de Harclay, himself afterwards
executed for alleged treasonable dealings with the Scots. Lancaster was
captured, and beheaded at Pomfret (_cf._ line 868).

869 _on the hill besyde the toune._ "On a certain little hill"
(_monticulo_) beside Pomfret (_Lanerc._, p. 244).

871 _syne drawin and hangit._ Though this was in the sentence, it
was, by special favour of the King, not carried out. Lancaster, being
a relative, was simply beheaded. In any case the drawing and hanging
would have come before the beheading. See on IV. 322.

872 _a fair menyhe._ Many others suffered capital punishment for their
share in this rising. The _Lanercost_ writer gives one baron and three
knights as having been drawn and hanged in Pomfret at this time, with
further details of other victims (p. 245). _Cf._ also _Baker_, pp. 65,
66. The names of five hanged on the same day at Pomfret are given in
_Annal. Paul._, p. 303.

874 _martir was, Wes sanctit and myraclis did._ Lancaster was popularly
regarded as a saint, a martyr for righteous government; he having been
also a liberal man to the Church and the poor. There were, of course,
doubters of his sanctity (_Vita Edw. Sec._: contin., p. 290). A chapel
was erected on the hill on which he was beheaded; crowds of pilgrims
flocked to it, and miracles were said to be worked by God through him
(_Lanerc._, pp. 244-5; _Foedera_, iv., p. 421). There was a special
service for him--an "Office of St. Thomas of Lancaster," printed in
Wright's _Political Songs_ (pp. 268-272). Edward III., whose accession
was the triumph of the opposition to his father, requested the Pope to
give Thomas regular canonization (_Foedera_, iv., p. 421). Capgrave says
he was canonized in 1389, when all concerned in his execution were dead
(p. 253).

889 _thai tuk westward the way._ The Scots in England retired about
September 14, going westwards (_versus occidentem tendentes_) by
Airedale and Wharfdale, and so home by "Gratsehals" (_Gesta Edw.
Carn._, p. 58). When they heard the siege was raised they returned
to Scotland by Staynmore and Gillesland and "those western parts"
(_Lanerc._ p. 240). _Cf._ also _Illustrations_, p. 7.

891 _With prayis, and with presoneris._ "With prisoners and plunder of
cattle" (_Lanerc._, p. 240). Also _Gesta Edw._, p. 58; _Vita Edw._, p.
244. _Prayis_ is a plural signifying different kinds of "prey."

922-3 _brynt had The brig._ _Cf._ on 757.

940 _Berwyk his toune._ As the reading from E shows, this is a
possessive of a type usually confined to proper names. _Cf._ III. 232;
VI. 435, etc.; and _Grammar_.

946 _Till help his brothir._ Wrong by a year. The siege of Berwick was
in September, 1319; Edward Bruce was killed in the previous year. The
succours here sent were dispatched in September or October, 1318. See
on _Bk._ XVIII. 3, 110.


BOOK XVIII.

3 _A day forrouth thair arivyng._ So, too, Gray declares that Edward
Bruce "from over-boldness (_pur surquidery_) was not willing to wait
his reinforcements (_soun poair_) which had lately arrived, and were
within six leagues (miles) of him" (_Scala._, p. 143)--_i.e._, within
a day's march. Gray, it will be observed, applies the same quality
to Edward Bruce as Barbour does in line 183. The same explanation
occurs in the _Annals of Clonmacnoise_ (pp. 281, 282). The _Lanercost_
chronicler, on the contrary, says that the "great army" which had
"newly come" from Scotland to his assistance had joined Edward before
his advance to Dundalk (p. 238).

8-9 _twa thousand, Outane the Kyngis of Erischry._ The _Annals of
Ireland_ give the Scots 3,000 (p. 359), so that Barbour is probably
about right. The chronicler in Stevenson's _Illustrations_ makes the
Scots 30,000 (p. 3)! The "Irish Kings" here include MacRory, "King" of
the Hebrides ("Insi-Gall"), and MacDonald, "King" of Argyll, who were
both slain (_Annals of Ulster_, ii., p. 433; _Annals of Clonmacnoise_,
p. 281. _Cf._ note on line 443).

12 _Richard of Clare._ Barbour is misinformed; Richard de Clare was
killed five months before, May 11 (_Annals of Ulster_, ii., pp. 433 and
432, note 5; _Annals of Ireland_, p. 35). The English were commanded by
Sir John de Birmingham (_Annals of Ireland_, p. 359; _Baker_, p. 58).

17 _tuenty thousand._ Such a number of horse is obviously absurd, as is
also the total of "forty thousand" below.

33 _Men sayis._ _Cf._ on 3: "My brothir" is Walter, the High Steward.

75 _nane of us._ Not true of the Scots-Irish. _Cf._ note on 8-9.

89 _fourty thousand neir._ _Cf._ line 93, and note on 17. The
_Lanercost_ chronicler says the English were but "a few country-folk"
(_paucis et popularibus_; p. 238), probably an exaggeration the other
way.

95 _cot-armour._ The surcoat over his armour, bearing his coat-of-arms.

101 _till assemmyll._ The battle took place near the hill of Faughard
or Fagher, about two miles from Dundalk. The spot where Edward Bruce
fell is still shown by the natives. The date is given by Hailes,
Bain, and others, following the version of the _Annals_ in Camden's
_Chronicle_ as October 5; but in the later edition of the _Annals_ and
in the _Annals of Ulster_ and of _Clonmacnoise_ it is precisely fixed
as Saturday, October 14, 1318, from which the _Lanercost_ chronicler
differs by a day only, October 13 (_Lanercost_, p. 238; _Annals of
Ulster_, p. 433; _Annals of Ireland_, p. 359; _Annals of Clonmacnoise_,
p. 281); Fordun also October 14 (_Skene_, i., p. 348).

104 _ruschit with thair fais._ In the _Lanercost Chronicle_ it is
explained that the Scots were in three battles too far apart, and that
thus each as it attacked was disposed of before the next could come to
its assistance. Edward was with the third battle (p. 238).

110 _Johne de Sowlis als._ But John de Soules appears to have been dead
_circa_ 1316, when the husband of his "daughter and heir" petitioned
Edward II. for his Scottish lands (_Bain_, iii., No. 530). The date,
however, is doubtful.

113 _That few ... war slayne._ According to the _Vita Edw. Sec._, five
hundred stout men-at-arms (_valentes armati_) were slain, besides
Edward Bruce (p. 238); almost all were slain, says _Lanercost_,
except those only who escaped by flight (p. 238); not a single one
escaped, declares _Knighton_ (i., p. 412), but this is absurd. Two
thousand, almost all the Scots, were slain, but a few got away (_Annals
of Ireland_, p. 360). Only a few escaped out of thirty thousand
(Stevenson, _Illustrations_, p. 3).

117 _Johne Tomassun._ No doubt the same John Thomson (_Johannes
videlicet Thomae_), a stout commoner (_valens vernaclus_), who in
1333 was holding out in the "peel" of Lochdoon against Edward III.
(_Scotichr._, lib. xiii., chap. xxviii.).

123 _Johne cummyn._ Skeat prints the verb with a capital, as if
"cummyn" was a personal name. Obviously "Johne" is Thomson.

125 _Schir Philipe the Mowbray._ The defender of Stirling Castle before
Bannockburn: mortally wounded (_Annals of Ir._, p. 360).

167 _strak his hed of._ The _Lanercost_ writer says Edward Bruce was
beheaded after death, and his body divided into four parts, which were
sent to the four chief towns of Ireland (p. 238). According to Barbour,
it was Gilbert Harper's head. For the beheading, see also _Trokelowe_,
p. 103, and Stevenson's _Illustrations_, p. 3.

183 _owtrageous succudry._ _Cf._ extract from _Scalacronica_ in note on
3.

215 _Richard of Clare._ But see note on 12.

224 _Johne Mawpas._ According to the _Annals_, John Mawpas slew Edward
Bruce, and was himself found dead over his body. John de Birmyngham
brought the head to Edward III. (p. 360). Probably he thus earned the
reward offered for injury to Edward in life or limb, on September 3,
1316 (_Patent Rolls_, p. 551).

225 _Quhilk._ Koeppel points out that this is the only example of
this word otherwise than in the form _the quhilk that_, and therefore
suggests that E gives the original reading (_Englische Studien_, x.
381).

230 _tuk purpos._ 1322. Barbour passes over four years, and says
nothing of a destructive raid of the Scots on the West March in
June-July of this year, in which they went as far south as Preston
(_Lanercost_, p. 246; _Knighton_, i., p. 428; _Bain_, iii., No. 761;
_Foedera_, iii., p. 960).

235 _richt gret hoost._ "A very great army" (_Lanercost_, 247). "With
a very large army ... having an armed foot-soldier from each town in
England, besides his knights and esquires" (_Scala._, p. 149. So also
_Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon_, p. 78; _Knighton_, i. 428; _Baker_, p.
66).

249 _with-draw all the catele._ "The Scots fled with all their
possessions, at their approach (_a facie eorum_), to safe places;
stripped their own land wholly bare, and cleared the districts of all
the goods" (_Trokelowe_, p. 125). "The Scots, having cleared away or
conveyed with them beyond the Scottish Sea (the Forth) everything that
could be easily carried, left for the English a land bare of victuals"
(_Baker_, p. 66). Edward told the Archbishop of Canterbury that he
found neither "man nor beast" (_Bain_, iii., No. 778). So also in
_Knighton_, i., p. 428.

253 _with his hoost als still he lay._ "The Scots, in their usual
fashion, withdrew, and did not dare to fight with him" (_Lanercost_,
p. 247). The English traversed the country, meeting with no resistance
(_Baker_, p. 66).

254 _At Culros._ In Fife, on the Forth, opposite Boness (_cf._ note on
249).

261 _in Lowdiane._ Edward was at Gosford, in Haddingtonshire, on August
5 (_Bain_, iii., No. 761). He had taken the coast-road in order to do
more damage (_ibid._, 778).

262 _till Edinburgh._ _Scala._, p. 149; _Fordun_; _Skene_, i., p. 349.
There is a record of a grant by Edward at Edinburgh on August 22, and
of payments made at Leith on August 23, so that he may have been there
longer than three days; _cf._ above on 261 (_Bain_, iii., Nos. 764,
765). On August 17, however, a pardon is dated from Lauder (_ibid._,
763).

264 _Thair schippes._ At some date in August, probably later than
above, for the King, it would appear, had left, a cargo of medicine
came by sea to Edinburgh (Leith) from Newcastle (_ibid._, 766). Fordun
speaks of a vast multitude of ships (_copiosa multitudine_: _Fordun_,
i. 349).

268 _Thair vittale._ "Having used up the food on land, and that by sea
everywhere failing them" (_Trokelowe_, p. 125).

276 _Tranentis corne._ Tranent is between Musselburgh and Haddington.

283 _derrest beiff._ In Bower, "That this beef was too dear," Warenne
punning in the Latin, _Quod illius tauri caro erat nimis cara_
(_Scotichr._, ii., p. 278).

289-290 _of fasting had gret payne, etc._ "A very great part of the
army was wasted with hunger, and a great number perished from want of
food," and so they returned (_Trokelowe_, p. 125). The _Lanercost_
writer speaks of lack of victuals, and illness, dysentery, among the
soldiers, from both of which many died (p. 247). _Scalacronica_ concurs
(p. 149), also Fordun (_Skene_, i. 349). The English were thus forced
to retreat (_ibid._). Knighton puts the English losses at about fifteen
thousand (i., p. 428); 30,000 (!) from starvation (_Flores Hist._,
iii., p. 210).

291 _In-till Melros._ "The King's hobelers (light horse) foraging at
Melrose were defeated by James Douglas" (_Scala._, p. 149). _Cf._
lines 292-3. Knighton says the English came to Melrose, when, most
unexpectedly, the Scots rushed on them from the mountains, and slew
three hundred and more (i., p. 428). According to Fordun, the English
slew and wounded several of the monks, and committed other sacrilege
(_Gesta Annal._; _Skene_, i., pp. 349, 350).

339 _by Driburgh._ They burned the monastery to the ground (_Fordun_,
_ibid._).

341 _till Ingland._ Edward is at Fenham, on the coast of
Northumberland, by September 4, or thereabout (_Bain_, iii., No. 767).

346 _our the Scottis Se._ _Cf._ note on 249.

349 _Auchty thousand._ Certainly an exaggerated number. Each "battle,"
as almost invariably with Barbour (_cf._ note on _Bk._ XI.), represents
ten thousand men. Bruce had, however, a considerable force (_exercitu
non modico_; _Gesta Edw. de Carn._, p. 79), having, according to
Gray, assembled the whole power of Scotland, of the Isles, and of the
Highlands (_dez autres pays hautz_; _Scala._, p. 149). Exactly parallel
is the statement in _Lanercost_, p. 247.

352 _on to Ingland._ By the Solway on October 1, 1322 (_Lanercost_, p.
247; _Gesta Ann._, p. 350).

355 _to Byland._ Byland is in the North Riding of Yorkshire, near
Helmsley, on the right bank of the Rye. In _Gesta Edw._ "Bella-landa"
(p. 79). The affair at Byland was on October 21 (note in _Stevenson_
from Cotton MS., c. 1325, p. 55); October 14 (_Flores Hist._, iii., p.
210).

356-7 _wes liand The King of Ingland, etc._ So placed, too, in _Gesta
Edw. de Carn._: the King "in monasterio de Bella-landa," and the army
on a high mountain above the monastery (p. 79); by Fordun (_Skene_,
i. 350); and by Higden (_Polychron._, viii., p. 316). Trokelowe, too,
suggests the same, saying the Scots followed the King as far as Byland
Abbey, in the district of "Rye Valley" (_Realis Vallis_, p. 125). The
escape was "near Byland, close to the Abbey of Rievaulx," when the King
was crossing over (_Flores Hist._, iii., p. 210). But the _Lanercost_
chronicler locates the King in Rievaulx Abbey (Rievaulx = Realis
Vallis), on the opposite bank of the Rye (p. 247); and an order from
Edward to the Earl of Pembroke "to raise the country towards Byland" is
dated from Rievaulx, October 13 (_Bain_, iii., No. 790). In Stevenson's
_Chronicle_, too, the King is at Rievaulx, while Pembroke (Valence) and
Richmond and other lords are at "Beghland" (_Illustrations_, p. 7).

365 _Ane craggy bra._ _Cf._ preceding note. "A strength (_un
forteresce_) on a hill near Biland" (p. 149). "A certain mountain
between the Abbey of Biland and the Abbey of Rievaulx" (_Lanercost_, p.
247).

366 _a gret peth._ "A certain path (_viam_) on the mountain, narrow and
confined" (_arctam et strictam_; _Lanercost_, p. 247). "A very narrow
road where scarce ten could go abreast" (_vix 10 in fronte meabile._
Stevenson's _Illustrations_, p. 7).

373-4 _Went to the path, etc._ The Earl of Richmond, John of Brittany,
was sent with his followers to examine the Scottish army "from a
certain mountain, etc." (_cf._ on 365. _Lanercost_, _ibid._).

409 _Thomas Ouchtre(d)._ "Arthyn," as in C., is not known, and is
clearly wrong, for Sir Thomas Ughtred, or Ouchtred, was captured here,
as Barbour says in line 426 (_Bain_, iii., No. 806).

419 _Stanis apon thame._ "He (Richmond) strove with them by throwing
down stones" (_per lapides projectos._ _Lanercost_, p. 247).

427 _he wes tane._ _Cf._ on line 409.

443 _all the Erischry._ _I.e._, the Highlanders and Islesmen, who spoke
Gaelic or Irish. _Cf._ on line 349.

454 _aboun the bra._ The Scots ascended above them (_super eos._
_Lanercost_, _ibid._).

458 _the hycht has tane._ "The Scots ascended between the trees through
the middle of the grove" (_Gesta Edw._, p. 79). The fight took place
"on the summit of a hill near Byland" (_ibid._, p. 82).

462-4 _Johne Bretane, etc._ _Cf._ on line 373.

469 _thar wes tane._ John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, a prisoner
in Scotland, October 27 (_Bain_, iii., Nos. 792, 793). Still detained
in Scotland, December 10 (_ibid._, No. 795). Captured at Byland
(Stevenson, _Illustrations_, p. 7).

472 _lord of Souly._ Henry, Lord of Sully, a prisoner (_Bain_, No.
796): "the lord of Sully, a baron of France" (_Scala._, p. 149);
"the lord of Sully (_Siliaco_), an ambassador of the King of France"
(_Baker_, p. 66).

478 _yheit at Biland._ But _cf._ note on 356-7.

480 _in full gret hy._ "The King himself scarcely escaped from Rivaulx"
(_Scala._, p. 149). "The King fled swiftly from Biland" (_Gesta Edw._,
p. 79; _cf._ also _Lanercost_, p. 248; _Baker_, p. 66). "To Scarborough
Castle" (Stevenson, _Illustrations_, p. 7).

489 _Till Yorkis yhettis._ The Scots made their way to York (_Scala._,
p. 150; _Lanercost_, p. 248; _Gesta_, p. 81).

493 _nane wald cum out._ The English were quite demoralized. They had
fled like "a hare before the hounds" (_Scala._, p. 150). "The people
were collapsing (_corruentem_) before the enemy like sheep without a
shepherd" (_Gesta_, p. 81).

498 _Rivens._ Rievaulx; see above.

500 _The King of Inglandis ger._ A note in _Bain_ describes the harness
lost at "Ryvaux" by the sudden attack of the Scots there on October 14
(iii., No. 791). According to _Lanercost_, the King in his hurry left
in Rievaulx Monastery his silver plate and great treasure, all which
the Scots carried off, spoiling the monastery besides (p. 248). The
royal treasure taken at Byland (_Higden_, viii., p. 316).

520 _Lang eftir._ In October, 1323, and May, 1324, negotiations for
Richmond's release were still in progress (_Bain_, iii., No. 829; _Pat.
Rolls_).

543 _but ransoun free._ This seems to have been the transaction which
resulted in the "Emerald" charter of the Douglases, giving them
extraordinary powers of jurisdiction within their territories. The
grant was in lieu of 4,400 merks sterling, the ransoms of three (not
two) French knights and their valets captured by Douglas at Byland, and
liberated at the instance of the King of France, "our very dear friend"
(Fraser's _Douglas_, _Bk._ iii., p. 11).

553 _Byrnand, slayand, and distroyand._ From all accounts the Scots
did terrible mischief. "They did damage at their pleasure, with no
one to oppose them" (_Scala._, p. 150). They spoiled and burned the
neighbouring districts, carried off the cattle, and wasted on all
sides with fire and sword (_Gesta Edw._, p. 80; _Trokelowe_, p. 126;
_Northern Registers_, p. 318).

555 _to the Wald._ The Yorkshire Wold (_Scala._, p. 150). "Le Wald"
(_Lanercost_, p. 248; Stevenson's _Illustrations_, p. 7).

558 _The vale ... of Beauvare._ The valley of the river Hull in
which is Beverley. "They destroyed that country to about the town of
Beverley, which purchased immunity from being burned" (_Lanercost_,
p. 248). Murimuth and Baker say it cost Beverley four hundred pounds
sterling (_Baker_, p. 66).

561 _Till Scotland._ They returned on October 22 (_Gesta_, p. 80).
In _Lanercost_, November 2 is given as the date (p. 248). It may be
inferred, from a reference in _Bain_ to the Earl of Richmond as "a
prisoner in Scotland" on October 27, that the Scots had got home by
that date.


BOOK XIX.

6 _a fell conjuracione._ Barbour post-dates this conspiracy. It took
place in 1320.

11 _The lord of Sowlis._ Probably the grandson of Sir Nicholas Soulis,
one of the competitors in 1292. Sir Nicholas claimed through his
mother, a niece of Alexander III. (_Bain_, ii., liv.). His forfeited
lands in Liddesdale were given to Bruce's illegitimate son Robert
(Robertson's _Index_, p. 12; 54, etc.); others to Robert Stewart, son
of Walter (_ibid._, 10; 13).

16 _Male-herbe._ As in E, is the correct form; or Malerb (_Fordun_),
Malherbe (_Scala._) and on record in _Bain_, and in _Robertson_, where
the Stirlingshire lands forfeited by "Gilbert de Malherbe" are gifted
to another (_Index_, 21; 19). The land of "Malerbe" was in Perthshire
(_Reg. Mag. Sig._, pp. 30, 61). The other names occur in these sources
also, as in Barbour.

19 _David the Brechyne._ _Cf._ on _Bk._ VIII. 402; IX. 293. Some of the
forfeited lands of Brechin, such as Rothmay, Brechine, Kinloch, etc.,
were granted to Sir David de Barclay (_Robertson_, pp. 26, 34).

23 _Throu ane lady._ The lady in the affair was Countess of Strathearn
(_Gesta Annal._, cxxxv.). But Gray (_Scala._, p. 144) gives a different
discoverer, Murdoch of Menteith, who was in the English service as
late, at least, as January, 1317 (_Bain_, iii. 534). The Countess could
not have turned King's evidence, as she was condemned to imprisonment
for life (_Fordun._ _Ibid._). In an extract from the Cotton MS. in
_Stevenson_, Menteith is again given as the discoverer (_Illust._, p.
55).

45 _playn granting._ Soulis made a full confession (_Scala._, p. 144).

49 _plane parliament._ At Scone, August, 1320 (_Fordun_; _Skene_, i.
348; _Scala._, p. 144). It was known as the Black Parliament.

51 _Till his penance till Dumbertane._ "Confined in Dumbarton Castle
for punishment in prison" (_a sa penaunz en prisoun._--_Scala._, p.
144); "for life" (_Fordun_; _Skene_, i. 348). Gray says that Dumbarton
was the only castle in Scotland not now dismantled (_ibid._).

56 _thai drawin war._ As in Fordun: "first drawn with horses and
finally executed" (_Skene_, i. 348). Gray says Brechin, Logy, and
Maleherbe were hanged and drawn in Perth. Fordun adds Richard Brown, a
squire.

74 _Scottis man._ Umfraville was a prisoner since Bannockburn. At this
date (1320) he was still in Scotland, though on July 24, 1314, Edward
was granting safe-conducts to some of his friends for a journey to
France in quest of money for his ransom (_Bain_, iii., No. 374). On
April 20, 1320, there is a safe-conduct for Sir Ingelram de Umfraville,
"a Scottish knight passing through England on his affairs beyond seas,"
with a considerable following, which was cancelled for one in October
(_ibid._, 694). Meantime his name is on the record of the Arbroath
Parliament in April, 1320 (see below). On January 26, 1321, he is being
restored to his estates, "as Ingelram, who was a prisoner in Scotland,
has escaped, and shown that he never left his allegiance" (_ibid._,
721). These facts have been held to invalidate Barbour's statement
(Maxwell's _Robert the Bruce_, pp. 276-7), but they have obviously a
suspicious air. He appears to have somewhat prolonged his escape; there
was clearly a doubt as to his loyalty; and the date fits in curiously
with the narrative. Finally, it has to be explained how Umfraville's
name appears in the list of signatories to the famous letter to the
Pope from the barons and Community of Scotland on April 6, 1320: "While
there exist a hundred of us we will never submit to England" (_Acts
Parl. Scot._, i., p. 114).

125 _the Kyngis curtasy._ _Cf._ note on _Bk._ XIII. 531.

131 _oftsis._ There had been frequent negotiations for peace since
immediately after Bannockburn (_cf._ _Foedera_ iii., p. 495).

186 _war trewis tane._ The truce was arranged at Thorpe, near York, to
last for thirteen years (see line 188) from June 12, 1323.

191-6 _Bot Inglis men apon the se Distroyit, etc._ Of such cases,
probably those referred to here, we have precise details in Bain's
_Calendar_, vol. iii. On September 7, 1326, an inquiry is ordered by
Edward II. into the case of certain Scottish merchants who, on their
way to Flanders, took refuge in an English ship from fear of pirates,
and were brought to Scarborough, where they were all arrested by the
Sheriff of York and the magistrates of Scarborough, and put in prison
(No. 887). On September 28 three justices are commissioned to inquire
into the seizure of a Flemish vessel at Whitby, when nine Scottish
merchants, sixteen Scottish pilgrims, and thirteen women were murdered
(lines 195, 234), and the cargo and goods to the value of L2,000
carried off (line 196); the vessel being cast adrift, and afterwards
captured by others, when the rest of the cargo was appropriated.
Apparently this inquiry was fruitless, for another is ordered at
Yarmouth on October 15 (No. 889). Then, on October 12, there was the
case of a Scottish clerk arrested on the high seas, brought with his
two servants and goods to Scarborough, and imprisoned by the Sheriff of
York, to be discharged later by the King's order (No. 889). And Adam
Rolok and other Scots had been taken from a ship touching at Brunham
and lodged in Norwich prison, from which they were not released till
September 24, 1328 (No. 965). Neglecting Barbour's full explanation,
confirmed as it is by Bain's _Calendar_, historians profess to find the
origins of this campaign obscure, or lay all the blame upon the Scots
(Hume Brown, _History_, i., p. 166; Lang, _History_ i. 232; Le Bel,
_Chronique_, ed. 1904, i., p. 37, editorial note).

205 _Walter Steward._ Died April 9, 1326.

230-1 _twa yheir ... and ane half._ Nearly four years after; _cf._ note
on 188.

238 _gaf the trewis up._ Le Bel, the Flemish chronicler, says he
"defied" Edward about Easter because he saw Edward II. deposed, his
Government upset, and that the new King was but a boy; and therefore
hoped to conquer a part of England (_Les Vrayes Chroniques_, i., p. 34,
edit. 1863; _Froissart_, trans. Johnes, i. 15).

241 _Donald Erll of Mar._ _Cf._ note on _Bk._ XIII. 687. He had been
brought up at the Court of Edward II., and had served for him against
the Scots, but, on his deposition, returned to his native land. The
Scots readily received him and restored him to his earldom (_Gesta
Edw. Tertii_, p. 96; _Bain_, iii. 744; _Scala._, p. 151). He hoped
to get Scottish aid in restoring Edward II. (_Chron. de Lanercost_,
p. 259). The leaders of this expedition are given as in Barbour in
_Scalacronica_, _Chron. de Lanercost_, and _Gesta Edwardi Tertii_,
with the exception of the Steward, who is not mentioned. Le Bel, who
was present with the troops of John of Hainault, names only Moray and
Douglas, whom he erroneously styles William, here as elsewhere (i., p.
48).

248 _In England._ June 15; and a second raid to Weardale in August
(_Fordun._ _Skene_, i. 351-2). Before July 20 (_Lanercost_, p. 259).
By the West March, says Hailes, citing Froissart (_i.e._, le Bel), but
this is certainly not clear. No one seems to have known how they came:
"They had passed the river (? Tyne, Eden) so quietly that neither they
of Carlisle nor they of Newcastle knew anything of it" (_Le Bel_, i.,
p. 46, edit. 1863).

250 _ten thousand._ Le Bel says there were three thousand men-at-arms,
knights, and squires, and about twenty thousand variously armed upon
little hackneys (p. 48). These numbers are clearly in excess. It is
from Jehan le Bel in this connection that Froissart has taken his
famous and familiar description of a Scots Border raid (_Johnes_, ch.
xvii.).

254 _Wardill._ Weardale, in Durham (_Fordun_, _Gesta Annalia_, cxl.).

256 _The King wes ded._ Edward II. was in ward since January 7, but did
not die till September 21.

257 _that wes yhing._ Edward III. was fifteen.

261 _Isabel._ Daughter of Philip IV. of France.

262 _wes weddid._ Not till January 28, 1328, to the second daughter
(Philippa) of Count or Earl William of Holland and Hainault. Barbour,
of course, writes about fifty years after.

267 _Schir Johne of Hennaut._ John of Hainault, lord of Beaumont,
brother of the Count, then "in the flower of his age" (_Le Bel_, i., p.
12). He came at Edward's request, and brought five hundred well-mounted
men-at-arms from Hainault, Flanders, Bohemia, Cambresis, and Artois:
later he was joined by fifty more (_Le Bel_, i. 36, 37). Jehan le Bel
and his brother were in the company.

271 _In-to York._ The English army assembled at York, and there awaited
the arrival of the Hainaulters (_Le Bel_, p. 36); or of the chief lords
(_Gesta Edw._, p. 96). There was a wait at York of more than six weeks
until news should come about the Scots (_Le Bel_, p. 45). The English
preparations seem to have anticipated the Scottish raid, though Barbour
puts it otherwise.

275 _neir fifty thousand._ According to _Le Bel_, it was said the
English had seven thousand knights and squires, thirty thousand armed
men, half of whom were mounted on little hackneys, and twenty-four
thousand archers on foot--sixty-one thousand men (i., p. 49). The
English were three times the number of the Scots (_Murimuth_, p. 53;
_Baker_, 97). Froissart, modifying _Le Bel_, gives in another place
more than forty thousand men-at-arms (i., p. 17).

278 _Xviii yheir._ Edward, born November, 1312, was only fifteen.

279 _Cokdaill._ The Cock flows into the Wharfe, a tributary of the
Yorkshire Ouse. Sir Herbert Maxwell says Coquetdale (_Robert the
Bruce_, p. 311).

287 _sevyn battellis._ According to Le Bel, the English were in three
battles of infantry, each battle having two wings of five hundred
men-at-arms (p. 49).

316 _north half Wer, toward Scotland._ Maxwell insists that the Scots
were on the south bank, on account of an order from Edward on August
3, located at Stanhope, to which may be added a later reference to his
having been there (_Robert the Bruce_, p. 312 and note; _Bain_, iii.,
Nos. 929, 933). But the Scots were certainly at Stanhope Park, on the
north bank (see below on 490 and 513). Mr. J. T. T. Brown, also on the
strength of the first citation from _Bain_, says that "Froissart and
the Scottish poet are both alike in error in placing the Scottish army
on the north bank and the English on the opposite of the Wear" (_The
Wallace and Bruce Restudied_, p. 144). In what he writes, Froissart
simply follows _Le Bel_, who was present. Neither expressly says that
the Scots were on the north bank, but it is made clear in both that
the river separated the forces. Nothing is said by Barbour of how the
English hunted for the Scots, but could not find them; of their rough
and hurried ride to the Tyne at Hexham to cut off the expected Scottish
retreat; or of their rush south when it was discovered by a squire that
the Scots were on the Wear--all of which is graphically described by
Le Bel and transferred to his own work by Froissart (_Le Bel_, i., ch.
xii.; _Froissart_, ch. xvii.).

322 _Stude in a strynth._ They were drawn up in three battles on the
slope of the mountain on which they were encamped (_Le Bel_, p. 62).
Gray says the Scots were in three divisions on a fine plain, and calls
this first position also Stanhope (_Scala._, p. 154). But it is clear
from the detailed accounts of Barbour and Le Bel that the Scots were on
a hill.

328 _Weris wattir._ "Below this mountain was a strong, swift river"
(_Le Bel_, p. 62). "The King took up a position before them on the Wear
wattir for three days" (_Scala._, p. 154).

350 _Archibald ... of Douglas._ Youngest brother of Sir James, "the
Tineman" (_i.e._, the Loser), afterwards Regent of Scotland; killed at
Halidon Hill, 1333. His especial share in this raid was to plunder the
bishopric of Durham (_Scala._, p. 154; Maxwell's _History of the House
of Douglas_, vol. i., pp. 70, 71, 75).

353-4 These lines appear to mean that Douglas alternately advanced
and retired so as to draw the English on. The Scots on the next day,
according to Le Bel, "ran forwards and backwards in skirmishing"
(_couroient et racouroient tout en eshcarmuchant_, p. 64).

374 _Schir Williame of Erskyn._ It is noted that Bruce died in debt to
Erskine (_Excheq. Rolls_, i., p. 404).

396 _Tymbrys for helmys._ Wooden crests on helmets, common in the
fourteenth century. Apparently the novelty was not in the crests, but
in the material; hitherto they would have been made of _cuir-bouilli_
(see _Bk._ XII., 23, note). Edward III. bore an eagle: "Tymbre de legle
(? l'aigle)" (_Bain_, iii., p. lxviii.).

399 _crakkis of war._ Early cannon (_cf._ on _Bk._ XVII., line 250). It
is not easy to understand how the English carried these with them in
their forced marches over hill and dale. Le Bel does not mention them.
They do not appear again in warfare till Crecy (1346), if then (Oman,
_Art of War_, p. 611).

402 _That nycht._ "The night of St. Peter in August" (_la nuit
Saint-Pierre d'aoust_, _Le Bel_, 64). St. Peter's Day was August 1, but
as Mass was heard on the morrow, the "night" was probably that of July
31, St. Peter's Eve.

405 _The Inglis men._ Le Bel (_Froissart_) does not relate the
incidents given by Barbour, or these operations, except in general
terms. Many "companions," he says, with the assistance of their horses,
crossed the river, and some on foot; prisoners were taken, and others
wounded or killed on both sides; and this went on continuously for
three days (p. 64). The English learned from their prisoners that the
Scots had neither bread, salt, nor wine, and so they hoped to starve
them out; but they had plenty of beef, and were not particular about
how they ate it, without salt or bread, "boiled or roasted as it liked
them;" as well as some oatmeal, of which they made cakes (i., p. 65).

431 _all arayit._ Each of the first two days, Le Bel tells us, the
English were drawn up in order of battle, though it came only to
fruitless skirmishing.

482 _Fyres in gret foysoun._ The Scots, writes Le Bel, always made a
wonderful number of fyres between night and morning; and by this and
their blowing of horns and shouting together it seemed as if all the
devils of hell were assembled there (pp. 64, 65; _Johnes_, i., ch.
xviii.).

486 _Twa myle._ "Two small leagues" (_Le Bel_). "A short league"
(_Scala._). "League," as usual, signifies just a mile, as when Le
Bel credits the Scots with an average day's march of from twenty to
thirty-two "leagues" (p. 4).

488 _defend thame bettir._ "A much stronger place than before" (_Le
Bel_, 65).

490 _a park._ Stanhope Park, a hunting-ground of the Bishop of Durham,
on the north bank of the Wear. "The Scots entered the park of Stanhope
and there lodged; likewise also the English on the other side of a
certain stream pitched camp and rested" (_Gesta Edw._, p. 96). The
Scots moved to "within the park of Stanhope" (_dedenz le park de
Stanhope_, _Scala._, p. 154). "The Scots betook themselves to the
park of Stanhope" (_Lanercost_, p. 259). The Scottish army was "at
Stanhope Park" (_apud Stanhop park_, _Contin. Chron._, _Murimuth_, p.
53; _Chron._, _Knighton_, i., p. 445; _Baker_, p. 97; _Hemingburgh_,
ii., p. 298). And those who have rejected Barbour's statement as to
the northward position of the Scots, resting on a single citation
from Bain (see on 316), would have found, a few pages farther on, an
express reference to the time when the Scots were surrounded and beset
(_circumdati et obsessi_) _in the park of Stanhope_ by the King's army
(_Bain_, No. 957, June 29, 1328). Edward, being so near, could very
well speak of himself as "at Stanhope." Bain later admits the Scots
were at Stanhope (_Edwards in Scotland_, p. 77).

492 _full of treis._ At Stanhope Park "they were lodged in a wood" (_Le
Bel_, 65). "In the woddys of Stanhop park in dyverse busshementis"
(_Fabyan_, p. 439).

495 _Be nychtyrtale._ _I.e._, by night-time, as in Chaucer:

                          "by _nightertale_
  He sleep namore than doth a nightingale."

  (_Prologue_, 97, 98).

501 _Upon the wattir._ "On another mountain ... also on the river" (_Le
Bel_, i. 65).

503 _on the morn._ Barbour gives the Scots only two days in the first
position opposite the English, not saying how long they had been
already "liand" there, which Le Bel says was eight days. Le Bel says,
further, that they left on the third, not the second, night, and that
their departure was discovered on the morning of the fourth day (p.
65). If the English arrived on July 31 (_cf._ on 402), and Edward was
at Stanhope on August 3 (_cf._ on 316), this would be right. Gray says
the Scots shifted camp on the fourth night (_Scala._, p. 154). Fordun
suggests only one position, the second (_Gesta Annalia_, cxl.).

513 _on othir half the wattir of Wer._ _Cf._ _Gesta Edwardi_ in note on
490. In Le Bel the river is still between the armies, (pp. 65, 66).

516 _Aucht dayis._ Maxwell affirms that, in saying this, Barbour
"either draws on his imagination, or has been misled by his informants"
(_Robert the Bruce_, p. 314); and the chronology of the various
writers is hard to reconcile. Gray gives six days for the second
position (p. 154); Le Bel (Froissart) eighteen (68); Knighton fifteen
(_Leycestrensis Chron._, i. 445); Hemingburgh says the Scots were
besieged for fifteen days in Stanhope Park (ii., p. 298). But the
author of _Gesta Edwardi_ agrees with Barbour in assigning eight days
(_octo diebus dicursis_, p. 97), and so does the _Lanercost_ writer (p.
259) and Fordun (_Gesta Annalia_, cxl.). Yet Mr. Brown accuses Barbour,
in fixing that term, of "always lauding his own side," though these
English chroniclers support him (_The Wallace and The Bruce_, p. 145).
One document suggests that Edward was at Durham on August 5 (_Bain_,
iii., No. 930), but dates and places on legal documents do not always
signify what they suggest. The order from Durham was issued in the
King's name. Edward was still at Stanhope on August 7 (_Calendar of
Patent Rolls_, Edward III. _s. d._).

520-1 _ilk day justyng of Wer. And scrymming._ "Every day skirmishing
by those who wished to skirmish" (_Le Bel_, 67). _Cf._ throughout
Froissart, ch. xviii.

527 _on the nynt day._ "The _first_ night that our lords were lodged
upon this (second) mountain" (_Le Bel_, p. 67). In _Scala._ apparently
the third night (p. 155).

533 _V. hundreth._ "Two hundred men-at-arms" (_Le Bel_, p. 67). "A few"
(_Lanercost_, 260; _Gesta Edw._, 96).

534 _in the night._ "About midnight" (_Le Bel_).

535 _so fer he raid._ "He passed this river a good distance (_bien
loin_) from our host" (_Le Bel_).

538 _slely can he ryd._ "Wherefore no one perceived him" (_Le Bel_).

541 _hew rapys._ See below on 561.

550 _no vachis._ "He suddenly passed through the sentinels of the
English" (_Gesta Edw._, pp. 96-7).

560 _He ruschit on thame hardely._ He fell on the English host most
boldly, crying: "Douglas! Douglas! you shall die all, lords of England"
(_Le Bel_, _ibid._). In _Froissart_ it becomes "thieves of England"
(_Berners_, _Johnes_), a version due, apparently, to Froissart's later
re-editing of his own work. In Lettenhove's edition (1863) it is
"_'Glas, 'Glas_" (i., p. 102). Knighton says that when Douglas was seen
by some English he began to cry in English (_Anglica voce_), "'No warde
a seynt Jorge!' as if he were an Englishman" (i. 445).

561 _doune he bare._ Le Bel (Froissart) says Douglas got so far
that "he cut two or three cords of the King's tent." "He penetrated
(_intravit_) a great part of the army of the King, and came nearly to
the King's tent" (_Lanercost_, 260). "He passed through the midst of
the English army" (_Gesta Edwardi_, 97).

565 _Thai stabbit, stekit, and thai slew._ "They began, he and his
company, to make a great attack. (A faire une grand envaie et a coper
et mehagnier gens et a abatre (car ce fus sus le point dou premier
somme) et porterent grand damage a l'oost" (_Froissart_ in Vatican MS.,
ed. Lettenhove, i., chap, xxxiii., p. 102. 1863).

567 _A felloun slauchtir._ "Douglas and his company slew more than
three hundred" (_Le Bel_). "Some he slew, some took captive" (_Gesta
Edw._, p. 97). They "slew a great part of the people of the Earls"
(_Scala._, p. 155).

568 _liand nakit._ _I.e._, unarmoured. "And he slew or he seased
ccc. men, some in their beddes, and some skant redy" (from Berner's
_Froissart_, but not in Johnes nor in any of the known editions of
_Froissart_ nor in _Le Bel_; not, however, a very unusual exercise
of the imagination). Barbour's descriptive detail is evidently due
to his information. "He gave very many a rude awakening" (_plurimos
terribiliter evigilavit._ _Gesta Edw._, p. 97). "On his return he slew
many in their amazement" (_attonitos._ _Lanercost_, 260).

577 _That lord, etc._ _I.e._, "First one lord and then another was
aroused."

614 _cummyn ar thai._ "He himself (Douglas) returned unhurt to his own
army" (_Gesta Edw._, 97); "with very great difficulty" (_Knighton_, i.
445).

638 _ilk day growis._ Edward was still summoning men to his host. Such
a summons is dated at Stanhope, August 3 (_Bain_, No. 929).

639 _vattale has._ Le Bel, on the contrary, says the English army was
suffering severely from want of food, and that provisions were at a
famine price (_toudis avions nous paour de plus grand famine_, pp.
66-68). The final Froissart does not have these passages, but suggests
the same thing (p. 24). The _Lanercost_ chronicler speaks of their
failing victuals (p. 259).

644 _Sic as we haf._ See notes on 405 and 735. Le Bel says the English
expected the Scots would be forced by famine to make a night attack (p.
68; _Froissart_, Johnes, p. 24).

657 _A nycht._ "One night."

667 _thou mon heir out._ "You can get out only here."

712 _thai sall let thame trumpit ill._ Evidently in allusion to line
680. "Trumpeting" seems to have been the prelude to any operation. Or
the phrase may be in French idiom, introducing the verb _tromper_, to
deceive, which, however, would be unusual for Barbour.

731 _blew hornys and fyres maid._ _Cf._ note on 482.

735 _the nycht wes fallyn._ According to Le Bel, a Scottish knight was
that day captured, who, much against his will, informed them that in
the morning the Scots lords had arranged that every man was to be armed
at vespers (68), and that each was to follow the banner of Douglas
wherever he should go, and that every man was to keep it secret; but
the Scots knight did not know for certain what their purpose was. The
English judged that the Scots, forced by unendurable famine, were about
to make an attack on their host (p. 68). Next day it was found that
the Scots had departed "before midnight" (p. 69), "leaving the park
by night" (_Gesta Edw._, p. 97). Certain allusions would lead us to
infer that the English had, to some extent, got round the Scots. Le Bel
declares that the Scots were thought to be planning an attempt to break
through the English on two sides (_brisier nostre ost a deux costes_,
pp. 68-9). The _Lanercost_ writer says the Scots got away to their
own country "by moving round the army of the King" (_circueundo regis
exercitum versus Scotiam pertransirent_, p. 259). They were surrounded,
according to Knighton (i., 445). _Cf._ also extract 957 from _Bain_
in note on 490, and lines 800, 801. Le Bel says that he and some
"companions" had to cross the river next day to get to the Scottish
encampment, where they found abundance of beef in various forms. The
account in the _Scalacronica_ is simply that, the third night after
the Douglas affair, the Scots broke camp and marched to their own
country (_Scala._, p. 155). Several English chroniclers attribute the
escape of the Scots to treachery on their own side (_Murimuth_, 53, 64;
_Knighton_, i. 445; _Gesta Edw._, 97, etc.).

746 _summer._ "Sumpter-horse," as, with a different spelling, in
_Wallace_, iv. 53; "Thar tyryt _sowmir_ so left thai in-to playne."

766-7 _till consale, etc._ "When the lords heard this they took counsel
... and said that to chase after the Scots would profit them nothing,
for they could not be overtaken" (_Le Bel_, p. 69).

770 _Kyng Robert than._ If so, Bruce must have hurried back from
Ireland, for on July 12 he granted a truce of one year to the people
of Ulster (_Bain_, iii. 922). This Irish campaign appears to have been
a failure (_ibid._, 1191). These are our only allusions to it. In
_Scala._ it is said that it was the Earls who heard they were besieged
(p. 155).

774 _tuenty thousand._ "Five thousand" (_Scala._, p. 155).

776 _Marche and Angous._ "Patrick, Earl of March, and John the Steward,
who styled himself Earl of Angous" (_Scala._, p. 155). March (_cf._
note on _Bk._ XI. 46) had joined the Scots some time before February,
1317 (_Bain_, iii. 536). Sir John Stewart of Boncle, or Bonkill, son
of Sir Alexander (see on _Bk._ IX. 692), was created Earl of Angus by
Bruce (_Scots Peerage_, i. 169).

781 _the sammyn day._ "The very day of their departure" (_Scala._, 155).

798 _Had vittale with thame._ On the contrary, Gray declares that if
they had had enough provisions they would have gone back; they were
such fierce warriors (p. 155).


BOOK XX.

1 _Soyne eftir._ "Not long after" (_nec multum post._ _Gesta Edw._, p.
97). It was "lately," on September 22, 1327 (_Northern Registers_, p.
344).

5 _A gret host._ "With a great army" (_North. Reg._, p. 344).

7 _to Norhame._ Besieged Norham Castle (_ibid._; also _Foedera_, iii.,
p. 975; and _Scala._, p. 155). Robert himself was at Norham (_Scala._).
For this and next note, _cf._ _Scotichronicon_, ii., p. 288.

10 _Awnwyk._ Alnwick. "Besieged the castle of Alnwick for more than
fifteen days" (_Gesta Edw._, p. 97). Alnwick besieged by Moray and
Douglas (_Scala._, 155).

15 _mony fair gud chevelry._ At Alnwick "there were great jousts of war
by formal agreement" (_estoient grantz joustes de guere par covenaunt
taille._ _Scala._, p. 155).

23-25 _The landis of Northumberland ... gaf he._ "And lands, it is
claimed, within the kingdom of England, the said King Robert confers
on certain of his followers, and causes charters to be prepared for
the grantees" (_North. Reg._, p. 344; _cf._ "thai payit for the seliys
fee").

27 _raid he destroyand._ The Scots "destroyed Northumberland almost
entirely, except the castles, and remained there a long time"
(_Lanercost_, p. 260).

31 _Ledaris of hym._ "The Queen and Mortimer arranged everything" (_la
royne et le Mortimer le firent tout_, _Scala._, 156). "By the evil
advice of his mother and Roger, Lord of Mortimer" (_Lanercost_, p.
261); "his mother then ruled the whole kingdom" (_ibid._).

33 _Send messyngers._ The "messengers" (_nuntios_; in _Acts._,
messages) and procurators of the King of England were the Bishops
of Lincoln and Norwich, Henry Percy, William of Ashby-de-la-Zouch
(a Mortimer), and Geoffrey Scrope. The negotiations took place at
Edinburgh, and were concluded March 17, 1328 (_Gesta Edw._, p. 98;
_Acts Parl. Scot._, i., p. 124). A parliament at Northampton finally
agreed to the treaty, May 4, 1328 (_Exchequer Rolls_, i. ciii.).

38 _fiff yheir ... scarsly._ David Bruce was born on March 5, 1324.

39 _Johane ... of the Tour._ Having been born in the Tower of London.
"Johanam de Turre" (_Lanercost_, p. 261); "Johannam de Turribus"
(_Scotich._, ii., p. 290).

43 _sevin yher._ Born 1321.

44 _monymentis and lettrys ser._ Especially the _Ragman Roll_
(Icelandic, _ragmanr_, a coward?), containing a list of the homages
to Edward on August 28, 1296, at Berwick, by the churchmen, earls,
barons, knights, burgesses, and whole community of Scotland, as well
as earlier submissions (_Bain_, ii. xxv., pp. 193-214; _cf._ also
_Lanercost_, p. 261; _Knighton_, i. 448-9; _Scotichr._, ii., p. 289;
_Baker_, p. 103). Baker says the Roll was publicly burned at the
marriage at Berwick (_ibid._). The only copies of it that exist are
in the _Tower Rolls_ (_Bain_, _ibid._), with portions of the original
instruments of homage; so that this stipulation was never carried out
(_Acts Parl. Scot._, i., p. 19).

48 _all the clame._ "Omnem clameum (_sic_) seu demandam" (_Lanercost_,
p. 261). _Cf._ for terms of the "Relaxation of Superiority." _Foedera_,
iv., p. 338; York, May 1, 1328.

53 _Fully xx thousand pund._ Twenty thousand pounds sterling to be paid
in three years (_Acts Parl. Scot._, i., p. 125). Fordun says 30,000
marks out of King Robert's "mere goodwill," in compensation for English
losses (_Gesta Annalia_, cxli.). The last payment was in 1331 (_Excheq.
Rolls_, cx.).

67 _for the mangery._ The _Exchequer Rolls_, I, cxiv.-cxvii., contain
a long list of purchases in the Low Countries for the household of the
young people--food, furniture, utensils, etc.

73 _male es._ Fr. _mal aise_, illness. According to Le Bel, Bruce was
suffering from the "great sickness" (_la grosse maladie_) in 1327
(p. 48; see also 79). The _Lanercost_ chronicler says it was leprosy
(_factus fuerat leprosus_, p. 259). Johnes translates Froissart's
"grosse maladie" as leprosy (i. 18, 26).

79 _Cardross._ On the Clyde, half way between Dumbarton and
Helensburgh, acquired by the King in 1326 in exchange for other lands
(_Exchequer Rolls_, I., cxix.).

83 _To Berwik._ The marriage took place on Sunday, July 19, 1328
(_Lanercost_, p. 261); July 17 (_Gesta Annalia_, cxlii.).

85 _the Queyne and Mortymer._ Edward III. himself was not present
(_Lanercost_, p. 261).

125 _At that parliament._ The arrangement as to the succession of the
Steward and a possible regency were made in a parliament of 1318.
Randolph was to be regent, and, failing him, Douglas (_Acts Parl._,
i. 105). Barbour divides the regency; Fordun makes no mention of this
(_Gesta Annalia_, cxxxix.).

*129 _Maid hym manrent and fewte._ Some such ceremony in all likelihood
did take place; Barbour's statement is not to be rejected lightly. Le
Bel (_Froissart_) says that when the King felt the approach of death he
summoned his barons (see below), and charged them, on their fealty, to
guard loyally the kingdom for his own David, and when he came of age
obey him, and crown him King, and marry him suitably--in which last
detail Le Bel is, of course, astray (p. 79; _Johnes_, i. 27).

151 _Till Cardross went._ He had paid a visit to Galloway, and was at
Glenluce on March 29, 1329.

158 _For the lordis._ See note on 129.

167 _Lordingis._ An alternative account of this speech and of the whole
circumstances up to the death of Douglas is given by Le Bel (ch. xxv.),
and adapted from him by Froissart (_Johnes_, i., ch. xx.). Divergencies
or close parallels are noted as they occur. See on these Appendix, F.
vi. Baker also has a brief account, citing, as a witness of the doings
of Douglas in Spain, Thomas Livingstone, a Carmelite friar, at that
time a civilian serving under his command in the Christian army (p.
104).

177 _my trespass._ This sounds like a clerical interpretation; _cf._
_Bk._ II. 43-5 for a similar comment. In _Le Bel_ Bruce opens with
the remark that all knew that he had much to do in his time, and had
suffered much to maintain the rights of this kingdom (as cited).

178 _my hert fyschit firmly was._ "I made a vow which I have not
accomplished and which weighs upon me" (_Le Bel_). "I vowed," etc.
(_Baker_, p. 105).

181 _to travell apon Goddis fayis._ "To make war upon the enemies of
our Lord and the adversaries of the Christian faith beyond the sea"
(_Le Bel_). Froissart does not have the closing phrase. "That I would
fight with my body against the enemies of Christ" (_Baker_, p. 105).

183-5 _the body may on na wis, etc._ "Since my body is not able to go
or accomplish that which the heart has so long desired, I wish to send
the heart for the body to make satisfaction for me and my wish" (_pour
moy et pour mon vueil acquittier._ _Le Bel_, 1904, I., chap. xv.); "to
fulfil my vow" (_pour mon voeu achever._ _Froissart_); "Because alive I
shall not be able"--_i.e._, to go (_Baker_, 105).

188 _cheis me ane._ Le Bel and Baker represent Bruce as himself
choosing Douglas for the mission; so, too, does Bower (_Scotichr._,
ii., p. 300).

191-2 _On Goddis fayis, etc._ _Cf._ above on line 181. Le Bel gives
the commission differently and in fuller detail: "That you take my
heart and have it embalmed, and take as much of my treasure as will
seem good to you for performing the journey, for yourself and all
those whom you will wish to bring with you; and that you will carry my
heart to the Holy Sepulchre, where our Lord was buried, since the body
is not able to go thither; and that you do it as magnificently (_si
grandement_) and as well provided with all things and with attendance
sufficient, as belongs to your estate; and wherever you come let it be
known that you carry as a commission (_comme message_) the heart of
the King of Scotland for the reason that his body cannot go thither."
In Johnes it is, from _Froissart_, "you will deposit your charge at
the Holy Sepulchre"; in Berners, "present my heart to the H.S." The
Vatican (final) MS. of _Froissart_, however, has "that you carry (the
heart) beyond the sea against the heathen (_mescreans_) _and as far as
to the Holy Sepulchre and leave it there, if you have the fortune to
go so far_" (_si l'aventure poes avoir d'aler si avant_, Lettenhove,
I., chap. xxxviii., p. 119). Bain summarizes a Protection "for seven
years," given by Edward III. on September 1, 1329, for James Douglas,
"on his way to the Holy Land with the heart of the late Robert K. of
Scotland, in aid of the Christians against the Saracens" (No. 991);
who also, on the same date, commends Douglas, on this mission, to
Alfonso K. of Castile, Leon, etc. (990). In the Pope's absolution
for the ecclesiastical offence of mutilating a dead body, dated at
Avignon, August 6, 1331, which, of course, proceeds on a narrative
furnished from Scotland, it is explained that King Robert had expressly
commanded that "his heart should be carried in battle against the
Saracens" (_in bello contra Saracenos portaretur_), and that, in
accordance with the wish of the King himself, it was carried by Douglas
into Spain in battle against the said Saracens (Theiner, _Vetera
Monumenta_, No. 498). Baker has it, "that you carry my heart against
the enemies of the name of Christ to Gardiavia on the frontier" (_ad
fronterii Gardiaviam_, p. 105). Later chroniclers distort the details
somewhat, Bower alleging that the heart was to be buried in Jerusalem,
and sending both Alfonso and Douglas to the Holy Land; referring the
reader, nevertheless, to "Barbour's Bruce" ("Barbarii Broisacus,"
_Scotichr._, ii., p. 301); while the _Book of Pluscarden_ simply
paraphrases Bower, expanding the reference to the Bruce (_legendam
dicti excellentissimi principis in nostro vulgari compositam_). _Cf._
also note in Brown's _Wallace and Bruce_, pp. 136-7, where, however,
Mr. Brown's hand is being forced by his theory. Doubtless Bruce's words
might be alternatively interpreted; but, from what we know of Douglas,
we may conclude that he fulfilled his commission to the letter, and
that Barbour is, so far, right. The Vatican _Froissart_ shows us how,
also, the confusion arose. Scott, in his final note on _The Abbot_,
prints a commendation (May 19, 1329) of Melrose Abbey by Bruce to his
son David and his successors, in which he says that he has arranged
that his heart should be buried there, but makes no mention of a prior
destination. Edward I. also had "bequeathed" his heart to the Holy
Sepulchre (_Trivet_, p. 413; Wright's _Political Songs_, p. 247).

197 _greting._ "All those who were there began to weep with much
compassion" (_Le Bel_).

212 _his bounty._ "I shall now die in peace, when I know that the most
suitable man in my kingdom and the most worthy will perform that which
I have not been able to perform" (_Le Bel_).

223-231 "Noble sire, a hundred thousand thanks for the great honour you
do me, when you charge and entrust to me so noble and so great a thing
and such a treasure; and I shall do very willingly what you command
concerning your heart, doubt it not, to the best of my power" (_Le
Bel_). In Baker, "I swear by the heart of Jesus Christ that I shall
carry your heart as you have asked me and die fighting with the cursed
enemies" (_contra praedamnatos hostes moriturum_, p. 105).

253 _he wes ded._ June 7, 1339, aged fifty-four years and eleven months.

276 _all for his persoune._ This, as may be gathered from all that here
precedes, was fully the case. Le Bel, in his earliest reference (ch.
i.), refers to him as "the noble King Robert the Bruce, who was King
of Scots, and had given often so much trouble to the good King Edward,
spoken of above" (Edward I.); and later says that from their exploits
these two Kings were reputed "the two most worthy in the world" (p.
107). On the English side: "Indeed, I would speak of Lord Robert the
Bruce with the greatest praise, did not the guilt of his homicide and
the knowledge of his treason compel me to be silent," and the writer
drops into a couplet to the same effect (_Vita Edw. Sec._, p. 166).
Baker is of the same mind; Bruce was "every inch a soldier" (_per omnia
militarem_), save that he was disloyal to his natural lord, which no
knight should be (p. 101).

286 _bawlmyt syne._ According to Le Bel, the heart was taken out and
embalmed (p. 81).

292 _solempnly erdit syne._ "He was buried in the honourable manner
that became him, according to the usage of the country" (_Le Bel_,
_ibid._). Froissart adds that "he lies in Dunfermline Abbey." His
skeleton was brought to light in digging in the Abbey in 1819, showing
the breastbone sawn up to get at the heart. It is that of a man about
six feet high. The mass of the wide, capacious head is to the rear,
and the forehead is rather low; the marks of the muscles on the head
and neck are very pronounced, and the cheekbones particularly strong
and prominent. Four front teeth in the upper jaw are missing, three,
apparently, as the result of a blow, the socket being much fractured.
The lower jaw is exceptionally strong and deep. For full details see
_Archaeol. Scot._, vol. ii., pp. 435-453. The _fair toume_ was brought
from Paris to Bruges, and thence, by England, to Dunfermline; the
expense of this conveyance and of many other items in connection with
the interment are to be found in the _Exchequer Rolls_, vol. i.

318 _To schip till Berwik._ "En Escoce" (_Le Bel_, i., p. 83);
"Montrose," adds Froissart (_Lettenhove_, I., chap. xxxix.)

324 _the Grunye of Spanyhe._ Bain makes this comment, reading _Grunye_
from E. "The 'Grunye' is probably Coruna, called by sailors the
'Groyne.' Mr. Skeat's text makes the word 'grund,' taking no notice of
the other reading" (iii., p. xxxvii, note). Le Bel takes Douglas first
to Sluys in Flanders, making him hear in that port of the operations in
Spain (p. 84). In Sluys, he says, he hoped to meet with some going to
Jerusalem (p. 83).

326 _Sebell the Graunt._ Seville the Grand, on the Guadalquiver. "First
at the port of Valence (Valentia) la Grande" (_Le Bel_, 84). Seville
was then the base of operations against the Moors.

336-7 _a fair company, And gold eneuch._ According to Le Bel,
Douglas had with him the knight-banneret and six others of the most
distinguished men of his country. His plate was of silver (and gold,
adds Froissart), and all of his own rank who visited him at Sluys
were treated to two kinds of wine and two kinds of spices (ch. xvi.;
_Johnes_, i., ch. xx.).

338 _The Kyng._ Alphonso XI. of Castile and Leon, to whom Douglas had
been commended by Edward III.; see note on 190. There was another
Alphonso, IV. of Arragon, but he gave no assistance on this occasion
(_Mariana_, _Bk._ xv., ch. x., p. 255).

361 _The Inglis knychtis._ Prussia and Spain were the favourite resorts
of English knights anxious to war against the infidels. Chaucer's
knight had been in both countries on this errand (_Prologue_, 53-56).

393 _Balmeryne._ A Moorish kingdom in Africa; or, more correctly, of
the reigning dynasty, the Banu-Marin. In Chaucer's _Prologue_ it is
"Belmarye" (line 57); in _Froissart_ the name appears more correctly as
Bellemarie (_Johnes_, ii., p. 484; _Letten._, I., p. 121, chap. xxxix.).

401 _The vaward._ In Le Bel (_Froissart_) Douglas betakes himself to
one of the wings "the better to do his business and display his power"
(_son effort_, p. 84).

402 _the strangeris with him weir._ So we gather also from Baker, whose
informant served under Douglas. _Cf._ note on 167.

403 _mastir of Saint Jak._ The Master, or head, of the Order of St.
James.

407 _To mete their fayis._ On March 25, 1330, at _Tebas de Hardales_, a
strong town in Granada (_Mariana_, _Bk._ xv., ch. x., p. 255). Fordun,
however, dates the battle August 25 (cxliv.).

*421-32 _Bot ere they joyned, etc._ See on these lines _Appendix_ D.

431 _So fer chassit._ The account in _Le Bel_ is to the effect that
Douglas attacked prematurely, thinking that Alphonso was about to
do so, and that he was being followed up. But Alphonso did not move
for the reason, we learn from _Mariana_, that the frontal attack of
Moorish cavalry was but a feint, and that the real attack, as the King
said, was to be in the rear on the Christian camp (_Le Bel_, p. 84;
_Mariana_, as cited). Alphonso was better acquainted than Douglas with
the Moorish methods of fighting. Fordun's narrative is that Douglas
and his company were cut off by an ambuscade which, though superior in
numbers, they readily attacked (_Gesta Annalia_, cxliv.).

440 _That relyit._ _I.e._, the Moors rallied. It was their usual
tactics to attempt to draw after them a body of the enemy in pursuit,
and then surround the pursuers.

467 _ilkane war slayn thar._ "Not a single one of them escaped, but
they were all slain" (_Le Bel_, p. 84).

521 _the leill Fabricius._ Roman consul, 278 B.C. A traitor offered
to poison Pyrrhus, but the Roman refused the proposal, and sent
information to Pyrrhus (_Plutarch_).

585 _the kirk of Dowglas._ St. Brides, Douglas.

587 _Schir Archibald his sone._ Skeat, in his note on this passage, is
all astray. He says that Douglas was never married, that he left only a
natural son William, and that this Archibald was his third or youngest
brother. But Sir William Fraser is of opinion that Sir James was
married, though Sir Herbert Maxwell doubts, and certainly no record of
it survives; but he was succeeded in the estates by William, while his
brother Archibald "Tineman" (Loser) was killed at Halidon Hill in 1333.
He, however, had another son, certainly illegitimate, the Archibald
referred to here, who succeeded in 1388 as third Earl of Douglas, and
died, after a varied career, in 1400 (Fraser's _Douglas Book_, I.,
188-9; _Scalacronica_; Maxwell's _History of the House of Douglas_, i.,
p. 67 and 114-124; _Acts Parl._, i. 193-4; _Reg. Mag. Sig._, i., p.
177). Archibald was known as "the Grim." Mr. Brown cites Fraser to the
effect that Archibald erected the tomb "probably about the year 1390,
after his succession as third Earl of Douglas" (_Douglas Book_, I., p.
181); and adds the proposition that he could not have done so before
his succession, because, according to the _Book of Pluscarden_ (1462),
his friends "held him in small account because he was a bastard,"
and because his succession to the estates was disputed (_Acts Parl.
Scot._, i., p. 194; _The Wallace and Bruce_, pp. 154-5). Mr. Brown's
contention, therefore, is that the statement in the text could not
have been penned by Barbour in 1375, and that it is not due to him,
but to his redactor. The reasoning is not all conclusive; against the
plain statement of Barbour there is only an assumption on Fraser's
part, and inferences on the part of Mr. Brown which are not necessarily
contained in his premisses. Archibald was, no doubt, only a child when
his father was killed; but he became Lord of Galloway in 1369, and Earl
of Wigtown in 1372. What was there to prevent his erecting a tomb for
his distinguished father, except a delicacy of feeling on the side of
the "legitimates," which is rather modern than late mediaeval? Archibald
bought his earldom, built and endowed a hospital near Dumfries, erected
Thrieve Castle, and had extensive lands in various parts of Scotland,
so that he must have been a man of considerable wealth, besides being,
as Warden, the most important figure on the Border. Who or what was
then to prevent him honouring the congenial memory of his great father
before 1375-6?

600 _Melros._ _Cf._ note on 191-2.

604 _And held the pure weill to warrand._ _I.e._, "And carefully
guarded or looked after the interests of the poor."

609 _poysonyt was he._ Moray died at Musselburgh, July 20, 1332. Fordun
says nothing of poisoning (_Gesta Annalia_, cxlvi.). But there appears
to have been a popular story to this effect, to which, later, was added
the detail that his poisoner was an English monk (_Scotichr._, ii.,
lib. xiii., ch. xix.). Moray died of the stone from which he suffered
towards the close of his life; the rest Hailes considered "a silly
popular tale" (_Annals_, vol. iii., App. 2).

APPENDIX A

THE SITE OF THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN


It will be noticed that the conception of this battle, alike as to
position and tactics, elaborated in the notes in strict conformity
with Barbour, differs entirely from that now universally accepted. The
engagements of the first day (Sunday) were the outcome of attempts
to clear the two paths of approach to Stirling--that through the New
Park, and the other on the level below St. Ninians. Both failed,
and the means by which their failure was brought about determined
the operations of the following day (Monday). This main engagement,
however, it has been hitherto held, took place on the banks of the
Burn, below or in the neighbourhood of Brock's Brae, with the Burn
separating the forces. This is pure misconception. There can be no
doubt that the battle was fought on a position roughly at right angles
to this--on "the playne," "the hard feld," or level ground east of
St. Ninians, reaching back into the angle formed by the Forth and the
Bannock. The main data for such a conclusion are these: (1) The English
passed the night on the Carse, having crossed the Bannock; (2) the
Scots _attacked_ early next morning, and to do this "tuk the playne,"
leaving their camp-followers in the Park, so that they astonished the
English by their audacity; (3) in the rout many English were drowned
in the Forth and in the Bannock; (4) Edward II., unable to get away,
fled to the castle; (5) so did many of his men, as the castle "_wes
ner_." These facts, fully substantiated from both sides, are wholly
inconsistent with a site of battle south of St. Ninians, and fix its
position between the Forth and the Bannock. Barbour's "pools" are the
"polles" in which, according to Hemingburgh,[57] the English baggage was
bogged and captured after the battle of Stirling Bridge. The English
and French (and Irish) chroniclers invariably speak of the battle as
that of "Stirling," and Trokelowe calls it the Battle of _Bannockmoor_.
For a full discussion of the matter, see my paper on "The Real
Bannockburn" in _Proceedings of the Glasgow Archaeological Society_,
1908-1909.

APPENDIX B

BRUCE'S SPEECH AT BANNOCKBURN

BOOK XII. 210-327


It is the privilege of early historians to equip their leading
personages with speeches, and in its pertinent, practical character
the speech here provided for King Robert is a good example of such--so
good, indeed, as to suggest the probability that Barbour is working up
some transmitted material. There is on record another speech attributed
to Bruce, which formed part of a Latin poem on Bannockburn by Abbot
Bernard of Arbroath, Bruce's Chancellor, portions of which are quoted
in the _Scotichronicon_.[58] This speech consists of twenty-five
hexameter lines, and is a rhetorical flourish on Scottish liberty,
the miseries inflicted by the English on the country, and the hapless
condition of "mother Church," closing in strains of ecclesiastical
exhortation. Moreover, it immediately precedes the opening of the
battle, while Barbour's version is of the evening before. In the latter
a special interest attaches to lines 263-268 and 303-317, which may
be compared with the following extracts from a speech by Alexander
the Great in _The Vowes_, one of the three romances which make up the
Scottish _Buik of Alexander_, the translation of which from the French
was probably the work of Barbour himself.[59] Alexander says:

  "Be thay assailyeit hardely,
  And encountered egerly,
  The formest cumis ye sall se,
  The hindmest sall abased be.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Forthy I pray ilk man that he
  Nocht covetous na yarnand be,
  To tak na ryches that thay wald,
  Bot wyn of deidly fais the fald;
  Fra thay be winnin all wit ye weill
  The gudis are ouris ever ilk deill;
  And I quyteclame yow utrely
  Baith gold and silver halely,
  And all the riches that thaires is,
  The honour will I have I wis."[60]

[58] Lib. xii., chap. xxi.

[59] See Appendix E.

[60] P. 318.

To the same purport as these latter lines is a portion of a subsequent
address;[61] and lines 325, 334 find a similar parallel in:

  "Thus armit all the nicht thay lay,
  Quhile on the morne that it was day."[62]

Of the cardinal sentiment in the speech, the origin is probably to be
found in the familiar story of the Maccabees, referred to more than
once in _The Bruce_. Judas Maccabeus was one of the typical heroes of
French romance, and had one metrical romance, at least, devoted to his
career. And in 1 Maccabees, chap. iv., we have:

"17. (Judas) said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoils, inasmuch
as there is a battle before us.

"18. And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain; but stand
ye now against our enemies, and overcome them, and after this ye may
boldly take the spoils."[63]

APPENDIX C

THE NUMBERS AT BANNOCKBURN


ENGLISH: _One hundred thousand men and ma._

SCOTS: _Thretty thousand, and sum deill mare._

These figures have given rise to much discussion, without any very
certain result. Yet official data are not wanting--sufficient, at
least, to check what is only another example of the wild conjectures
of mediaeval chroniclers when dealing with numbers. Hemingburgh gives
Wallace at Falkirk "about three hundred thousand men"[64]--rather more,
probably, than the whole male population of Scotland. We need not be
surprised, then, at how all such estimates shrink in the cold light of
Exchequer figures.

[64] II. p. 180.

Edward II. summoned all owing him military service,[65] which
corroborates the statement of the author of the _Vita Edw. Sec._ that
"the King exacted from all the service due,"[66] as well as that of
Barbour--"of England hale the chivalry." The Earls of Lancaster,
Warenne, Arundel, and Warwick did not attend, for a particular reason,
but sent their contingents.[67] Now, by Mr. Round's calculations, the
whole number of knights' fees in England did not exceed 5,000;[68] Mr.
Morris raises the figure to something short of 7,000.[69] The important
point is, however, that in practice the assessment was only a nominal
or conventional one. Thus Gloucester, with 455 fees, was assessed at
ten knights.[70] Including all grades of horsemen, Mr. Morris puts
"the maximum of the cavalry arm" at "about 8,000"; but, all things
considered, no such number could ever take the field.[71] Edward I. had
summoned his full feudal array (_omnes sui fideles_) for the Falkirk
campaign, and Hemingburgh says that, when counted, it came to 3,000 men
on armoured horses (Barbour's "helit hors"), and more than 4,000 on
unarmoured horses--say, roughly, 7,000 in all.[72] Mr. Morris, however,
by a generous calculation from the rolls, arrives at 2,400 as the
highest possible figure.[73] Now, it is to be noted that the author of
the _Vita Edw. Sec._, while lauding the size and magnificence of the
host that went to Bannockburn, gives 2,000 men-at-arms as apparently
the total of the cavalry, since he simply adds "a considerable body
of footmen."[74] On the whole, 3,000 to 4,000 English horse is a
higher limit for Bannockburn, when we consider all the difficulties
of sufficient armour, remounts, and forage. Mr. Morris thinks 10,000
"impossible," though he is here calculating on yards of frontage on a
site where the battle was not fought.[75] About 7,000 is Mr. Round's
free estimate, adopting Hemingburgh's figure for Falkirk.[76] Bain
accepts Barbour's 3,000 heavy horsemen, and suggests 10,000 light
horse, but proceeds on no data.[77] Mr. Oman calculates that "three
thousand 'equites coperti,' men-at-arms on barded horses," means,
probably, 10,000 for the whole cavalry,[78] but this traverses his
Falkirk figures. England never put, nor could maintain, on the field
such a mounted force, to say nothing of the difficulty of handling and
manoeuvring it.

For the foot we have, fortunately, exact figures in the
_Foedera_[79]--21,540 men all told, which would include the archers.
Only the northern counties--but not all--and Wales are drawn upon, as
those of the south would be for a French campaign.[80] Such had been
the practice of Edward I., whose levies from the northern counties
and Wales ranged from 29,400 foot in 1297 to 12,000 in 1301.[81] Mr.
Morris contends that not till 1322 were infantry drawn from all England
for a Scottish campaign (_as cited_), but in this he is wrong. It was
done by a special vote of Parliament, and according to a prescribed
form, as early as March, 1316, when every township, with some special
exceptions, furnished one soldier,[82] and again in 1318.[83] These are
clearly new and special arrangements, and there is thus no reason to
believe that the list in _Foedera_, etc., is not complete, as Mr. Oman
suggests, adding, accordingly, a southern contingent of about 30,000
men, though he doubts if "the extreme South" sent its full muster.[84]
This is quite gratuitous. Lord Hailes, too, contended that the official
records are imperfect, and that the numbers given by Barbour "are
within the limits of probability."[85] Bain's authoritative reply is
that, "as a rule, the writs were always enrolled, and the Patent Rolls
of the time are not defective."[86] This, however, is not always true,
and Bain, applying this principle absolutely, is once, at least, led to
a wrong conclusion.[87]

An important question now suggests itself, but no one has so far raised
it: did the levies in these full numbers turn up? They are allotted
in round figures: what proportion was actually furnished? That there
would be some trouble in securing the conscripts is anticipated and
provided for in severe measures for the contumacious.[88] This was
usual, and even the strong hand of Edward I. could not prevent men
from deserting after they had received their wages.[89] Here we have,
also, a sufficient basis for an estimate. On May 12, 1301, Edward I.
summoned for midsummer 12,000 men from nine of the counties included
in the Bannockburn levy--York, as in that case, being assessed at
4,000.[90] On July 12 we have the numbers from these counties as they
appear on the pay-roll, when it is stated that they had contributed
in proportions which give only 5,501 all told; York having sent only
1,193, and Northumberland, assessed at 2,700, providing the largest
proportion--2,019.[91] The numbers vary slightly on other days, but
seem never to have exceeded, if they reached, 50 per cent. of the
nominal levy. Mr. Morris works out the same result for the Caerlaverock
Campaign of 1300.[92] There are no grounds for assuming that things
went differently in 1314, and thus over 21,540 men are reduced by
about half. It is quite a fair conclusion that not more than 12,000
English foot--which exceeds the proportion above--were actually present
at Bannockburn.

For the foreign contingents no figures exist. Bain thinks they were
not "more than a few thousands."[93] The Gascon corps in the Falkirk
army should have been 106 mounted men.[94] The Hainault and Flanders
auxiliaries who shared in the campaign of 1327 amounted to 550
men-at-arms, and were an expensive item.[95] The Irish contingent which
came to Edward I. in 1304 amounted at most, for a few weeks only, to
3,500 men,[96] but to merely 361 in the army of 1300.[97]

I would suggest, therefore, for the English army the following
round numbers: 3,000 to 4,000 horse of all sorts, 12,000 English
and Welsh foot, 3,000 (?) Irish, 1,500 (?) foreigners, or, in a
lump sum, 20,000 men of all arms, to which must be added a crowd of
non-combatants--servants, traders, and camp-followers generally. Bain
(as cited) proposes 50,000; Round, 30,000; Oman, 60,000 to 70,000.
I consider 18,000 to 20,000 the most probable range. With even the
lower of these numbers, the English commanders in organization and
commissariat would have rather more than they could manage.

Barbour's figure for the Scottish army must be similarly reduced. More
than 30,000 would be a huge proportion of the Scottish population
of that time, especially as the whole does not seem to have been
drawn upon, and of that, as Barbour insists, a good many were still
hostile.[98] William the Lion was credited in 1173 with a national
host of 1,000 armoured horsemen, and 30,000 unarmoured footmen,[99]
and the latter unit is surely over the score. At Halidon Hill, 1333,
the Scots are said to have had 1,174 knights and men-at-arms and
13,500 light-armed men or foot;[100] and this chronicler consistently
exaggerates. Yet these figures represent a united kingdom. Forty
thousand at Bannockburn is the estimate for the Scots of the _Vita
Edw._ writer, but the English writers, on their side, grossly overstate
the numbers of the enemy, as witness what is said of Hemingburgh above.
Bain's figure of 15,000 to 16,000 is no doubt nearer the mark; "perhaps
twenty-five thousand men in all" is Mr. Oman's conjecture.[101] Possibly
6,000 to 7,000 is as near as we can go, adopting Barbour's ratio, which
gives a proportion of 1 to 3 of the English army. The non-combatants
here, too, would be numerous. Up to this time Bruce's men in the field
could be numbered only in hundreds, so that as many thousands would
represent a very special effort. And note that after Murray's success
over Clifford nearly the whole Scots army gathered round him to see him
and do him honour--a fact which is suggestive[102] as to its size.

APPENDIX D

THE THROWING OF THE HEART

BOOK XX. *421-*432


These lines are found only in Hart's printed edition. Pinkerton
thought there was "no reason to view them as an interpolation," and
Jamieson regarded their agreement with the account in the _Howlat_[103]
"a strong presumption of authenticity." By Skeat they were at first
accepted as genuine, but afterwards, influenced by the reasoning on
Barbour's rhymes of P. Buss in _Anglia_,[104] he surrendered them as an
interpolation. In the passage of twelve lines three rhymes occur, which
are unusual--more strongly, impossible--for Barbour on the basis of
his admitted work. These are _battell--tell_, _to be--de_, _ho--to_.
In the first case, Barbour, it is claimed, elsewhere always uses the
"liquid" form _bataill_ (_battalyhe_) to rhyme with another word of
the same character as _assaile_ or _travaill_ (_travailyhe_).[105] In
the second, he "never rhymes _be_ with _de_ (correctly _dey_)," as
Skeat puts it, for _de_ (Icel. _deyja_) was still influenced by the
terminal semi-guttural, giving it an "impure" sound, whereas "be,"
with no ghostly after-sound, is quite "pure." The final example brings
together two different values of "o," and, it may be added, in the four
cases in which Barbour uses the word, it is in the form _hoyne_.[106]
These rhyme-tests had also been applied to the same result by Mr. W. A.
Craigie.[107]

[103] See below.

[107] _Scottish Review_, 1893, p. 192 note.

With this conclusion Mr. Brown agrees, "although on slightly different
grounds."[108] Hart's edition, of course, takes a place in his general
scheme of redaction. But he would "hesitate to reject the lines
on the rimes alone," and "The _be, de_ test" seems to him "quite
untrustworthy."[109] Skeat thinks it unanswerable.[110] Mr. Neilson
pleads "that this canon begs the whole question of the text of the
Bruce ... first you find your canon; then you edit out of your text
all that is disconform."[111] Arguing specially on its application to
_The Legends of the Saints_, he points out that "There are not a few
metrical and other solecisms in the Bruce," and that the "exceptional
_e_-rhyme" is the stamp of transition.[112] It is to be observed
also that Chaucer, Barbour's contemporary, and more careful in such
matters than he, rhymes _ho, y-do_ in the _Knight's Tale_.[113] In the
_Alexander_ occurs the _tell--battell_ rhyme.[114] On the whole, the
test is perhaps not so conclusive--out of Germany--as Skeat imagines.
Further, from the indubitable reference in the _Howlat_ to the _Bruce_,
Neilson accepts the latter as the sole source of its digression, and
the lines as therefore authentic.[115]

If, however, what has already been said of the passages from Hart
hold good,[116] then this one must go with the rest. Fortunately, in
this specific case that argument can be greatly strengthened, for the
lines have never been tried by their relation to the context and their
historic implications, and that obvious and indisputable test puts the
question beyond doubt. They have but an outside connection with the
narrative of Barbour, and otherwise are in flat contradiction thereto.
So much is at once evident from the closing couplet:

  "And took it up in gret daintie;
  And _ever in field_ this used he."

[116] _Pref._, pp. vi-viii.

It is a series of performances of this kind that is contemplated, not
a single example, which is all that Barbour's account gives room for.
Douglas is credited with a habit of this sort, "ever in field"; while
Barbour, like Froissart, knows of only one battle in which Douglas
fought while bearing the heart of Bruce.[117] Nor is Barbour likely to
have omitted such a "point of chivalry" on the part of his twin hero,
had a valid tradition of it existed in his day.

[117] _Cf._ notes on Book XX. 393, 431.

The problem becomes clearer when we consider alternative and later
accounts of the expedition of Douglas, for which see note on Book
XX. 191, 192. Evidently the idea of his going to the Holy Land, as
Froissart explains the commission,[118] and as it occurs in Bower, gave
an opening for embellishment, which expands in the hands of Boece to
the extent of thirteen victories achieved by Douglas over the Turks!
This, however, is only to give more precision to a composite account
contained in the _Buke of the Howlat_ of the middle of the fifteenth
century, a poem written in glorification of the Douglases. The author,
supposed to be Richard Holland, speaks of the great friendship Bruce
had for Douglas: "Reid the writ of thar work to your witness"[119]--a
clear reference to the _Bruce_, especially as in xxxv. and xxxvi. he
paraphrases the reply of Douglas to the King in Book XX. 223, 234.
Thereafter, however, he strikes off from Barbour. Douglas goes to "the
haly graif," where--

[118] In part; but see the reconciling passage in note on xx. 191-2.

[119] Stanza xxxi.

  "XXXVII.

  "He gart hallowe the hart, and syne couth it hyng
  About his hals[120] (neck) full hende (respectfully), and on his
        awne hart."

[120] But _cf._ xx. 307, where this comes before.

The story then proceeds:

  "XXXVIII.

  "Now bot I semble for thi saull with Sarasenis mycht,
  Sall I never sene be into Scotland!"

An extension of the original commission, be it noted, and a motive for
what follows:

  "Thus in defence of the faith he fure to the fecht
  With knychtis of Cristindome to kepe his command.
  And quhen _the batallis_ so brym, brathly and bricht,
  War _joyned_ thraly in thrang, mony thousand,
  Amang the hethin men the hert hardely he slang,
  Said: 'Wend on as thou was wont,
  Throw the _batell_ in bront,
  Ay formast in the front,
  Thy fays amang;'


  "XXXIX.

  "'And I sall followe the in faith, or feye to be fellit,--
  As thi lege man leill, my lyking thow art.'

         *       *       *       *       *

  Thus frayis he the fals folk, trewly to tell it,
  _Aye quhile he coverit_ (recovered) _and come to the Kingis hart,
  Thus feile feildis he wan, aye worschipand it_,
  Throwout Cristindome kid (known)
  War the dedis that he did,
  Till on a time it betid
  As tellis the writ."[121]

[121] _Cf._ also xlii.

So we go back to Barbour ("the writ"), but in the final scene there is
no mention of throwing the heart, any more than in the genuine _Bruce_,
though it is stated that "His hardy men tuk the hart syne upon
hand."[122]

[122] XLI. _Cf._ _Bruce_, xx. 486, 487.

Obviously we have in these stanzas, and especially in the words
underlined, the source of the lines in the _Bruce_, which are further
in express contradiction to Barbour's narrative, and have no place
in it. The threefold argument leads inevitably to the one conclusion
that these lines are an interpolation, and, as a corollary, that their
source is the _Howlat_. Mr. Amours, in editing that poem,[123] has gone
so far as to say that this is "almost certain." I would remove the
qualification.[124]

APPENDIX E

THE "ALEXANDER" AND THE "BRUCE"


_The Buik of the Most Noble and Vailyeand Conquerour, Alexander the
Great_ is an anonymous Scots translation of three French romances in
the Alexander cycle, dated, in a rhyming colophon, 1438, and published
for the Bannatyne Club in 1831. Between this translation and the
_Bruce_ there is a remarkably intimate and undisguised connection, not
only in spirit and method, but in "the diction as a whole, the choice
of words and the arrangement of the sentences, (and) the abundant
use of alliteration," to such an extent that "in reading the _Buik
of Alexander_ one would often think that he discerned the singer of
the _Bruce_."[125] A few examples have been given in the notes, but for
a full survey of this literary phenomenon the reader must go to the
dissertation quoted from above, or to Mr. J. T. T. Brown's _The Wallace
and the Bruce Restudied_, pp. 100-112 (Bonn, 1900), or Mr. Neilson's
_John Barbour, Poet and Translator_ (London, 1900), which is devoted
to the subject; or, for the parallels in the Bannockburn account, to
Mr. Neilson's article on Barbour in Chambers's _Cyclopaedia of English
Literature_, vol. i.

[125] _Untersuchungen ueber das schottische Alexanderbuch._ Albert
Hermann, Halle, 1893, pp. 26, 27.

On the facts there is no dispute; for explanation three hypotheses
have been put forward. Hermann, accepting the 1438 date, concludes
that the translator of the _Alexander_ was so familiar with the
language of the _Bruce_--"here and there, indeed, knew it by heart"
(_stellenweise es wohl auswendig wusste_)--that his translation was
necessarily strongly influenced thereby.[126] This is inadmissible; the
French poems are earlier than the _Bruce_, and to these the links of
connection ultimately go back. The relationship is really deeper than
the mere language of the translation, as Hermann himself indicates.
Mr. Neilson, accordingly, in a detailed and forcible argument, claims
Barbour himself as the translator of the _Alexander_, arguing that,
the literary proofs being so conclusive, the date given must be an
error, "scribal or printer's."[127] Given Roman numerals to begin with,
such a slip is not in the least unlikely; variations of this sort
occur in the _Bruce_ itself,[128] and 1438 may have been a misreading of
1338, or the date may be that of the scribe's copy, not of the actual
work. Mr. Neilson has an ingenious section on the wayward fortunes of
dates.[129] Thus, reversing Hermann's thesis, he holds that "Barbour's
mind and memory had been steeped in the _Alexander_ when he wrote the
_Bruce_."[130] Mr. Neilson's argument and conclusion are vigorously
contested by Mr. Brown in a _Postscript_ to the work cited. His more
elaborate hypothesis is that David Rate translated the _Alexander_ in
1437, and that "John Ramsay, Sir John the Ross, wishful to improve the
plain song of John Barbour, used the translation of the _Alexander_
extensively, taking freely whatever he required."[131] Mr. Brown's
negative criticism is independent of this proposition which is involved
in his wider theory regarding the construction of the _Bruce_. The
eclectic conclusion of the writer in the _Cambridge History of English
Literature_, vol. ii., is: "Either the book (_i.e._, the _Alexander_)
is the work of Barbour preserved in a somewhat later form, or the
author was saturated with Barbour's diction, so that he continually
repeats his phrases."[132]

In the dust of the conflict a crucial fact has gone unobserved--namely,
that one of the parallel lines enumerated by Brown and Hermann
appears in the portion of the _Bruce_ incorporated in his own work by
Wyntoun.[133] _Here, then, we have a line of the alleged translation of
1438 occurring in the "Bruce" as it existed before 1420._ Thus the only
outstanding difficulty of Mr. Neilson's proposition disappears. The
effect on the rival propositions is obvious.

APPENDIX F

MR. BROWN'S "SOURCES" FOR THE "BRUCE."


In pursuance of his "hypothesis of fifteenth-century redaction" of the
_Bruce_, Mr. Brown applies what he claims to be "fair and ordinary
tests" to six "selected examples," in order to show that his hypothesis
"has a basis in demonstrable fact."[134] I shall notice such of these
very briefly, premising that I do not consider Mr. Brown's use of his
tests either "fair" or "ordinary." So much, I think, will appear.

[134] _The Wallace and The Bruce Restudied_, p. 92.

1. _The Trojan War_, _Alexander the Great_, _Julius Caesar_, and _King
Arthur_.

(_a_) The only thing urged against the _Trojan War_ passage[135] is
that it is in the suspicious company of the others, and these, Mr.
Brown suggests, are derived from Chaucer's _Monk's Tale_, from which
he produces a selection of lines to parallel those in the _Bruce_. It
may be urged,[136] at the outset, that two contemporary poets dealing
with the same set of historical events are very likely to display
similarities. As Chaucer himself begins by saying--

  "The storie of Alisaundre is so commune,
  That every wight that hath discrecioune
  Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune."

[135] I. 521-8.

[136] _Bruce_, I. 529-548; _Monk's Tale_, Group B., 3821-3908.

But even in Mr. Brown's "selected" lines it is the divergencies
rather than the similarities that stand out. Chaucer says nothing
of "Babilony's tour"; "his awyne hows" is no parallel to "of thyne
owne folk"; and "Bot, ar he deit, his land delt he" has no equivalent
whatsoever in the _Monk's Tale_. Yet Chaucer has forty lines to
Barbour's eight. In fact, the "example" is a stock one, even to its
phraseology, as witness these excerpts from sources half a century and
more earlier than either poet: _Commendatio Lamentabilis_ on Edward I.
in 1307, "magnus Alexander ... Nam ille annos regnans duodecim veneno
hausto vita defungitur (15); _Vita Edwardi Sec._ (c. 1326). Sed ille
magnus Graecorum imperator Alexander, _totius orbis domitor, cum cunctas
nationes orbis subicit, per familiares proditores toxicatus occubuit_."
Do such close parallels prove that either Barbour or Chaucer borrowed
from chronicles which they never saw?

(_b_) Mr. Brown argues that the _Julius Caesar_ parallels are "not
less remarkable for significant agreement, as regards the sequence of
the narrative,"[137] and that "so far as concerns the diction it (the
_Bruce_ passage) approaches even nearer the Chaucerian original."[138]
But where Chaucer speaks of Caesar conquering "thoccident" and "the
orient," Barbour enumerates the countries. Is this similarity of
diction? According to Mr. Brown, he is giving "simply an expansion
of the Chaucerian phrases."[139] Elsewhere, in such a case, Barbour is
convicted of "summarising" or "assimilating," here of "expanding." This
is Mr. Brown's "fork" from which no author could escape. In twelve
lines Barbour comments on Caesar's conquests, his imperial position,
and his death, and in forty-eight Chaucer gives a detailed biography
introducing Pompey, of whom Barbour says nothing, and Barbour is
thereupon charged with following "the sequence of the narrative"--as if
he could avoid doing so! That Caesar by both poets is styled "Emperor"
goes for nothing; that was the medieval way; as also was the statement
that he was killed in "the Capitol," as Shakespeare, too, believed. But
the most striking note of difference remains. Barbour says of Caesar--

  "Hys eyn with his hand closit he,
  For to dey with mar honeste."[140]

[137] P. 98.

[138] P. 99.

[139] P. 97, note.

[140] I. 548, 549.

Now Chaucer remarks: "Of honestee yet had he remembrance,"[141] and Mr.
Brown enrols the word "honestee" among the things "not to be explained
either as commonplaces or as mere coincidences."[142] We see Barbour's
idea of his "honeste"; this is Chaucer's:

  "His mantel over his hypes casteth he
  For no man sholde seen his privetee."[143]

[141] 3908.

[142] P. 99.

[143] 3904-5.

Mr. Brown here seems to have followed Caesar's example and "closit hys
eyn"!

(_c_) The only point made with regard to the _Arthur_ lines[144] is the
calling of Lucius "Emperor," and regarding this see my note on the
passage. Geoffrey of Monmouth does the same. That Wyntoun corrects
Huchown, and not Barbour, in this usage--well, Mr. Brown can make all
he can of that. Barbour's dozen lines on the familiar _Arthur_ story is
charged with being "an excellent summary of the _Morte Arthure_,"[145] a
poem of 4,364 lines! No "expansion" here!

[144] I. 549-561.

[145] P. 99.

2. The _Alexander_ allusions in Bks. III., X. With reference to these
see Appendix E. But why should Mr. Brown speak of "the famous grey
palfrey of Lord Douglas" on the strength of one notice in Bk. II. 118?
There is nothing to justify the epithet "famous"; and _Ferrand_ was no
more an unusual name for a "grey" horse than _Blanchard_ for a white
one. Bishop Lamberton might have had "a grey" as well as Eumynedus.[146]

[146] See note on passage.

3. _The Ferumbras Romance._ I have analyzed this passage in my notes
to Bk. III., 435-462. Mr. Brown contends that the adoption of the
form _Ferumbras_ for the French _Fierabras_ "points to a knowledge
on the part of the Scottish poet" of either the _Syr Ferumbras_ or
the _Sowdone of Babylone_, in both of which this form occurs. It is
possibly an adaptation of the spelling _Fierenbras_, which occurs in
_The Destruction of Rome_ and also in a fragment of the romance.[147]
But there is nothing more remarkable in Barbour's intrusion of the
"m" here than in his calling Lubaut or Lybaut, _Lumbard_ in Bk. X.
324,[148] or Capaneus, _Campaneus_.[149] More significant is the name
_Lavyne_ for _Balan_, which is the normal form for all the existing
texts, French and English, save the _Sowdone_, where we have _Laban_,
_Lavane_ and _Lavyne_, and _The Destruction of Rome_ (French), which
has _Balan_ and _Laban_, the latter of which has given the spelling
in "v." Mr. Brown, however, rules out the _Destruction_ for Barbour,
as being "merely related to the Charlemagne cycle,"[150] though
Dr. Hausknecht accepts it as the original of the first part of the
_Sowdone_.[151] Why, then, should Barbour, too, not have known it?
Mr. Brown's conclusion is that the name, with other material, points
to the whole passage being based on the _Sowdone_, and the _Sowdone_
being post-Chaucerian--in which opinion he follows, and even goes
beyond, Hausknecht--of the beginning of the fifteenth century, after
Barbour's death, it obviously follows that the lines cannot have been
his work.[152] Against this may be put Hausknecht's own conclusion,
to which Mr. Brown makes no reference: "It is worthy of notice that
the account of the Fierabras romance, as given by Barbour, may be
considered, on the whole, as identical with the subject of the French
_Fierabras_ or the English _Syr Ferumbras_, _but not with the_
_Sowdan_, as there is no mention made of the combat before Rome, nor
any trace of what makes up the first part of the _Sowdan_."[153] A few
additional facts will substantiate Hausknecht's statement.

[151] As cited, p. xxv.

[152] Pp. 115, 116.

[153] P. ix, note. The italics are mine.

In the _Sowdone_ the twelve peers are shut up in "Egrymor"; Barbour
gives "bot eleven."[154] Mr. Brown says of the _Bruce_ account that,
"Every line is traceable in the _Sowdone_."[155] There is no trace of
line 452, or of Lavyne's "flot" in 456; Charlemagne, instead of "being
joyful" at the news that his peers were alive, there bursts out in
anger against the traitor Ganelon.[156] Conclusive, on Mr. Brown's own
case, is the fact, noted by Hausknecht, that the relics mentioned
by Barbour "differ from all other versions."[157] It is not "off the
croice a gret party"[158] in the _Sowdone_, but simply "the crosse,
the crown, the nailes bente";[159] and there is no mention of "the
sper."[160] Nothing is said of the cross in the _Fierabras_ or the _Syr
Ferumbras_, and the _Destruction_ has the crown of thorns, the cross,
the nails, and the "signe"[161] or shroud. Nor did Barbour invent "the
sper," for it is spoken of in this connection, though not in the final
distribution, in the Provencal version of the _Fierabras_: "_e del fer
d'una lansa_," the spear-head.[162] It would seem, then, that Barbour
was using a version of the romance different, in certain particulars,
from any we now possess. At any rate, Mr. Brown has to get round these
awkward corners before he can transfix Barbour on _Lavyne_.

4. _The Tydeus Episode_, Bk. VI. 179-268. It may be granted that
Barbour here is not, as Skeat supposed, drawing directly on the
_Thebaid_ of Statius, even in memory. But then no more is Lydgate in
his _Story of Thebes_;[163] having used, according to Dr. Koeppel,
some French prose epic based on the classical story,[164] now lost,
or giving in his poem "a transcript from a French rendering of
Statius."[165] There was ample material, including even, as Gaston
Paris has suggested, an abridgment of Statius in Latin prose. Mr.
Brown contends that Barbour's "redactor" borrowed from Lydgate. But
here, again, the differences are sufficiently vital to thwart such a
conclusion. "Betwix ane hye crag and the se"[166] has no equivalent
either in Statius or Lydgate, as is clear from Mr. Brown's own
citations;[167] nor has the detail that the "gret stane ... throu the
gret anciente, Wes lowsyt reddy for to fall,"[168] for which Lydgate
has:

  "Beside he saw with water turned down
  An huge stone, large, round, and square."[169]

In an inductive literary argument differences must be accounted for
as well as similarities, and any other possible sources must be
satisfactorily eliminated. Opinions as to "the classical parsimony of
independent translators"[170] are purely speculative.

[170] P. 119.

5. _The Hannibal lines_, Bk. III. 207-248.--Here Mr. Brown's argument
needs only to be summarily stated to show its inadequacy. Wyntoun
borrowed from Barbour in some instances, but not in this; therefore,
since there are similarities in the way the same story is told, the
_Bruce_ lines are drawn from the _Cronykil_.[171] Wyntoun confesses
to having translated from Orosius, Mr. Brown says through Martinus
Polonus, and he follows his author closely. Barbour's narrative is
brief and, in several details, faulty, in which he diverges from both
the Latin author and his Scots translator.[172] The startling error
in chronology, especially, "would not be readily made by one using
Martinus at first hand," but with the _Cronikyl_ before him the writer
was quite likely to do so![173] The peculiar "touches" in the _Bruce_
passage are noted, but unexplained. It is assumed that "The agreement
with Martinus is much too close for it to be considered to be written
from memory;"[174] and "there is nothing in Martinus that should lead us
to expect independent translators to ascribe such a victory to God and
in terms so similar:

  "Bot throw Goddis gret powste."[175]
  "Bot throw the mycht of Goddis grace."[176]

[171] P. 125.

[174] P. 126.

[175] _Wyntoun._

[176] _The Bruce, &c._, p. 126.

But the terms are not "similar," and both are a mediaeval rendering of
_divina miseratio_ in Orosius and Polonus. The whole argument in this
connection is involved and haphazard. What is there illegitimate in
the simple hypothesis that Barbour wrote from a well-stored but not
perfectly accurate memory, and that Wyntoun preferred the first-hand
to the second-hand source? So we explain both similarities and
differences. Wyntoun's lines are a plain following of his Latin author;
Barbour's a brief summary, with expansions and comments of his own
leading up to the moral he wishes to enforce; and in this case Mr.
Brown cannot point to a single line in common.

6. _Froissart and the Bruce._--Here Mr. Brown prints his parallels
in full, and the matter can be safely left to the judgment of the
unprejudiced reader. It need only be remarked that Froissart (1)
calls Douglas William instead of James; (2) sends the heart to the
Holy Sepulchre[177]; (3) makes Bruce choose Douglas; (4) embarks him
at Montrose; (5) takes him to Sluys; (6) lands him at Seville: while
Barbour (1) is right as to Douglas; (2) sends the heart against
"Goddis fayis"; (3) makes the barons choose Douglas; (4) embarks him
at Berwick; (5) says nothing of Sluys; and (6) lands him at Valentia.
Of Barbour's "motive" lines, of the repentance for blood-spilling and
the saving of his sins,[178] Froissart (or Le Bel) has no trace. The two
narratives are independent, though, in their trend, alike.

APPENDIX G

LANGUAGE AND ORTHOGRAPHY


The language of the _Bruce_ is Northern English, the dialect spoken
north of the Humber. Barbour himself calls it "Inglis" (Bk. IV. 253),
and Scottish writers down to the sixteenth century do the same. The
name "Scots" is therefore a term of pure convenience, signifying
the English spoken within the political borders of Scotland, which
continued to be an independent literary medium after the Northern
English of England had ceased to be such, and had yielded place to the
standard dialect of Chaucer and his successors. But the language of the
Aberdeen Barbour is substantially that of the Yorkshire Richard Rolle.

The most obvious characteristic of the northern tongue is that in
development it was far ahead of its southern contemporary, in so far as
it had absolutely got rid of inflections, not even retaining the final
_e_ which casts its shadow over Chaucer. Where the final _e_ occurs
in the _Bruce_ it is non-significant and unsounded. Like the variable
spelling, it is the result of the writing of English by scribes
accustomed to the sounds and orthography of contemporary French, which
was rich in final _e's_[179]--a process which had seriously complicated
the straightforward phonetic spelling of Old English. A peculiar
Scots fashion, however, was the representation of the long vowels by
a combination with _y_ or _i_, sometimes in addition to a final _e_,
which came to be regarded as the sign of a long vowel. Thus we have
such groups as _mar_, _mair_, _mayr_: _done_, _doyn_, _doyne_. In these
and similar cases _y_ is simply an alternative form of _i_; at first it
would be written before letters like _m_, _n_, _u_, where _i_, having
no dot, might be mistaken for a part of the succeeding letter; then in
practice the two would become interchangeable according to the caprice
of the writer. In this matter the scribe of C is rather more regular
than that of E. Now, such a diphthong as _ai_ was in time reduced to a
simple sound, when the _i_ became superfluous, and came to be looked
upon as a sign of length. With this function it was afterwards, at the
pleasure of the writer, transferred to the company of other long vowels
where there was no original diphthong. Thus we have the long vowel
sound represented in three ways--simple, with following _i_ (_y_), or
with terminal _e_. In cases like _tais_, _gais_, however, the _i_ is
part of the termination of the present tense of the verb, of which
Barbour is particularly fond.[180]

[179] Sounded as yet, like those of M.E., but in time to become silent.
Anglo-French is Norman-French developed in England; it was closely
related to Old French, familiar to the scribes through the romances.

[180] Buss, _Anglia IX._, pp. 505-507. _Cf._ also Murray, _Dialect of
the Southern Counties_, p. 53.

But while Scots--in the sense indicated above--had thus early parted
with its inflections, it was, on the other hand, more conservative
than the southern dialects in its treatment of the vowel sounds. It
retained, for example, the Old English _a_, which in Southern English
was rounded into broad _o_ (_oa_)--_cf._ _ga_, _stane_ (O.E. or A.S.
_gan_, _stan_) for _go_, _stone_. In the _Bruce_ (X. 199; XII. 299)
the rhyme _more_, _before_ may show the rounding influence of _r_.[181]
Vowels in words of French origin show slight modification. Anglo-French
nasal _a_ before _m_, _n_ tends to become _au_, whence _daunger_, etc.,
and _o_ or _u_ to become _ou_ as in _baroun_, _felloun_. _Ai_ and _ei_
incline to merge in long _e_ as _feble_ (O.F. _faible_), and _sesyt_
(O.F. _seisir_); but _ai_ may also become _a_--_e.g._, _tratour_ for
O.F. _traitor_.

[181] Buss, p. 509.

Aphaeresis occurs in such shortened forms as _stroy_ (destroy), _semble_
(assemble), etc.

The following peculiarities may be noticed among the consonants:

_ch_ sometimes = "tch" in middle and end of word--_e.g._, _fech_ =
fetch (II. 532).

_h_ is silent in _hoost_, as in all Anglo-French words of Latin origin,
and sometimes drops out--_e.g._, _ost_ (II. 559, etc., O.F. _ost_),
also in _ayris_ (heirs, V. 520).

_b_ in combination with _m_ is dropped both in pronunciation and
spelling. _Cf._ _chamyr_ (II. 97), _tumlit_ (IV. 182, etc.). C _Hummyr_
for Humber; E _Humbre_ (XV. 538).

_d_ usually dropped after _n_--_e.g._, _henmast_ = hindmost (XII.
268, etc.); sometimes intrusive--_e.g._, _suddandly_ (VI. 11), but
_suddanly_ (VI. 220). In _avantage_, _aventure_ from French the English
_d_ is intrusive.

_f_ represents final _ve_ in _pruf_ or _preif_, _leiff_, _driff_,
_knaf_, _haf_, etc., retaining the voiced sound (_v_) which it had in
A.S. between vowels, and _r_ _l_ and vowels.

_g_ in words of French origin has before _e_, _i_, the English sound =
_da(j)_, which was also then the French one--_e.g._, _liege_, _jugis_.

_l_ as indicating merely a long vowel is unsounded in _walknyt_ (VI.
296), _walk_ (wake, VII. 179, etc.). So we have also _falt_ (VI. 345,
etc.) and _fawt_ (III. 298); _realte_ and _reawte_, etc. Skeat holds
that the _l_ in the first case represents but a way of writing the
first _k_, so that the words should be _wakk_, etc., but this does not
cover the second case.[182]

[182] S.T.S., I. lxxxix., and Glossary.

_m_ and _n_ are often interchanged, as in _confort_, _manteme_, etc.

_ng_ becomes _n_ before _th_ as _lenth_, _strenth_, etc. _Cf._ also
Grammar. The nasal _ng_ may take the place of the liquid _n_, as in
_ryng_ (I. 78, etc.) for "reign" (Fr. _regner_). The French nasal
_nce_ is represented by _ng_ or _nch_--_e.g._, _Vallang_ (II. 201) or
_Vallanch_ (V. 472) for "Valence."

_r._ Metathesis of _r_ is very characteristic of the Northern
dialect--_e.g._, _fryst_ (first), _brist_ (burst, A.S. _berstan_),
_tursit_ (O.F. _trusser_), etc.

_s_ is changed to _sch_ in _schir_, _isch_ (issue), etc.; but on the
other side we have _sall_, _suld_ (shall, should) and _Inglis_.

_z_ has in _Fiz_ the Anglo-French sound _ts_, as in _rats_.




APPENDIX H

GRAMMAR


NOUNS

_Singular--Possessive Case._--1. The inflected genitive or possessive
is formed by adding _ys_ or _is_; MS. E, on the whole, shows a
preference for the former. Sometimes the final consonant is doubled.
_Cf._ _a manis hand_ (VII. 580), to _mannys fude_ (X. 189).

2. Nouns denoting relationship are uninflected, as in Anglo-Saxon:
_Mordreyt his sistir son_ (I. 557). _Till his brothiris pes_ (XI. 652)
is an exception found in both MSS. For _And sperit of his brotheris
fair_ (XVI. 21) in C, E has _brodyr_.

NOTE.--_Wode-syde_ (E _woddis sid_, IX. 139), _sonne-rising_, _hous
end_ (VII. 163), all common combinations. Editors, however, usually
read the termination of the last as _housis_, though it seems to fall
under the same category.

_Plural._--1. The plural also is in _ys_ or _is_, more seldom _es_,
representing A.S. _as_. It "formed a distinct syllable in monosyllables
and words accented on the final syllable."[183] The latter part of the
statement is not, however, uniformly true. _Cf._ _battalis_ (XI. 122),
_bischoppes and prelatis_ (XX. 294), etc., which are dissyllables.

2. Simple _s_ occurs only after _r_ and _y_ (_i_)--_galays_,
_werriours_, etc.--but _spurys_, _baneris_, _towris_ also occur. _Feys_
(I. 58) and _fays_ (I. 223) are to be read as two syllables.

3. Final _f_ (_ff_) is generally changed to _v_, as _theif_, _thevis_;
but _wif_ preserves the _f_ throughout, as _wifis_, _wiffys_, etc. (E,
however, in XII. 246, has _wyvis_); and _lif_ has _lyvis_ (XI. 590), or
_livis_ and _lyffis_ (X. 106), or _liffis_ (IV. 137).

4. Words ending in _er_, _ir_, _yr_, _yn_, _ill_ for the most part
reject the final vowel before the ending of the plural: _dochtrys_,
_lettres_ or _lettrys_, _wapnys_, etc. Where the vowel is retained, it
is silent, as in _schulderis_ (IX. 356), _letteris_ (XVII. 31, 39), etc.

NOTE.--_Burges_ in XVI. 80, XVII. 236, is clearly unaltered in the
plural, and this would seem to apply also to _marras_ (VIII. 35),
_hous_ (VIII. 514, etc.), and _mos_ (VIII. 173), which are usually read
as three and two syllables respectively. _Cf._ on _Singular_ (2).

5. Of strong plurals, besides _men_ and its compounds, _ky_ and
_brethir_ by change of vowel (_Umlaut_), we have _eyn(e)_ (A.S.
_eagan_), with singular _e_ or _ey_ (VI. 523), _oxin_ or _oxyne_ (X.
381, 388), _schoyne_ (II. 510). These (with _hosen_ and _fan_ (_faes_))
are the only plurals in _n_ preserved in Northern English.

6. Some old neuters (A.S.) take no inflection in the plural: _deir_,
_hors_, etc.; _hous_ has _hous_ and _housis_ (X. 60, etc.), but _cf._
on (4) (note); _thing_ has _thing_ (XI. 27, etc.) and _thingis_. _Cf._
also _gudis_ and _gude_ (XVII. 517, 521). One form is in _er_ or _ir_,
_childer_ (XII. 246) or _childir_ (XVII. 515), A.S. _cildru_.

7. Nouns indicating time, space, quantity, weight, and number are
unchanged in the plural: _fifty yheir_ (in I. 522 occurs _ten yheris_,
quite an exceptional case), _tuelf moneth_, _six and fourty wyntir_
(A.S. plural also _winter_), _twa myle_, _tuenty thousand pund_, etc.
For _paris_ in C (XIII. 463), E reads _payr_. In XII. 234 C has _thre
gret avantage_, where E gives _avantagis_, but reads _vasselagis_ (!)
to rhyme.

8. Only _men_ suffers inflection in the plural possessive: _the Inglis
menis fewte_ (VIII. 19), _of othir mennis landis_ (XI. 148). In
_till Scottis men possessioune_ (XVII. 202) we may have, as Henschel
suggests,[184] a piece of "scribal carelessness;" but Hampole
undoubtedly uses this as a valid form:

  "Sal dede _men_ banes be set togyder
  Thurgh messes, and rightwis _men_ prayers."

[183] Murray, _Dialect of the Southern Counties_, p. 153.

[184] _Darstellung der Flexionslehre in John Barbour's Bruce_, p. 12.


PROPER NOUNS.

In general, these follow the common nouns in their forms, but note:

1. Two names ending in _s_ have no inflection for the genitive: _King
Adrastus men_ (II. 529), _Thomas prophecy_ (II. 86). This occurs also
in Chaucer.

2. _Douglas_ has both flectionless and inflected forms: _the Douglas
men_ (X. 398), _the Lord Douglassis men_ (XX. 481).

3. Possessive or genitive formed by _his_: _Hannyball his mekill mycht_
(III. 232). _Cf._ also VI. 435, 446. Originally, as here, confined to
proper names. A special example is in the reading of C (XVII. 940):
_Berwyk his toune_; E _Berwykis_.


ADJECTIVES.

1. There is no distinction in the _Bruce_ between strong and weak
adjectives, the latter in Chaucer being indicated by a final _e_, and
used after the definite article, demonstrative and possessive pronouns,
etc., nor is the plural similarly distinguished from the singular. In
all these cases the Scots adjective is invariable; the final _e_, which
often occurs, is of no grammatical significance. There is no difference
between _the gud Erll_ (X. 686) and _the gude Erll_ (XX. 603), while
the plural is _gud werriours_ (XX. 416).

2. The only example of inflection is the form _aller_, genitive plural
(_er_ = _-ra_, A.S. _eal-ra_). It occurs once: _throuch thar aller hale
assent_ (I. 137).

3. The comparative and superlative are formed by adding _ar_ or _er_
(seldom _ir_) and _est_ or _ast_. In words of two and more syllables
_mar_ (_mair_) and _mast_ (_maist_) also occur. The same rule applies
to adverbs. The final consonant of a monosyllable may be doubled:
_thikkest_ (VIII. 81), but also _thikast_ (XVII. 156).

4. Change of vowel (_Umlaut_) appears in two cases--_sterkar_ (E
_starkar_) (XV. 491) and _eldest_ (I. 51, IV. 71). _Ill_ or _evill_
is the Northern form for _bad_, compared with _wer_ or _war_, _werst_
(III. 192). _Mor_, for _mar_, occurs twice to rhyme with _befor_ (X.
199, XII. 299). _Er_ gives _erar_.

5. After the comparative comes usually _than_, which is always used by
Rolle, but there are four examples of _na_--_wes starkar fer na he_
(VI. 538), also III. 229, II. 519, X. 637.


NUMERALS.

1. _Ane_ before a consonant sometimes becomes _a_: _in a nycht and a
day_ (III. 429). _The tane_ and _the ta_ are compounds of this numeral,
with the old neuter _thaet_ (_thet_) of the definite article, really
_thet-ane_, _thet-a_. The former is a substantive, the latter an
adjective: _the tane suld be kyng_ (VI. 186), _the ta part_ (III. 239).
Similarly _the tothir_ = _thet othir_ (I. 7, etc.), which is throughout
used for the ordinal "the second," as _formast_ is sometimes used
for "the first": _Fule-hardyment the formast is, And the tothir is
cowardis_ (VI. 337, 338).

2. Note _thresum_, _fiffsum_, _sex sum_, where "sum denotes
conjunction" (Jamieson's _Dictionary_), three, etc., together; _half
deill_ (A.S. _dael_, a part); _twa part_ = two parts; _yneuch_, singular
(usually adverb), used for quantity, and _ynew_ (_enew_), plural, for
number. _Cf._ XX. 337, and I. 558.

N.B.--For demonstrative, etc., adjectives, see also Pronouns,
Demonstrative, etc. Note _sam(m)yn_ (same) as adjective and adverb (V.
72, XII. 49, etc.). Distinguish _ilk(e)_ = same (A.S. _ylc_) from the
distributive _ilk_ (A.S. _ aele_) = each. Others are _sik_ (_syk_),
_swilc_, etc.


PRONOUNS.

_Personal._--1. In MS. E besides _I_ is found the strong form _Ik_
or _Ic_ (A.S. _Ic_). The latter is entirely wanting in C, which has
everywhere _I_.

2. The third person feminine is _scho_ (A.S. _seo_), once spelled
_sche_ (XIII. 635), a Southern effect, where, however, E has _scho_.

3. Note the gen. sing. mas. and gen. plur. in _magre his_, in spite of
him, and _magre thairis_, in spite of them.

_Possessive._--1. The genitive cases of the personal pronouns are most
often adjectives. Before words beginning with a vowel they are _mine_,
_thine_; before words beginning with a consonant they become _my_,
_thi_; words beginning with _h_ may have either form.

2. The forms used absolutely are _myn_, _his_, _ours_, _yhouris_,
_thaires_: _That suld be myn_ (V. 223), etc.

_Reflexive._--1. The personal pronouns serve as reflexives: _I will me
spied_ (XI. 638); _And went hyr hame_ (V. 177).

2. There is also the form in _self_, more seldom _selvyn_, _selvin_.
When the subject is a personal pronoun this may drop out: _that himself
suld wele Kepe the entre_ (XI. 445).

3. _Self_ is both singular and plural: _That thai mycht help thameself_
(X. 619).

_Demonstrative._--1. The Northern plural of _this_ is _thir_, which
supplanted _thas_ as _thise_ did in the Midland. Its origin is
obscure.[185]

[185] _Murray_, p. 185.

2. The plural of _that_ is _tha(i)_. Distinguish from _thai_ (they),
3rd pers. plur.

3. _Yhon(e)_, more often an adjective, has also a substantive use in
three cases only (IV. 502, 506; XIV. 280).

_Relative and Interrogative._--1. The relative pronoun is _that_ or
_at_, never _quha_. _At_ is a purely Northern form. _Quhais_ and
_quham_ occur occasionally as oblique cases. In _quhom_, as in words
like _so_, _mor_, etc., there is evidence of Southern influence. _Quha_
is used as an interrogative. The simple _quhilk_ occurs but once
(XVIII. 225, see note), where E has a different reading; otherwise it
is in the form _the quilk that_.

2. The relative in the oblique cases is often omitted: _the small folk
thai had thar_ (IX. 261). This is a marked feature of the _Wallace_.

_Indefinite._--1. _None_ for _nane_ occurs only once (IX. 485); and
so, too, _ilkone_ for _ilkane_, rhyming with a proper name (XI. 303).
_Nane_ is used both as substantive and as adjective. As adjective it
comes before a word beginning with a vowel. Before consonants and _h_,
_na_ or _no_ is used. In two cases _no_ precedes a vowel: XIII. 145;
XVI. 249.

2. _Othir_, often = "each other," as _Thai dang on othir_ (X. 680).

3. The plural of _man_ has a pronominal use = _one_, German "man": _as
men in the Bibill seys_ (I. 466); _men mycht se_ (X. 678), etc.


VERBS.

1. Note the periphrastic form with _gan_ in E (_can_ in a few cases),
_can_ always in C: _all the land gan occupy_ (I. 184); _all can thai
cry_ (XII. 200). The past tense of _can_ is _couth_: _thar vittale
all fast couth fale_ (VIII. 460): whence, by analogy, the false form
_begouth_ for past of _gan_, itself the past of _ginnen_, to begin.

2. Weak verbs form their past tense and past participle in _it_ or
_yt_, the latter being more common in E. In certain cases the vowel
drops out, as in _dwelt_. After _r_, _l_ (_ll_), _n_, the ending is
often in _d_, as _herd_, _ansuerd_, etc.

NOTE.--_Felt_ for the ordinary _feld_ occurs once, in III. 119. _Cald_,
too, for _callit_, is forced to a rhyme (XIII. 61). The proper past of
_send_ is _send_.

3. The present tense indicative is, _I spek_, _thou spekis_, _he
spekis_, _we spek_, etc. But when the personal pronoun is separated
from the verb, or when the subject is a noun or relative pronoun or
other form, the ending is in _is_ or _ys_ throughout. _Cf._ _yhow that
takis_ (XVI. 592); _yhe that this redis_ (VI. 269); _all men fleis the
did_ (IX. 90), etc.

4. The imperative plural is in _is_ (_ys_): _departis us_ (VI. 543). It
is more rare without the ending (XI 309; XII. 227, etc). This, however,
is the rule when the imperative is followed by its pronoun: _luk yhe_
(XII. 217).

5. The present participle ends in _and_. Doubling of the consonant may
occur after a short vowel--_e.g._, _wonnand_ (X. 160).

6. The verbal noun (so-called) ends in _yng_ or _ing_. In many examples
the _g_ is dropped, as the tendency was and is in Scots, and we have a
form in _yn(e)_. _Cf._ _fechting_ (XII. 119) and _fechtyn_ (III. 241).
And these may rhyme, which shows that in sound the difference was not
apparent (_cf._ IX. 120). Sometimes the particular form depends on the
MS.--_e.g._, VI. 520, C _supposing_: E _supposyn_. The same thing is
found in proper names with a similar termination.

7. The past participle of strong verbs has ending _yn_ or _in_, seldom
_en_. _Clymen_ in X. 648, where the correct form, _clummyn_, is given
in 606, is either really a surviving or intruded infinitive, or has
been assimilated to it.

N.B.--VII. 524, C _cum_: E _cummyn_; X. 506, C _won_: E _wonnyn_.

8. The infinitive has dropped all trace of an ending. The _e_ which
sometimes appears is silent. It is formed by prefixing _to_ or _till_,
in certain cases with _for_ in addition. For one case we have a reduced
infinitive with _at_: _a-do_ (X. 348).


ADVERBS.

1. _him allane_ is a strengthened form of _him ane_ (VI. 272, 320),
and is the more frequent of the two; equivalent to German "allein" and
analogous in construction to the pronoun with _self_. In Early Scots
_alane_ is attached to the dative, in later and modern Scots to the
possessive, _his ane_, etc.: the fuller form, from a confusion with
_lone_, is now _his lane_, etc.

2. The surviving phrase, _the morn_ (XIV. 478) occurs once for the
older _to-morn_. Mr. Gregory Smith says that the former "begins to
appear in M. Sc." (Middle Scots, 1450-1600),[186] and MS. E indeed reads
_to-morn_ in the passage above.

3. Note the compounds with _gat_ (a way), _thusgat_, _swagat_, etc.: in
XIX. 253; C _swagatis_; E _swagat_: also _howgatis_, etc., preserving
Genitive ending.

4. The forms _on liff_ (XVIII. 154), _on slepe_ (VII. 192), _on stray_
(XIII. 195), etc., are peculiarly Northern forms for "alive," "asleep,"
etc. _Cf._ also _on fer_, _on flot_.


PREPOSITIONS.

1. _Till_ = _to_, the former being a Northern fashion. C frequently
extends to _on-to_, _on-till_, as in VI. 622, XVII. 29, etc.

2. Note the verbal preposition _that I of tell_, etc.

3. _Be_ and _by_ are common to both MSS., C more frequently the latter,
probably a Southern influence. Strictly in Scots _be_ alone denotes
agency; _by_ usually = beyond, as in _by ordinar_, etc.


CONJUNCTIONS.

1. The verb _suppos_ is several times used as a conjunction.

2. _the-quhethir_ = _thohquhether_ = _thohquether_, "nevertheless,"
unknown to the Southern dialects.[187]

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
