INTRODUCTION


Among the unpublished papers of Thomas and Joseph Warton at Winchester
College the most interesting and important item is undoubtedly a
continuation of Thomas Warton's _History of English Poetry_. This
continuation completes briefly the analysis of Elizabethan satire and
discusses the Elizabethan sonnet. The discussion offers material of
interest particularly for the bibliographer and the literary historian.
The bibliographer, for example, will be intrigued by a statement of
Thomas Warton that he had examined a copy of the _Sonnets_ published in
1599--a decade before the accepted date of the first edition. The
literary historian will be interested in, inter alia, unpublished
information concerning the university career of Samuel Daniel and in the
theory that Shakespeare's sonnets should be interpreted as if addressed
by a woman to her lover.

Critically appraised, Warton's treatment of the Elizabethan sonnet seems
skimpy. To dismiss the sonnet in one third the amount of space devoted
to Joseph Hall's _Virgidemiarum_ seems to betray a want of proportion.
Perhaps even more damaging may seem the fact that Warton failed to
mention more sonnet collections than he discussed. About twenty years
later, in 1802, Joseph Ritson listed in his _Bibliographia Poetica_ the
sonnet collections of Barnaby Barnes, Thomas Lodge, William Percy, and
John Soowthern--all evidently unknown to Warton. But Warton was not
particularly slipshod in his researches. In his immediately preceding
section, on Elizabethan satire, he had stopped at 1600; and in the
continuation he deliberately omitted the sonnet collections published
after that date. Thus, though he had earlier in the _History_ (III, 264,
n.) promised a discussion of Drayton, he omitted him here because his
sonnets were continually being augmented until 1619. Two sixteenth
century collections which Warton had mentioned earlier in the _History_
(III, 402, n.) he failed to discuss here, William Smith's _Chloris_
(1596) and Henry Lock's _Sundry Christian Passions, contayned in two
hundred Sonnets_ (1593). Concerning Lock he had quoted significantly
(IV, 8-9) from _The Return from Parnassus_: "'Locke and Hudson, sleep
you quiet shavers among the shavings of the press, and let your books
lie in some old nook amongst old boots and shoes, so you may avoid my
censure.'" A collection which certainly did not need to avoid censure
was Sir Philip Sidney's _Astrophel and Stella_; and for Warton's total
neglect of Sidney's sonnets it seems difficult to account, for in this
section on the sonnet Sidney as a poet would have been most aptly
discussed. The _Astrophel and Stella_ was easily available in
eighteenth-century editions of Sidney's works, and Warton admired the
author. Both Thomas and Joseph Warton, however, venerated Sidney mainly
for his _Arcadia_ and his _Apology for Poetry_. For Joseph Warton,
Sidney was the prime English exhibit of great writers who have not, he
thought, "been able to express themselves with beauty and propriety in
the fetters of verse."[1] And Thomas Warton quoted evidently only once
from Sidney's verse,[1] and then only by way of _England's
Helicon_.[2] The omission of Sidney, then, is the glaring defect; of the
dozen or so other Elizabethan sonnet collections which escaped Warton,
most were absolutely or practically unknown, and none seem to have been
available to him in the Bodleian or the British Museum.

At the time of his death, on 21 May 1790, there were in print only
eleven sheets,[3] or eighty-eight pages, of the fourth and final volume,
which was scheduled to bring the history of English poetry down to the
close of the seventeenth century. For four years after the publication
of the third volume in 1781 Warton repeatedly promised to complete the
work,[4] and a notice at the end of his edition of Milton's _Minor
Poems_ advertised in 1785 the "speedy publication" of the fourth volume.
But to his printer Warton evidently sent nothing beyond Section XLVIII.
The present continuation was probably written during or shortly after
1782: it contains no reference to any publication after William Hayley's
_Essay on Epic Poetry_, which appeared in 1782; and according to Thomas
Caldecott, Warton for the last seven years of his life discontinued work
upon the _History_.[5]

The notes which Thomas Warton had made for the completion of the
_History_ were upon his death commandeered by his brother, Joseph, at
that time headmaster of Winchester College. Joseph Warton made some
halfhearted efforts to get on with the volume,[6] but neither Winchester
nor Wickham, whither he retired in 1793, was a proper place in which to
carry on the necessary research. Moreover he was much more interested in
editing Pope and Dryden; and securing advantageous contracts to edit
these poets whom he knew well, he let the _History_ slide.

Joseph Warton appears, however, to have touched up the present
continuation, for a few expansions seem to be in his script rather than
in his brother's. It is difficult to be positive in the discrimination
of hands here, as Thomas Warton's hand in this manuscript is quite
irregular. Pens of varying thicknesses were used; black ink was used for
the text and red ink for footnotes, and one note (16) was pencilled.
Moreover, certain passages appear to have been written during periods of
marked infirmity or haste and are legible only with difficulty if at
all. In any case, those additions which were presumably made by Joseph
Warton merely expand the original version; they do not alter or modify
any of Thomas Warton's statements.

In the text of the present edition the expansions which appear to be in
Joseph Warton's hand are placed within parentheses, which were not used
for punctuation in the text of the manuscript itself. Because of the
difficulties of reproduction, all small capitals have been translated
into lover case italics.

This continuation, discovered by the editor among the Warton papers in
the Moberly Library at Winchester College, is here published with the
kind permission of the Right Honorable Harold T. Baker and Sir George
Henry Gates, retired and present Wardens of Winchester College, and of
the Fellows of the College. The editor is indebted also to the Reverend

A HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY: AN UNPUBLISHED CONTINUATION


(In enumerating so many of these petty Epigrammatists, I may have been
perhaps too prolix,--but I did it to shew the taste & turn of writing at
this time; & now proceed to observe, that, in the year, 1614,)[1] the
vogue which satire had acquired from Hall and Marston, probably
encouraged Barten Holiday of Christ-Church in Oxford, to translate
Persius, when he was scarcely twenty years of age. The first edition is
dated 1616. This version had four editions from its publication to the
year 1673 inclusive, notwithstanding the versification is uncommonly
scabrous. The success of his Persius induced Holiday to translate
Juvenal, a clearer & more translatable satirist. But both versions, as
Dryden has justly observed,[2] were written for scholars, and not for
the world: and by treading on the heels of his originals, he seems to
have hurt them by too near an approach. He seized the meaning but not
the spirit of his authors. Holiday, however, who was afterwards
graduated in divinity and promoted to an archdeaconry, wrote a comedy
called the _Marriage of the Arts_, acted before the court at
Woodstock-palace, which was even too grave and scholastic for king James
the first.

I close my prolix review of these pieces by remarking, that as our old
plays have been assembled and exhibited to the public in one uniform
view,[3] so a collection of our old satires and epigrams would be a
curious and useful publication. Even the dull and inelegant productions,
of a remote period which have real Life for their theme, become valuable
and important by preserving authentic pictures of antient popular
manners: by delineating the gradations of vice and folly, they furnish
new speculation to the moral historian, and at least contribute to the
illustration of writers of greater consequence.


_Sect._ XLIX.

The _Sonnet_, together with the _Ottava Rima_, seems to have been the
invention of the Provincial bards, but to have been reduced to its
present rhythmical prosody by some of the earliest Italian poets. It is
a short monody, or Ode of one stanza containing fourteen lines, with
uncommonly frequent returns of rhymes more or less combined. But the
disposition of the rhymes has been sometimes varied according to the
caprice or the convenience of the writer. There is a sonnet of the
regular construction in the Provincial dialect, written by Guglielmo de
gli Amalricchi, on Robert king of Naples who died in 1321.[4] But the
Italian language affords earlier examples. (The multitude of identical
cadences renders it a more easy and proper metre to use in Italian than
in English verse.)

No species of verse appears to have been more eagerly and universally
cultivated by the Italian poets, from the fourteenth century to the
present times. Even the gravest of their epic and tragic writers have
occasionally sported In these lighter bays. (A long list of them is
given in the beginning of the fourth Volume of Quadrios History of
Italian Poetry.) But perhaps the most elegant Italian sonnets are yet to
be found in Dante. Petrarch's sonnets are too learned (metaphysical) and
refined. Of Dante's compositions in this style I cannot give a better
idea, than in (the ingenious) Mr. Hayley's happy translation of Dante's
beautiful sonnet to his friend Guido Calvacanti [sic], written in his
youth, and probably before the year 1300.

    Henry! I wish that you, and Charles, and I,
      By some sweet spell within a bark were plac'd,
      A gallant bark with magic virtue grac'd,
      Swift at our will with every wind to fly:

    So that no changes of the shifting sky
      No stormy terrors of the watery waste,
      Might bar our course, but heighten still our taste
      Of sprightly joy, and of our social tie:

    Then, that my Lucy, Lucy fair and free,
      With those soft nymphs on whom your souls are bent,
      The kind magician might to us convey,

    To talk of love throughout the livelong day:
      And that each fair might be as well content
      As I in truth believe our hearts would be.[5]

We have before seen, that the _Sonnet_ was imported from Italy into
English poetry, by lord Surrey and Wyat, about the middle of the
sixteenth century. But it does not seem to have flourished in its
legitimate form, till towards the close of the reign of queen Elisabeth.
What I call the legitimate form, in which it now appeared, was not
always free from licentious innovations in the rythmical arrangement.

To omit Googe, Tuberville [sic], Gascoigne, and some other petty writers
who have interspersed their miscellanies with a few sonnets, and who
will be considered under another class, our first professed author in
this mode of composition, after Surrey and Wyat, is Samuel Daniel. His
_Sonnets_ called _Delia_, together with his _Complaint of Rosamond_,
were printed for Simon Waterson, in 1591.[6] It was hence that the name
of Delia, suggested to Daniel by Tibullus, has been perpetuated in the
song of the lover as the name of a mistress. These pieces are dedicated
to Sir Philip Sydney's sister, the general patroness, Mary countess of
Pembroke. But Daniel had been her preceptor.[7] It is not said in
Daniel's Life, that he travelled. His forty-eighth sonnet is said to
have been "made at the authors being in Italie."[8] Delia does not
appear to have been transcendently cruel, nor were his sufferings
attended with any very violent paroxysms of despair. His style and his
expressions have a coldness proportioned to his passion. Yet as he does
not weep seas of tears, nor utter sighs of fire, he has the merit of
avoiding the affected allusions and hyperbolical exaggerations of his
brethren. I cannot in the mean time, with all these concessions in his
favour, give him the praise of elegant sentiment, true tenderness, and
natural pathos. He has, however, a vigour of diction, and a volubility
of verse, which cover many defects, and are not often equalled by his
contemporaries. I suspect his sonnets were popular. They are commended,
by the author of the _Return from Parnassus_, in a high strain of
panegyric.

    Sweet honey-dropping Daniel doth wage
    War with the proudest big _Italian_
    That melts his heart in sugar'd sonnetting.[9]

But I do not think they are either very sweet, or much tinctured with
the Italian manner. The following is one of the best; which I the rather
chuse to recite, as it exemplifies his mode of compliment, and contains
the writer's opinion of Spenser's use of obsolete words.

    Let others sing of knights & Paladines,
      In aged accents, and untimely words,
      Paint shadowes in imaginarie lines,
      Which well the reach of their high wit records;

    But I must sing of thee, and those faire eyes
      Autentique shall my verse in time to come,
      When yet th' vnborne shall say "Loe, where she lyes,
      Whose beauty made Him speak that els was dombe."

    These are the arkes, the trophies I erect,
      That fortifie thy name against old age,
      And these thy sacred vertues must protect
      Against the Darke, & Times consuming rage.
    Though th' errour of my youth they shall discouer,
    Suffise, they shew I liu'd, and was thy louer.[10]

But, to say nothing more, whatever wisdom there may be in allowing that
love was the errour of his youth, there was no great gallantry in
telling this melancholy truth to the lady.

Daniel is a multifarious writer, and will be mentioned again. I shall
add nothing more of him here than the following anecdote. When he was a
young student at Magdalen-Hall in Oxford, about the year 1580,
notwithstanding the disproportion of his years, and his professed
aversion to the severer acadamical [sic] studies, the Dean and Canons of
Christchurch, by a public capitular act now remaining, gave Daniel a
general invitation to their table at dinner, merely on account of the
liveliness of his conversation.[11]

About the same time, Thomas Watson published his _Hecatompathia, Or the
passionate century of love_, a hundred sonnets.[12] I have not been able
to discover the date of this publication:[13] but his _First set of
Italian Madrigals_ appeared at London, in 1590.[14] I have called them
_sonnets_: but they often wander beyond the limits, nor do they always
preserve the conformation [or] constraint,[15] of the just Italian
_Sonetto_.[16] Watson is more brilliant than Daniel: but he is
encumbered with conceit and the trappings of affectation. In the
love-songs of this age, a lady with all her load of panegyric, resembles
one of the unnatural factitious figures which we sometimes see among the
female portraits at full length of the same age, consisting only of
pearls, gems, necklaces, earings, embroidery, point-lace, farthingale,
fur, and feathers. The blooming nymph is lost in her decorations.
Watson, however, has sometimes uncommon vigour and elegance. As in the
following description.

    Her yellow locks exceed the beaten gold,
    Her sparkling eyes in heau'n a place deserue;
    Her forehead high and faire, of comelie mould,
      Her wordes are musical, of syluer sound, &c.
    Her eye-browe hangs like Iris in the skies,
    Her eagle's nose is straite, of stately frame;
    On either cheeke a rose and lillie lyes;
    Her breathe is sweet perfvme, or holie flame:
      Her lippes more red than any coral-stone, &c.
    Her breast transparent is, like cristal rock,
    Her fingers long, fit for Apollo's lute,
    Her slipper such, as Momus dare not mock,
      Her virtues are so great, as make me mute, &c.[17]

Spenser's Sonnets were printed with his _Epithalamium_. They are
entered, in the year 1593, under this title to William Ponsonby,
"_Amoretti_, and _Epithalamium_, written not long since by Edmond
Spencer."[18] In a recommendatory sonnet prefixed, by G. W. senior, it
appears that Spenser was now in Ireland. Considered under the idea which
their title suggests, undoubtedly these pieces are too classical,
abstracted, and even philosophical. But they have many strokes of
imagination and invention, a strength of expression, and a stream of
versification, not unworthy of the genius of the author of the _Faerie
Queene_.[19] On the whole however, with the same metaphysical flame
which Petrarch felt for the accomplished Laura, with more panegyric
than passion, Spenser in his sonnets seldom appeals to the heart, and
too frequently shews more of the poet and the scholar than of the lover.
The following, may be selected in illustration of this opinion.

    When those renowned noble peers of Greece,
      Through stubborne pride among themselues did iar,
      Forgetful of the famous golden fleece,
      Then _Orpheus_ with his harp their strife did bar.
    But this continual, cruel, civil war,
      The which myselfe against myselfe doe make,
      Whilst my weake powres of passions warried arre,
      No skill can stint, nor reason can aslake.
    But when in hand my tunelesse harpe I take,
      Then doe I more augment my foes despight,
      And grief renew, and passion doe awake
      To battaile fresh against myselfe to fight.
    Mongst whom, the more I seeke to settle peace,
    The more I find their malice to increase.[20]

But the following is in a more intelligible and easy strain, and has
lent some of its graces to the storehouse of modern compliment. The
thought on which the whole turns is, I believe, original, for I do not
recollect it in the Italian poets.

    Ye tradeful Merchants, that with weary toyle,
      Doe seek most precious things, to make your gaine,
      And both the Indias of their treasure spoile;
      What needeth you to seeke so farre in vaine?
    For lo, my Love doth in herselfe containe
      All this worlds riches that may farre be found:
      If saphyres, loe, her eyes be saphyres plaine;
      If rubies, loe, her lips be rubies sound;
    If pearles, her teeth be pearles both pure & round;
      If iuorie, her forehead iuorie were [wene];
      If gold, her locks are finest gold on ground;
      If siluer, her faire hands are siluer sheene:
    But that which fairest is, but few behold,
    Her mind adornd with vertues manifold.[21]

The last couplet is platonic, but deduced with great address and
elegance from the leading idea, which Gay has apparently borrowed in his
beautiful ballad of _Black-eyed Susan_.

Among the sonnet-writers of this period, next to Spenser I place
Shakespeare. Perhaps in brilliancy of imagery, quickness of thought,
variety and fertility of allusion, and particularly in touches of
pastoral painting, Shakespeare is superiour. But he is more incorrect,
indigested, and redundant: and if Spenser has too much learning,
Shakespeare has too much conceit. It may be necessary however to read
the first one hundred & twenty six sonnets of our divine dramatist as
written by a lady:[22] for they are addressed with great fervency yet
delicacy of passion, and with more of fondness than friendship, to a
beautiful youth.[23] Only twenty six, the last bearing but a small
proportion to the whole number, and too manifestly of a subordinate
cast, have a female for their object. But under the palliative I have
suggested, many descriptions or illustrations of juvenile beauty,
pathetic endearments, and sentimental declarations of hope or
disappointment, which occur in the former part of this collection, will
lose their impropriety and give pleasure without disgust. The following,
a few lines omitted, is unperplexed and elegant.

      How like a winter has my absence been
      From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
      What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
      What old December's bareness every where!
      And yet this time, remov'd,[24] was summer's time;
      The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
      Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, &c.
      For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
      And thou away, the very birds are mute:
    Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a chear,
    That leaues look pale, dreading the winter's near.[25]

In the next, he pursues the same argument in the same strain.

      From you have I been absent in the spring,
      When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim,
      Has put a sprite of youth in euery thing;
      That heauy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
      Yet not the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
      Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
      Could make me any summer's story tell,
      Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
      Nor did I wonder at the lilies white,
      Nor praise the deep vermilion of the rose:
      They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
      Drawn after thee, thou pattern of all those![26]
    Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,
    As with your shadow, I with these did play.[27]

Here are strong marks of Shakespeare's hand and manner. In the next, he
continues his _play_ with the flowers. He chides the _forward_ violet, a
_sweet thief_, for stealing the fragrance of the boy's breath, and for
having died his veins with too rich a purple. The lilly is condemned for
presuming to emulate the whiteness of his hand, and _buds_ of _marjoram_
for stealing the ringlets of his hair. Our lover is then seduced into
some violent fictions of the same kind; and after much ingenious
absurdity concludes more rationally,

    More flowres I noted, yet I none could see,
    But sweet or colour it had stolne from thee.[28]

Shakespeare's _Sonnets_ were published in the year 1599.[29] I remember
to have seen this edition, I think with _Venus and Adonis_ and the _rape
of Lucrece_, a very small book, in the possession of the late Mr Thomson
of Queen's College Oxford, a very curious and intelligent collector of
this kind of literature.[30] But they were circulated in manuscript
before the year 1598. For in that year, they are mentioned by Meres.
"Witness his [Shakespeare's] _Venus and Adonis_, his _Lucrece_, his
sugred _Sonnets_ among his priuate friends, &c."[31] They were reprinted
in the year 1609; one hundred & fifty four in number. They were first
printed under Shakespeares name, among his _Poems_, in the year 1717, by
Sewel, who had no other authority than tradition.[32] But that they were
undoubtedly written by Shakespeare, the frequent intermixture of
thoughts and expressions which now appear in his plays, and, what is
more, the general complexion of their phraseology & sentiment,
abundantly demonstrate, Shakespeare cannot be concealed. Their late
ingenious editor is of opinion, that Daniel was Shakespeare's model.[33]

I have before incidentally mentioned Barnefield's Sonnets,[34] which,
like Shakespeare's, are adressed [sic] to a boy. They are flowery and
easy. Meres recites Barnefelde among the pastoral writers.[35] These
sonnets, twenty in number, are written in the character of a shepherd:
and there are other pieces by Barnefield which have a pastoral turn, in
_Englands Helicon_. Sir Philip Sydney had made every thing Arcadian. I
will cite four of this authors best lines, and such as will be least
offensive.

    Some talk of Ganymede th' Idalian boy,
      And some of faire Adonis make their boast;
      Some talke of him whom louely Leda lost
    And some of Echo's loue that was so coy, &c.[36]

Afterwards, falling in love with a lady, he closes these sonnets with a
palinode.[37]

I have before found occasion to cite the Sonnets of H. C. called _Diana_
printed in 1592.[38] As also _Dieella_ [sic], or _Sonnets_ by R. L.
printed in 1596.[39] With these may be mentioned a set of Sonnets,
entitled _Fidessa more chaste than kinde_. By B. Griffin, Gent. At
London. Printed by the Widow Orwin for Matthew Lownes, 1596.[40] They
are dedicated to Mr William Essex of Lambourne in Berkshire. Then
follows a deprecatory address to the gentlemen of the Inns of Court, who
are earnestly requested to protect at least to approve this first
attempt of a stranger; and who promises, if now successful, to publish a
pastoral the next time. It is possible that some other writers of this
class may have escaped my searches. I do not wish to disturb their
repose, which is likely to be lasting.




NOTES TO THE TEXT


Warton's notes, which in the manuscript are designated by letters or
symbols, have been numbered. Brackets enclose all the editor's
corrections, expansions, and comments. The parentheses are Warton's.

[1] [Thomas Warton's original version began "The temporary vogue which
..." The final version, here parenthesized in the text, represents, it
seems fairly certain, Joseph Warton's expansion. Although this
deprecatory comment seems rather abrupt coming after five sections
devoted to the Elizabethan satirists, Joseph Warton is not disparaging
where his brother praised. Thomas Warton had already (IV, 69) belittled
the "innumerable crop of _satirists_, and of a set of writers differing
but little more than in name, and now properly belonging to the same
species, _Epigrammatists_."]

[2] [Warton here combined several remarks in Dryden's essay "The Original
and Progress of Satire." See John Dryden, _Essays_, ed. W. P. Ker
(Oxford, 1900), II, 111-112. There were six, not four editions of
Holiday's _Persius_.]

marginal note (I, col. 447) in his copy (Bodleian MS. Top. Oxon. b. 8)
of the second, 1721, edition of Wood. Although Philip Bliss in his
edition of _Athenae Oxonienses_ (London, 1813) incorporated many of the
marginalia inserted by Tanner in his copy of Wood, Bliss evidently
overlooked this particular note. The editor is grateful to the Bodleian
Library for a photostat and for permission to quote. According to Mr. W.
G. Hiscock, Deputy Librarian at Christ Church, no mention of the "act"

[15] [Above the word "conformation" Warton added "constraint." It is not
clear whether he intended both to stand.]

[16] I have discovered, says Mr Steevens, in a Letter to me, that
Watson's Sonnets, which were printed without date, were entered on the
books of the Stationer's Company, in 1581: under the Title of, "Watsons
Passions, manifesting the true frenzy of Love". The Entry is to Gabriel
Cawood, who afterwards published them. [See _A Transcript of the
Registers of the Company of Stationers of London_, ed. Edward Arber
(London, 1875-1894), II, 409.] Ad Lectorem Hexasticon is prefixed

[17] [A note to accompany this Sonnet No. VII has been almost completely
destroyed by the excision, unique in the notebook, of what was
originally folio 17. The mutilated line ends of the note read thus: "...

Watson and cited Section XI of "A Comparative Discourse of our English
Poets," in Francis Meres's _Palladis Tamia: Wit's Treasury_ (London,
1598, fol. 280), where among those praised for their Latin verse are
Christopher Ocland, Thomas Watson, Thomas Campion, Walter Haddon, and
"Thomas Newton with his Leyland."]

[19] There is [a] Sonnet by Spenser, never printed with his works,
prefixed to Gabriel Harveys "Foure Letters, &c. Lond. 1592." I have much
pleasure in drawing this little piece from obscurity, not only as it
bears the name of Spenser, but as it is at the same time a natural
unaffected effusion of friendship ... [four words illegible]. (See
_Observations_ on Spenser's _Fair. Qu._ [II]. [245-247?].)

    "_Harvey_, the happy aboue happiest men,

_Dublin_ this 18 of July, 1586. _Your devoted Friend during life, Edmund
Spencer._"

I avail myself of an opportunity of throwing together a few particulars
of the life and writings of this very intimate friend of Spenser, more
especially as they will throw general light on the present period. He
was born at Saffron-Walden in Essex, [John] Strype's [_Life of the
Learned Sir Thomas] Smith_. [London, 1698] p. 18. He was a fellow of
Pembroke-Hall, Spenser's college: and was one of the proctors of the
university of Cambridge, in 1583. [Thomas] Fuller's [_History of the
University of] Cambridge_, p. 146. [in his] _Ch[urch] Hist[ory of
Britain_]. [London, 1655.] Wood says, he was first of Christ's college,
and afterwards fellow of Trinity-Hall, _Ath. Oxon._ F[asti, I, col.
755]. But Wood must be mistaken, for in the _Epilogus_ to his _Smithus_,
addressed to John Wood Smith's amanuensis, Harvey dates from
Pembroke-Hall. _Smithus_, Signat. G. iij. [G4 verso.] [Warton probably
did not intend to deny that Harvey was a fellow of Trinity, but
evidently felt that Wood was ignorant of the intermediate fellowship at
Pembroke.] He was doctorated in jurisprudence at both universities. With
his brother Henry, he was much addicted to Astrology. (See supr. [Vol.
IV], p. 23.)

He seems to have been a reader in rhetoric at Cambridge from his
_Ciceronianus, vel Oratio post reditum habita Cantabrigiae ad suos
auditores_. Lond. 1577. 4to. It is dedicated to William Lewin, I suppose
of Christ's college. (See Wood, ubi supr.) He published also _Rhetor,
vel duorum dierum oratio de natura arte et exercitatione_ rhetorica,
Lond. 1577. 4'o. It is dedicated to Bartholomew Clark, the elegant
translator of Castilios _Courtier_, who has also prefixed an address to
our author's _Rhetor_, dated at Mitcham in Surrey, Cal. Sept. 1577. He
published in four books, a set of Latin poems called _Gabrielis Harveii
Gratulationum Valdinensium Libri quatuor_, &c. Lond. 1578. 4to. This
book he wrote in honour of queen Elisabeth, while she was on a progress
at Audley-end in Essex, "afterwards presenting the same in print to her
Highnesse at the worshipfull Maister Capels in Hertfordshire." _Notes_
to Spenser's _September_. He mentions a most perfect and elegant
delineation or engraving of all England, _perartificiose expressa_,
procured by his friend M. Saccoford, to which the queen's effigy,
_accuratissime depicta_, was prefixed. Lib. i. p. 13. In his character
of an accomplished _Maid of Honour_ of the queen's court, some curious
qualifications are recited. One of the first, to make her truly amiable,
is what he calls _Affectatio_.

She is to understand painting her cheeks, to have a collection of good
jokes, to dance, draw, write verses, sing, and play on the lute, and
furnish her library with some approved recipt-books. She is to be
completely skilled in cosmetics. "_Deglabret_, lavet, atque ungat, &c."
Lib. iiii. p. 21. 22. (See supr. ii[i]. [426, n].) Another book of
Harvey's Latin poetry is his _Smithus, vel Musarum Lacrymae_, on the
death of Seceretary [sic] Sir Thomas Smith, Lond. 1578. 4to. The
dedication is to Sir Walter Mildmay. When Smith died, he says, Lord
Surrey broke his lyre. _Cant._ v. He wishes on this mournful occasion,
that More, Surrey, and Gascoigne, would be silent. _Cant._ vi. Ascham,
Carr, Tonge, Bill, Goldwell, Watson, and Wilson, are panegyrised as
imitators of Smith. [Nicholas Carr, 1524-1568, was Regius Professor of
Greek at Cambridge. William Bill, d. 1561, was Master of Trinity
College, Cambridge. Perhaps Tonge is the Barnaby Tonge who matriculated
at Christ Church, Cambridge, in 1555. There were two John Goldwell's at
Cambridge in Smith's day: one was a fellow at Queen's from 1538 to 1542;
the other was named fellow of Trinity in 1546. For Wilson see Warton's
discussion earlier in the _History_ (III, 331-344), where this very
praise in Harvey's _Smithus_ is quoted.] _Cant._ vii. Signat. D. iij.
See also, Sign. L. i. And C. ij. Wilson, the author of the _Art of
Rhetoric_, is again commended. Ibid. Sign. E. ij. Again, Sign. F. i. F.
ij. He thinks it of consequence to remember, that Smith gave a Globe,
_mira arte politum_, to Queens College Library at Cambridge. Ibid, Sign.
E. iij. [E4 verso.] He praises Lodovice Dolci's odes, and Ronsard.
_Cant._ ii. Sign. C. i. His iambics are celebrated by his cotemporaries.
See Meres, _Wits Tr._ fol. 280. 282. [283 verso.] (See supr. ii [i].
[401, n].) Nothing can be more unclassical than Harvey's Latin verse. He
is _Hobbinol_ in Spenser's Pastorals. Under that name, he has prefixed
two recommendatory poems to the first and second parts of the _Faerie
queene_. [There was only one such poem, but in some folio editions it
was inadvertently printed twice.] The old annotator on Spenser's
Pastorals prefaces his commentary, with an address, dated 1579, "To the
most excellent and learned both oratour and poet master _Gabriel
Harvey_, &c." In the notes to _September_, he is said to have written
many pieces, "partly vnder vnknowne titles, and partly vnder counterfeit
names: as his _Tyrannomastix_, his _old [ode] Natalitia_, his
_Rameidos_, and especially that part of _Philomusus_ his divine
_Anticosmopolite_, &c." He appears to have been an object of the petty
wits & pamphlet-critics of his times. His chief antagonists were Nash
and Greene. In the _Foure Letters_ abovementioned, may be seen many
anecdotes of his literary squabbles. To these controversies belong his
_Pierces supererogation_, Lond. 1593. Sub-Joined, is a _New Letter of
notable contents with a strange sound sonnet called_ Gorgon. To this is
sometimes added _An Advertisement for Pap-Hatchet_ &c. Nash's _Apology
of Pierce Penniless_, printed 1593, is well known. Nash also attacks
Harvey, as a fortune-teller & ballad maker, in _Have with you to
Saffron-Walden_. Nash also wrote a confutation of Harvey's _Foure
Letters_, 1592. [_Strange News, of the Intercepting Certaine Letters_,
to which Warton evidently refers, is actually the early title of the
_Apology_.] I pass over other pieces of the kind. The origin of the
dispute seems to have been, that Nash affirmed Harvey's father to have
been a rope-maker at Saffron-Walden. Harvey died, aged about 90, at
Saffron Walden, in 1630.

[22] Except in in [sic] such a passage as when he calls this favourite
by "The master-mistress of my passion," _Sonn._ 20. And in a few others,
where the expressions literally shew the writer to be a man. [Warton of
course wanted to preserve Shakespeare's sonnets from the charge of
homosexuality. In the eighteenth century the distaste for conceits and
an acute sensitivity to the suspicion of homosexuality made the
_Sonnets_ so unpopular that they were omitted from the editions of
Shakespeare by, among others, Rowe, Pope, Theobald, Warburton, Capell,
and Johnson.]

[23] The last of these is that which begins, "O thou, my lovely Boy."
_Sonn._ 126.

[24] "When _absent_ from thee".

[25] _Sonn._ 97.

[28] _Sonn._ 99.

[29] [Warton originally wrote "1609," but immediately scored it out and
replaced it with "1599."]

[30] In 16mo. With vignettes. Never entered in the Register of the
Stationers. [Possibly Warton saw a volume registered by Eleazer Edgar on
3 January 1599/1600 as "A booke called _Amours_ by J. D. with certen
oy'r sonnetes by W. S. vj'd" (Arber's _Stationers Register_, III, 153).
This entry may indicate that Edgar held manuscripts of some of
Shakespeare's sonnets, and some copies of the book so registered may
have been published. However, if Warton had seen this hypothetical
volume he should have correctly identified it: he had already (III, 402,
n.) printed the Edgar entry from the Stationers Register.

If this volume which Warton mentions ever actually existed, it cannot
now be located. Concerning Warton's statement Mr. G. B. Oldham,
Principal Keeper of Printed Books, British Museum, wrote as follows: "I
have examined the sale catalogue which contains books from the library
of the Reverend William Thomson of Queens College, Oxford, but have
failed to find anything at all corresponding with the volume which
Warton describes. There are not, in fact, many really scarce books in
this catalogue and it rather looks as though the rarer items in
Thomson's collection were otherwise disposed of. In any case I think
there is a strong presumption that Warton's memory betrayed him."

Thus, in the absence of any evidence concerning a 1599 edition of the
_Sonnets_ and in the light of Thorpe's claim in 1609 that they were
"Never before Imprinted," it seems probable that what Warton was vaguely
recalling was actually a copy of Shakespeare's _Passionate Pilgrim_.
This book, printed for Jaggard in 1599, my have misled Warton by its
separate title page, _Sonnets to Sundry Notes of Musicke_. Such a volume
as Warton describes was, it seems evident from surviving copies,
frequently bound up to contain _The Passionate Pilgrim_, _Venus and
Adonis_, and other small collections of poetry. The fact that Warton
recollected the book as a l6mo. does not argue much against this
identification. Though _The Passionate Pilgrim_ is actually an octavo,
surviving copies measure about 4-1/2 by 3-1/4 inches, and as late as
1911 William Jaggard, in his _Shakespeare Bibliography_ (p. 429),
described it as a 16mo.

In explanation of Warton's probable error two extenuating facts should
be remembered. First, since Thomson died about 1766, Warton's
recollection was at least fifteen years old; and second, only in 1780
did Edmond Malone edit the _Sonnets_ and _The Passionate Pilgrim_ as
discriminate texts comprising Shakespeare's lyrics. Even then Malone
omitted without comment the separate title page _Sonnets to Sundry Notes
of Musicke_. Previously, except in George Steevens's edition of the
_Sonnets_, Shakespeare's poems were lumped together, with lyrics of
several other Elizabethan poets, and printed as Shakespeare's _Poems on
Several Occasions_. Moreover, Warton was not the first to write of a
1599 edition of the _Sonnets_. His friend Bishop Percy may have helped
to create this false impression in Warton's memory. In his interleaved
copy of Langbaine's _Account of the English Dramatick Poets_,
immediately after Oldys's statement that Shakespeare's _Sonnets_ were
not printed until 1609, Percy commented, "But this is a mistake. Lintot
republished Shakespeare's Sonnets from an edition in 1599." Malone, in
his transcript of Steevens's transcript of Percy, corrected Percy's
mistake: "This is a mistake of Dr. Percy's. Lintot republished from old
ed's but not from any ed. of 1599, except a very _few_ sonnets called
the _Passionate Pilgrim_ printed in that year." (Photostat of Bergen
Evans's transcript of Bodleian Malone 129-132.) Warton, however, may
well have been misled by Percy's comment, for in the winter of 1769 he
had borrowed and used Percy's annotated copy of Langbaine. (_The Percy
Letters, The Correspondence of Thomas Percy and Thomas Warton_, ed. M.
G. Robinson and Leah Dennis [Baton Rouge, 1951], pp. 135, 137.) It is
unfortunate that the matter was not cleared up in discussion with
Malone, whom at some time during the 1780's Warton furnished with a copy
of the 1596 _Venus and Adonis_ and with whom he corresponded around 1785
concerning sonnets in general and Shakespeare in particular. (William
Shakespeare, _Plays and Poems_, ed. Edmond Malone [London, 1790] X, 13,
n. 1; and James Prior, _The Life of Edmond Malone_ [London, 1860], pp.
122-123.)]

[31] _Wits Tr._ fol. 281. b. [The brackets in the text are Warton's.]

[32] [Warton was of course much mistaken. Following the 1640 edition of
Benson, Gildon had reprinted them under Shakespeare's name in 1709
(dated 1710) and again in 1714. The two Sewell editions appeared in 1725
and 1728. Invariably the poems seem to have been printed under
Shakespeare's name, though perhaps not always in a collected edition of
his complete poems. See Hyder Rollins's New Variorum edition of the
_Sonnets_ (Philadelphia, 1944).]

[33] [See Malone's _Supplement to the Edition of Shakespeare's Plays_

This piece was afterwards inserted in _Englands Helicon_.

[38] See supr. vol. iii. p. [292, n.] I [am] now most inclined to think,
that these initials mean Henry Constable, and not Henry Chettle. The
Sonnets do not justify the applauses paid to Constable, by his
contemporaries, Edmond Bolton, Meres, the author of the _Return_ from
_Parnassus_, and many others. Some of his sonnets are prefixed to
Sydney's _Apology for Poetry_. The initials H. C. often occur in
_Englands Helicon_. I take this opportunity of saying that some pieces
of Chettle were among Mr. Beauclerc's books. (See supr. iii. [291-292,
n.?]) [Indeed the annotations in the Harvard Library copy of the
_Bibliotheca Beauclerkiana_ (p. 102) suggest that either Thomas Warton
or, more probably, his brother may have purchased the copy of Chettle's
_Englands Mourning Garment_ owned by Thomas Warton's former student. It
was sold to "Dr. W."]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
