PILGRIMAGES TO THE HOLY LAND.

In an article in the _Retrospective Review_ (2nd Series, vol. ii. p.
234.) it is stated that the first book ever printed concerning
Pilgrimages to the Holy Land was the _Peregrinatio Bernhardi de
Breydenbach_, Moguntiae, 1486; and in the Preface to the _Pylgrymage of
Sir Richard Guylforde to the Holy Land in 1506_, lately published by the
Camden Society, the learned editor remarks that the work of Bernhard de
Breydenbach, _Opus transmarinae Peregrinationis ad venerandum et
gloriosum Sepulchrum dominicum in Jherusalem_ (fol. Mogunt. 1486), is
believed to be the first book of travels that was printed. Having by me
notes of five works printed earlier than that of Breydenbach just
mentioned,--and all of these, with one exception, being Pilgrimages to
the Holy Land,--I forward them for publication in "N. & Q.," and
probably some of your correspondents may be able to add to the list.

1. _Ludolf von Suchen ("Ludolphus parochialis ecclesiae in Suchen
rector"), De terra sancta et itinere Jhierosolymitano._--Three undated
editions, but in all probability printed before 1480, are mentioned in
Brunet's _Manuel du Libraire_. A German translation, entitled, _Von dem
gelobten Land vnd Weg gegen Iherusalem_, was published at Augsburg in
1477 in 4to. The author travelled about the year 1340. "His journal,"
observes Dr. Robinson (_Biblical Researches in Palestine_, iii. p. 11.),
"is written with great simplicity, and has something of the marvellous;
but is decidedly the best itinerary of the fourteenth century."

2. _Marco Polo_, the celebrated Eastern traveller, wrote an account of
his peregrinations in Italian, about the year 1300. A German translation
was printed at Nuremberg as early as 1477, with the following title:
_Hie hebt sich an das Puch des edeln Ritters vnd Landtfarers Marcho
Polo; in dem er schreibt die grossen wunderlichen Ding dieser Welt_. (In
folio.)

3. _Sir John Mandeville._ Both French and Italian editions of the
well-known "Marvaylous Travailes" of this worthy knight were printed in
1480. (See Brunet _ut supr._)

4. _Santo Brasca_, a gentleman of Milan, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem
in 1480, of which he wrote a journal in Italian, and published it the
following year at Milan. Brunet gives the title as follows: _Tutto il
suo Itinerario di giorno in giorno al sanctissima cita di Jerusalem
nell' anno 1480_, 4to. This is a very curious and rare book, written in
simple and natural style; and at the end of which are "Instructioni a
ciascuno che desidra fare questo sanctissimo viagio," and two prayers in
verse: "1. Oratione per sancto brascha fatta a piedi nudi in Monte
Calvario a di 29 Julij, 1480: 2. Oratione facta in la vale de Josaphat a
la sepultura de la Vergene Maria."

5. _Johann_ or _Hans Tucher_, a counsellor (_Rathsherr_) of Nuremberg,
undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and Mount Sinai in the year 1479, in
company with Balthasar, Duke of Mecklenburg, and two of his
fellow-citizens. The title of his itinerary in Brunet is, _Wallfart und
Reise in das gelobte Land_. Such was its popularity that it passed
through two editions in the same year (1482); the one appearing at
Augsburg, in folio; the other, corrected by the author, at Nuremberg, in
4to. (Vide Will's _Nuernbergisches Gelehrten-Lexicon_.) The work is,
however, very rare. In it full directions are given for the guidance of
all such as might thereafter be disposed to venture forth with scrip and
staff on these pious but somewhat perilous expeditions.

Referring again to Breydenbach, Dr. Kitto (no mean authority) is of
opinion that the account which goes under his name was written by the
Dominican monk Felix Faber, who was Breydenbach's secretary and
companion in the journey. (See Kitto's _Physical History of Palestine_,
p. 9.)

    PEREGRINE A.


SURNAMES.

The subject of surnames has more than once been referred to in the pages
of "N. & Q.," and it may assist those of your readers who have
investigated the question of their origin and use, to offer them the
following examples of peculiar forms of personal designation which occur
in certain of the more ancient public muniments of the city of Norwich.

It is the opinion of Camden, Du Cange, Pegge, Sharon Turner, and other
writers, that the custom of appropriating a permanent appellation to
particular families, became fully established in this country at the
period (sooner or later) of the Norman Conquest. The instances, however,
exhibited below, prove that such custom was not, at any rate,
universally prevalent at that time amongst us. And, indeed, whatever
might have been the case in reference to "the high men of the lond," it
is very certain that surnames, properly so called, were not completely
adopted by the mass of the people until the close of the fourteenth
century.

But as the intention of this Note is simply to adduce original examples
of individual designations, without inquiring into the circumstances
attending their acquisition, or pointing to the causes, obvious enough
for the most part, to which their various after-changes and
modifications are to be attributed, the subject calls for no other
general remark, except, perhaps, as to the prefixes "Le"[1] and "De,"
which, it may be noticed in passing, are, though not _constantly_, as is
commonly asserted, attached to names in records of an older date than
the time of Edward IV., when they began to fall into desuetude.

  [Footnote 1: This prefix was occasionally in Cheshire, and in the
  North with few exceptions, contracted into "A," as Thomas a
  Becket, Thomas a Dutton, &c.]

With these introductory observations are now given, from the source
above indicated,--

I. Examples of sons bearing a name different to that of their fathers:--

  "1230. Will. fil. Silvestri, als. Will. Silvestre, fil. Silvestri
  Pudding de Holmestrete;

  "1232. Joh. de Worthestede, Tannator, fil. Simonis le Spencer;

  "1239. Sim. Pellipar (Pelter, or Skinner), fil. Ranulph. le
  Furmag. de N.;

  "1242. Will. Pryse, fil. Clementis Mayne de N.;

  "1249. Walt. de Swathingg de N. Aurifaber, fil. Joh. de
  Birlingham;

  "1273. Rob. Leck, fil. Add. de Tifteshale;

  "---- Rad. fil. Willi de Castelaire (Castleacre) qui vocatur Rads.
  de Lenn (Lynn);

  "1333. Rycard de Byteringe, fil. Johis le Yunge (Ling), Ballior;

  "1334. Joh. del Stonhous, fil. Ad. de Storston, Clici, C. N.

  "1354. Willm. de Bernham, fil. Adam. del Sartyn defti."

Attention is requested to the last entry but one of this list; and it
may be further mentioned, in reference to it, that sub ann. 1270 occurs
this notice:

  "Adam _le Clerk_ de Stirston et Anger (?) _ux. ej._"

II. Examples of wives described by names other than those borne by their
husbands:

  "1255. Rob. de Wurthestede, et Basilia le Ro', ux. ej."

  1288. Will. de Devenschyr, le Wayte, et Alicia de Wetinge, ux. ej.

  1307. Johes Mengy de Besthorp, et Martha de Felmingham, ux. ej.

  ---- Thos. Toyth, et Juliana le Ropere, ux. ej.

  1316. Agnes Richeman (Rickman), Relicta Ric. Holveston defti.

  1318. Rob. de Poswyk, Taverner, et Alicia Godesman, ux. ej.

  1352. Isabell. de Mundham fuit ux. Willi de Dunston, et nunc uxor
  Simonis Spencer."

It is also to be noticed that wives, if more than once married, are
frequently described in old documents by the names, distinctly and
united, of their several husbands.

III. Examples of changes in the form of particular designations:

Between 1332 and 1348 the name borne by the famous knight, Sir Rob. de
Salle, commemorated by Froissart, and who was killed by the insurgents
near Norwich in 1381, is severally written, de la Sale, de Salle, de
Aula, de la S'aule, de Halle, Saul, and Halle.

In temps. Ed. II. and III. is the following name thus modified: Fitz
Benedict, Benediscite, Bendiste, Bendish, Bennett.

The twenty-ninth bishop of Norwich (1446-1472) is styled Walter Lyhart,
Le Hert, and Hart.

In 1337 we have "Jas. de Briseworth als. de Bliclingg;" and in 1368,
"Johes. de Welburn (Frat. Thome de Welburn nuper defti), als. de
Cobeslound de Welburne, Taverner."

Then, again, it were easy to produce innumerable examples of
professional and business descriptions, which have originated many
modern surnames, as Joh. le Lytester (Lister, Dyer), Regin, le Paumer
(Palmer), Bateman le Espicer, (Spicer), &c.

But this Note has already somewhat unduly encroached upon your pages;
and it is now brought to a conclusion with the single observation, that
many of the causes of various readings and differences of form in the
same original surname, as well as of a total change from one designation
to another, are now in full force and daily practical operation in many
isolated parts of the country, where, from the predominance of identical
family and baptismal appellations, some method, such as is illustrated
in the foregoing examples, must obviously be adopted, in order to
distinguish one individual from another. In many of the remote valleys,
indeed, of the North of England, a more comprehensive reply might be
given than that which the unsuccessful gaberlunyie woman, mentioned by
Sir W. Scott, received in a certain Scottish dale, when, in the
bitterness of her disappointment, she exclaimed, "Are there no
Christians here?" and was answered, "Christians! nae; we be a' Elliots
and Armstrongs!" So--but certainly not under like circumstances--it
might be replied, "We're a' Meccas (Ang. Metcalfes)!"

    COWGILL.

_Number of Surnames._--Probably some of your numerous correspondents
could give me some idea as to the number of surnames there are in this
country used by British subjects. We have no good work on surnames, as
those of Lower and others do not go sufficiently into the subject to
satisfy the curiosity of those who wish to know the origin and date of
the names in use among us. A work of some study and research, giving all
the names in use at present in the country, and showing when they were
first adopted or brought into the country, with the changes that have
been made in them, would be very interesting, and as worthy, if not more
so, than many that are brought before the public.

    J. H.

P.S.--I would suggest that the names should be classed in the different
periods of history, beginning with the Britons.


LICENSE TO MAKE MALT IN 1596.

Among the old family deeds relating to the manor of Wishanger, I find
the following curious and interesting document. It affords evidence that
in 1596 there was a dearth of corn which was general through the
kingdom; that barley was then much used for bread; that there was a
custom, either general, or occasioned by the scarcity, that the poor
should be served in open market, at an accustomed hour; that one of the
means relied upon to supply food to the people was to restrain the
making of malt; and, therefore, that malt liquor must have been very
generally consumed by our forefathers at that time.

The writing is in perfect preservation, and the ink jet black.

I give it in the original orthography, according to the literature of
those easy times when every man spelled that that was right in his own
eyes and the world was little troubled with dictionaries or critics.

WHERE LOLLARD WAS BURIED, AND WHAT BECAME OF HIS BONES.

In referring to the passage of Heda's history relating to
bishop-boiling, the following curious fact caught my eye. Speaking of
the same bishop, Florentius de Wevelichoven, he says:

  "Fecit et exhumari ossa cujusdam haeretici Matthaei Lollaert atque
  ante atrium Pontificale comburi, cineresque in fossas urbis
  dispergi."--_Hist. Episcopor. Ultraject._ p. 259.

Now though the Christian name, _Matthaeus_, of this Lollaert does not
agree with that usually assigned to Lollard, viz., _Walter_; nor yet
this assertion that his bones were dug up, and burned at Utrecht, with
the current story that Lollard was buried alive at Cologne; yet it is
evident from the note upon this passage on p. 263., that Heda is
speaking of the founder of the sect of the Lollards. In this note he
refers to Prateolus and Walsingham, to which I turned in order to
ascertain where he got his information; but, alas, in vain! They only
give a very meagre account of the origin of the Lollards. Heda must
therefore have had some independent source from which he wrote, as he
could hardly have invented the story. The form of name, _Lollaert_,
would make it more than probable that Lollard was a Dutchman, which
agrees very well with the account that he preached in Germany.

How much is it to be wished that some member of the many learned Dutch
Antiquarian Societies now in existence, would endeavour _at last_ to
clear up the history of Lollard by reference to the records of the city
of Utrecht, if they are still in being, and extend so far back as the
fourteenth century.

Florentius became Bishop of Utrecht in 1379, and died 1394.

DEAN SWIFT'S LIBRARY.

The letters and other MSS. of Dr. John Lyon, who was prebendary at
Rathmichael, in the archdiocese of Dublin, between the years 1755 and
1764, by some chance or another recently got into the possession of a
shopkeeper in this city, by whom they have been, for the most part, used
as waste paper. The originals from which the following transcripts have
been made, are now in my possession.

  "We the undernamed have examined and considered ye Catalogue of ye

_Churching of Women._--In Herefordshire it is considered _contra bonos
mores_ for the husband to appear in church on the day of his wife's
churching, or, at all events, in the same pew with her. An antiquary of
that county considers this a relic of Roman paganism, connected with the
worship of Bona Dea. Query, is this so elsewhere?

    C. S. P.

_Wassailing Orchards in Sussex._--I am happy to be able to send you the
following particulars respecting the apple-tree superstitions, as they
prevail in this county; and it is as _well to preserve_ the
_recollection_ of them, for I suspect they are wearing away. In this
neighbourhood (Chailey) the custom of wassailing the orchards still
remains. It is called apple-howling. A troop of boys visit the different
orchards, and encircling the apple-trees they repeat the following
words:

      "Stand fast root, bear well top,
      Pray the God send us a good howling crop.
      Every twig, apples big,
      Every bough, apples enow.
      Hats full, caps full,
      Full quarters, sacks full."

They then shout in chorus, one of the boys accompanying them on the
cow's horn; during this ceremony they rap the trees with their sticks.
This custom is alluded to in Herrick's _Hesperides_, p. 311.

      "Wassail the trees that they may beare
      You, many a plum, and many a peare,
      For more or less fruits they will bring,
      As you do give them _wassailing_."

_Lucky Omens._--"The schoolmaster with his primer in his hand," to quote
Lord Brougham, is unquestionably abroad, and dispelling, with surprising
rapidity, the prejudices of the people; in some cases, perhaps, to make
way for prejudices yet stronger and more tenacious than those they
displace. You are doing good service by collecting and recording some of
those that are fast disappearing. In this neighbourhood I know ladies
who consider it "lucky" to find _old iron_; a horse shoe or a rusty nail
is carefully conveyed home and hoarded up. It is also considered lucky
if you see the _head_ of the first lamb in spring; to present his _tail_
is the certain harbinger of misfortune. It is also said that if you have
money in your pocket the first time you hear the cuckoo, you will never
be without all the year. The magpie is a well-known bird of omen. The
following lines were familiar when I was a boy:

      "One for sorrow, two for mirth,
      Three for a wedding, four for death;
      Five for a fiddle, six for a dance,
      Seven for England, eight for France."

    T. D.

_Lambs._--The Denbighshire peasantry watch with great anxiety for the
position in which young lambs are seen by them the first time in the
year. If their heads are towards them it is lucky; if their tails, great
misfortunes will ensue.

_Key Experiments_ (Vol. v., p. 152.).--Perhaps J. P. Jun. may not be
aware that an experiment somewhat similar to these is practised in the
Isle of Man. The operator holds a thread between the finger and thumb,
with a shilling fixed horizontally to it, gradually drops the shilling
into a glass, and after it has once become stationary, the shilling
begins to oscillate, and, as the superstition goes, invariably strikes
the hour of the day against the glass. I have frequently practised it,
and consider the motive power to be the pulse, which is completely under
the operator's control. This performance has been known in the Isle of
Man certainly more than a century, and bears a resemblance to the
experiments of Mayo and Reichenbach with the Od Force, or the vagaries
of the Magnetoscope.

Perhaps some of your correspondents can instance cases and tricks of
this kind of much earlier date.

Minor Notes.

_Rhymes connected with Places._--There are many villages in England, the
names of which have old traditionary couplets attached to them,
illustrating some natural or other peculiarity; some such have already
incidentally found their way into the pages of "N. & Q." Might not a
complete collection be easily made, and would it not be an interesting
one? I send, as a beginning, two Staffordshire villages in my immediate
neighbourhood, which are very characteristically described. One is--

      "Wootton under Weaver,
      Where God came never,"

being very lonely, and out-of-the-way; and the other--

      "Stanton on the stones,
      Where the Devil broke his bones,"

which explains itself.

    W. FRASER.

_French Dates._--I annex a singular connexion between the dates of some
of the most important occurrences in the history of France, which was
mentioned to me by a French lady, with whom I had the pleasure of
travelling from Soissons to Paris the day after the melancholy death of
the Duke of Orleans, in July 1842. By following out the same principle
of addition, the next great national event appears to be in store for
the year 1857. Of course the superstitious reader must shut his eyes on
1848.

"_Black Book of Scone._"--The _Black Book of Scone_, containing the
history of Scotland from Fergus I., was in Sir Robert Spottiswood's
library, and was given by Lewis Cant (a Covenanting minister) to
Major-General Lambert, and by Lambert to Col. Fairfax; which book
Charles I. had ransomed from Rome by a considerable sum of money: and it
is certain Archbishop Spottiswood had it and the _Black Book of
Paisley_, signed by three abbots, when he compiled his _History_, which,
with the famous _Red Book of Pluscardine_, Buchanan says he had, and
frequently cites.--Sir George Mackenzie's _Defence of the Antiquity of
the Royal Line of Scotland_; and also _Lives of Scotch Writers_.

The fate of the _Black Book of Scone_ may be a clue to the inquirer
after the _Black Book of Paisley_. It is not now in the library at
Spottiswood; and most of Sir Robert Spottiswood's property was pillaged
and ransacked during his imprisonment.

_Cracked Glass._--Some years ago, being a schoolboy at the time, I spent
my Christmas holidays at my grandfather's house in Somersetshire. The
members of the family were assembled for evening prayer, when suddenly
music, resembling that of an Aeolian harp, was heard, produced apparently
by some person upon the lawn immediately beneath the window. As soon as
the prayers were concluded I opened the hall door, and was greatly
surprised to find the musician had departed. On returning to the
drawing-room I was informed that the moment I had left the room the
music ceased. Believing that some village friend had come to serenade
us, we drew our chairs round the fire in expectation of his return. A
few minutes only elapsed when the music was again distinctly heard. A
second visit was made to the hall door, but with no better success. It
was then resolved to open the shutters, which was no sooner done than
the mystery was clearly explained. During the day a pane of glass had
been cracked, and the music was produced by the two pieces of glass
vibrating against each other. We found, from repeated experiments, that
it required the atmosphere of the room to be at rather a high
temperature to produce the effect, for the moment the door, or one of
the other windows, was opened, the vibration ceased. I have only to add
that the music was very pleasing to the ear, and consisted of rapid
cadences. I have often mentioned the circumstance, but I never found any
one who had met with a similar _musical fracture_.

_Spanish Verses on the Invasion of England._--I carry in my memory the

      A mater et Draque
      Y a tomar la reyna.
      Y de los Luteranos
      De la banda-messa

      Un Luteranico

LEGAL WORTHIES, QUERIES RESPECTING.

I shall be much obliged for any information or hints as to the following
Queries:--

1. Is there any list extant of the Prothonotaries of the Supreme Courts
of Judicature from the time of Edward III. downwards, or any source from
which their names could be obtained? Was John Hayward a prothonotary of
one of the courts in Edward III.'s time, or during the reign immediately
following? or can any information be furnished about a lawyer of that
name about that time?

2. Is anything known of a place called "Schypmen Hall" existing in
London or elsewhere in the time of Edward IV.?

3. When did "Mr. Goldsborough, one of the Prothonotaries of the Common
Banke," flourish?

4. Is anything known of Traherne, said to have been reader at Lincoln's
Inn temp. Hen. VIII., whose _Reading on Forest Laws_ is much referred to
by Manwood?

5. Is anything known of Frowick, a lawyer probably of the sixteenth
century?

TOWN HALLS.

I have to thank two of your correspondents for their Notes in answer to
my Query respecting mediaeval towns built on a regular plan in England.
They have reminded me of Hull and Wokingham, with both which places I
was previously acquainted; neither of them is by any means of the same
regular and perfect plan as the English towns in France, but they
approximate to it in some degree; and I am not the less obliged for
being reminded of them. My success in this instance encourages me to
trouble you with another Query. Can any of your correspondents furnish
me with information respecting any mediaeval town halls remaining in
England? I am acquainted with several, but believe there are many more
than is commonly supposed. Some of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
are mentioned in Mr. Turner's work on _Domestic Architecture_, as the
County Hall at Oakham; the Guildhall at Lincoln; the King's Hall at
Winchester. In addition to these, the Guildhall at Exeter is partly of
the thirteenth century, and partly of the fifteenth. The old Town Hall
at Colchester of the twelfth has, I believe, been destroyed within these
few years. The Town Hall at Winchelsea is of the time of Edward I.,
though mutilated. The Town Hall at Aldborough is of the fifteenth
century, or earlier. The hall of St. Mary's Guild at Coventry is a
well-known and beautiful example. The Town Hall of Weobly in
Herefordshire is, if I remember rightly, an early example of timber
work. These are a few instances which occur to my memory. I have no
doubt there are many others; and, as the subject is one of considerable
interest, perhaps you will not object to assist me in collecting
information upon it. You will observe that I include under the general
name of Town Halls all public halls, whether called by that name or by
any other. I am aware that they do not all belong to the same class,
strictly speaking; but I should be glad to know of other examples of any
of them.

Minor Queries.

_Chasseurs Britanniques._--This regiment is noticed under the head of
"Foreign Corps on English half-pay," in the _Army List_ for 1850-1, pp.
494. 530. Can any of your readers favour me with some particulars
regarding it, and when and where it was raised, &c.?

    E. N.

_Knights Templars and Freemasons._--Can any of your readers inform me
what connexion has ever existed between the Knights Templars and the
Freemasons, as there is a degree in Freemasonry called the Knight
Templar's degree? It is supposed that the persecuted Templars betook
themselves to the Freemasons' lodges, and secured their protection. The
two orders became closely connected, the succession of Grand Masters
kept up, and the ritual of the Templars preserved. There is a French
order of Knights Templars, which claims direct succession from Jacques
de Molay, the last Grand Master of the original order; but the
Freemasons say that this is a spurious body, and that the only
legitimate claimants to representation of this once powerful order are
the Freemasons.

I shall be glad if any of your readers can give such information as may
aid my inquiries into this subject; or if they can furnish me with the
titles of such works as are most likely to aid my researches. My object
is to trace the history of the order of Knights Templars subsequent to
the persecution and death of Jacques de Molay, and to ascertain the
correctness of the statements of those who profess to be the proper
representatives of the order.

    E. A. H. L.

_St. Christopher._--Can any of the readers of "N. & Q." supply any
information which will assist my researches into the real meaning of the
representations of St. Christopher, which are so frequently found on the
north walls of churches? I have read Mr. Duke's essay on the subject in
the _Prolusiones Historicae_, but do not quite agree in his view of the
meaning which these singular paintings were intended to convey. Why
should this saint, of whom so little is correctly known and of whom
Alban Butler gives a very scanty account, occupy such a very important
position in the iconography of the mediaeval church, and which it appears
has not been maintained by the Roman Catholics of the present day? I am
quite aware of the doggrel lines occasionally found underneath these
representations, ascribing extraordinary powers of cure to the picture
when looked upon by the faithful; but I cannot think that this reason
alone would have led to the adoption of this extraordinary
representation in almost all our parish churches. Are there any known
representations of St. Christopher in painted glass; if so, where?

_Arnold Bilson's Wife._--Can any of your readers inform me who was "the
daughter of the house of Bavaria" married to _Arnold Bilson_,
great-grandfather of Thomas Bilson, Bishop of Winchester (who died
1616); and under what circumstances the marriage took place?

It seems there was some romance in the case, as, according to memorandum
(_Lib. Coll. Arm._, c. 19. p. 48., and _Harl. MS._ 1101. p. 29. [1582]),
the arms granted by the duke to his son-in-law were--"azure, per pole, a
rose and thistle, pper;" crest, "a horn, or." This union of what I
apprehend to be the royal and plebeian flowers, would seem to indicate
that the husband was merely a "roturier;" and, indeed, the "horn" itself
may point to his occupation, as it is the simple hunting instrument of
the time.

Arnold Bilson after his marriage left Germany, and settled in England.

controversy, and whose, was that?

_Sword Swallowing._--If some one of your learned correspondents could
point out any other references to the useful accomplishment of sword
swallowing, the information would confer a favour on me. The reference
to which I allude is about the date of B.C. 326, and is, unless my
memorandum be inaccurate, _Plu. Lycur._ c. 19, and runs thus:

      "[Greek: Agis men oun ho basileus, skoptontos Attikou tinos,

consigned to Mr. Samuel Pawson, wine merchant in Cecil Street, Strand,
without date or name, or residence of printer; it contains succinct
annotations "of the several masters whose performances are herewith
exhibited." These are very curious, and the prices affixed to each
picture (800 in number), as added together by some possessor of the
volume, amount to 55,379_l._ It appears to have been highly esteemed;
and, amongst other autographs, has "J. P. Roberts, Kingsgate;" "J. P.

  "We may anticipate the portrait of this truly great man drawn to
  the life in the intended biography of my friend Mr. Willson."

Dibdin published this in 1838. Has the memoir of Grostete ever appeared?

I may add, as a pendant to this Query, that two years back I saw a
beautiful English MS. of Grostete's on vellum, at the library of the
English College at Douay, out of which some British traveller, to whom
it had been obligingly lent, had cut every one of the illuminations.

_Almas-cliffe._--During a brief sojourn at Harrogate, Yorkshire, I have
visited two remarkable groups of rock, locally known as _Great
Almas-cliffe_ and _Little Almas-cliffe_: the former crowning a lofty
ridge about five miles south-west of this place; and the latter standing
upon a wild, heathery moorland, about three miles north of the other.
Both command most extensive views; and, on the table-rock of each, I
noticed circular basins, with channels by which superfluous fluid may be
carried off. Tradition says, that in remote ages they were used as
druidical altars; and, that in later days, after the introduction of
Christianity into England, mass was occasionally celebrated upon them.
In some of the local guide-books they are called _Almias_ Cliff. Whence
is the name derived? Can it be a corruption of holy mass, or hallowmas?

severe, that it was at once suppressed. The author is said to be dead; I
should like to know something of the circumstances of its publication,
for I had once seen it, and it bore the marks of very great genius. If
any one has a copy to dispose of, I would gladly buy it.

Minor Queries Answered.

"_Salusbury Welsh Pedigree Book._"--Having sometimes occasion to
investigate the lineage of Irish families derived from Wales, I am very
anxious to learn, through your valuable oracle, where may now be that
genealogical collection. According to the notes I have of it, it
contained "the pedigrees of all the gentlemen in North Wales, and of
some adjacent counties, with their arms finely illuminated;" and took
its name from the compiler, John Salusbury, Esq., of Erbistock, who
lived about the middle of the seventeenth century, and is reported as
having executed the labour with great accuracy. Does its actual scope
justify the above description, and where is it now? About the year 1780
it was in the possession of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, the very surname
on which I am at present engaged.

granted to his ancestry by King Robert Bruce, in 1312, his lordship is
by birth the first subject in Scotland; and in right of this privilege,
on all state occasions, where the sovereign is present, appears at his

Earl of Stamford. The Queries I wish to make are, were Thomas and

Thomas?

_Edward Bagshaw._--Can any of your correspondents inform me whether Sir
Edward Bagshaw, of Finglas, near Dublin, who settled in Ireland about
the commencement of the seventeenth century, left other children besides
two daughters; one of whom married William, eldest son of Sir William
Ryves, and by him had issue Bagshaw, William, Thomas, and Francis Ryves,
together with a daughter married to a Captain Burrowes? I also wish to
ascertain whether Castle Bagshaw, co. Cavan, the seat of the late Sir
William Burroughs, derives its name from this branch of the family of
Bagshaw. Any information, genealogical or historical, concerning the
above Sir Edward Bagshaw, would be acceptable.

ORIGINAL LETTER OF GENERAL JAMES WOLFE.

(Vol. v., pp. 34. 136. 185.)

I beg to renew my acknowledgments to the various gentlemen who have
afforded additional information respecting this brave man. So little has
been recorded of his personal history, that every item which can be
gleaned is valuable. It is certainly strange that no proper memoir of
one so distinguished in arms as Wolfe has yet been written. His career,
though short, was brilliant and embraces a period of time, as well as
events, which would render a sketch of his life, by a competent writer,
singularly interesting. Materials do not seem wanting; the detached
pieces of information, and references to sources where more may be
obtained, which have already appeared in "N. & Q." since I ventured to
start the subject in October last, indicate, that with a little industry
and research in proper quarters, Wolfe's history can yet be written to
advantage. England's young hero has, in this respect, been too much
neglected. Surely this national reproach will not be allowed to
continue.

In the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for January last, there is a very
interesting letter from Wolfe to a young officer on the subject of
military studies, supplied from the rich MS. stores of Mr. Robert Cole.
I am enabled to contribute the fragment of another letter from Wolfe,
also to a very young officer, pointing out how he ought to conduct
himself on entering the army. This fragment was discovered within these
few weeks, in the same old military chest where the twelve letters in
my possession were found, to which I formerly alluded. This fragment,
though neither dated, signed, nor addressed, is in Wolfe's handwriting
beyond all doubt. I have compared it with his other letters, and not
only do I find the resemblance perfect, but the paper on which the
fragment is written is identically the same with several of these
letters, the water-mark being the very appropriate one for a soldier,
"pro _patria_." This newly discovered portion of Wolfe's letter is
written closely on two pages of a sheet of post paper; and from
circumstances I am inclined to think the date must have been in the end
of 1757, when he was at Blackheath, soon after his return from the
descent on Rochefort, in which he held a command. I am unable, however,
to point out the name of the young officer for whose advantage the
fragmentary epistle was written; but he was evidently one in whose
welfare Wolfe took much interest, and intimate in Wolfe's family. The
introductory words, "_Dear Huty_," seem to be an affectionate
abbreviation of the young gentleman's surname; but how the fragment came
amongst the papers of Wolfe's other friend, Lieut.-Col. Rickson, to whom
the whole of the twelve letters in my possession are addressed, I cannot
at present say. Here is an exact copy, viz.:

  "Dear Huty,

  "By a Letter from my Mother I find you are now an officer in Lord
  Chs. Hay's Regiment, which I heartily give you Joy of, and as I
  sincerely wish you success in Life, you will give me Leave to give
  you a few Hints which may be of use to you in it. The Field you
  are going into is quite new to you, but may be trod very safely,
  and soon made known to you, if you only get into it by the proper
  Entrance. I make no doubt but you have entirely laid aside the Boy
  and all Boyish amusements, and have considered yourself as a young
  man going into a manly profession, where you must be answerable
  for your own conduct. Your character in life must be that of a
  Soldier, and a Gentleman: the first is to be acquired by
  application and attendance on your duty; the second, by adhering
  most strictly to the Dictates of Honour, and the Rules of Good
  Breeding. To be more particular in each of these points; when you
  join your Regiment, if there are any Officer's Guard mounted, be
  sure constantly to attend the Parade, observe carefully the manner
  of the officers taking their Posts, the exercise of their
  Espontoon, &c.; when the Guard is marched off from the Parade,
  attend it to the Place of Relief, and observe the manner and form
  of Relieving, and when you return to your chamber (which should be
  as soon as you cou'd, lest what you saw slip out of your Memory),
  consult Bland's Military Discipline on that Head; this will be the
  readiest method of learning this part of your Duty, which is what
  you will be the soonest call'd on to perform.

  "When off Duty get a Serg't or a Corporal, whom the Adjutant will
  recommend to you, to teach you the Exercise of the Firelock, which
  I beg of you to make yourself as much master of as if you were a
  simple soldier; the exact and nice knowledge of this will readily
  bring you to understand all other parts of your Duty, make you a
  proper judge of the performance of the Men, and qualify you for
  the post of an Adjutant, and in time many other employments of
  Credit. When you are posted to your Company, take care that the
  Sergeants or Corporals constantly bring you the orders; treat
  those officers with kindness, but keep them at a Distance, so will
  you be beloved and respected by them; read your orders with
  attention, and if anything in particular concerns yourself, put it
  down in your Memorandum Book, which I wou'd have you constantly in
  your Pocket ready for any Remarks; be sure to attend constantly
  morning and evening the Roll Calling of the Company, watch
  carefully the Absentees, and enquire into reasons for their being
  so, and particularly be watchfull they do not endeavour to impose
  on you sham Excuses, which they are apt to do with young officers,
  but will be deterr'd from it by a proper severity in detecting
  them;----"

Here, unfortunately, the remainder of the sheet has been torn off, and
the continuation of the excellent precepts it no doubt contained, is
irretrievably lost. Enough has luckily been preserved to show what an
admirably disciplined soldier mind Wolfe possessed, taken in conjunction
with the outline of military reading, pointed out in the letter
contributed by Mr. Cole, already alluded to, and written with the same
kindly object (the instruction of youthful officers), probably only a
few months prior to the date of the mutilated one.

As it may be thought desirable to say something more than I have done,
regarding the packet of Wolfe's letters in my custody, I beg to state
that the officer to whom they are all addressed, was William Rickson, a
native of Pembroke. He was eight years older than Wolfe. They appear to
have served together in Flanders. Both were at the battle of Dettigen,
and their names appear in the list of promotions consequent on that
victory. Rickson and young Wolfe were also in the same regiment,
commanded by Wolfe's father, in Flanders. I think it was then known as
"Onslows." Both father and son appear to have felt a strong attachment
to Rickson: this appears from the letters. On the part of James Wolfe in
particular, this attachment was of the most ardent description. In one
letter, dated Banff (Scotland), 9th June, 1751, he thus writes to
Rickson:

  "I believe that no man can have a sincerer regard for you than
  myself, nor can any man wish to serve and assist you with more
  ardour;" and "Attachments between men of certain characters do
  generally arise from something alike in their natures, and should
  never fall from a certain degree of firmness, that makes them the
  same all the world over, and incapable of any diminution. I have
  (as you justly acknowledge) a perseverance in friendship, that
  time, nor distance, nor circumstance, can defeat,--nay, even
  neglect can hardly conquer it; and you are just as warm and as
  near me in North America as you would be upon the spot."

Rickson survived Wolfe eleven years, and I possess the key of the tomb
in which his remains repose in Restalrig churchyard, near Edinburgh. A
fine miniature of him in his antique regimentals also exists; and it is
interesting to contemplate the lineaments of a countenance so familiar
to Wolfe, and of a man to whom the latter seems to have communicated his
inmost thoughts. There are passages in the letters indicative of this to
a degree, that I felt bound in honour not to disclose. Rickson died a
lieutenant-colonel in 1770. His antique military chest remained in
possession of relatives in Scotland almost forgotten, till about three
years ago curiosity prompted the examination of a mass of old papers,
covered with dust, lying at the bottom of it. A number of curious
documents have thus been brought to light, including a file of letters
to Rickson from the Duke of Queensbury (under whose auspices he
constructed the military roads in Gallowayshire) and other distinguished
personages of the last century, but best of all twelve invaluable
letters from the lamented Wolfe, tied up by themselves, probably by
Rickson, as memorials of his bosom friend who fell in the arms of
victory. It was, as already said, among these old papers that the
fragment of the letter above quoted was also found lately, on a more
careful inspection of the antique chest in which they lay. I was so much
struck with the noble sentiments expressed by Wolfe in the letters, that
I ventured to write a short sketch of him from very imperfect materials,
which appeared, along with the letters themselves, _ad longam_, in
Tait's _Edinburgh Magazine_ for December, 1849. Had I been aware of some
of the facts which have since been contributed to the "N. & Q.," I would
have modified certain passages in the narrative. All I aimed at,
however, was merely to elucidate the letters which accident placed in my
custody. But I now earnestly invite some competent writer to rescue
Wolfe's history from the undeserved neglect and obscurity in which it is
at present shrouded. I shall cheerfully allow any such party access to
the whole letters, under proper guards for their safety, and my address
has been left with the Editor accordingly.

EARL OF CHEPSTOW.

(Vol. v., pp. 126. 204. 261.)

The seeming difficulty regarded in these communications arises from
Hooker's unauthorised translation of "Comes Strigulensis" into "Earl of
Chepsto_ne_," and in a phrase of ancient parlance appearing a Title of
Dignity. The error does not exist in the original work, as Giraldus
wrote "Dermutius Morchardi filius, Lagenensium Princeps, _Ricardo Comiti
Strigulensi, Gilleberti Comitis filio_, S."--Camden's _Anglica_, &c., p.
767.

The town, called in later times _Chepstow_ by the English, and sometimes
_Cas Gwent_, or _Castell Gwent_, by the Welsh, is clearly _Strigul_ (as
shown in Lhwyd's _Commentariolum_, p. 102. edit. 1731, and
_Archaeologia_, vol. xxix. p. 31.); but these names are not precisely
equivalent. In early documents the Town, Vill, or Burgh is thus
variously named, and the style of the present Court Baron is, "the
Honour of Chepstow, _alias_ Striguil;" but in old charters and
chronicles the Lordship Marcher, the castle, and the honorary
description of its lords, are usually designated by the word "Strigul"
(variously written) only; and of this "Hooker _alias_ Vowell" was
perhaps ignorant. Giraldus himself is correct, as shown above.

As to the style of "Earl of Strigul," Dugdale admits the use of it by
Richard Fitz-Gilbert, who occurs as "Comes Strigulensis" above, and as
"Ricardus Comes de Striguil Dermuciigener," in Ralph de Diceto (p.
590.). His descendant Gilbert Marescall is also termed "Counte de
Strogoile" in the petition of Margaret, daughter of Thomas de
Brotherton, at the coronation of Richard II. (Vincent's _Corrections_,
p. 345.) There is a stronger instance in Selden's _Titles of Honour_ (p.
617. edit. 1631), correctly cited from Hoveden, and mentioning the fact
of William Marshall and Geoffrey Fitz-Peter being severally girded
"_gladio Comitatus de Striguil_ et gladio Comitatus de Essex," at the
coronation of King John, with remarks on their previous rank as earls,
their administration of earldoms, but their non-investiture, and their
sitting at the royal table in consequence of this investiture.

Nevertheless, it is laid down in the third _Report on the Dignity of a
Peer_, p. 146., that such expressions are to be considered vague. It
refers, for instance, any description of Roger de Montegomeri, as Earl
of Arundel (if such exists), to _residence_; adding, "that is, he was an
earl, and from his _residence_ was denominated Earl of Arundel, _as the
Earls of Pembroke were denominated Earls of Strigul_, a castle which
appears to have been built by William Fitz-Osborn, Earl of Hereford, and
which had _no connexion_ with the county of Pembroke."

As to the immediate parentage of Earl Richard Fitz-Gilbert, proof will
be readily found in the Foundation Charters of St. Neot's Priory and
Tintern Abbey, in Gorham's _St. Neot's_, p. cv.; _Monasticon_, vol. v.
p. 267.

DEATHS FROM FASTING.

(Vol. v., p. 247.)

In the parish church of Tenby there is an emaciated figure, lightly
wrapped in a winding-sheet, which is supposed to represent Tully, Bishop
of St. David's, of whose death a tradition, similar to that related by
BURIENSIS, is current. I should mention that there is also in the same
church another monument of a bishop (as is shown by the still
distinguishable mitre and crozier), which is also stated to be his. I
have been informed that where a monument was surmounted by a
representation of an emaciated corpse (emblematic of the poverty of
spirit in which the original was supposed to live and die), it was usual
to erect a second effigy, representing the departed as he actually
appeared to his fellow men. This last sentence I must however put in the
form of a Query, in the hope that some of your correspondents may answer
it with special reference to the supposed tomb, or tombs, of Bishop
Tully?

    SELEUCUS.

There are two monuments of the description respecting which BURIENSIS
desires information in the county of Devon. One against the south wall
of the chancel of Feniton Church, is an elegant altar tomb ornamented
with quatrefoils, on which lies the effigy in a shroud, tied at the head
and feet. This may be assigned to the thirteenth century, but nothing
appears to indicate whether it is the monument of a priest or of one of
the Malherbe family, who were the lords of the soil. The other similar
monument is in the north aisle of the choir of Exeter Cathedral, and is
of later date. The skeleton figure lies on a slab in a recess under an
obtuse arch, all highly decorated with tracery, panels, and foliage.
This is said to be to the memory of Canon Parkhouse, buried in 1540. See
_Gough. Sepulch. Mon._ Introd. p. 111.; and Britton's _Exeter
Cathedral_, p. 139., and plate xxii.

    J. D. S.

In the north aisle of Exeter Cathedral there is an instance similar to
that mentioned by your correspondent, BURIENSIS, of a monument with the
figure of a human skeleton lying at full length on a winding sheet. The
following inscription is over the arch:

      "Ista figura docet: nos omnes premeditari
      Qualiter ipsa nocet: mors quando venit dominari."

Tradition ascribes it to Bishop Lacy's tomb, and the vergers even at the
present day inform visitors that it was erected to commemorate his
attempt to fast during Lent. It is an exquisite piece of work. An
engraving of it may be found in Britton's _Exeter Cathedral_. I have
heard that there is a similar monument in Salisbury Cathedral, and it
appears probable, from there being more than one, that it was a
favourite device to represent the instability of human grandeur.

    EXONIENSIS.

There is a tradition similar to that related by BURIENSIS, and alike
unfounded, concerning Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln, who is buried on the
north side of the choir of Lincoln cathedral in a chapel of his own
foundation. On the floor is an image of a decayed skeleton-like body; on
the tomb above, his effigy arrayed in his episcopal robes.

    K. P. D. E.

I would remind your correspondent BURIENSIS of the splendid monument in
Winchester cathedral, beneath which are deposited the remains of Richard
Fox, Bishop of Winchester, and founder of Corpus Christi College,
Oxford, who died here on the 14th of September, 1528. In an oblong
niche, under the third arch, lies the figure of Bishop Fox, represented
as an emaciated corpse in a winding-sheet, with his feet resting on a
skull. It is a tradition of the vergers that he died whilst endeavouring
to imitate the example of Our Lord by a fast of forty days.

The figure of Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, is also
represented, like that of Fox, as a skeleton; and the same tale of a
forty days' fast traditionally delivered by the same authorities.

BURNING FERN BRINGS RAIN.

(Vol. v., p. 242.)

Your correspondent [Greek: m] asks whether any traces of such a popular
belief exist at present.

In the Highlands of Scotland, where at this season the heather is burned
by the shepherds, the belief is general among the people; I may add that
it is a belief founded on observation. In Australia a hot wind blowing
from the north caused (in part at least) by bush fires in the interior,
is invariably succeeded by rain from the opposite part.

It would not be difficult, perhaps, to assign a satisfactory reason for
a meteorological fact, which by a misnomer is dubbed "Folk Lore."

    W. C.

It is believed in the neighbourhood of Melrose that burning the heather
brings rain.

It must be remarked that Tweeddale runs mainly west and east; that the
heather-covered hills are all to the _west_ of this place. West wind
brings rain.

    [+]

In the north of England, and in Scotland, and probably in all moorland
districts of the country, it is the practice of shepherds in spring,
when the heather is dry enough, to set fire to it and burn large tracts
of it, in order to get rid of the old woody plants. The young heather
which springs up from the roots produces much better and more palatable
food for the sheep. In this process, which takes place at the same time
in a whole district (viz. when there has been no rain for some time),
the whole air becomes loaded with smoke, and a very misty state of the
atmosphere is produced. It is the general belief throughout the south of
Scotland and in the Cheviot range, that this burning "doth draw downe
rain."

Luckily this season, though there has been much moor burning, the
general expectation has been agreeably disappointed, and the weather has
now continued perfectly dry for several weeks, and appears likely to do
so for some time to come, to the great delight of the farmers, as most
propitious for sowing their grain of all kinds.

THE FISH CALLED "VENDACE."

(Vol. iii., p. 301.)

A short time since, an eminent naturalist directed my attention to
Yarrell's _History of British Fishes_ (2 vols. 8vo. 1836, and
_Supplement_, 1839), with reference to this curious fish.

Mr. Yarrell does not attempt to identify the vendace with any foreign
species, nor to answer the question, who introduced them in Lochmaben?
However, his account of the other species of the genus _Coregonus_ in
Great Britain is well worth giving.

The species of the genus _Coregonus_ are numerous in Europe, and several
of them are so similar to each other that they are often confounded.

  "Some writers have even considered the Vendisse of Lochmaben as
  the same with the _Powan_ of [Loch Lomond] Perthshire, the
  _Schelly_ of Cumberland, the _Gwyniad_ of Wales, and the _Pollan_
  of Ireland. This is not the case, for the Pollan of Ireland is
  distinct from the two species of _Coregonus_ found in Great
  Britain."

  "The _Gwyniad_ is very numerous in Ulswater and other large lakes
  of Cumberland, where on account of its large scales it is called
  the _Schelly_. The fish is not unlike a herring in appearance; the
  Welsh term _Gwyniad_ has reference to their silvery white colour."

Izaak Walton notices it at the end of chap. xiii.:

  "Nor would I have you ignorant of a rare fish called a _Guiniad_,"
  &c.

The _Pollan_ is principally found in Loch Neagh, also in Loch Derg and
Loch Erne. Mr. Thompson, of Belfast, says:

  "The habits of this fish do not, with the exception of having been
  in some instances taken with the artificial fly, differ in any
  marked respect from those of the Vendace of Scotland, or the
  Gwyniad of Wales, and are in accordance with such species of
  Continental Europe as are confined to inland waters, and of whose
  history we have been so fully informed by Bloch."

In 1835, Mr. Thompson published some observations on this species. The
earliest notice of it that he has seen, occurs, he says, in Harris's
_History of County Down_, 1744.

  "The Vendace or Vendis (_Coregonus Willughbii_); Vendace,
  _Jardine_; Vangis and Juvangis, Penn, _Brit. Zool._, vol. iii. p.
  420.; Vendace, Knox, _Trans. R.S.E._, vol. xii. p. 503.

  "But little is known of this delicate fish," says Mr. Yarrell,
  "beyond what has been published by Sir William Jardine, Bart., in
  the 3rd volume of the _Edinb. Journal of Nat. and Geog. Science_,
  and by Dr. Knox. The Vendace is only known in the lochs in the
  neighbourhood of Lochmaben, in Dumfriesshire. Sir W. Jardine says,
  'The story that it was introduced into these lochs by the
  unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots, is mentioned by Pennant in his
  description of the Gwyniad, (and it is likely that his information
  was derived from this vicinity,) and is still in circulation. That
  the fish was introduced from some continental lake, I have little
  doubt, but would rather attribute the circumstance to some of the
  religious establishments which at one time prevailed in the
  neighbourhood, and which were well known to pay considerable
  attention both to the table and cellar. The introduction must have
  taken place by means of spawn: the fish themselves could not be
  transported alive even a few miles. They are not confined to the
  castle loch, but are found in several others, some of which have
  no communication with that where they are thought peculiar. In
  general habits, the Vendace nearly resemble the Gwyniad, and
  indeed most of the allied species of the genus."

Mr. Yarrell gives representations of two magnified specimens of their
food.

MACARONIC POETRY.

(Vol. v., p. 166.)

Perhaps some of the correspondents of "N. & Q." who take an interest in
this style of composition are not acquainted with the two following
productions, which appeared at Oxford several years ago, the author of
the first being an accomplished first-class man, and, I think, a member
of Worcester College:

1. "Viae per Angliam ferro stratae." (The Railroads);

2. "Poema Canino-Anglico-Latinum, super adventu recenti serenissimarum
Principum." (The Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria.)

The perusal of MR. CORNISH'S curious communication (Vol. v., p. 251.)
also reminds me of the subjoined clever and amusing verses which were
written by a talented friend and schoolfellow, whose premature decease
occurred about two years ago, and which appear to be well worthy of
publication. It will be seen that the words, which are all Latin, are
quite unconnected and unmeaning, but when separated or united they
become converted into our own language, or rather into a mixture of
English and Irish. I have thought it absolutely necessary to annex a
key.

      MY MOLLY AND I.

      O Paty O'Toole is a rascally fellow,
      He beat his wife's head, and said, "I hope you are well, O!"
      With his knocks, Sir, she has in her body not a whole limb,--
      A mighty great sin I must own it is of him.
      "Pray say, Sir, do tell us, how is it," says he,
      "My Molly and I cannot ever agree?"
      Your Molly and you cannot ever agree:
      Very true, so I hope you will listen to me;
      The _rason_ is plain, "O come, Hymen" (you said it),
      Do ye tie us togather. So Hymen he did it.
      Since your marriage to Mary now 'tis alter'd, alas!
      All you do is to _trate_ your dear spouse as an ass.
      "O Patrick! you vixen," says Molly, and why?
      You hit her a very great stroke in her eye.
      Ah Molly! her heart I fear _proke_ as 'twere in two it is!
      Woes me! for departed away sure her beauty is.
      Thus the _rason_ is plain, as well you may see,
      Why your Molly and you cannot ever agree.
      Be to Molly indulgent and _swate_ as a jelly,--
      Pay respect to her sex, you know women are silly:
      "Quite at your service, I am," say to her as you pat her,
      "How d'ye do, Misses Molly, and what is the matter?
      Arah, my honey! stay, 'tis, wait a bit, d'ye see;--
      O Mary, my _dary_, come _spake_ to me:
      A-going away is't you are, well you no more I'll lick,
      O Mary, my _dary_, come _pack_ to your Patrick."
      Behave, I advise you, and so shall you see,
      Your Molly and you may for ever agree.

_Cooper's Miniatures of Cromwell_ (Vol. iv., p. 368.; Vol. v., pp. 17.
92. 189. 234. 255.).--Eight years ago I saw, at the house of my friend,
A. Macdonald, Esq., since deceased, but then living in Hyde Park Square,
three miniatures, which were said to be by Cooper, of Cromwell and his
two daughters. The miniatures of the women were, I thought, stiff and
harsh; but that of their father (of which only the head was finished)
appeared to me to be the finest painting of the kind that I ever saw. I
examined it through a strong magnifying glass, when the face exhibited
all the truth and force of a portrait. A high value was set upon it; but
I do not know whether it was sold, or where it is.

  [We take this opportunity of stating that we have availed ourself
  of General Fox's invitation, and examined the beautiful miniature
  of Cromwell, described by him in our Number for the 6th instant,
  and so considerately left by him at Colnaghi's, for the inspection
  of all who are interested in the subject. The General having
  placed beside it the volume of Carlyle's _Cromwell_, containing
  the engraving from Cooper's miniature in the possession of
  Archdeacon Berners, we are bound to agree with him that the
  Archdeacon's may be "better painted;" but General Fox may
  certainly congratulate himself upon being the possessor of a work
  of very high art, as well as of great historical interest; and one
  which we are extremely pleased to have had the opportunity of
  examining. It will, we believe, remain on view until the 31st.]

_The Vellum-bound Junius_ (Vol. iii., p. 262.).--Your correspondent MR.
HAGGARD tells us, that from the time he read the private correspondence
between Junius and Woodfall he has examined all book catalogues that
came in his way, in the hope of finding a copy, or the copy, "bound in
vellum"--so bound by Woodfall, for and at the express desire of Junius.
Of course the edition so bound was "the author's edition," as Junius
calls it, the edition of 1772, printed by H. J. Woodfall. At last, says
MR. HAGGARD, "_the long-wished-for object appeared at the Stowe sale_;"
but though, he bid eight pounds, he was not so fortunate as to obtain
it. Thus far all is simple and clear enough. But then MR. HAGGARD
subsequently informs us (Vol. iii., p. 307.) that the reason of his
"being so desirous to procure this copy" was, because it was "not only
bound in vellum, but was printed on that article"--that is, as I
understand it, because it was _not_ the copy bound by Woodfall for
Junius. I am at a loss to reconcile these statements. However, as I
observe by the periodicals that MR. HAGGARD'S first statement is getting
into circulation, and that it now assumes this form--that the
vellum-bound copy of Junius presented by Woodfall to Junius was sold at
the Stowe sale, I think it right to state, that the Stowe copy, printed
on and bound in vellum, was, as I am informed on good authority, not the
edition of 1772--not a Woodfall edition at all--but the common
illustrated edition, printed more than thirty years after, by Bensley,
for Vernor and Hood.

_Sept_ (Vol. v., p. 277.).--Dr. Ogilvie's derivation is absurdly
far-fetched. _Sept_ is notoriously from the Latin _septus_ or _septum_,
_inclosed_, _an inclosure_, and it is applied to one kindred or family
living in or round the inclosure in which they herded their cattle. See
Spenser's _Ireland_; see also Cole's _Dictionary_:

  "SEPT, an inclosure; the multitude of the same name in Ireland."

In ancient Rome certain classes of voters were called _Septs_, from the
_septa_ or _inclosures_ in which they were arranged.

_Many Children_ (Vol. v., p. 204.).--I am indebted to the Rev. J.
Sanford, orderly preacher at the Rolls chapel, for the subjoined curious
statement, which you may add, if you please, to the instances of female
fecundity already recorded in your pages.

The Marchese Frescobaldi, the representative of one of the most ancient
Florentine families, is still possessed of a portrait of his ancestress,
Dionora Salviati, wife of Bartolomeo Frescobaldi of the same house. She
gave birth to fifty-two children, never less than three at a time; and
there is a tradition in the family that she once had six, and that
twelve were reared. The portrait was painted by the celebrated Bronzino,
who died in 1570, and has recorded the remarkable circumstance in the
following inscription placed under the picture, and in some degree has
thus made himself responsible for the authenticity of the story:--

  "Dionora Salviati moglie di Bartolomeo dei Frascobaldi, fece 52
  figli, e mai meno di tre per parto, come riferesce Gio. Schenzio
  nei libri delle osservazioni amirabili, cioe nel libro quarto de
  Parto a carta 144."

    BRAYBROOKE.

Relative to extraordinary births, I may mention that within half a dozen
miles of this city, and not more than six weeks since, a poor woman gave
birth to four children, two of each sex, and all, with the mother, doing
well. Some millions are born without such, as I may term it, a
phenomenon.

In a very late Brussells paper I find it stated, that in nine years the
wife of a tradesman had twenty-four children, three on each
delivery,--"chose desesperante (it is added) pour le mari, qui desirait
transmettre son nom, car c'etaient toutes des filles." Mercier, in his
_Tableau de Paris_ (1786) quotes _L'Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences_
of the preceding century for a similar fact, where it is asserted that a
baker's wife had twenty-one children in seven years, three at each
birth, and that he had again three children at a birth by a servant
maid.

_Hog's Norton_ (Vol. v., p. 245.).--Your correspondent who writes from
Ashby-de-la-Zouch will, it is probable, be surprised to find that _Hog's
Norton_ is almost in his own immediate neighbourhood. In Curtis'
_Topographical History of Leicestershire_ (printed, by-the-bye, at
Ashby), he subjoins to the modern names of places the ancient names as
found in _Domesday Book_, Inquisitiones post mortem, &c. It appears that
_Norton juxta Twycross_ was in other days "Nortone, Hoggenortone, Hog's
Norton." There is, then, no doubt as to which of the many Nortons in
England is Hog's Norton: but whether there is now, or ever was, an organ
in the church; or whether a Mr. Pigge, or any number of _pigs_, played
on one there, I know not.

  "Historical Notes concerning certain Illnesses, the Death, and
  Dis-interment of Oliver Cromwell, by W. White Cooper, F.R.C.S."

_Eliza Fenning_ (Vol. v., pp. 105. 161.).--It is long after the "N. &

(what may probably have been already done) the very great importance of
obtaining from the workhouse, or wherever else in Suffolk or Essex it
can be obtained, an authentication of the report by Turner, that he was
the poisoner of the family in Chancery Lane, for which crime Eliza
Fenning was executed. One would hope that a question of so much and such
serious monument would not be permitted to remain undetermined, if by
any possibility it can be cleared up.

I well knew the medical man who attended the case, and gave evidence at
the trial,--he was cruelly assailed afterwards by some who had taken a
prejudice against him, and no doubt suffered in his practice in
consequence.

person in the appendix to Tytler's _History of Scotland_, reign of Queen
Mary. There is a letter there from the English ambassador at Paris to
his Court, with an account of the Queen Dowager's visit to France: he
mentions that King Henry had been captivated by one of the ladies in
Mary's train, who, it was reported, was with child to him. The frail
fair one left with her mistress, but returned shortly thereafter. I
think she must be the person referred to in the _Grey Friars'
Chronicle_.

and eight or ten feet high, and fitted up as a place of worship, with a
font, altar, seats, &c. I hope some one who has seen it will be able yet
to throw some light on the subject.

got outside the breakwater, she was recalled by the Port-admiral, and
did not leave again until the next day: it was to take in the mail-bags,
but the firm belief of the men was, that the gallant admiral purposely
left something behind to avoid going to sea on such an unlucky day as
Friday.

William Smith's _New Dictionary of Classical Geography_ may be expected
to supply the desideratum, in regard to places known to the Greeks and
Romans, but will not, I presume, take up all the names in Baudrand's
_Dictionary_. Its title-page reads as follows:

  "Novum Lexicon Geographicum, in quo universi orbis oppida, urbes,
  regiones, provinciae, regna, emporia, academiae, metropoles, flumina
  et maria, _antiquis et recentibus nominibus appellata_, suisque

_Gospel Trees_ (Vol. ii., p. 407.; Vol. v., p. 157.).--BURIENSIS, in a
recent Number, says that he has somewhere read of a tree called the
"Gospel Elm." May, in his _Guide to Stratford-upon-Avon_, published
about twenty years since, gives the following description of an elm,
which is probably the one referred to by your correspondent. After
describing the hamlet of Bishopton, he writes:

  "In varying our return to Stratford, pursuing thus the path along
  the Henley road, we pass at the town's entrance the now decaying
  'Gospel Tree,' that still indicates the boundary of the borough in
  this direction, towards the 'Dove house close.' In a perambulation
  of the boundaries, made here on the 7th of April, 1591[3], this
  elm--judging from its now decayed and weather-beaten aspect--is
  the one there noted as seated on the boundary in this direction,
  whence the line is therein stated as continuing, to 'the two elms
  in Evesham highway.' Such a perambulation was anciently made
  yearly, during Rogation week, by the clergy, magistrates, and
  burgesses; not omitting, for evidence' sake, the boys of the
  grammar school, who then doubtless received, as still is
  customary, some _sensitive_ reminiscences of local
  limitation."--May's _Guide to Stratford-upon-Avon_, p. 92.

  [Footnote 3: "Presentment" in the possession of R. Wheler, Esq.]

The author gives a very plausible reason for the tree's peculiar name,
in the ensuing remark:

  "When the bound mark was a tree, as in the present instance, a
  passage of Scripture was read beneath its branches, a collect was
  recited, and a psalm was sung. Hence its sacred designation, long
  retained, but now well nigh forgotten."--_Ibid._ p. 93.

    SOUTHAMIENSIS.

_Gospel Oaks_ (Vol. v., p. 209.).--Near the hamlet of Cressage, co.
Salop, is a very old oak tree, under which tradition says the first
missionaries of the Gospel to this land preached. The name of the
hamlet, _Cressage_, is, I have been told, a contraction of _Christ's
Oak_.

There is also, near Dudley, a place called _Round Oak_; and on the road
between Walsall and Lichfield, near the latter, may still be seen the
old _Shire Oak_.

At _Stanford's Bridge_, co. Worcester, is a place called the _Apostles'
Oak_; and in the parish of _Hartlebury_, in the same county, is a tree
bearing the name of the _Mitre Oak_. Both these places, and also a
_Rock_, have contended for the honour of being the scene of the
conference of St. Augustine and the British bishops, A.D. 603. (Nash,
vol. ii. p. 399.)

_Wild Oats_ (Vol. v., p. 227.).--I think I can give a clue to the Query
of BEAU NASH respecting the origin of this phrase. In Kent, if a person
has been talking at random, it is not uncommon to hear it said, "you are
talking _havers_," or _folly_. Now I find in an old dictionary that the
word _havers_ means _oats_; and therefore I conclude, that the phrase
"to sow your wild oats" means nothing more than "to sow folly."

_Traditions of a Remote Period--The Chamberlaine Family_ (Vol. v., p.
77.).--As an instance of the "few links" required to connect the present
time with a remote period, I may mention that a grand-aunt of mine who
lived far into the year 1843, remembered perfectly her "uncle
Chamberlaine,"[4] who was an officer in King James II.'s army, and who
fought at Aughrim and at Limerick, thus connecting in her own person the
days of the "Monster Meetings" with those of the Revolution of 1688. She
remembered many of the old soldier's anecdotes of the stirring times in
which he lived, and I now regret having been so careless as not to have
taken any Note of them. He was, I believe, the last of his race. I hold
his commission, signed by the celebrated Tyrconnell, and also many old
deeds, some of which are prior to the reign of Richard II., and of which
he was said to be very careful, though on examination they have proved
to be of no value, except as antiques.

  [Footnote 4: Her grand-uncle.]

_English Translation of the Canons_ (Vol. v., p. 246.).--The Queries of
M. on this subject have arisen out of an error, which I fancy must be
his own. After quoting the clause of the 36th Canon, _quodque eodem
taliter uti liceat_, he says:

  "The English translation, to which subscription is now made, has
  the following rendering of the second clause: 'And that the same
  may be lawfully used.' The word 'taliter' seems to be not rendered
  at all."

Of course I cannot tell on what authority he says this; but he is
certainly wrong: for in the Oxford edition (1844) of the _Homilies and
Canons_ this clause stands thus: "and that it may lawfully _so_ be
used." And so it is printed in Hodgson's _Instructions_, p. 8., and in
the Instructions to be observed by Candidates for Holy Orders in the
Diocese of London: and I myself not long ago subscribed to it in this
form. There is then no difference here at all; the Latin being rendered
by the English, not only fully, but literally. I will only add, that the
grammatical meaning of _taliter_, or _so_, appears to me in this place
to be plain enough, without requiring a "theological controversy" to
determine it.

_"Arborei foetus alibi," &c._ (Vol. v., pp. 58. 189.).--I am afraid
I did not make myself intelligible in my former communication. Certainly
W. A. C. does not understand me. The question is, are we justified in
translating _alibi atque_ "otherwhere than," in like manner as we
translate _aliter atque_ "otherwise than?" W. A. C. takes for granted
that the line in question refers to only one district. But that is the
very point in doubt. The "head master's" translation makes it refer to
two.

_Horn-blowing_ (Vol. v., p. 148.).--In reference to this practice, I may
state that a similar custom prevails here (Gainsborough, Lincolnshire),
but on the 29th May, or "Royal Oak Day." For some days previously the
boys collect all the birds' eggs they can find or purchase, and early in
the morning of the 29th, they may be seen returning from the woods in
crowds, with an ample supply of oak. They next procure a large quantity
of flowers, with which they construct a garland in the form of a crown,
the apples of the oak being all gilded, surrounded by flowers and
festoons of birds' eggs. The garland is then suspended across the
street, and every little urchin being provided with a horn, some the
natural horn of the cow, others of tin, similar to those formerly used
by the guard of the mail coaches, they keep up throughout the day a most
terrible blowing of horns; the doleful noise being ill in accordance
with the festivity and rejoicing which the garlands are presumed to
indicate. I have been unable to learn the origin or import of this
singular custom.

"_God's Love_" (Vol. v., p. 272.).--If T. S. will refer to Wood's
_Athenae Oxon._, vol. iii. col. 698. edit. 4to., he will find all account
of the author of _God's Love_. Wood records an edition of 1659. In the
_Bibliotheca Anglo-Poetica_, No. 594., was one dated 1679; but I have
now before me the _first_, which neither Wood nor his editor appear to
have heard of. The title:

  "God's Love and Man's Vnworthiness: whereunto is annexed a
  Discourse between the Soul and Satan. With several Divine
  Ejaculations. Written by John Quarles. London: Printed for John
  Stafford, and are to be sold at his house in S. Bride's
  Church-yard; and by Humphrey Moseley, at the Prince's Armes, in
  St. Paul's Church-yard; and John Holder, at the Blue Anchor, in
  the New Exchange. 1651."

Collation: the minde of the frontispiece: 8 lines verse. The
frontispiece, or engraved title: _God's Loue, Man's Vnworthiness_, by
Io. Qu. "Lord, what is man," &c. _Ps._ viii. 4. An engraved portrait of
the author, kneeling and saying, "O giue salvation vnto Israell out of
Sion!" (this unknown to Granger or Bromley: the latter records _three_
other portraits of the author.) Then the title, as given before. The
dedication: "To my much honoured and esteemed Friend, Edward Benlowes,
Esq." To the Reader. To my Muse: "Tel me, presumptuous Muse, how dar'st
thou treat." _God's Love_, &c., pp. 1. to 66. A Dialogue, &c., pp. 67.
to 108. Pp. 109, 110. wanting in my copy, but probably blank, as the
catch-word "Divine" agrees with "Divine Ejaculations," which commence
on p. 111. and end at p. 160., thus concluding the volume.

_Plague Stones_ (Vol. v., p. 226.).--One of these stones is (I believe)
still standing at Bury Saint Edmunds. In a paper read to the Bury and
West Suffolk Arch. Inst. (vide vol. i. p. 42. of the _Society's
Proceedings_) Mr. S. Tymms says:

  "The small-pox has been a frequent visitor of Bury in its most
  terrible forms. In 1677, says Gillingwater (_Hist. Bury_, 226.),
  it was so prevalent that the people resorting to the market by the
  Rislygate Road, were accustomed to dip their money in water
  (tradition says vinegar) which had been placed in _the cavity of
  the ruined base of the boundary cross_ situate at the bottom of
  Chalk Lane, with the view of preventing any infection being
  conveyed to the neighbouring towns and villages."

My attention has been frequently called to a stone of similar
description standing in the parish of Stuston in this county, by the
side of the Ipswich and Norwich turnpike; it is called in Kirby's
_Suffolk Traveller_, 1st ed. pp. 52-3., a "Stuston Stone" and "The White
Stone," and is nearly equidistant from Diss and Eye, between two and
three miles.

  "Sed neque Cygni canunt," says Leland, in his _Cygnea Cantio_,
  "nisi flante zephyro vento geniali quidem illo, si quicquam Aeliani
  judicio tribuendum."

In the work itself, which is a poetical panegyric on King Henry VIII.,
the following lines occur:

      "Strepitum dedit sonorum
      Cygnorum niveus chorus canentum,
      Concussis alacri vigore pennis.
      Applausus placuit mihi canorus."

The last line, however, seems only to apply to the applauding sound of
the wings, and not to intimate that any music was produced by them.

_Cimmerii_ (Vol. v., p. 188.).--The belief that the Cymry are descended
from Gomer can prove very little as to the restlessness of those who
hold it; and if it is making progress, the opinion must be supported by
probability: consequently a mere denial will not dispel the illusion.
Authors quite as remarkable for their matter-of-fact opinions as A. N.
may be, have not rejected the connexion of the Cymry with Gomer. For
instance, Volney, in his attacks on Scripture history, when examining
Gen. x. on Gomer, adopts an argument in support of this paternity,
though not in its Biblical sense, viewing Gomer as a chief. As it is not
an unusual circumstance for a nation to adopt the name of its patriarch
or founder (and on this point I would refer to a note to Gibbon's
_Decline_, chap. lxiv.), I trust I shall be excused for believing myself
descended from Gomer, until decided evidence is adduced that I am not.

Pompeius Festus I am unacquainted with; but on consulting Plutarch, in
Mario, the following contradictory statements may be seen: "The Germans
called banditti _Cimbri_;" and, "Hence, therefore, these barbarians who
came into Italy first issued; being anciently called _Cimmerii_, and
afterwards _Cimbri_, and the appellation was _not at all from their
manners_."

That the old Germans may have called robbers _Cimbri_, does not prove
that word implies _robbers_, or anything of the kind; but it indicates
that the intrusion of the old Germans on the lands of the Cimbri caused
the invaded to make reprisals on the invaders; and then the injured
Germans connected or identified the Cimbrian name with that of enemy or
robber.

_Stoke_ (Vol. v., pp. 106. 161. 213.).--I think that the towns and
parishes of _Tawstock_, _Culmstock_, _Tavistock_, _Plymstock_, _Stockton
on Tees_, _Severn Stoke_, _Stoke in Teignhead_, _Stoke on Tern_, _Stoke
on Trent_, must have received their names from a _stockade_ of some kind
_in_ the rivers near which they are situated. There is at a ford across
the river Severn, about half a mile from Welsh Pool, a weir made of
stakes and brushwood erected a few yards above the ford, for the sole
purpose of diminishing the force of the current, and spreading the water
into a stream of an uniform depth. I conjecture that in ancient times
the fords of our larger rivers were kept in a passable state during the
winter season by weirs of this description, and that there were fords in
the rivers at the places above mentioned. There is near Nuneaton the
chapelry of _Stock in Ford_, but I am not sufficiently acquainted with
that place to be able to conjecture from what circumstance it may have
derived its name. I infer that one meaning of the word _stoke_ is _wood_
of any kind, from the fact that the opening through which coals are
introduced under the larger boilers in our houses is called a
_stoke-hole_, from the wood formerly used for fuel.

_King's College Chapel Windows_ (Vol. v., p 276.).--See Blomefield's
_History of Norfolk_, vol. i. p. 406., and vol. ii. p. 388. At the
latter reference, under the head of Richard Nykke or Nix, Bishop of
Norwich, 1500, occurs this passage: "This bishop incurred a premunire
for extending his jurisdiction over the Mayor of Thetford, and was fined
for it. With part of the fine, it is said, the beautiful windows in
King's College Chapel, Cambridge, were purchased." The statement is
given at greater length at the first of the above-quoted references. I
never heard of the story before I met with it in Blomefield.

    T. H. L.

Mr. Blomefield, referring to Richard Nykke, Bishop of Norwich
(1500-1535), says he incurred a premunire for extending his
jurisdiction over the Mayor of Thetford, "and was fined for it, with
part of which fine _'tis said_ the beautiful painted glass windows in
King's College Chapel at Cambridge were purchased."--_Hist. of Norfolk_,
8vo. edit., ii. 52.; iii. 546.

There is good foundation for the statement that this bishop "was
condemned in the premunire" (Coke's _Reports_, xii. 40, 41.); but I
question if there be authentic evidence that he "redeemed the punishment
of that offence by the glasing of the King's College Chappell windows in
Cambridge." Bishop Nykke is no doubt the prelate to whom Ferne alludes.

thirty-four years of age, during eight of which he had filled the office

_Game of Curling_ (Vol. v., p. 13.).--The third volume of Tytler's
_Lives of Scottish Worthies_ (No. 37. of the _Family Library_) contains
a series of antiquarian illustrations, of which the last is devoted to
"Ancient Scottish Games and Amusements." The author refers particularly
to the MS. accounts of the Lord High Treasurer during the reign of King
James IV. (1488-1513), in which, however, there appears to be no notice
of the "roaring game." The origin of this favourite amusement is
certainly involved in mystery, and I have repeatedly failed in my
endeavours to ascertain the meaning of the name by which the game is
known. On consulting the abridgment of Jamieson's _Dictionary_ for the
derivation, I find the following:--

  "Perhaps from Teut. _krollen_, _krull-en_, sinuare, flectere,
  whence E. _curl_; as the great art of the game is to make the
  stones bend or curve in towards the mark, when it is so blocked up
  that they cannot be directed in a straight line."

    E. N.

_Ancient Trees_ (Vol. iv., pp. 401. &c.).--Notwithstanding the assertion
of Dr. Johnson, many fine specimens of timber have long existed to the
north of the Tweed. At p. 20. of the _Edinburgh Antiquarian Magazine_
(Edin. 1848) will be found a "List of Scottish Trees, of remarkable
magnitude, as they existed in 1812," including numerous examples of the
oak, larch, ash, elm, beech, silver fir, Scots fir, sycamore, chesnut,
black poplar, and yew. One of the largest in the catalogue is the great
yew at Fortingal, in Perthshire, measured by the Hon. Judge Barrington
in 1768, when its circumference was no less than fifty-two feet.

    E. N.

_Paring the Nails, &c._ (Vol. v., pp. 142. &c.).--

  "Now no superfluity of our food, or in general no excrementitious
  substance, is looked upon by them (the Egyptian priests) as pure
  and clean; such, however, are all kinds of wool and down, our hair
  and our nails. It would be the highest absurdity therefore for
  those who, whilst they are in a course of purification, are at so
  much pains to take off the hair from every part of their own
  bodies, at the same time to cloath themselves with that of other
  animals. So when we are told by Hesiod 'not to pare our nails,
  whilst we are present at the festivals of the Gods,' we ought so
  to understand him as if he designed hereby to inculcate that
  purity with which we ought to come prepared, before we enter upon
  any religious duty, that we have not to make ourselves clean,
  whilst we ought to be occupied in attending to the solemnity
  itself."--Plutarch's Treatise of _Isis and Osiris_, translated by
  Squire, p. 5. 1744.

This note will show the great antiquity of these nail-paring and
hair-cutting superstitions. What is there does not come from Egypt?

TOMB OF THE TRADESCANTS.

  In Lambeth Churchyard is a Monument, once handsome and elaborately
  carved, which was erected in 1662 by the widow of JOHN TRADESCANT
  the younger, to the memory of her father-in-law, her husband, and
  her son, who were inhabitants of that parish.

  The Monument of the TRADESCANTS, which was repaired by public
  subscription in 1773, has now again fallen into decay. The
  inscription also on the stone that covers ASHMOLE'S grave, who was
  himself buried in Lambeth Church, is now very nearly effaced. The
  restoration of that Church, now nearly finished, seems a fit
  occasion for repairing both these Monuments. It is therefore
  proposed to raise a fund for the perfect restoration of the Tomb
  of the TRADESCANTS, according to its original form, as represented
  in two drawings preserved in the Pepysian Library at Cambridge,
  and also for renewing ASHMOLE'S epitaph. The cost will not be less
  than 100_l._, and assistance is earnestly requested from all who
  are anxious to preserve ancient monuments, especially those who
  are following the same pursuits as the TRADESCANTS, and who are
  daily deriving benefit and delight from the labours and
  discoveries of these first of English gardeners and naturalists.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
