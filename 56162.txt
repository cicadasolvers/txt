PREFACE.


THE ILLUSTRATED DICTIONARY OF GARDENING aims at being the best and
most complete Work on Gardening and Garden Plants hitherto published.
The aim is, indeed, a high one; but the Publisher, whose taste for
Flowers has rendered the production a labour of love, has, on his part,
spared no expense that the Typography and Illustrations should be of
a very high class. It is to be hoped that earnest efforts to attain
accuracy, by consulting the best Authorities, combined with no small
amount of original research, have contributed to render the _matter_
of the Work not unworthy of the _form_ in which it is presented to the
reader. The large number of Illustrations is an important feature;
and it is believed that the figures quoted, and the references given
to various works--in which more detailed information is contained
than is desirable, or, indeed, possible, in these pages, on account
of space--will greatly add to the interest and value of the work.
Considerable trouble has been taken in revising the tangled synonymy of
many genera, and clearing up, as much as possible, the confusion that
exists in garden literature in connection with so many plants, popular
and otherwise. In the matter of generic names, Bentham and Hooker's
recently-completed "Genera Plantarum" has, with few exceptions, been
followed; that work being the one which will, for a long time to
come, undoubtedly remain the standard authority on all that relates
to generic limitation. With regard to the nomenclature of species, I
have endeavoured to consult the latest and most trustworthy Monographs
and Floras, and to adopt the names in accordance with them. Now and
then, certain plants are described under their common garden names; but
they will, in such cases, be also found mentioned under the genus to
which they really belong. A case in point may be cited: _AnA"ctochilus
Lowii_ is given under _AnA"ctochilus_, but the name it must now bear is
_Dossinia_, and a reference to that genus will explain matters pretty
fully, as far as the present state of knowledge goes.

I am greatly indebted to Professor J. W. H. TRAIL, M.D., F.L.S.,
&c., for his valuable contributions on Insects, Fungi, and Diseases
of Plants, branches of science in which he has long been specially
interested, and in which he is an undoubted authority.

Mr. J. GARRETT, of the Royal Gardens, Kew, late of the Royal
Horticultural Society's Gardens, is responsible for Fruit and
Vegetable Culture, for most of what appertains to Florists' Flowers,
and for General Gardening Work. For information on many special
subjects--Begonias may be cited as an example--I am obliged for much
assistance to Mr. W. WATSON, also of the Royal Gardens, Kew; in fact,
the article _Begonia_, in its entirety, was written by him. Mr. W. B.
HEMSLEY, A.L.S., has, throughout, given me aid and advice; and I have
to acknowledge constant help from several other colleagues.

The Rev. PERCY W. MYLES, M.A., has taken no little trouble in working
out the correct derivations of very many of the Generic Names;
unfortunately, in a number of instances, lack of time prevented me from
obtaining the benefit of his knowledge. I have to record my gratitude
for help in so difficult a task, this special study being one to which
Mr. MYLES has paid much attention.

REFERENCE TO ILLUSTRATIONS OF PLANTS OTHER THAN THOSE FIGURED IN THIS
WORK.


    It has been suggested, by an eminent Authority, that many readers
    would be glad to be informed where reliable Illustrations could be
    found of those Plants which are not figured in this Work. To meet
    this want, references to the figures in Standard Authorities have
    been given, the titles of the Works referred to being, for economy
    of space, abbreviated as follows:

THE

DICTIONARY OF GARDENING,

An EncyclopA|dia of Horticulture.


    The following are the Abbreviations used:--_fl._ flowers; _fr._
    fruit; _l._ leaves; _h._ height; _deg._ degrees; _rhiz._ rhizomes;
    _cau._ caudex; _sti._ stipes.

    The Asterisks (*) indicate plants that are especially good or
    distinct.


=A.= In compound words from the Greek the initial _a_ has usually a
privative meaning; as _aphyllus_, without leaves; _acaulis_, without a
stem, &c.

=AARON'S BEARD.= _See_ =Hypericum calycinum= and =Saxifraga sarmentosa=.

=AARON'S ROD.= _See_ =Verbascum Thapsus=.

=ABELE TREE.= White Poplar. _See_ =Populus alba=.

=ABELIA= (named after Dr. Clarke Abel, Physician to Lord Amherst's
Embassy to China, in 1817, and author of a "Narrative of a Journey
to China" (1818); died 1826). ORD. _CaprifoliaceA|_. Very ornamental
shrubs. Corolla tubular, funnel-shaped, five-lobed. Leaves petiolate,
dentately crenated. Well suited for the cold greenhouse, either as
trellis or pot plants; free-flowering when well grown, and of easy
culture. May be treated in sheltered and warm climates as hardy; and
can be grown out of doors during summer in less favoured spots. They
thrive in a compost of peat and loam in equal parts, to which a small
quantity of silver sand may be added. Increased by cuttings in summer,
and by layers in spring, under a frame. Only two species, _floribunda_
and _rupestris_, are much grown in England.

    =A. floribunda= (many-flowered).* _fl._ rosy-purple, about 2in.
    long, in axillary clusters. March. _l._ opposite, oblong. _h._ 3ft.
    Mexico, 1842. The best and freest flowering evergreen species.

    =A. rupestris= (rock).* _fl._ sweet-scented, small, pink, in
    pairs at the ends of the branches; sepals of leafy texture, with
    a reddish tinge. September. _l._ small, oblong. _h._ 5ft. China,
    1844. A deciduous, branching, hairy shrub.

    =A. serrata= (serrate-leaved). _fl._ pretty pale red,
    sweet-scented, very large, in one-flowered terminal peduncles;
    sepals leafy. March. _h._ 3ft. China, 1844. A fine evergreen
    species.

    =A. triflora= (three-flowered).* _fl._ pale yellow, tinged with
    pink, small, arranged in threes at the ends of the branches; sepals
    long and linear, clothed with long hairs. September. _l._ small,
    lanceolate. _h._ 5ft. Hindostan, 1847. A small evergreen branching
    shrub.

=ABERRANT.= Deviating from the natural or direct way; applied, in
natural history, to species or genera that deviate from the usual
characters of their allies.

=ABIES= (from _abeo_, to rise; alluding to the aspiring habit of
growth of the tree; or, according to some, from _apios_, a Pear-tree,
in allusion to the form of the fruit). Spruce Fir. The synonymy of
this genus is much confused, plants belonging to several genera being
frequently referred to _Abies_ in nurserymen's catalogues and gardening
periodicals. ORD. _ConiferA|_. A genus of about twenty-five species,
widely distributed over the mountainous regions of the Northern

or greenhouse plants, having solitary axillary diA"cious flowers, and
finely divided leaves. The only species in cultivation is a very pretty
half-hardy climbing perennial, having a fleshy root about 1ft. or more
beneath the surface of the soil. It thrives well in warm sunny spots,
and in a light soil; seeds may be sown in pots or pans of light soil
early in April; the young plants can be planted out about the middle
of June. The fleshy tuberous roots may be stored during winter in a
greenhouse or frame. _See_ also =Gourds=.

    =A. viridiflora= (green-flowered). _fl._ pale green, fragrant;
    females succeeded by small oval scarlet fruits, which are about
    as large as a filbert. _l._ dark green, glossy, much divided into
    narrow segments. South America. A rapid growing plant, admirably
    adapted for training over arbours or trellis-work. It is a very
    pretty form of ornamental gourd.

=ABORTION.= An imperfect formation, or the non-formation of an organ;
any fruit or produce that does not come to maturity, or anything which
fails in its progress before it is matured, frequently from a defect in
the male or female flowers.

=ABRAXAS GROSSULARIATA.= _See_ =Gooseberry or Magpie Moth=.

=ABRICOCK.= A former mode of writing Apricot.

hairy lobed leaves, and extra axillary or terminal few-flowered
peduncles. Of easy culture, in a stove temperature, in loam and peat
soil. Propagated by seeds or cuttings, the former sown in March, the
latter made in April from half-ripened wood, and placed under a bell
glass.

=ABRONIA= (from _abros_, delicate; referring to its involucrum).
Sand Verbena. ORD. _NyctaginaceA|_. A small genus of seven species,
mostly natives of California, four of which only are known in general
cultivation. They are of a dwarf trailing habit, producing showy
blossoms in dense verbena-like clusters. Corolla funnel-shaped; limb
spreading. They succeed best in light sandy soil, in a position fully
exposed; if well drained, the rockery is perhaps the best place.
Increased by seeds, the outer skin of which should be peeled off before
sowing; sow during autumn in pots of sandy soil, and keep in a frame
until the following spring, when they may be placed in their flowering
quarters; or by young cuttings, set in spring, and also in sandy soil.

    but under greenhouse culture it is a perennial. SYN. _Tricratus
    admirabilis_. See Fig 1.

=ABRUPT.= Suddenly terminating, as abruptly pinnate; when pinnate
leaves are without a terminal or odd leaflet.

=ABRUS= (from _abros_, soft, in reference to the extreme softness of
the leaves). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A very ornamental and delicate much
branched deciduous stove climber, whose roots have the virtues of
the common liquorice. Leaves abruptly pinnate, bearing many pairs of
leaflets. Requires a strong heat to keep it in a growing, healthy
condition, and to flower it well; and thrives best in sandy loam.
Increased by cuttings under a hand glass, in sand, or seeds raised in
heat.

    =A. precatorius= (prayer). _fl._ pale purple, butterfly-shaped,
    disposed in axillary clusters. Seeds bright scarlet, with a black
    spot at the base, used by the Buddhists for making rosaries, whence
    the specific name. March to May. _l._ leaflets ligulate, oblong.
    _h._ 12ft. East Indies, 1680. Varieties are now and then met with
    having rose coloured or white flowers.

=ABSORPTION.= The action by which liquids and gases become incorporated
with various bodies, through molecular or other invisible means, to
which function all parts of a growing plant contribute, the roots more
especially.

=ABUTA= (native name). ORD. _MenispermaceA|_. A strong growing
ornamental stove evergreen climber. Used medicinally in Cayenne.
Flowers diA"cious, fascicled, males racemosely panicled; females loose
and simply racemose. It grows freely in a mixture of loam and peat.
Cuttings will root readily if planted in a pot of sand, with a hand
glass placed over them, in heat. About half-a-dozen species are known.

    =A. rufescens= (rusty-coloured). _fl._ grey-velvety on the outside,
    dark purple on the inside. March. _l._ ovate; under surface
    brownish. _h._ 10ft. Cayenne, 1820.

=ABUTILON= (Arabic name for a plant analogous to the Marsh Mallow).
ORD. _MalvaceA|_. Very showy, decorative, and free-growing shrubs,
both for the greenhouse and outside culture. Calyx naked, five-cleft,
usually angular; style multifid at apex. The many beautiful hybrids
(of which Fig. 2 represents a group) now in cultivation, far supersede
the true species. Cultivation: Few plants are more easily grown and
worthy of liberal treatment than these. The best soil for them is equal
parts turfy loam, peat, and leaf mould, with some gritty sand. They
may either be grown in pots, or planted out; but in all cases thorough
drainage is indispensable, as they require an abundance of water,
and stagnancy must be guarded against. At the end of May they may be
planted outside, when they will flower profusely through the summer. In
a free growing and flowering state they enjoy weak manure water. From
the latter part of autumn till early spring they may be kept almost
dry without injury, though in a warm conservatory some of the later
struck plants will go on flowering throughout the greater part of the
winter; or plants may be specially prepared for winter flowering. They
are admirably adapted for forming standards of various heights, from
2ft. to 6ft. Some of the taller sorts are very useful for training
under roof rafters. As pillar plants, too, very loosely trained, so
as to allow the upper and side branches to droop to a considerable
distance from the pillar, they are very effective. Propagation: They
strike readily from cuttings made of the young wood, at almost any
season; the best time, however, is early spring and September. Inserted
in pots, in a compost of equal parts peat, leaf mould, loam, and
sand, and placed in a temperature of from 65deg. to 70deg., they will
then quickly root, and form good plants. Seeds may be sown in pans
filled with soil as recommended for cuttings, and placed in a similar
temperature. Those followed by a dagger (aEuro ) are the best for training
to pillars, roofs, &c.

The following are some of the best varieties, which, although they
do not include all the newest sorts, yet afford a good selection of
first-rate kinds, which will give general satisfaction. They are
arranged according to their respective colours. Those marked with a
dagger (aEuro ) are best for roofs and pillars.

=ACACIA= (from _ac_, a point, in Celtic; or from _akazo_, to sharpen;
many of the species are furnished with spines). _See_ also _Albizzia_.
ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Shrubs or trees, very variable in habit and leaves.
Flowers yellow, white, rarely red, disposed in globular heads or
spikes, decandrous or polyandrous. Spines stipular, scattered, or
wanting. This is a very polymorphous genus, and the majority of species
described are known in this country only from herbarium specimens. It
is very doubtful whether the entire genus is represented in our gardens
by more than about fifty species, many of which are only to be found
in botanic gardens; but this number is, without doubt, sufficiently
characteristic. The number of species is close upon 400, and the genus
one of the largest known. In our enumeration, we have strictly confined
ourselves to describing such as are unquestionably in cultivation,
and to this end we have adopted the only accurate method of deciding
which are and which are not grown, viz., by consulting the trade lists
of nurserymen, both in this country and on the Continent. Such lists,
however, are not always correct, from a scientific point of view, in
the matter of nomenclature. The species best deserving of cultivation
are all natives of Australia, New South Wales, or other temperate
regions, and are among the hardiest and most easily cultivated of all
greenhouse plants. They are very floriferous. The greenhouse species
are sufficiently hardy to withstand the winter in a temperature very
little higher than freezing point. Cultivation: Some have a tendency
to make long straight shoots; these should be selected for training
upon rafters or pillars, on which they thrive well and form splendid
ornaments in spring; whilst the more shrubby kinds will be equally
at home in pots in the form of bushes. Roots and tops grow with
great rapidity, and an abundance of water is required at all times.
Immediately after flowering (usually about May) is the best time to
prune Acacias; they may then be placed in the open air, and fully
exposed to the sun, until October. They make a far healthier, cleaner
growth, and ripen their wood much better outside than under glass; all
they require is copious waterings, never allowing them to become dry,
and keeping clear of weeds. In the first week in October house the
plants, and winter in a temperature of 40deg. to 50deg. They delight in
a light rich compost of equal parts turfy loam and leaf mould, freely
intermixed with sand, or peat may be used instead of the leaf mould.
Propagation: Cuttings of the half-ripened wood, put in with a heel,
root readily during the summer. They do not bear heat well, nor do
they require it. The soil should be equal parts peat and sand, covered
with pure sand, thoroughly consolidated. Insert the cuttings as soon
as made; water home, and leave them in the shade till dry. Then place
the bell glasses over them, shade and water so as to prevent flagging.
Pot off as soon as rooted, and keep in a close pit or house until the
plants are thoroughly established. Seeds should be sown as soon as
ripe, in sandy peat; about 1/4in. deep, or a little more, for large
seeds. A temperature of 55deg. to 60deg. suits them well. Pot off when
large enough to handle, and place in a cool close pit or house until
quite established. The culture and propagation of the stove species
are the same as for the greenhouse sorts, but the former require, of
course, greater heat. Their flowers, however, are much less frequently
produced than their more temperate congeners, consequently they are not
so much grown.

    conspicuous and ornamental feature of the plant. SYN. _A. NovA|
    ZealandiA|_. See Fig. 6.

    =A. millefolia= (myriad-leaved).* _fl._ inconspicuous. A very
    distinct species with finely-cut pale green leaves. The fruiting
    spikes of this are not collected in globular heads, as in the
    others, and their presence detract from its value as an ornamental
    plant. Otherwise, it is very graceful.

[Illustration: FIG. 6. ACA†NA MICROPHYLLA.]

    =A. myriophylla= (many-leaved).* _fl._ green, small, in rounded
    spikes. June. _l._ pinnate; leaflets deeply cut. _h._ 6in. to 1ft.
    Chili, 1828. Small, fern-like.

    =A. NovA| ZealandiA|= (New Zealand). A synonym of _A. microphylla_.

    where space is no object. It grows very rapidly, and forms handsome
    tufts.

=ACALYPHA= (the name given by Hippocrates to the Nettle). ORD.
_EuphorbiaceA|_. Stove ornamental and variegated nettle-like leaved
shrubs. Flowers greenish or reddish, inconspicuous, in erect or
drooping bracted axillary or terminal spikes; those of the upper
portion sterile, of the lower, fertile. The undermentioned only are
those most worthy of cultivation. They are very easily grown, with
ordinary stove treatment, and in a peat and loam compost. When well
cultivated, the leaves of the hybridised varieties are highly coloured,
but rather coarse than otherwise. Increased by cuttings under a glass
in sandy soil, in stove heat, during April.

    =A. Macafeeana= (Macafee's). _l._ red, blotched with bronzy
    crimson. 1877.

    margined with rosy carmine. Fiji Islands, 1875.

=ACANTHACEA†.= A large order of soft-wooded, herbaceous plants, usually
having gamopetalous axillary flowers; calyx composed of deeply
imbricated scales; bracts large, leafy.

=ACANTHEPHIPPIUM= (the derivation of this word is not apparent). ORD.
_OrchideA|_. A peculiar class of terrestrial stove orchids. Flowers
rather large, racemose, few; sepals combined in a broad oblique
pitcher, including the petals, which are adnate to the base of the
column; column short, produced into a long foot. Pseudo-bulbs oblong.
Leaves few, large, longer than the scapes. The best species are the
two first-mentioned. They will thrive well in sandy peat, with a
quantity of small stones, broken pots, or gravel. A great deal of
heat and moisture are absolutely essential during the growing period.
Propagated, as soon as growth commences, by dividing the pseudo-bulbs.

    =A. bicolor= (two-coloured).* _fl._ purple and yellow, about 2in.
    long, campanulate, produced in clusters of three or four together;

    lip), with numerous purple spots, light rose, and flush; column
    white, nail of lip yellow, keels yellowish, laciniA| white with
    purple. Malay Archipelago, 1881. The five keels between the
    side laciniA| distinguish it from the foregoing species and _A.
    sylhetense_.

    =A. javanicum= (Javanese).* _fl._ yellow and red, with distinct
    longitudinal stripes; petals triangular; lip three-lobed; lateral

=ACANTHOLIMON= (from _akanthos_, a spine, and _limon_, sea lavender).
ORD. _PlantagineA|_. Dwarf hardy tufted evergreen plants, distinguished
from allied genera in having sharp-pointed rigid leaves. They are of
rather slow growth, thriving best in a sandy soil, and sunny position,
on rockwork more particularly. The flowers are similar to _Statice_ and
_Armeria_. Increased by seeds (which germinate slowly), sown carefully
on a warm but rather shaded border, and transplanted when large
enough to handle; or by cuttings and very carefully made divisions.
The cuttings should be made in late summer, and placed in a frame, to
remain there during the winter.

    =A. glumaceum= (prickly).* _fl._ rose, spicate, about 1/2in.
    across, six to eight in a spikelet. Summer. _l._ densely packed and

    twenty in each spike. Summer. _l._ broader than in the last, and
    glaucous. _h._ 6in. or 8in. Cilicia, 1873. A rare and handsome
    alpine. Larger than the preceding. See Fig. 7.

=ACANTHOPHA'NIX= (from _akantha_, a spine, and _phoinix_, the Date
Palm). ORD. _PalmA|_. A very elegant stove palm, differing from _Areca_
principally in habit, and requiring a light sandy soil and a summer
temperature of 65deg. to 80deg., winter 55deg. to 65deg. Increased by
seeds only; these germinate best in a moist bottom heat, and a well
decomposed compost of one part loam, one of peat, one of leaf mould,
and the remainder of sand. They may remain in this soil for two or
three years.

    =A. crinita= (hairy).* _fl._ spirally arranged, in threes, the
    central one being female. _l._ the fronds are arched, broadly ovate
    in outline, pectinately pinnate in division, with long linear
    acuminate segments, paler beneath. The stem is densely armed with
    black, needle-shaped spines, and much swollen towards the base.
    Seychelles, 1868.

=ACANTHORHIZA= (from _akantha_, a spine, and _rhiza_, a root). ORD.
_PalmA|_. A small genus of stove palms, differing from _Trithrinax_
by the aA"rial roots of the trunk hardening into spines (which are
horizontal or pointed upwards), and by the blade of the leaf being
divided down to the petiole. They delight in a rich loamy soil, and are
propagated by seeds, in a moist, sweet hotbed, in spring.

    =A. aculeata= (spiny).* _l._ orbicular, palmately slit into
    numerous linear-lanceolate, glabrous segments, deep-green above,
    silvery beneath; petioles slender; the trunk is covered with
    a network of branching spines. Mexico, 1879. SYN. _ChamA|rops
    stauracantha_.

    =A. Wallisii= (Wallis's).* A recent introduction from tropical
    America, and not yet much cultivated; it is a tall palm with
    orbicular palmate leaves.

    =A. Warzcewiczii= (Warzcewicz's).* This differs from the preceding
    species by its more irregularly divided leaf blade, which is white
    below. Tropical America.

=ACANTHOSTACHYUM= (from _akanthos_, a spine, and _stachys_, a spike).
ORD. _BromeliaceA|_. A monotypic genus of stove evergreen herbaceous
plants; of easy culture in a compost of equal parts sand, decayed wood,
and rotten leaves. Propagated by suckers, which strike readily in
bottom heat.

    =A. strobilacea= (cone-fruited). _fl._ red and yellow; scape
    simple, long, scurfy; bracts coloured. June. _l._ radical, very
    long, incurved, narrow, thick, pungent, channelled, spiny-toothed,
    covered with white scurf. _h._ 4ft. Brazil, 1840.

=ACANTHUS= (from _akanthos_, a spine; several species being spiny
or prickly). Bear's Breech. ORD. _AcanthaceA|_. A group of stately,
ornamental perennial plants, mostly hardy, remarkable for their
vigorous growth and beautiful foliage. Flowers sessile, crowded,
spicate; corolla tubular, one-lipped; lip three lobed. To attain
perfection they require a deep soil, and a situation fully exposed to
the sun. They will, however, thrive moderately well in common soil and
partial shade. The habit being generally a bold one, they are most
suited for isolated tufts, backgrounds of mixed borders, and the wild
garden. Propagated by seeds, sown in gentle heat, or by division of the
roots, in autumn or early spring.

    =A. carduifolius= (thistle-leaved). _fl._ blue. August. _h._ 3ft.
    Cape of Good Hope, 1816. Greenhouse species.

    shining, and deeply cut. _h._ 2ft. Spain, 1700.

    =A. longifolius= (long-leaved).* _fl._ purple, rose, in the axils
    of the bracts, which are oval, acuminate, spiny, of a reddish hue,
    forming a spike nearly 1ft. long. June. _l._ radical, 2ft. to 3ft.
    long; numerous. _h._ 3ft. to 4-1/2ft. Dalmatia, 1869.

    broad. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. Italy, 1548.

    =A. m. latifolius= (broad-leaved).* A variety of _A. mollis_, but
    larger and more robust in every part. This very handsome form
    is probably the best grown; it is one of the most suitable for
    sub-tropical gardening. A warm sunny spot is needful. SYN. _A.
    lusitanicus_. See Fig. 8.

    =A. montanus= (mountain).* _fl._ rose. August. _h._ 3ft. West
    Africa, 1865. A shrubby species.

=ACER=, (from _acer_, hard or sharp; wood is extremely hard, and
was formerly much used for making pikes and lances). Maple. ORD.
_SapindaceA|_. A genus comprised, for the most part, of handsome
hardy deciduous shrubs, or trees, adapted for forming shrubberies,
plantations, &c. Flowers greenish, except where mentioned. _A.
Pseudo-platanus_ is one of our most useful forest trees. Several of the
species produce very useful timber; sugar is one of the constituent
parts of the sap of all of them, and is obtained in large quantities
from _A. saccharinum_, in North America. They all prefer a somewhat
sheltered position. The most satisfactory soil is one free, deep,
loamy, and well drained; the latter is especially desirable with
some of the Japanese varieties. The varieties of _A. japonicum_, and
_palmatum_ are well worth growing in pots for conservatory decoration.
Propagation: By seeds, sown either in autumn or spring, covering them
not more than a 1/4in. deep; the common varieties may be sown outside,
while the rarer ones should be sown in a frame. By layers, and by
grafting; the latter method is adopted with many of the rarer species
and varieties, especially the variegated kinds; they are also readily
increased by budding in summer.

    =A. austriacum= (Austrian). Synonymous with _A. campestre
    austriacum_.

    =A. campestre= (field).* Common Maple. _fl._ on erect racemes. May.

    the autumn.

    =A. creticum= (Cretan). _fl._ on few-flowered erect corymbs. May.
    _fr._ smooth, with the wings hardly diverging. _l._ cuneated at
    the base, acutely three-lobed at the top. _h._ 4ft. Levant, 1752.
    Nearly evergreen.

    =A. dasycarpum= (thick-fruited).* _fl._ conglomerate, on short
    pedicels, apetalous. April. _l._ truncate at the base, palmately
    five-lobed, with blunt recesses, and unequally and deeply-toothed
    lobes. _h._ 40ft. North America, 1725. SYNS. _A. eriocarpon_, _A.
    tomentosum_, _A. glaucum_, and _A. virginianum_.

    =A. Douglasii= (Douglas). Synonymous with _A. glabrum_.

    =A. eriocarpon= (hairy-fruited). Synonymous with _A. dasycarpum_.

    =A. Ginnala= (Ginnalian).* _fl._ on compound, crowded, erect
    racemes. Amur River. This is generally classed as a variety of _A.
    tartaricum_, but its habit is much more graceful, and in this form
    the leaves are prettily cut and lobed, whilst the leafstalks and
    midrib are more deeply coloured.

    =A. glabrum= (smooth).* _fl._ corymbose, on short two-leaved
    branchlets, greenish-yellow. June. _l._ roundish-cordate, deeply
    three to five-lobed, or partite; the lobes biserrate, of a

    small, ovate, entire, and three-lobed, slightly serrated, smooth.
    _h._ 4ft. Levant, 1759. An evergreen. SYN. _A. sempervirens_.

    =A. ibericum= (Iberian). _fl._ corymbose. May. _l._ bluntly
    three-lobed; lobes with one or two teeth, lateral ones marked
    with the middle nerve to the insertion of the petiole. _h._ 20ft.
    Iberia, 1826.

    =A. japonicum= (Japanese).* _fl._ deep purplish-red, large. April.
    _l._ many-lobed, in early spring very light green. _h._ 20ft.
    Japan, 1863. The varieties of this species, although not well fixed
    in many cases, rank amongst the most handsome of the deciduous
    small shrubs grown, but often change in character as they attain
    any considerable size. Plants from 1-1/2ft. to 3ft. high are very
    useful in cool conservatories, and in the highly kept grounds
    surrounding the house.

    =A. palmatum= (palmate-leaved).* _fl._ on five to seven-flowered
    umbels. May. _l._ palmately divided into five to seven lobes beyond
    the middle; lobes oblong, acuminated, serrated. _h._ 20ft. Japan,
    1820.

    =A. p. atropurpureum= (dark purple).* A vigorous handsome plant,
    with bold dark purple foliage. Japan.

    =A. p. crispum= (crispy or waved).* _l._ green, with red stalked,
    convoluted edges. Japan, 1871. Very distinct, and like a miniature
    Lombardy poplar in habit of growth.

    =A. p. dissectum= (finely-divided).* _fl._ red, on terminal-stalked
    racemes, five to six-flowered. May. _l._ nine to ten parted; lobes

    lobes deeply cut, light green, margined with rose. Japan, 1874. A
    very distinct and charming variety.

    =A. p. sanguineum= (blood-red).* _l._ deeply five-lobed, the lobes
    serrated, of a deep reddish-crimson colour, much brighter than
    the variety _atropurpureum_. 1874. This presents a very striking
    contrast to the last.

    =A. p. septemlobum= (seven-lobed).* _fl._ purplish, on numerous
    flowered umbels. Spring. _l._ varying much, from palmately
    five-lobed, with toothed undivided lobes, to deeply seven to
    nine-lobed, with more or less finely cut divisions. Japan, 1864.
    There are numerous beautiful forms of this variety.

There are many varieties of this much varying species, but we have only
mentioned those best known; many are only known by their native names,
and there is some doubt as to their distinctive characteristics. They
are all extremely handsome.

    =A. pennsylvanicum= (Pennsylvanian).* _fl._ in long drooping,
    simple racemes. May. _l._ cordate, three-lobed, acuminated, finely

    principally in the colouring of the leaves. All are very desirable.

    =A. platanoides= (plane-like).* The Norway Maple. _fl._ on nearly
    erect stalked corymbs. May, June. _l._ cordate, smooth, five-lobed;
    lobes acuminated, with a few coarse acute teeth. _h._ 50ft. Europe,
    1683. A very ornamental hardy tree, growing with great rapidity
    when young. It prefers a deep, well-drained soil.

    =A. p. aureo variegatum= (golden-variegated).* _l._ variegated with
    yellow. Europe, 1383. This, to retain the variegation, requires to
    be propagated by budding or grafting. The same remarks are equally
    applicable to the other varieties.

    =A. p. laciniatum= (cut-leaved).* _l._ deeply and variously cut,
    green and yellow.

    =A. p. Schwedleri= (Schwedler's).* _l._ very large, deep
    bronzy-red. A vigorous grower, and most effective.

    =A. p. variegatum= (variegated).* _l._ variegated with white.
    There are several other varieties, but of less importance than the
    foregoing.

    =A. Pseudo-platanus= (Mock-plane tree).* Sycamore. _fl._ on rather
    compound pendulous racemes. May. _l._ cordate, with five acuminated
    unequally-toothed lobes. _h._ 30ft. to 60ft. Europe. There are
    few deciduous trees so well adapted for standing singly in rough
    exposed situations. A deep, soft, dry soil is most suitable for it,
    but it will grow in soils of very opposite qualities.

    =A. P. albo variegata= (white-variegated).* A very beautiful form,

=ACHIMENES= (from _cheimaino_, to suffer from cold; alluding to
the general tenderness of the species). Including _Scheeria_. ORD.
_GesneraceA|_. A large genus of handsome, stove or warm greenhouse,
branched, generally hairy, herbaceous perennials, with scaly,
catkin-like stolons underground (see Fig. 14), and sometimes from
the axils of the leaves. Corolla funnel-shaped; tube rather oblique,
gibbous behind at the base; pedicels one-flowered, axillary, solitary
or fasciculated, bracteated. Leaves opposite, or three in a whorl,
serrated.

[Illustration: FIG. 14. ROOT OF THE ACHIMENE, showing Tubercles.]

[Illustration: FIG. 15. BOUQUET OF VARIOUS ACHIMENES.]

To be successfully cultivated, they must be started and grown in stove
heat till they commence flowering, when they may be removed to the
conservatory or greenhouse, there to remain till after flowering.
Batches of tubercles should be started in heat from February till
the end of April, so as to give a succession of blossom. Shake each
variety out of the old compost and insert separately in light, sandy
soil; water sparingly at first, but when active they may receive
more frequent supplies. When the shoots are about 2in. high, the
tubercles may be transplanted to the pots, pans, or baskets in which
it is intended to grow them, using as potting compost fibrous peat and
leaf-soil in equal proportions, with about a sixth part of sheep's or
rotten cow manure, and sufficient silver sand to make the whole porous
and of a whitish appearance. Thorough drainage is indispensable, and
a layer of the rougher soil, or sphagnum, should be placed over the
potsherds, to prevent the loose soil stopping the drainage. Place the
pans as near the glass as possible, and shade from bright sunshine.
Give liberal supplies of water, with occasional doses of liquid manure;
and, as the shoots lengthen, they may be pinched, to induce sturdy
growth and a larger number of flowering branches. Place neat stakes to
each stem, and keep well tied, arranging the stakes as symmetrically
as possible, so as to ensure an even outline, but do not allow them
to be seen. Light syringing with clear water, morning and evening, is
beneficial. After the plants have done flowering, they should gradually
have less water as the foliage and stems decay; a light airy situation
is needed to mature and ripen the tubers. When the tops are quite dead,
they may be removed, and the pots stored on the sides in any warm dry
corner where the temperature will not fall below 50deg., keeping
the plants quite dry until the time of starting again. Achimenes are
liable to attacks of thrips, red-spider, and green-fly, especially if
the atmosphere is kept dry; these are easily destroyed by fumigation
with tobacco. This must only be done when the foliage is quite dry,
otherwise the plants will suffer. Achimenes are especially beautiful
when well arranged, especially if two or three varieties are mixed
together, as white, red, and purple (Fig. 15). There are several
methods of increasing these:--(1) By cuttings; these need not be cut
off at a joint, as they will root from any portion of the stem. Insert
them thickly in well-drained pots of sandy soil--say a mixture of equal
parts of peat and sand--and place in bottom heat. (2) By leaves, which
should be severed from the stems, and pricked in pots of similar soil
to the cuttings, placing all the petiole below the surface; stand the
pots in bottom heat. (3) By scales from the corms, which should be
carefully rubbed off and sown, like seeds, in pots or pans of the same
compost, barely covered with sand, and placed in bottom heat. (4) By
seeds, which are very small, and, consequently, require to be carefully
sown. The pans must be thoroughly drained and filled nearly to the
rim, levelled, and well watered with a fine rose, after which the seed
should be thinly scattered, covered very lightly with sand, and placed
in a shady position. Keep nicely moist, and apply water very lightly,
or the tiny germs will be disturbed. Place a sheet of glass over the
seed-pans. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, they may be
pricked off and afterwards treated like rooted cuttings. The best time
for all modes of propagating is early spring.

=ACINETA= (from _akineta_, immovable; the lip being jointless). ORD.
_OrchideA|_. A small genus of cool house, robust, sub-terrestrial
orchids allied to _Peristeria_. Flowers sub-globose, fleshy, arranged
on stout, pendulous racemes. Leaves lanceolate, membranous, ribbed.
Pseudo-bulbs angular, about as large as hens' eggs. The compost
should consist of equal parts of fibrous peat and living sphagnum. In
planting, first place a somewhat thick layer of the moss all round
the inside of the basket, and press the soil firmly round the plant.
During the growing season, the baskets should be taken down twice or
three times a week and dipped into a tub of water, so that the whole
may become saturated. In addition, the plants should be sprinkled with
the syringe morning and evening, for they delight in an abundant supply
of water and plenty of shade. When the growth is finished, they must
be kept very dry, an occasional syringing, to keep the leaves from
shrivelling, being all that is necessary.

linear leaves and bell-shaped flowers. They require a free, open, rich
soil, and should remain and bloom undisturbed for years; divide the
clumps every three or four years, and renew the soil.

    =A. autumnalis= (autumn-blooming).* _fl._, perianth white, delicate
    pink at the base, preceding the leaves; two to three on a stem.
    Autumn. _l._ few in number, very slender, sheathing the stems at

    crenated; branches square. Habit erect, branched at the apex. _h._
    1ft. to 1-1/2ft. Jamaica, 1804. More curious than ornamental.

=ACMADENIA= (from _akme_, a point, and _aden_, a gland; in allusion

Bithynia, near where it is said to abound). Aconite; Monk's Hood;
Wolf's Bane. ORD. _RanunculaceA|_. An extensive genus of very ornamental
hardy perennials. Flowers in terminal racemes; sepals five, the upper
one helmet shaped, the two sides broader than the two back ones; petals
five, small, the two upper with long claws hooded at the tip; the three
inferior smaller or undeveloped. Leaves palmate. They thrive well
in any ordinary garden soil. If left undisturbed for several years,
they will attain a goodly size, and produce fine panicles of handsome
flowers. They are invaluable for growing beneath the shade of trees,
where they succeed better than almost any other class of plants. All
are very easily propagated by divisions of the roots and seeds; the
latter should be sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame. Care should
be taken not to leave pieces of the roots about, for, with but one
exception, those of all the species are very poisonous. Although very
unlike horse-radish, they have frequently been mistaken for it, with
fatal results; and none of the species should be cultivated in or near
the kitchen garden.

requirements of this handsome genus of ferns are good drainage, and a
compost of fibrous peat, loam and sand. In most cases, plenty of pot
room is essential, and a larger quantity of loam will be needed for
strong-growing sorts. For general culture, _see_ =Ferns=.

    =A. volgensis= (Volga). An intermediate species between _A.
    vernalis_ and _A. pyrenaica_, differing from the first in the stems
    being branched, leaves more distant; from the last by the lower

=A†CHMEA= (from _aichme_, a point; in reference to the rigid points
on the calyces, or flower-envelopes). Including _Pironneaua_. ORD.
_BromeliaceA|_. Very handsome stove plants. Flowers scapose, panicled;
perianth six-cleft, three outer segments sepaloid, longer than the
three inner or petaloid ones. Leaves ligulate or sword-shaped,
sometimes with marginal spines. The species thrive best in a
well-drained compost of rich fibrous loam and leaf mould. They like
plenty of light, which may be afforded by standing them on inverted
pots, so as to raise their heads well up above the surrounding plants.
Propagation: When the flower-spikes, which are sent up from the heart
or crown of the plant, die away, suckers or offsets are produced near
the base, and from these other flowers appear the year after. If large
plants are desired, these suckers should be left to grow and spread
around; but to produce single plants, the suckers must be taken off
and potted singly, in sharp soil, and then stood where they can get
a moist heat till rooted. To enable them to do this it is necessary
to strip off a few of the lower leaves, and trim the bottom with a
sharp knife, in order that it may heal over and callus more readily
than it otherwise would. When rooted, the plants may be shifted into
larger-sized pots; but for single crowns 32-sized pots are large
enough, as the plants, being epiphytal in their nature, do not require
much soil or any great supply of water, except when growing freely or
sending up their flower-spikes. In winter, they should be kept rather
on the dry side, to induce partial rest; and an important point is to
see that water is not allowed to lie for any length of time in the
crown of the plant, as when that is the case it is likely to cause them
to rot.

=AERATION.= The exposure of the soil to the free action of the air, as
essential to the growth of plants.

=AERIDES= (from _aer_, the air; in reference to the power the
species have of deriving their sustenance from the atmosphere). ORD.
_OrchideA|_. An extensive genus of epiphytal orchids, confined to the
tropics of the Old World, including many large and showy-flowered
species. The majority of them are extremely handsome. The thick
fleshy leaves are noteworthy for their characteristically distichous
arrangement--that is to say, they are arranged in two opposite rows.
They are usually truncate at the apex, and for the most part deeply
channelled down the centre, but in some species terete or nearly
cylindrical. All of them throw out large fleshy roots from various
parts of their stems, by which they absorb the moisture from the
atmosphere; and, in order to grow them successfully, they must be fixed
upon blocks of wood. But this method should be adopted only whilst the
plants are young, as it is almost an impossibility for the cultivator
to maintain a sufficient amount of atmospheric moisture to meet their
requirements; and, unless this is managed, the leaves will shrivel and
fall off, leaving only a few at the extremity. Therefore, as soon as
the plants are established upon the blocks of wood, let them be removed
and potted. Fill the pot three parts full of broken potsherds and lumps
of charcoal, and then use nothing, but clean, living sphagnum, placing
a few roots in the moss and leaving the others free. By this means a
greater amount of moisture can be supplied to them, and thus beautiful
and symmetrical specimens obtained. The Aerides are easily grown into
handsome plants, which usually bloom profusely, and thus recommend
themselves to all who cultivate orchids. From early spring until the
end of September they should be treated liberally with water, at the
same time taking care never to wet the flowers. After the above-named
time, a gradual diminution in the water supply to the roots should
take place; and the atmosphere, too, should be less densely charged
with moisture. But drought should never be carried far enough to cause
the leaves to shrivel, for, if this is done, the uniformity of the
specimen is marred; and, although we are quite willing to admit the
possibility of the plants producing a greater quantity of flower spikes
after a thorough shrivelling, we prefer to advocate the system that
gives a fair amount of flower coupled with good leafage. As before
remarked, the Aerides are peculiarly eastern, and therefore are usually
classed amongst the orchids which require the hottest houses. This is,
in one sense, correct; yet they do not require the great amount of heat
which many imagine, and which has, until recently, been given them.
They must not, therefore, be excluded from the amateur's collection of
orchids. During the winter season many of the species may be kept in
a temperature of 58deg. to 60deg.; whilst during the growing season
the temperature may run up by sun heat without limit, so long as a
free circulation of air and a sufficiency of moisture are secured. The
following status of temperature may be observed: In spring, from 65deg.
in the night, to 70deg. or 80deg. by day; in summer, from 70deg. in the
night, to 80deg. or 85deg. through the day; in winter, about 60deg.
night, and 65deg. day.

    =A. affine= (related).* _fl._ delicate rose, produced, in great
    profusion, on branching spikes, which are sometimes 2ft. in
    length, and continue in bloom two or three weeks; the sepals and
    petals equal, rounded at the apex; the lip is sharply rhomboid and
    three-lobed, with a short spur. _l._ light green, about 1ft. long.
    _h._ 3ft. A very handsome species from India, forming an excellent
    exhibition plant.

    =A. a. superbum= (superb).* An improved variety, with larger and
    richer coloured flowers, and more compact habit.

    =A. Brookii= (Sir A. Brooke's).* _fl._ purple and white; labellum
    bright purple; sepals and petals white, very fragrant. _l._ very
    ornamental, of a glaucous (milky green) hue. Bombay. This species,
    although one of the handsomest, is very rare.

    =A. crassifolium= (thick-leaved).* This is a dwarf, densely-habited
    plant, with broad, thick, purple-dotted obliquely-bilobed leaves.
    The flowers, which are borne on long and drooping spikes, are
    bare--larger than those of _A. falcatum_, which they resemble in
    form, and have the segments tipped with rich purple or amethyst,
    the centre or throat of the flower being ivory-white. Compared with
    _A. falcatum_, the spur is here bent under at an angle, while in
    that plant it is straight; the side laciniA| of the lip are much
    broader and shorter in the present plant, and the two keels on the
    lip here stand close together at the base, and become divergent,
    whilst in _falcatum_ they are distant at the base, and become
    convergent near the middle of the lip. This species is described
    as being the best in the genus. It may be grown near the glass,
    suspended in a basket. Burmah, 1877.

    three-lobed, pressed to the column, the side lobes being oblong
    and denticulate, the middle lobe linear and bifid, the whole lip
    being of a pale lemon colour, and the spur rosy-eyed; the numerous
    racemes are half pendulous and branched, bearing a profusion of
    deliciously fragrant flowers. _l._ flaccid, about 10in. long, light
    green, profusely freckled with brown dots. Malacca, 1848. There are
    one or two varieties.

    =A. tesselatum= (chequered). _fl._ lined and streaked with green,
    white, and purple. East Indies, 1838. A scarce species.

    =A. Thibautianum= (Thibaut's). A synonym of _Saccolabium Huttoni_.

    =A. vandarum= (Vanda). A synonym of _A. cylindricum_.

    =A. virens= (vigorous). _fl._ deliciously fragrant; sepals and
    petals ovate, obtuse, soft white, tipped with rosy-purple; lip
    large; side lobes toothed at the apex, white, dotted with crimson;

=AEROBION.= _See_ =AngrA|cum=.

=AEROPHYTES.= Plants that are grown entirely in the air.

=A†SCHYNANTHUS= (from _aischuno_, to be ashamed, and _anthos_, a
flower). ORD. _GesneraceA|_. A genus of very beautiful twining, radicant
or parasitical stove shrubs, with opposite, simple, entire leaves, and
axillary, terminal, few flowered, umbellate peduncles. They possess all
the qualifications worthy of extensive cultivation--handsome flowers,
fine deep green leaves, an agreeable fragrance, and are easily grown on
blocks, which must be covered with green moss, fastened on with small
copper wire. Preparatory to fastening them on, the roots should be
covered with moss, and the plants secured to the block also by wire.
After this, but little attention is requisite, except duly syringing
and occasionally dipping in tepid water. As pot plants they are very
beautiful, and in this method perfection is only obtained by growing
them on fast and strong by generous treatment, which consists in
frequently repotting in light rich compost till they are large enough
to be trained up a trellis, formed of slender rods of willow or hazel.
Propagated by seeds and cuttings. The former are very unsatisfactory;
the latter root readily during spring in a well-drained pot, filled
with a light compost, and having a surface of pure white sand, about
1in. deep. The best are obtained from half-ripened wood, cut into 2in.
or 3in. lengths, and all leaves, with the exception of one or two at
the top, removed. The cuttings should then be covered over with a bell
glass, and placed in moderate bottom heat. So soon as rooted, transfer
them singly to small pots, and again place under hand glasses, until
they are thoroughly established, then gradually harden off. When about
twelve months old, place the plants in their permanent quarters.
Baskets are commonly and very effectively employed. Line these with
moss, and fill with a light rich compost; place the plant as near the
centre as possible, and, to promote a uniform growth, fasten down the
branches with small neat pegs, at equal distances. During the summer,
give copious supplies of water, to produce a liberal growth, which is
of the utmost importance the first season, when they should not be
permitted to flower. The following winter they should be kept cool and
rather dry, thus giving them a rest. The year following, if properly
managed, they will bloom profusely.

    =A†. zebrinus= (zebra-marked). _fl._ green, brown. Autumn. Java,
    1846.

=A†SCHYNOMENE= (from _aischuno_, to be ashamed; in reference to the
leaves of some of the species falling on the slightest touch, like
those of the Sensitive plant). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Stove herbs and
shrubs, with impari-pinnate leaves, having many pairs of leaflets, and
axillary racemes of usually yellow flowers. They thrive well in a good
rich loam. Propagated by cuttings, placed in sand under a bell glass,
in a brisk heat. Seeds of the herbaceous species require a good heat to
start them into growth. The annuals are not worth growing. There are
about forty other species known besides those mentioned, some of which
may prove worthy of cultivation when introduced.

    =A†. aristata= (awned). A synonym of _Pictatia aristata_.

    =A†. aspera= (rough-stemmed). _fl._ yellow; racemes compound;
    peduncles, bracteas, calyces, and corollas, hispid. June. _l._ with
    thirty to forty pairs of linear leaflets, which (as well as the
    legumes) are smooth. Stem herbaceous, erect. _h._ 6ft. to 8ft. East
    Indies, 1759. Perennial.

    =A†. sensitiva= (sensitive).* _fl._ white; legumes and racemes
    glabrous; peduncles branched, few-flowered. June. _l._ with sixteen
    to twenty pairs of linear leaflets. Stem smooth. _h._ 3ft. to 6ft.
    Jamaica, 1733. This shrub requires a sandy soil.

=A†SCULUS= (a name given by Pliny to a kind of oak having an edible
fruit; derived from _esca_, nourishment). The Horse Chestnut. ORD.
_SapindaceA|_. A genus of hardy showy trees, well adapted for lawns
or parks, having a beautiful appearance when in flower. They will do
well in any soil, but the more loamy the better. Increased by layers,
put down in the spring, or by grafting or budding on the common horse
chestnut. Seeds, where procurable, should be sown singly in rows in
spring, where they may remain until they are of sufficient size to be
permanently planted out. This genus is distinguished from _Pavia_, in
having its capsules echinated, _i.e._, covered with prickles, like a
hedgehog; but this character is not always consistent.

    =A†. carnea= (flesh-coloured). Synonymous with _A†. rubicunda_.

    =A†. glabra= (smooth-leaved).* _fl._ greenish yellow; corolla of
    four spreading petals, with their claws about the length of the
    calyx; stamens longer than the corolla. June. _l._ with five
    leaflets, very smooth; foliage larger than the common species. _h._
    20ft. North America, 1821. SYNS. _A. ohioensis_, _A. pallida_.

    =A†. Hippocastanum= (Common Horse-Chestnut). _fl._ white, tinged
    with red, on very handsome terminal racemes, which are produced
    in great profusion; petals five. April and May. _l._ with seven
    obovately-cuneated, acute, toothed leaflets. Asia, 1629. This, the
    common horse chestnut, is well known by the beautiful parabolic
    form in which it grows, and during the period of its flowering no
    tree possesses greater beauty. It has two or three unimportant
    varieties, differing in the variation of their leaves, and one also
    with double flowers. These are increased by grafting only.

    =A†. ohioensis= (Ohio). A synonym of _A. glabra_.

    =A†. pallida= (pale-flowered). A synonym of _A. glabra_.

    =A†. rubicunda= (red-flowered).* _fl._ scarlet, in very fine
    terminal racemes; petals four, having the claws shorter than
    the calyx; stamens eight. June. _l._ with five to seven
    obovately-cuneated, acute, unequally serrated leaflets. _h._
    20ft. North America, 1820. This is a very distinct and beautiful
    tree when in flower, and does not attain so large a size as _A†.
    Hippocastanum_. SYN. _A†. carnea_.

=A†STIVATION.= The manner of the folding of the calyx and corolla in the
flower bud.

=A†THIONEMA= (from _aitho_, to scorch, and _nema_, a filament;
apparently in allusion to some tawny or burnt appearance in the
stamens). ORD. _CruciferA|_. A genus of elegant little plants,
distinguished from allied genera in having the four larger stamens
winged, and with a tooth. Herbs or sub-shrubs, perennial or annual,
branched from the base, diffuse or erect. Flowers in crowded terminal
racemes. Leaves fleshy, sessile. They are well worth cultivating in
sunny situations, where they form a freer flowering habit than when
growing in a wild state. Some of the more hardy species may be planted
on rock work, which, by their dwarf growth, they are well adapted for.
The annual and biennial species may either be sown on rockwork or in
the front of the flower-border. A light dry soil suits them best. The
shrubby kinds of this genus should be kept in pots, which should be
well drained with potsherds, and treated like other alpine plants.
Propagated by seeds, sown in May; or by cuttings, planted in summer.

    =A†. Buxbaumii= (Bauxbaum's). _fl._ pale red; racemes crowded,
    aggregate. June. _l._ oblong-spathulate, glaucous. _h._ 6in.

Flowers.]

    =A†. coridifolium= (Coris-leaved).* _fl._ rosy lilac, small, in
    terminal dense rounded racemes. June. _l._ linear, glaucous,
    crowded. Asia Minor, 1871. A pretty perennial, shrubby below, with
    erect stems 6in. to 8in. high. See Fig. 37.

    =A†. gracile= (slender). _fl._ purplish; racemes crowded, terminal;
    when in fruit, loose. June. _l._ lanceolate, pointed. _h._ 8in.
    Branches and branchlets slender, elongated. Sandy hills in
    Carniola, 1820. Shrubby perennial.

[Illustration: FIG. 38. A†THIONEMA GRANDIFLORUM, showing Habit and
Flowers.]

    =A†. grandiflorum= (large-flowered).* _fl._ of a warm shaded
    rose; racemes crowded, terminal, numerous. May to August. _l._
    ovate-oblong, glaucous. Mount Lebanon, 1879. This perennial species
    forms a spreading bush about 1-1/2ft. high, and is perhaps the
    handsomest of the genus. It succeeds well in the ordinary border,
    but is far better suited for the rockery. See Fig. 38.

    =A†. membranaceum= (membranous-podded). _fl._ purplish, in terminal
    racemes. June. _l._ linear, distant, somewhat fleshy, strictly
    appressed. _h._ 3in. to 6in. Persia, 1828. A small shrub, with
    filiform branches.

    =A†. monospermum= (one-seeded). _fl._ purple, largish, in terminal
    racemes. July. _l._ oval or obovate, blunt, coriaceous; pods
    one-celled, one-seeded. _h._ 3in. to 6in. Spain, 1778. A pretty
    little biennial, with hardish branches.

    =A†. pulchellum= (pretty).* This is said to be a new species,
    but it much resembles _A†. coridifolium_. It is scarcely in full
    cultivation yet, but it proves one of the hardiest as well as one
    of the most handsome kinds.

    =A†. saxatilis= (rock).* _fl._ purplish; racemes loose, terminal.
    May and June. _l._ lanceolate, acutish. _h._ 8in. Spain, 1820. A
    pretty annual.

ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A pretty stove evergreen tree. For culture, _see_
=A†giphila=.

    =A. africana= (African).* _fl._ crimson, disposed in racemes;
    petals four (furnished with claws), upper one largest. June. Legume
    ligneus, many-celled; seeds black, with scarlet aril. _l._ abruptly
    pinnate. _h._ 30ft. Sierra Leone, 1821.

=AGALMYLA= (from _agalma_, an ornament; and _hule_, a wood; the
species are great ornaments to the woods in which they grow wild).
ORD. _GesneraceA|_. A small but very handsome genus of climbing or
radicant herbs, with simple alternate leaves and axillary fascicles of
flowers, something like the blooms of a Gesnera. Corolla limb oblique,
five-lobed, scarcely two-lipped. _A. staminea_, the most generally
cultivated species, is best grown in a basket, planted in a compost of
rough peat, a little leaf soil, fresh sphagnum moss, and nodules of
charcoal. Give an abundance of moisture when growing, which should be
lessened after flowering, and allow the plant to rest during winter. It
may be planted out on rockwork in the stove. Half-ripened cuttings will
root freely in heat under a glass. The temperature in summer should not
be less than 75deg. by day, and 65deg. by night.

    =A. longistyla= (long-styled). _fl._ crimson. Java, 1873.

    =A. staminea= (long-stamened).* _fl._ scarlet, disposed in axillary
    fascicles; corolla tubular, incurved, with a dilated throat.
    Summer. _l._ alternate, oblong, acuminated, denticulated, nearly
    equal at the base, downy beneath, and on the edges. Stem and
    petioles hairy. _h._ 2ft. Java, 1846. Stove species.

=AGANISIA= (from _aganos_, desirable; in reference to the beauty
of these neat little plants). ORD. _OrchidaceA|_. A small genus of
epiphytal orchids, requiring to be grown upon a block of wood suspended
from the rafters of the stove. A damp atmosphere, syringing the roots
and leaves freely when in a growing state, and shade during very bright
sunshine, are primary points to be observed in their cultivation.
Increased by dividing the pseudo-bulbs just previous to starting into
new growth.

    =A. cA"rulea= (dark blue).* _fl._ peduncles axillary, few flowered.
    "The colour is the well known one of _Vanda cA"rulea_. There are,
    however, darker blue blotches quasi-tesselated over the flower.
    The lip is veiled, and has two very small basilar teeth, and
    then a veiled middle lacinia, that is sacciform, bordered with
    most remarkable long bristles, and with a deep violet blotch on
    its middle part beneath. The white column has two cartilaginous
    quadrate arms close to the stigmatic hollow." _l._ cuneate, oblong,
    acuminate. Pseudo-bulbs distichous, depresso-ovoid. Brazil, 1876.

    =A. fimbriata= (fringed).* _fl._ white; lip blue. Demerara, 1874.
    This species has also a sacciform, fimbriate lip, but, when
    compared with the foregoing, its flowers, leaves, and bulbs are
    much smaller, and the lip is not slit up to the apex, but the sac
    is round.

    =A. graminea= (grass-leaved). A weedy looking species, of no garden
    value. Guiana, 1836.

    =A. ionoptera= (violet-winged). The flowers, not very much larger
    than those of the lily of the valley, are white, with violet
    petals, and violet tips and streaks on the sepals. Peru, 1871.

    =A. pulchella= (pretty).* _fl._ white, with a blotch of yellow in
    the centre of the lip; the spike is produced from the bottom of the
    bulb. _h._ 8in. Demerara, 1838. It blossoms at different times of
    the year, and lasts two or three weeks in perfection. This species
    is very rare and pretty, and is best grown in a pot, with peat, and
    good drainage; requires a liberal supply of water at the roots, and
    the hottest house.

=AGANOSMA= (from _aganos_, mild, and _osme_, a smell; scent of
flowers). ORD. _ApocynaceA|_. A genus of showy stove or warm
greenhouse shrubs, with opposite leaves and terminal corymbs of
large funnel-shaped flowers, the coronet of which is cup-shaped or
cylindrical, "having its parts so united that they appear only as lobes
around the mouth of the cup." All the species mentioned are well worth
cultivating. They thrive best in a mixture of loam, sand, and peat,
in equal proportions. Propagated by cuttings in sand, under glass, and
with bottom heat.

    =A. acuminata= (pointed-leaved).* _fl._ large, white, fragrant;
    petals linear, falcate, curled; panicles axillary, longer than
    the leaves, scattered. _l._ from oblong to broad-lanceolate,
    acuminated, glabrous. Sylhet. Shrubby climber.

    =A. caryophyllata= (clove scented).* _fl._ pale yellow, tinged
    with red, deliciously clove scented; corymbs terminal. October.
    _l._ oval, acutish at both ends, tomentose beneath as well as the
    branches. India, 1812. Shrubby twiner.

    =A. cymosa= (cymose-flowered).* _fl._ small, whitish, fragrant;
    calyx and corolla hoary outside; cymes terminal, shorter than the
    leaves. _l._ elliptic, acuminated. Sylhet. Shrub.

    =A. elegans= (elegant).* _fl._ small, purple; corolla downy
    outside, as well as the calyces, bracteas, and pedicels; sepals
    longer than the tube of the corolla; corymbs terminal, crowded.
    _l._ elliptic, short-acuminated, glabrous. India. Shrubby twiner.

    =A. marginata= (bordered).* _fl._ numerous, large, white, fragrant;
    petals linear, falcate; panicles terminal, loose, corymbose,
    glabrous. _l._ lanceolate, smooth. Sylhet. Shrubby climber.

    =A. Roxburghii= (Roxburgh's).* _fl._ pure white, large, fragrant;
    calyx and corolla hoary outside; petals triangular; corymbs
    terminal. October. _l._ ovate-cordate, acuminated; petioles and
    veins red, glabrous, pale beneath, and shining above. India, 1812.
    Shrubby twiner.

    =A. Wallichii= (Wallich's).* _fl._ white, fragrant; calyx and
    corolla downy outside; corymbs terminal. _l._ elliptic-acuminated,
    shining above and pale beneath, glabrous. India. This species
    differs from the last in the veins of the leaves being parallel,
    not longitudinal, from the base to the apex. Shrubby twiner.

=AGAPANTHUS= (from _agape_, love, and _anthos_, a flower). ORD.
_LiliaceA|_. African Lily. A genus, with numerous varieties, of very
handsome greenhouse or conservatory herbaceous plants. Flowers
large, scapose; perianth tubular, tube short; stamens six, having
the filaments somewhat declinate. Leaves linear or lorate, arching,
radical. They are of easy culture, and thrive best in strong turfy
loam, leaf mould, decomposed manure, and river sand. They may be grown
in large pots or tubs outside, to be removed in autumn, and placed
under the stage in the greenhouse, or where they will be protected
from frost, and kept moderately dry. If planted and left outside, the
crowns should be well covered with cocoa-nut fibre in winter. During
the summer, and especially in dry weather, the plants can hardly
be over watered. They thrive admirably on the margins of lakes or
running streams, and few plants, alike in flower and foliage, are
more effective. Clear manure water may be given previous to or when
the plants are in flower, and, after flowering, gradually lessen the
quantity of water, until they are stowed away for the winter. They
increase very rapidly, by offsets, and, if necessary, the old plants
may be divided in early spring, to any extent required. In the more
southern parts of this country they are quite hardy.

[Illustration: FIG. 39. AGAPANTHUS UMBELLATUS.]

    =A. umbellatus= (umbelled).* _fl._ bright blue; perianth
    funnel-shaped, regular, deeply six-parted; tube short; scape tall,
    naked, bearing a many-flowered umbel. Summer and autumn. _l._
    numerous, radical, linear, somewhat fleshy. _h._ 2ft. to 3ft. Cape
    of Good Hope, 1692. See Fig. 39.

    =A. u. albidus= (whitish).* _fl._ pure white, on large full-sized
    umbels, smaller than those of the species, but very showy. Cape of
    Good Hope. This requires carefully drying off during the winter.

    =A. u. aureus= (golden). A variety in which the leaves are marked
    longitudinally with yellow. 1882.

    =A. u. flore-pleno= (double-flowered).* Identical in all respects
    with the species, except that it has double flowers, which are
    therefore, much more lasting than the single ones. A very handsome
    variety.

    =A. u. Leichtlinii= (Leichtlin's).* _fl._, perianth deep bright
    hyacinthine blue, 1-1/4in. long; scape about 1-1/2ft. long, with a
    more compact umbel than any other known form. June. _l._ similar in
    size to the species. Cape of Good Hope, 1878.

    =A. u. maximus= (larger).* _fl._ bright blue, in immense umbels.
    This is larger in all its parts than the type, and when well grown
    is truly a noble plant. There is also a white-flowered form of this
    variety, which is most desirable, being equally as large.

    =A. u. minor= (smaller).* This is smaller in all its parts, with
    narrow leaves, and slender scapes of deep blue flowers. A very
    elegant variety.

    =A. u. Mooreanus= (Moore's).* _fl._ dark blue. _h._ 1-1/2ft. 1879.
    A new variety, with shorter, narrower, and more upright leaves than
    the species; it has a dwarf habit. Perfectly hardy.

    =A. u. variegatus= (variegated).* Where variegated-leaved plants
    are desired, few could be more useful than this; its leaves are
    almost entirely white, with a few green bands, but they are neither
    so broad nor so long as in the type. It is an excellent subject for
    the domestic garden.

=AGAPETES= (from _agapetos_, beloved; in reference to the showy
character of the plants). ORD. _VacciniaceA|_. A genus containing about
eighteen species of warm greenhouse or stove evergreen shrubs. Flowers
corymbose and racemose; corolla tubular. Leaves alternate, coriaceous.
They are all worthy of cultivation, but only two or three species are
grown in England. Peat, turfy loam, and sand, in equal parts, is the
best compost for them; and young hardened cuttings will strike in sandy
soil, under a hand glass, in stove temperature.

    =A. buxifolia= (box-leaved).* _fl._ bright red, about 1in. long,
    tubular, wax-like, disposed in corymbs. April. _l._ small, oval
    oblong, bright green, leathery; branches spreading, twiggy. _h._
    5ft. Bootan.

    =A. setigera= (bristly). _fl._ red, about 1in. long, tubular,
    numerous, in lateral and corymbose racemes, furnished with bristly
    hairs. _l._ scattered, lanceolate, acuminated, on very short robust
    petioles. Pundua Mountains, 1837.

    =A. variegata= (variegated). _fl._ scarlet, about 1in. long,
    tubular, lateral, corymbose. _l._ on short petioles, lanceolate,
    acuminated, denticulated, attenuated at the base, veiny. Khasia,
    1837.

=AGARICUS= (derived from _Agaria_, the name of a town in Sarmentosa).
Mushroom. ORD. _Fungi_. The most extensive genus known. It, however,
contains but one or two species of cultural value. The most important
ones are the common field mushroom, _A. campestris_ (Fig. 44), the
Fairy Ring mushroom, _A. pratensis_, and _A. vaginatus_. Familiar
species are the Parasol mushroom, _A. procerus_ (Fig. 43); St. George's
mushroom, _A. gambosus_ (Fig. 42); and the deadly Fly Agaric, _A.
muscarius_ (Fig. 41). For practical purposes the majority of this genus
are poisonous, and many virulently so. Great care must be exercised in
experimenting with unknown species, even by experienced fungologists.
_See_ =Mushroom=.

=AGASTACHYS= (from _agastos_, admirable, and _stachys_, a spike). ORD.
_ProteaceA|_. A greenhouse evergreen shrub, with four sepalled apetalous
flowers, which are disposed in numerous spikes. It thrives in a compost
of equal parts loam, sand, and peat. Cuttings of ripened wood will
strike in sandy soil under a glass, in a cool house.

    =A. odorata= (fragrant).* _fl._ pale yellow, sweet scented,
    crowded; spikes 4in. to 5in. long. April. _l._ bluntly lanceolate,
    sub-sessile, thickish, about 2in. long. _h._ about 3ft. New
    Holland, 1826.

=AGATHA†A= (from _agathos_, excellent; in reference to the beauty of the
flowers). ORD. _CompositA|_. Allied to _Cineraria_, and requiring the
same greenhouse treatment. It makes a very pretty object for summer
decoration in the flower garden. Young cuttings root freely, in a
gentle heat, at all times; and the plant may be had in bloom all the
year round.

    =A. cA"lestis= (sky-blue).* _fl.-heads_ blue; peduncle one-headed.
    June. _l._ opposite, ovate, naked. _h._ 1-1/2ft. Cape of Good Hope,
    1753. Herbaceous perennial. See Fig. 40.

shrubs, from the Cape of Good Hope. Flowers in terminal heads, or
umbels; petals five, divided, with long claws, and scattered, short,
narrow leaves, usually with revolute edges. They are of easy culture,
thriving best in a mixture of sand and peat, with the addition of a
little turfy loam. Young cuttings will strike root freely in a pot of
sand, under a bell glass, in a cool house. They require to be shaded
somewhat in the summer. Winter temperature, 40deg. to 45deg. About
forty-six species are known.

=AGAVE= (from _agauos_, admirable; referring to the stately form
in which some of them flower). ORD. _AmaryllidaceA|_. Flower-scape
tall, proceeding from the centre of the rosette of leaves; perianth
funnel-shaped, six-parted. Leaves large, fleshy, tufted. Mr. B. S.
Williams describes them as follows: "They are noble, massive-growing
plants, and form magnificent ornaments in the greenhouse or
conservatory; whilst, from their slow growth, they do not rapidly get
too large, even for a small greenhouse. Indeed, some of the real gems
of this genus are neat, compact-growing plants, seldom exceeding 2ft.
in height. Besides being fine ornamental plants for indoor decoration,
the larger growing kinds are unquestionably the finest objects for the
embellishment of terrace-walks, or surmounting flights of steps in the
open air during the summer season, and also for plunging in rockwork,
or about any rustic nooks in the pleasure-grounds, as, in such
situations, they are quite in keeping, and thrive admirably. As is well
known, they attain maturity very slowly; but when this condition is
reached, the plant sends up a flower spike, and, after perfecting this,
dies." _A. Sartorii_, and a few others are, however, exceptional, and
go on flowering year after year. It is certainly fallacious to suppose
it takes them a hundred years to flower. Agaves succeed well potted in
good loam and river sand, to which may be added a little peat and leaf
mould for some of the smaller-growing kinds. The drainage should be
good, as they enjoy a liberal supply of water during the summer season,
but during winter considerably less will be required. They can be
increased by suckers when these are to be obtained, and also by seeds,
to secure the production of which, in the species that do not yield
suckers, the flowers should be carefully impregnated. In the following
descriptive list of species, only those of horticultural value are
mentioned, some of which are still rare; and in describing them we
have availed ourselves of Mr. J. G. Baker's excellent monograph,
which appeared in the columns of the _Gardener's Chronicle_. Many are
omitted, not from any deficiency in horticultural beauty, but because,
in several instances, only one plant of a species is known to exist
in cultivation, and such cannot, therefore, hope to become in general
cultivation for many years hence.

    =A. xylacantha= (woody-spined).* _fl._ green, 1-1/2in. long; spike
    dense, rather shorter than the scape, its bracts linear-subulate;
    scape 5ft. to 6ft. long, its bracts subulate, all ascending,
    the lower ones 6in. to 8in. long. _l._ not more than twenty in
    a stemless rosette, ensiform, diverging irregularly and often
    curving, 1-1/2ft. to 3ft. long, 2in. to 3in. (rarely 4in.) broad at
    the middle, narrowed gradually upwards, a slightly glaucous dead
    green, marked with a few darker green lines on the back, furnished
    with a broad continuous horny border and a few very large irregular
    hooked teeth, often united or collected in pairs, 1/2in. to 3/4in.
    long, and 3/8in. to 1/2in. broad; terminal spine brown, pungent,
    1in. long. Mexico. A long-known, widely-spread, and distinct
    species. SYNS. _A. amurensis_ and _A. Vanderdonckii_.

    =A. x. hybrida= is a striking dwarf variety with vittate leaves,
    and smaller, more crowded deltoid-cuspidate prickles than in
    the type. It is also commonly known as _A. x. vittata_ and _A.
    perbella_.

[Illustration: FIG. 48. AGAVE YUCCA†FOLIA.]

    =A. yuccA|folia= (Yucca-leaved).* _fl._ greenish yellow, 1-1/4in.
    to 1-1/2in. long, in a dense spike 6in. to 15in. long, about
    14in. in diameter, sessile, solitary, or in pairs; scape 12ft.
    to 20ft. high. _l._ twenty to forty in a dense, shortly-stemmed
    rosette, linear, much recurved, 1-1/2ft. to 2-1/2ft. long, 3/4in.
    to 1in. broad at the middle; face deeply channelled, dull, rather
    glaucous green, with a pale band down the centre, the tip not at
    all pungent, the back broadly rounded, edge entire, or obscurely
    serrulate. Mexico, 1816. A most distinct species. See Fig. 48.

=AGERATUM= (from _a_, not, and _geras_, old; in reference to the
flowers being always clear). SYN. _CA"lestina_. ORD. _CompositA|_. This
genus includes several American species, for the most part half-hardy
annuals and biennials; or, if the seed is not allowed to ripen, they
become perennials. Involucre cup-shaped, of many imbricated linear
bracts; receptacle naked. Leaves opposite. A light rich soil is most
suitable. Very easily increased by cuttings or seeds; if required true,
the former is the only sure method of propagation. To grow large plants
for greenhouse decoration, sow the seeds in January, in heat, in sandy
soil, barely covering them. As soon as the young plants are large
enough, prick them off into thumb pots, and keep in heat till they grow
freely, then place them into a cooler house. Transfer into larger pots
as soon as the others are full of roots, until they are finally shifted
into 10in. or 12in. pots. When these are full of roots, the plants
should be watered with liquid manure twice a week, and they soon flower
well, making fine specimens. During hot weather especially, they should
be well syringed with clear water daily, to keep down red spider.
The plants required for bedding (for which purpose the dwarf garden
varieties are mostly used) should be raised about the same time, kept
in small pots, gradually hardened off, and planted out in the middle
or end of June. Cuttings of all the varieties strike readily in heat,
treated like most soft-wooded plants, and, when rooted, may be managed
as recommended for the seedlings.

    =A. Lasseauxii= (Lasseaux's). _fl.-heads_ rose-coloured, small,
    disposed in corymbose heads. Summer. _l._ lanceolate-elliptic.
    _h._ 1-1/2ft. to 2ft. Monte Video, 1870. A much-branched plant,
    requiring greenhouse protection in winter, and suitable for
    planting out in summer.

    =A. latifolium= (broad-leaved). A synonym of _Piqueria latifolia_.

    =A. mexicanum= (Mexican).* The commonest and most useful species,
    with a profusion of lilac-blue flowers. _h._ 2ft. Mexico, 1822.
    When used for bedding purposes it may be pegged down like the
    Verbena, or be allowed to grow its full height. Several very dwarf
    varieties of it have originated under cultivation, which supersede
    the species for bedding, the best of which are:--CUPID,* rich blue,
    very dwarf and floriferous; IMPERIAL DWARF, about 9in. high, with
    porcelain blue flowers; LADY JANE, of the same colour, very free;
    QUEEN,* silvery grey, about 9in. high; SNOWFLAKE,* white, very free
    and showy; SWANLEY BLUE,* very deep blue, 6in. to 8in. high. There
    is also a white-flowered variety of _Mexicanum_, which is very
    showy; and a variegated form, sometimes grown for the sake of its
    pretty foliage.

=AGGLOMERATE, AGGLOMERATED.= Collected into a heap or head.

=AGGLUTINATED.= Glued together.

=AGGREGATE, AGGREGATED.= Gathered together; usually applied to the

=AGLAIA.= (mythological: from Aglaia, the name of one of the Graces,
and given to this genus on account of its beauty and the sweet scent of
the flowers). ORD. _MeliaceA|_. Stove evergreen trees or shrubs having
very small flowers, disposed in branched axillary panicles. Leaves
alternate, trifoliate, or impari-pinnate. There are several species,
but the undermentioned is the only one worth growing yet introduced.
It thrives well in a mixture of turfy loam and peat. Young cuttings
ripened at the base, and taken off at a joint, will root in sand under
a hand glass, in heat.

    =A. odorata= (sweet-scented). _fl._ yellow, small, in axillary
    racemes, very sweet-scented, said to be used by the Chinese to
    scent their teas. February to May. _l._ pinnate, with five or seven
    glossy leaflets. _h._ 8ft. to 10ft. China, 1810.

=AGLAOMORPHA.= _See_ =Polypodium=.

=AGLAONEMA= (from _aglaos_, bright, and _nema_, a thread; supposed to
refer to the shining stamens). ORD. _AroideA|_. Stove perennials, allied
to _Arum_, and requiring similar treatment to the stove species of that
genus.

    =A. commutatum= (changed).* _fl._ white. _l._ greyish-blotched.
    _h._ 1ft. Philippines, 1863. SYN. _A. marantA|folium maculatum_.

    =A. Mannii= (Mann's).* _fl._, spathe 2in. long, whitish, with

    round so as to appear globular-oblong, opening at top; spadix
    projecting, white. August. _l._ elliptic-acuminate, light green,
    blotched irregularly with broadish angulate patches of grey. Stems
    slender, erect. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Borneo.

=AGNOSTUS.= _See_ =Stenocarpus=.

=AGRAPHIS.= Included under =Scilla= (which _see_).

=AGRIMONIA= (from _argos_, white; the cataract of the eye being white.
Once reputed to contain medicinal qualities). Agrimony. ORD. _RosaceA|_.
A genus of hardy herbaceous perennials, with interruptedly pinnate
leaves, each accompanied by a pair of stipules united to the petioles.
Flowers small, numerous, spiked; calyx turbinate, involucrated by
bristles; petals five. They are all of the easiest culture, growing
in ordinary soil. Readily increased by root-division. The most showy
species in cultivation are described below.

    =A. Eupatoria= (Eupatoria). _fl._ yellow, on an elongated spike.
    _l._ with elliptic-oblong, coarsely serrated leaflets, odd one

    _h._ 2ft. to 3ft. Italy, 1640.

=AGRIMONY.= _See_ =Agrimonia=.

=AGRIOTES.= _See_ =Wireworm=.

=AGROSTEMMA= (from _agros_, a field, and _stemma_, a crown; alluding
to the beauty of the flowers, which were formerly made into crowns
or garlands). Rose Campion. ORD. _CaryophyllaceA|_. Hardy evergreen
perennials and annuals, with broadish leaves, and one-flowered
peduncles. Of easy culture, and well adapted for borders. They will
all grow freely in common garden soil. Increased by division of the
roots, and seed. _A. cA"li-rosa_, and _A. flos-Jovis_ are, perhaps,
species of _Lychnis_, but the generic name which we have adopted is the
most common one. All the species of this genus are exceedingly pretty
free-flowering plants, and both annuals and perennials are well worth
growing.

    =A. cA"li-rosa= (rose of Heaven).* _fl._ delicate rose, white, or
    bright purple, solitary, terminal. Summer. Levant, &c., 1713. An
    annual species about 1ft. high, not tomentose; should be grown in
    patches. Sow the seed in April.

[Illustration: FIG. 49. AGROSTEMMA CA'LI-ROSA FIMBRIATA.]

    =A. c.-r. fimbriata= (fimbriate). A form having fimbriated petals.
    Known also as _nana_. _h._ 9in. See Fig. 49.

    purple flowers, and compact habit. See Fig. 50.

    =A. coronaria= (crowned).* _fl._ white, with the middle red; petals
    emarginate, crowned, serrated; peduncles elongated, one-flowered.
    July. _l._ lanceolate, very broad, leathery; plant woolly
    throughout. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. South Europe, 1596. This species is
    admirably adapted for naturalising on dry hill sides, and in the
    wild garden. There are several varieties seen in gardens with
    a great diversity of colour, including dark crimson, white, and
    sometimes double flowers. See Fig. 51.

    =A. flos-Jovis.=* Flower of Jove. _fl._ purple or scarlet, in
    umbellate heads; peduncles short, rather branched. July. _l._
    lanceolate, stem-clasping, silky, tomentose. _h._ 1-1/2ft.
    Switzerland, 1726. Plant white from tomentum. See Fig. 52.

[Illustration: FIG. 52. AGROSTEMMA FLOS-JOVIS, showing Habit and
Flower.]

=AGROSTIS= (from _agros_, a field; the Greek name for a kind of grass).
Bent Grass. ORD. _GramineA|_. Annual or perennial grasses. Panicle
loose; spikelets compressed. Several of the species are very effective,
and well worth growing; and the spikes are pretty objects, when dried,
for window vases, &c. They are of easy culture, in ordinary garden
soil. Sow seeds during spring in the open border, in tufts, among
ferns, &c., or in pots for decorative purposes.

    =A. elegans= (elegant). _h._ 1ft. Russia, 1834.

[Illustration: FIG. 53. AGROSTIS NEBULOSA.]

    =A. nebulosa= (cloud).* Cloud Grass. _fl._ panicles resemble, when
    developed, a cloud resting over the ground. _h._ 1-1/2ft. Very
    light and elegant. Annual. See Fig. 53.

    =A. pulchella= (pretty).* Dwarfer, and with a more rigid habit than
    _A. nebulosa_. It is, nevertheless, a most graceful plant, and
    valuable for bouquet making, and for winter decorative purposes.
    _h._ 6in. to 12in. Russia. Annual.

    =A. spica-venti= (windward-spiked). _fl._ panicle large, silky
    looking, loosely spreading. England. Annual.

=AGROTIS.= _See_ =Pot-herb Moths= and =Turnip Moth=.

=AILANTUS= (from _ailanto_, referring to its lofty growth). Tree of
Heaven. ORD. _XanthoxylaceA|_. Tall deciduous trees. The stove species
will grow freely in a mixture of loam and peat; and the best way to
increase these is by pieces of the roots, planted in a pot with their
points above the ground, and placed in a hotbed, where they will soon
make fine plants.

    =A. excelsa= (tall). _fl._ whitish green, disposed similar to the
    following. _l._ abruptly pinnate, 3ft. long, with ten to fourteen
    pairs of leaflets coarsely toothed at the base, without glands.
    _h._ 66ft. India, 1800. A stove tree.

    =A. glandulosa= (glandulous).* _fl._ whitish green, disposed
    in large branched, terminal, fascicled panicles, exhaling a
    disagreeable smell. August. _l._ impari-pinnate; leaflets coarsely
    toothed at the base with glands. (The leaves on vigorous young
    trees are sometimes 6ft. in length.) _h._ 60ft. China, 1751. This
    tree grows with great rapidity for the first ten or twelve years,
    in favourable situations, afterwards its growth is much slower. It
    is quite hardy, and thrives in almost any soil, though one that is
    light and somewhat humid, and a sheltered situation, suits it best.
    It is a very desirable tree for plantations, or to stand singly on
    lawns, and is easily increased by slips of the roots.

=AINSLA†A= (in honour of Dr. Whitelaw Ainslie, author of a work on
Indian drugs). ORD. _CompositA|_. Herbaceous perennials, of recent
introduction. Although, no doubt, both species will prove tolerably
hardy, they should have slight protection during winter. They thrive in
light rich soil. Propagated by divisions of the root.

    =A. aptera= (wingless). _fl.-head_ purple, disposed in an elongated
    spike-like panicle. _l._ deeply cordate, sinuately toothed;
    petioles wingless, whence the name. Sikkim Himalayas, 1882.

    =A. WalkerA|= (Mrs. Walker's).* _fl.-heads_ slender, distant,
    shortly stalked, borne in erect or somewhat nodding racemes; the
    white corolla-lobes and the red purple anthers make a pretty
    contrast. _h._ about 1ft. Hong Kong, 1875. A very rare and graceful
    species.

=AIR.= Pure atmospheric air is composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and a very
small quantity of carbonic acid gas, all of which are essential to the
growth of plants. Air-giving is a term used by gardeners to lessen the
temperature of a greenhouse, or to equalise it with that outside. _See_
=Ventilation=.

=AIRA= (from _aira_, applied by the Greeks to _Lolium temulentum_).
Hair Grass. ORD. _GramineA|_. Chiefly hardy grasses, of agricultural
value. Panicle loose; spikelet compressed, with two perfect flowers,
and sometimes a neuter. Of easy culture, in ordinary garden soil. Sow
seeds in spring.

    =A. flexuosa= (waved).* The Waved Hair Grass. _fl._ shining
    brown; panicle erect, spreading, with waved angular branches and
    flower-stalks. _l._ short. Stem upwards of 1ft. high, erect,
    smooth. England. A very pretty and graceful perennial.

[Illustration: FIG. 54. AIRA PULCHELLA.]

    =A. pulchella= (pretty).* _fl._ panicles loose, very delicate
    and graceful. _l._ very short. _h._ 6in. to 8in. South Europe.
    An elegant plant, with tufted filiform stems. One of the best of
    dwarf-growing ornamental grasses. See Fig. 54.

=AIR-PLANT.= _See_ =Aerides=, also =Epiphytes=.

=AITONIA= (in honour of W. Aiton, once Head Gardener at Kew). ORD.
_MeliaceA|_. A small and rather interesting greenhouse evergreen shrub
from the Cape of Good Hope, and thriving well in an equal mixture of
sandy loam and peat. Young cuttings will root in sand, under a bell
glass, with bottom heat. The cuttings must not be put in very close
together, and the glass should be wiped frequently, as they are apt to
damp off.

    =A. capensis= (Cape). _fl._ pink; petals four, shorter than the
    projecting stamens. July. _h._ 2ft. 1777.

=AIZOON= (from _aei_, always, and _zoos_, alive; tenacious of life).
ORD. _PortulacaceA|_. Greenhouse annuals, biennials, or evergreen
shrubs. Flowers apetalous; calyx five-cleft, coloured on the inner
surface. The undermentioned species is the only one worth growing. It
requires no shade, a dry atmosphere, and light sandy soil. Propagated
by seeds and cuttings.

    =A. sarmentosum= (sarmentose). _fl._ greenish, sessile. Summer.
    _l._ opposite, linear-filiform, rather connate, glabrous; branches
    rather villous, three-flowered at the apex, the two lateral flowers
    are bracteated, and spring from the sides of the middle one.
    Sub-shrub, erect, diffuse, glabrous, branched. South Africa, 1862.

=AJAVA SEED.= _See_ =Ptychotis=.

=AJAX MAXIMUS.= _See_ =Narcissus=.

=AJOWAN.= _See_ =Ptychotis=.

=AJUGA= (from _a_, not, and _zugon_, a yoke; in reference to the calyx
being equal, not bilabiate). Bugle. ORD. _LabiatA|_. Hardy annual
or perennial herbaceous plants, usually procumbent or ascending,
sometimes stoloniferous. Whorls two or many flowered, dense, sometimes
all axillary, when the floral leaves conform to those of the stem;
sometimes the superior whorls are approximate into spikes, then the
floral leaves are small, and of a different form from the stem ones.
All the species are of easy cultivation in ordinary garden soil.
Perennials increased by divisions, or by seeds sown in the open border,
during spring or autumn. The seeds of annual kinds may be sown in the
open border in spring, where they are intended to remain.

    =A. alpina= (alpine). Synonymous with _A. genevensis_.

    =A. australis= (southern). _fl._ blue; whorls six or more flowered;
    lower whorls remote, upper ones sub-spicate, floral leaves similar
    to the stem ones, exceeding the flowers. May to July. _l._
    narrow-oblong, narrowed at the base, quite entire or sinuated,
    thickish, rather villous. Stem ascending, or erect. _h._ 6in. New
    Holland, 1822. Perennial.

    =A. ChamA|pitys= (ground-pine). _fl._ yellow, dotted with red,
    pubescent outside; whorls two-flowered; floral leaves similar to
    the others, exceeding the flowers. April. _l._ deeply trifid, with

    usually coarsely toothed, membranaceous, green on both surfaces,
    and beset with scattered hairs. Stem erect, pilose. _h._ 6in. to
    1ft. Europe. A very variable species, admirably adapted as an
    alpine plant, and succeeds best in bog soil, where its roots will
    have plenty of room; it increases rapidly. Perennial. SYNS. _A.
    alpina_, _A. rugosa_.

    =A. orientalis= (oriental).* _fl._ blue; whorls six or more
    flowered, distant, or the upper ones are approximate. May. _l._
    lower ones large, petiolate; ovate, coarsely and sinuately toothed,

    lobed or toothed, exceeding the flowers. Stem ascending, pilosely
    woolly. _h._ 1ft. to 1-1/2ft. Eastern Europe, 1732. This species
    should be grown in a dry, sunny spot.

    =A. pyramidalis= (pyramidal).* _fl._ blue or purple; whorls
    many-flowered, upper ones or all spicate. May and June. _l._
    stem ones approximate, scarcely petiolate, obovate; floral ones
    broad-ovate, clasping the flowers, tetragonally pyramidate; the
    upper ones often coloured, all quite entire or obscurely sinuated.
    Stem erect. _h._ 6in. Scotland. Perennial. Of this there are
    several handsome garden varieties.

[Illustration: FIG. 55. FLOWER OF AJUGA REPTANS.]

    =A. reptans= (creeping).* _fl._ varying from blue to rose-colour;
    lower whorls remote; upper ones spicate, six to twenty flowered.
    May. _l._ ovate or obovate, quite entire or sinuated, and are, as
    well as the stem, nearly glabrous; radical one petiolate, stem ones
    nearly sessile. Stem creeping. The variegated and darkest leaved
    forms of this are superior to the type for horticultural purposes.
    Britain. Perennial. See Fig. 55.

    =A. rugosa= (wrinkled). Synonymous with _A. genevensis_.

=AKEBIA= (its Japanese name). SYN. _Rajania_. ORD. _LardizabalaceA|_. A
pretty twining shrub, succeeding well in the south-western counties of
England, or in Scotland, trained to a trellis, or rambling over other
shrubs in the open; but, when so grown, it requires the protection of
a mat in winter. It makes an excellent twiner for the cool greenhouse.
Sandy loam, leaf soil, and peat are most suitable for its culture.
Increased by root divisions and cuttings.

    =A. quinata= (five-leafletted).* _fl._ purplish brown, small,
    in axillary racemes, very fragrant. March. _l._ on very slender

=ALANGIUM= (from _Alangi_, the Malabar name of the first species).
ORD. _AlangiaceA|_. Very showy stove evergreen trees, with alternate,
exstipulate, entire leaves. Flowers few, sessile, in axillary
fascicles; calyx campanulate; petals linear, spreadingly reflexed.
They thrive well in a mixture of loam and peat, or any light rich soil.
Cuttings root readily if planted in a pot of sand, with a hand glass
placed over them, in heat.

    =A. decapetalum= (ten-petaled).* _fl._ pale purple, with a
    grateful scent, solitary, or two to three together in the axils
    of the leaves; petals ten or twelve. June. _l._ alternate,

which they are often referred.

    =A. Julibrissin= (Julibrissin). _fl._ white; heads pedunculate,
    forming a terminal somewhat corymbose panicle. August. _l._ with
    eight to twelve pairs of pinnA|, each pinna bearing about thirty
    pairs of dimidiate-oblong, acute, rather ciliated leaflets. _h._

    ovate-oblong, axillary, twin. May. _l._ with eight to ten pairs of
    pinnA|, each pinna bearing twenty-five to thirty pairs of linear,
    bluntish leaflets; petioles and calyces clothed with velvety down.
    _h._ 6ft. to 10ft. New Holland, 1803. A very distinct unarmed
    greenhouse species, and one of the best for window gardening.

    =A. Nemu.= A synonym of _A. Julibrissin_.

=ALBUCA= (from _albicans_, or _albus_, white; the colour of the earlier
species). ORD. _LiliaceA|_. A rather extensive genus of Cape of Good
Hope bulbs, requiring ordinary greenhouse culture. Closely allied to
_Ornithogalum_. Perianth six-cleft, three outer segments spreading;

=ALKANET.= _See_ =Anchusa tinctoria=.

=ALLAMANDA= (named in memory of Dr. Allamand, of Leyden, who first
communicated seeds of this genus to LinnA|us). ORD. _ApocynaceA|_.
Elegant climbing evergreen stove plants. Peduncles terminal and
many-flowered; corolla funnel-shaped, with a narrow tube, gamopetalous,
large, inflated, five-cleft at the apex. Leaves verticillate. This
genus differs from all others of the same order, in the figure of
the corolla. Of comparatively easy culture. To obtain their beauty
of foliage and flowers, the shoots should be tied to wires placed
within 8in. or 9in. of the glass that forms the roof of the structure
in which the plants are growing. Trained in this way, and the shoots
allowed to ramble in a somewhat natural manner, the effect, when the
plants are in flower, is grander and more pleasing in every respect
than when the shoots are tied to a formal trellis, of whatever shape.
When thoroughly established, they succeed admirably in a compost of
three parts good fibry loam, and one part wood charcoal or coarse river
sand, with some rotten cow manure added. When potting the plants,
make the fresh compost firm round the old balls of soil, and do not
fill the pots too full; leave room for plenty of water, as, when in
active growth, they require a liberal daily supply. They must be pruned
annually in January or February, cutting the previous year's shoots
back to within a joint or two of the old wood. Allamandas should be
exposed to the light as much as possible at all seasons of the year.
In winter months they require but little water, but the drainage must
always be perfect. They are remarkably free from insect attacks of
any kind. It may be also observed that the temperature should never
fall below 55deg. This genus is easily propagated by cuttings, which
will root at any time of the year in a bottom heat of from 70deg. to
80deg. The usual time is, however, in spring, when the old plants are
pruned back. Choose the tops of the shoots, retaining two or three
joints to each cutting; place these in a compost of sand and peat or
leaf mould in equal proportions, singly, in small pots. Press the soil
firmly around each cutting, and, when all are inserted, give a good
watering, and plunge the pots in the propagating bed. Attend to shading
and watering, and in about three weeks' time they will have emitted
roots, and started to grow at the tops. The pots should now be raised
out of the plunging material, and placed upon the surface thereof, and
there allowed to remain two or three weeks longer; when the young roots
will have, by this time, filled the little pots, and a shift into the
larger ones will be necessary. Return the plants to the propagating
bed, but do not plunge them therein. As soon as it is certain that the
roots have commenced growth in the fresh soil, pinch the point of each
plant that is intended to be grown on a trellis. This will cause the
remaining buds to push out fresh shoots; and these, as soon as they
have made two joints or whorls of leaves each, should have their points
pinched out also. By repotting the plants as often as they fill their
pots with roots during the first season of their growth, and pinching
the points out of the shoots twice or thrice in the same time, a good
foundation will be formed, from which the future specimens will spring.
In the case of plants intended to be trained up rafters or pillars,
they should not have their points pinched out until they attain to the
height where it is desirable they should have more than one shoot, and
be repotted as recommended above, for the first year; but, after that,
they will require to be repotted only once a year, and this should be
done soon after the buds have started to grow afresh in the spring.

=ALLOSORUS.= _See_ =Cryptogramme= and =PellA|a=.

=ALLOTMENT GARDENS.= A system of assigning small portions of land to be
cultivated by labourers after their ordinary day's work.

The following are the most important rules to be carried out; but,
should occasion arise, other rules must be made to meet particular
cases:--

1. Each Allotment should consist of a rood of land (=1/4 acre) to be
let yearly at a rent of not more than 10s.

2. The Allotment to be let for one year only, to be re-let to the same
occupier, provided his character has been satisfactory during the
preceding year.

3. The rent shall be considered due at Michaelmas. If it remains unpaid
for one month after that date, the Allotment shall be forfeited.

4. The Allotment to be cultivated solely by spade husbandry, and the
same crop shall not be planted on the same part two years in succession.

5. Separate Allotments shall be divided by a space not less than 18in.

6. Any occupier trespassing on his neighbour's Allotment, or in any
way interfering or damaging the same, shall not be allowed to hold his
Allotment after the expiration of the year.

=ALLSPICE TREE.= _See_ =Pimenta=.

=ALMEIDEA= (in honour of J. R. P. de Almeida, a Brazilian, who was
of great assistance to St. Hilaire while travelling in Brazil). ORD.
_RutaceA|_. Stove trees or shrubs with alternate, simple, entire,
stalked leaves. Racemes terminal, divided at the apex into compound
thyrse-like panicles. The undermentioned species will grow freely in a
mixture of loam, sand, and peat. Partly ripened cuttings will root in
sand under a hand glass, in heat.

    =A. rubra= (red). _fl._ pink; petals very blunt; racemes compound.
    September. _l._ lanceolate, acute at base. _h._ 12ft. Brazil, 1849.

=ALMOND.= _See_ =Amygdalus=.

=ALMOND-LEAVED WILLOW.= _See_ =Salix triandra=.

=ALNUS= (from _al_, near, and _lan_, the bank of a river; general
habitat of the genus). The Alder Tree. ORD. _BetulaceA|_. A genus of
deciduous trees and shrubs. Flowers monA"cious; barren ones in long
drooping autumnal catkins, lasting through the winter; fertile ones,
produced in spring, in oval catkins, resembling a fir-cone in shape,
the fleshy scales of which become indurated and ligneous as they
approach maturity. Leaves stalked, roundish, blunt. Propagated usually
by seeds, which are gathered towards the end of October; they require
to be well dried, in order that the cones do not become mouldy. The
seeds are sprinkled lightly on the ground with the slightest possible
covering. Towards the end of the year, the seedlings will be about
10in. high. They are then planted in rows 1-1/2ft. apart, and 6in.
from each other, where they may remain for two years, after which they
can be placed out in the situations where they are intended to stand.
Planting is best done in November or March; and, if it is designed to
make a plantation of Alder, the young trees should be put in holes,
made with an ordinary garden spade, about 9in. deep, and about 4ft.
apart. They are also increased, but rarely, by cuttings, by suckers,
and by grafting.

    =A. cordifolia= (heart-shaped-leaved).* _fl._ greenish-brown. March
    and April, before the development of the leaves. _l._ heart-shaped,
    acuminate, dark green, and shining. _h._ 15ft. to 50ft. Calabria
    and Naples, 1820. A large, very distinct, and handsome round-headed
    tree. It grows rapidly in dry soil, and is one of the most
    interesting of ornamental trees.

    =A. firma= (firm).* _l._ oval lanceolate, acuminate, sharply
    serrated, many-nerved. Japan. One of the most distinct of all the
    Alders.

[Illustration: FIG. 60. ALNUS GLUTINOSA, showing Catkins and Fruit.]

    =A. glutinosa= (sticky).* _barren catkins_ long, large, and
    cylindrical, pendent, their footstalks branched. _fertile
    catkins_ small, ovate, with deep red scales. Spring. _l._
    roundish-cuneiform, obtuse lobed at the margin, and serrated,
    somewhat glutinous, downy in the axils of the nerves beneath.
    _h._ 50ft. to 60ft. Britain. The Alder affects moist and damp
    situations, and, as it grows quickly, it is a useful tree to plant
    in bare situations. It is valuable as a nurse to other trees by the
    sea-side. See Fig. 60.

    =A. g. aurea= (golden).* Foliage golden colour.

    =A. g. incisa= (incised).* Compact form, with leaves quite like
    those of common hawthorn. SYN. _A. g. oxyacanthifolia_.

    =A. g. laciniata= (cut).* _l._ oblong and pinnatifid, with the
    lobes acute. This has elegant drooping branches and fern-like
    leaves, and is one of the best.

    =A. g. oxyacanthifolia= (sharp-prickled). Synonymous with _A. g.
    incisa_.

    =A. g. quercifolia= (oak-leaved).* _l._ with a sinuate outline,
    like that of the common oak. A very distinct form. The variety
    _imperialis_ (=_asplenifolia_) slightly differs in its more or less
    lobed or cut foliage; _A. g. variegata_ is a variegated form.

    =A. incana= (hoary).* _l._ broadly oval or ovate, rounded at
    the base, sharply serrate, whitened, and mostly downy beneath.
    _h._ 8ft. to 20ft. North Temperate regions. This affects drier
    situations than our native _A. glutinosa_.

    =A. viridis= (green). _fertile catkins_ slender stalked, clustered,
    ovoid. _l._ round oval or slightly heart-shaped, glutinous and
    smooth or softly downy beneath, serrate, with very sharp and
    closely set teeth. Mountainous regions of northern hemisphere.

=ALOCASIA= (from _a_, without, and _Colocasia_). Allied to _Colocasia_.
ORD. _AroideA|_. Stove plants of great beauty, often with large and
handsomely variegated, usually peltate, leaves, and shortly petiolate
glaucous spathes. They are not difficult to grow, with a strong moist
heat, and an abundant supply of water to the roots. The soil should
consist of fibrous peat, with a little light fibry loam, in large
lumps; to this add a good proportion of sphagnum and lumps of charcoal,
with plenty of silver sand. Keep the bulbs and soil raised well above
the rim of the pots, and finish off with a surfacing of either sphagnum
or cocoa-nut fibre. The latter will soon encourage new rootlets. Crock
the pot quite two-thirds up with clean, broken potsherds. Water freely
when in good growth, and give liquid manure once or twice a week
through the growing season. Shade during bright sunshine in the spring
and summer months. Increased by seeds and division of the stems or
rhizome. Winter temperature, 60deg. to 65deg.; summer, 75deg. to 85deg.

    very slightly parted at the base, deep olive-tinted green on the
    upper surface, having stout, well-defined ribs, and the margin of
    an ivory white; dull purple at the back.

    =A. illustris= (bright). _l._ ovate-sagittate, rich green, with
    olive-black patches, deflexed, 1-1/2ft. long. India, 1873.

    acuminate, with their blades deflexed from the top of the erect
    mottled stalks, ground colour green, surface marked with large
    wedge-shaped blotches of dark brown; veins bright green, 6in. to
    8in. long. India, 1867. A very distinct and free growing species.

    =A. Johnstoni= (Johnston's).* _l._ semi-erect, arrow-shaped,
    peltate, the front lobe being about 12in. long, and the two back
    lobes 14in. long and divergent, olive-green, prettily variegated
    and strikingly veined with bright rosy red. The leafstalks are
    furnished at intervals with irregular whorls of stiff spines,
    the points of which are turned upwards. Stem darkly mottled with
    flesh-coloured bands just above the spines. Solomon Isles, 1875.
    This plant has quite a unique appearance.

    =A. Liervalii= (Lierval's). _l._ bright green. Philippines, 1869.

    white, sometimes nearly quite white; footstalks broadly streaked
    with pure white. Ceylon. A very striking and effective large
    growing plant.

    =A. Marshallii= (Marshall's). _l._ green, with dark blotches, and
    broad central silvery band. India, 1811.

    green beneath, extreme length 22in. to 31in. _h._ 4ft. to 4-1/2ft.
    North-West Borneo, 1878. Although this is not such an ornamental
    species as _A. Lowii_, _A. Thibautiana_, or _A. cuprea_, it has the
    merit of being a much larger and bolder plant than either of these,
    and is one of the largest species in the genus.

    =A. Sedeni= (Seden's).* A hybrid between _A. Lowii_ and _A.
    cuprea_. _l._ oval, cordate, sagittate, deflexed, bronzy green,

    This is said to be by far the finest of the genus.

    =A. variegata= (variegated). _fl._ whitish. _l._ leafstalk mottled
    with violet. India, 1854.

    =A. zebrina= (zebra).* _l._ erect, broadly sagittate, rich dark

=ALOE= (from _Alloeh_, its Arabic name). Allied genera: _Apicra_,
_Haworthia_, _Pachidendron_, _Phylloma_. Including _Rhipodendron_. ORD.
_LiliaceA|_. This hitherto much confused genus, and its allies, have
been completely revised by Mr. J. G. Baker (_vide_ "Journal of the
Linnean Society," vol. xxviii. pp. 152-182), to whose account we are
indebted for many of the following particulars:--Plant with or without
stems; shrubs or (rarely) trees; leaves thick, fleshy, frequently
in a rosette; peduncles simple or racemed, endowed with few or many
empty bracts. Flowers racemed; pedicels bracteated at base, solitary;
perianth-tube straight or slightly recurved; segments elongated;
stamens hypogynous, as long as the perianth, or longer. Mr. Baker
describes over eighty species, many of which, for various and important
reasons, have no claim upon our space. Natives of the Cape of Good
Hope, except where otherwise stated. These very interesting and curious
plants thrive well in a mixture of open loam and peat, together with a
small quantity of well decomposed manure. If old brick rubbish, or any
other similar material is mixed with the soil to ensure perfect and
rapid drainage, so much the better. Water, especially during winter,
must be carefully administered. They thrive in an ordinary greenhouse,
and cannot have too much light at any time.

    =A. linearis= (linear-leaved). _fl._ scarlet, with a dark bottom,
    like most of the species. May to October. _l._ opposite, or three
    in a whorl, linear, entire or remotely denticulated; young leaves
    fascicled in the axils of the old ones. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Peru,
    1790. Greenhouse shrub. SYN. _Hemimeris coccinea_.

    =A. linifolia= (flax-leaved).* _fl._ scarlet. _h._ 1ft. to 1-1/2ft.

    incisifolia_, and one of the best annuals.

=ALOYSIA= (in honour of Maria Louisa, mother of Ferdinand VII., King
of Spain). Sweet-scented Verbena. ORD. _VerbenaceA|_. This genus is
nearly allied to _Verbena_, which _see_ for generic characters. A
greenhouse deciduous shrub, with a very fine perfume and graceful
habit. The most satisfactory plan of culture is to obtain well-grown
thrifty young plants in spring, and grow them on for the season. As
the wood ripens, give less water until they are at rest, when it must
be nearly withheld. About the end of January, bring into the light and
warmth, and water thoroughly. As soon as the plants break, cut back to
three or four eyes; and when the young shoots are about an inch long,
transfer into rich sandy soil, using pots a size or two smaller than
those they were in before. When the pots are full of roots, transfer
to those that are to hold the plants for the season. By this mode of
culture, good plants are to be maintained for any length of time.
Aloysias form excellent pillar subjects for either a cold greenhouse,
or out-of-doors, in which latter situation they thrive remarkably
well, but require thorough protection, with straw bands or mats, from
November until March, and afterwards at night, until danger from severe
frosts has passed. They require no summer training, their young growth
being continually cut off for the many purposes of decoration to which
they are applied, and to which they are so well adapted. They are
easily increased by young cuttings in spring, which should be placed in
sandy soil and gentle heat, when they will root in about three weeks.

    =A. citriodora= (lemon-scented).* _fl._ whitish or lilac, very
    small, in terminal panicles. August. _l._ pale green, lanceolate,
    agreeably scented, arranged in whorls of threes; branches slender.
    Chili, 1781. SYNS. _Lippia citriodora_, _Verbena triphylla_.

=ALPINE GARDEN.= A very interesting style of gardening, which succeeds
best by imitating Nature as closely as possible. The situation may
be an open or a sheltered one. In building a Rock or Alpine Garden,
it should be so arranged that all aspects are secured--shady and
sunny--fully or in degree only. Pockets and crevices of various
sizes may be made, and filled with soil suitable for the subjects
to be planted therein, each one having a direct connection with the
bulk of the soil; and the constructing material should be arranged
with a gentle fall, so that moisture drains towards rather than from
the roots. Alpine plants, as a rule, flourish better on a properly
constructed rockery than if placed in any other position, because
thorough drainage is effected, and the long and fine roots can run
down in the crevices, where the soil is cool and moist. Although most
alpine plants are naturally exposed to the full action of sun and wind,
they should be placed out in early autumn, or early spring, so as to
become thoroughly established before the approach of scorching summer
weather. Failing materials necessary for the construction of a rockery,
many alpines are easily grown in the ordinary border, in a naturally or
artificially well drained situation. Excavate to the depth of 18in.,
put in a layer of stones, broken bricks, &c., 6in. deep; fill up with
rich fibrous loam and leaf mould, adding sufficient sand to keep the
soil porous. When the desired subjects are firmly planted, cover the
surface with small gravel or stone chippings, which, while allowing the
rain to penetrate the soil, effectually checks evaporation, and keeps
it moist and cool, as well as giving the appearance of rocky _dA(C)bris_.
The effect will be better if the surface is slightly undulated.

=ALPINE ROSE.= _See_ =Rhododendron ferrugineum=.

=ALPINIA= (in honour of Prosper Alpinus, an Italian botanist). ORD.
_ZingiberaceA|_. A rather large genus of stove herbaceous perennials,
with considerable grace and beauty. Flowers disposed in terminal
spikes. Leaves lanceolate, smooth, even, entire, sheathed at the base,
and having transverse veins. Roots fleshy, branched, having much of
the smell and taste of ginger. The soil can hardly be too rich for the
successful culture of these plants. A mixture of equal parts loam,
peat, leaf mould, or thoroughly rotted hotbed manure, freely mixed with
sharp sand or fine charcoal dust, forms an excellent compost. During
the growing season, a top dressing of rotten dung, and a frequent
application of weak manure water, prove excellent stimulants. They
grow rapidly and consume a great deal of food in the production of
so much stem and so many leaves. Unless the former is vigorous and
of considerable thickness, it will fail to be crowned with spikes
of flower. Alpinias require a high temperature, a rich, light soil,
abundance of water, and not a little space, to grow them well. Soon
after flowering, the plants will assume the yellow leaf, when water may
be gradually withheld; but no attempt should be made to dry them off
too severely, even after the stems die down. Nor must they be stored
when at rest in a low temperature; in fact, they require as much heat
to preserve them in health when resting as at any other time. The best
time to divide the plants is after the young shoots have made an inch
of growth in spring.

    drooping. May. _l._ lanceolate, smooth, even, entire. _h._ 13ft.
    India, 1792. This species looks best in considerable masses, even
    larger than those shown in the illustration, grown in large pots or
    tubs, or planted out in borders of tropical houses. It should on
    no account be severely divided. See Fig. 62.

[Illustration: FIG. 65. ALSOPHILA REBECCA†.]

=ALSTRA-MERIA= (in honour of Baron AlstrA¶mer, a Swedish botanist and
friend of LinnA|us). ORD. _AmaryllidaceA|_. Tall handsome hardy or
half-hardy tuberous rooted plants, with leafy stems and terminal
umbels of richly-coloured flowers; perianth regular, six-parted,
subcampanulate; inner segments narrower, two of which are somewhat
tubulose at the base; stamens included within, and inserted with
perianth; stigma trifid. Leaves linear, lanceolate, or ovate, and
resupinate, or inverted in position by the twisting of the petiole.
Cultivation: Few plants need less attention to grow them successfully,
either in pots or planted out. The best position for those kinds which
succeed outside is a deep and dry, sloping, sheltered border, in a
compost of two-parts peat and leaf soil, and one loam with some sharp
sand. Water freely if severe drought sets in; a surface covering of
common moss, or cut fern in winter, will prove an advantage. They are
very effective in masses. Propagation: They may be increased by seed or
root division. Sow the former when ripe, or in early spring, thinly in
pans, pots, or boxes, and place in a cool house or frame, so that they
will receive some fostering in their early stages. The seedlings should
be pricked out singly, when large enough to handle, and grown on till
well established under glass. A mixture of peat, leaf mould, and sandy
loam, is the best compost in which to sow the seeds and grow the young
plants. When sufficiently established, they may be placed in a warm
sheltered spot outside, and about 1ft. apart. The fasciculated masses
of fleshy roots are readily separated into as many pieces as there are
crowns; this operation may be performed during September or October, or
February and March; but it must be done carefully. Except for the sake
of increase, the less they are disturbed the better. They are excellent
subjects for pot culture (some can only be managed thus, unless planted
out in a house), and may be potted as early in the autumn as possible,
in 8in., 10in., or 12in. pots. Thorough drainage is essential; arrange
the crocks carefully, and place a layer of thin turfy loam over them.
A compost of equal parts turfy loam, leaf mold, and fibrous peat,
with an abundance of sand, will suit them admirably. Water sparingly
at first, but when root-action is fully resumed, they must never be
allowed to get dry. Support the stems by staking when they require it,
and just previous to flowering, top-dress with some rotten manure and
leaf soil. Occasional syringings will be necessary to keep down red
spider, especially if the atmosphere is very dry. As the plants finish
flowering, and the leaves fade, gradually diminish the supply of water
until the stems are quite down, when they may be placed somewhere out
of the way, free from frost, for the winter, but not kept dry enough
to make them shrivel. In repotting, as much of the old soil as is
practicable should be removed, without seriously disturbing the roots,
and the plants shifted into larger or the same sized pots, according to
their condition. AlstrA¶merias were at one time much more largely grown
than they are at present, and the genus was represented in nearly every
garden.

    to 12in. Brazil, 1776. This stove species requires perfect rest in
    winter. SYN. _A. Ligtu_.

[Illustration: FIG. 67. FLOWER OF ALSTRA-MERIA PELEGRINA.]

    =A. chilensis= (Chilian).* _fl._ blood-red or pink, large, the two
    upper interior petals longer and narrower, variegated with yellow
    lines; in pairs on a five to six stalked umbel. Summer and autumn.
    _l._ scattered, obovate, spathulate; upper ones lanceolate, twisted
    at the base, minutely fringed on the edges, glaucescent. _h._
    2ft. to 3ft. Chili, 1849. Hardy. There are many varieties of this
    species, varying in colour from a rosy white to a deep orange or
    red.

    =A. densiflora= (thickly-flowered).* _fl._, perianth scarlet,
    dotted with black spots inside towards the base; umbels
    many-flowered, dense; pedicels pubescent, rarely bracteated. _l._
    alternate, ovate, shortly acuminate, pubescent underneath. Stem
    climbing, glabrous. Peru, 1865. Tender species.

    =A. Flos Martini= (St. Martin's flower). Synonymous with _A.
    pulchra_.

    =A. Hookeri= (Hooker's). Synonymous with _A. Simsii_.

    =A. Ligtu= (Ligtu). Synonymous with _A. caryophyllA|a_.

    tender. See Fig. 67.

    =A. p. alba= (white).* Lily of the Incas. _fl._ white. Perhaps
    this is the most chaste of all the AlstrA¶merias, and more tender
    than many others; it should have a specially warm spot, or the
    protection of glass. 1877.

    =A. peruviana= (Peruvian). Synonymous with _A. versicolor_.

    =A. psittacina= (parrot-like).* _fl._ bright crimson at the base,
    greenish upwards, spotted with purple; upper perianth segments

[Illustration: FIG. 68. ALSTRA-MERIA VERSICOLOR, showing Habit and
Flower.]

    =A. versicolor= (various coloured).* _fl._ yellow, with purple
    marks; lowest segment the broadest; umbel of usually three
    shortly-stalked blooms, very floriferous. Late summer. _l._

    =A. v. niveo-marginata= (snowy-margined).* _fl._ rose, crimson and
    white, with green tips and black spots. _l._ lanceolate, stalked,
    white-edged. 1875. A charming but scarce variety.

=ALTERNANTHERA= (in allusion to the anthers being alternately
barren). ORD. _AmaranthaceA|_. Well known ornamental-leaved half-hardy
plants, with inconspicuous flowers in axillary heads. Some of the
undermentioned species and varieties belong, technically speaking, to
_Telanthera_, in which genus the five stamens are inseparate below, and
alternate with as many sterile filaments. They are so universally known
in gardening under the present generic name, that we have here included
them for convenience' sake. Where Alternantheras are used in large
quantities (and if they are to be used effectively, a considerable
number must be provided), their economical propagation becomes a matter
of importance. A good colour can only be secured by growing them in
some house or pit in the full light and warmth of the sun; for, unless
so grown, green or badly coloured plants will be the result. The best
and quickest way of producing this class of plants in large quantities,
is to make up a special hotbed for them about the end of March or
beginning of April. If a pit be used, it should be filled up within
6in. of the glass with leaves and manure, or any other material that
will produce a steady bottom heat of 80deg. or 85deg., and will last
for three weeks or so at that point; which, at this season, will be an
easy matter. When the heat has become regular and steady, about 4in. or
5in. of light, rich, sandy soil should be placed all over the surface,
adding, at the same time, a sprinkling of silver sand on the top, and
pressing it moderately firm with a flat board. The cuttings may now be
prepared and dibbled in, 1in. apart each way. If kept close, moist, and
shaded from bright sunshine, in a few days they will be forming roots,
and so soon as that takes place the shading should be discontinued, and
the ventilation gradually increased until they are finally hardened off
and planted out. If carefully lifted, and placed in trays or baskets,
with a rhubarb leaf over them, they may be taken any distance, and
planted without flagging; with this advantage-A--that the plants being
in good colour, the beds are effective at once. April is early enough
to commence striking them, and these will be fit to plant out by the
middle of June. The several species quoted in various dictionaries
hitherto are unknown in English gardens.

    =A. amabilis= (lovely).* _l._ elliptic, acuminate, greenish in
    some stages, with the principal ribs stained with red, but under
    free growth becoming almost entirely suffused with rose colour,
    mixed with orange, the midribs continuing to be of a deep red hue.
    Brazil, 1868.

    =A. a. amA"na= (charming).* _l._ small, spathulate, orange red and
    purple in colour, which is shaded with deep green and bronze.

    =A. versicolor= (various-colour).* _l._ medium sized, ovate, bright
    rosy pink and crimson, shaded with bronzy green, branching freely,
    and making a compact and handsome plant. Brazil, 1865.

=ALTERNATE.= Placed on opposite sides of an axis on a different line,
as in alternate leaves.

=ALTHA†A= (from _altheo_, to cure; in reference to the medicinal
qualities of some of the species). Marsh Mallow. ORD. _MalvaceA|_. Hardy
biennials or perennials, closely allied to _Malva_. Outer calyx six
to nine-cleft, inner one five-cleft. Most species belonging to this
genus are worthy of cultivation, particularly in woods, coppices, and
shrubberies; they will thrive in almost any kind of soil. They may be
either increased by dividing the plants at the roots, or by seeds; the
biennial species must be raised from seed every year, which may be
sown in spring where they are intended to remain, or in pans placed in
a cold frame, from which the young plants may be removed when large
enough.

    =A. cannabina= (Hemp-leaved).* _fl._ rose-coloured; peduncles
    axillary, many-flowered, loose, longer than the leaves. June. _l._

    =A. narbonensis= (Narbonne).* _fl._ pale red; peduncles
    many-flowered, loose, longer than the leaves. August. _l._
    pubescent, lower ones five or seven-lobed, upper ones three-lobed.

[Illustration: FIG. 69. FLOWER AND BUDS OF ALTHA†A OFFICINALIS.]

    =A. officinalis= (officinal). Common Marsh Mallow. _fl._ of a
    delicate, uniform blush colour; peduncles axillary, many-flowered,
    much shorter than the leaves. July. _l._ clothed with soft, white
    tomentum on both surfaces, cordate or ovate, toothed, undivided, or
    somewhat five-lobed. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. Marshes, Britain. Perennial.

    =Hollyhock=.

    =A. striata= (streaked). _fl._ white, 2-1/2in. in diameter,
    solitary, on short pedicels; calyx striped. July. _l._ cordate,
    bluntly three-lobed, crenated. Stem puberulous, and somewhat
    scabrous. _h._ 5ft. Biennial.

=ALUMINOUS.= Pertaining to, or containing alum, or alumina; as
Aluminous soils.

=ALUM-ROOT.= _See_ =Heuchera=.

=ALYSSUM= (from _a_, not, and _lyssa_, rage; in reference to a fable
that the plant allayed anger). Madwort. Including _Psilonema_,
_Ptilotrichum_, _Schivereckia_. ORD. _CruciferA|_. Annuals or dwarf,
branching, shrubby perennials, often clothed with hoary, stellate
hairs. Flowers small, cruciform, white or yellow. Leaves distant, or
the radical ones tufted, usually entire. Several of the species are
very much alike. They are excellent plants for the rockery, or for the
front of borders, growing freely in common but well-drained garden
soil. They may be increased by cuttings, by division of the roots, or
by seed. The cuttings should be made from young shoots, 2in. to 3in. in
length, inserted in sandy loam, early in the season, in a shady place.
Seed may be raised outside, or in a frame in pans in sandy soil, most
of them germinating in two or three weeks.

    =A. alpestre= (alpine).* _fl._ yellow; raceme simple. June. _l._
    obovate, hoary. Stem rather shrubby at the base, diffuse, greyish.
    _h._ 3in. South Europe, 1777. Perennial. A very neat little tufted
    species. _A. argenteum_ (silvery), _A. Bertolonii_ (Bertoloni's),
    and _A. murale_ (wall), are larger growing species allied to the
    above, but of less cultural merit.

[Illustration: FIG. 70. ALYSSUM SAXATILE.]

    =A. a. obtusifolium= (obtuse-leaved). _fl._ yellow, corymbose.
    June. _l._ obovate-spathulate, blunt, silvery on the under surface.

    _l._ lanceolate, hoary, and pilose. Stems shrubby at the base,
    erect. _h._ 6in. to 1ft. S. Europe, 1820. _A. Marschallianum_ is
    intermediate between _A. alpestre_ and _A. a. obtusifolium_; but is
    seldom met with under cultivation.

    =A. gemonense= (German).* _fl._ yellow, in close corymbs. April to
    June. _l._ lanceolate, entire, greyish-velvety from stellate down.
    Stem shrubby at the base. _h._ 1ft. Italy, 1710. Closely allied to
    _A. saxatile_, but not so hardy; it is very desirable for rockeries.

    =A. macrocarpum= (large-fruited). _fl._ white, racemose. June. _l._
    oblong, blunt, silvery. Stem shrubby, branched, somewhat spiny.
    _h._ 8in. South of France, 1828. _A. spinosa_ (thorny), and _A.
    halimifolia_ (purslane-leaved), are very like this species. _A.
    dasycarpum_ (thick-fruited) is an annual with yellow flowers.

    =A. maritimum.= _See_ =KA"niga=.

    =A. montanum= (mountain). _fl._ yellow, sweet-scented; raceme
    simple. May to July. _l._ somewhat hoary; lower ones obovate;
    upper ones oblong. Stems rather herbaceous, diffuse, pubescent.
    _h._ 2in. or 3in. Europe, 1713. A distinct and charming species
    for the rockery, forming compact tufts of slightly glaucous green.
    _A. cuneifolium_ (wedge-leaved), _A. diffusum_ (diffuse), and _A.
    Wulfenianum_ (Wulfenius') come close to this species, the latter
    being the most desirable.

    =A. olympicum= (Olympian). _fl._ deep yellow, small, in roundish
    corymbose heads. Summer. _l._ spathulate, sessile, very small,
    greyish. _h._ 2in. to 3in. Northern Greece.

    lanceolate, repandly-toothed, waved, downy. Stems suffruticose at
    the base. _h._ 1ft. Crete, 1820. There is a variety with variegated
    leaves.

    =A. saxatile= (rock).* _fl._ yellow, in close corymbose heads.
    April. _l._ lanceolate, entire, clothed with hoary tomentum. Stems
    shrubby at the base. _h._ 1ft. Eastern Europe, 1710. A very common
    and showy spring plant. See Fig. 70.

[Illustration: FIG. 72. FLOWER SPIKE OF AMARANTHUS CAUDATUS.]

    =A. s. variegatum= (variegated).* A constant and prettily
    variegated form, which is even more handsome than the type. On
    the rockery it does well, as it requires a sunny, well drained,
    position. See Fig. 71.

    =A. serpyllifolium= (Thyme-leaved).* _fl._ pale yellow, in simple
    racemes. April to June. _l._ very small, 1/4in. to 1/2in. long,
    ovate, scabrous, hoary. _h._ 3in. to 4in. Branches spreading,
    sub-woody at the base. South Europe, 1822.

    =A. tortuosum= (twisted). _fl._ yellow; raceme corymbose. June.
    _l._ hoary, somewhat lanceolate. Stem shrubby at the base, twisted,
    diffuse. _h._ 6in. Hungary, 1804.

    =A. Wiersbeckii= (Wiersbeck's).* _fl._ deep yellow, in close
    corymbose heads, about 1-1/2in. across. Summer. _l._ 2in. long,
    oval-oblong-pointed, sessile, attenuated at the base, roughish and
    hairy. Stems erect, scabrous, simple, rigid. _h._ 1-1/2ft. Asia
    Minor.

=AMARANTHACEA†.= An extensive order of herbs or (rarely) shrubs, with
opposite or alternate leaves, and inconspicuous apetalous flowers,
which are spicately or capitately disposed. The majority of this order
are weeds; well-known exceptions being many species of _Amaranthus_.

=AMARANTH, GLOBE.= _See_ =Gomphrena=.

[Illustration: FIG. 73. FLOWER SPIKE OF AMARANTHUS HYPOCHONDRIACUS.]

=AMARANTHUS= (from _a_, not, and _maraino_, to wither; in reference
to the length of time some of the flowers retain their colour). ORD.
_AmaranthaceA|_. Hardy or half-hardy annuals, with alternate entire
leaves and small green or red flowers in large bracteate clustered
spikes. Flowers polygamous, furnished with three bracts at the base
of a three or five-lobed glabrous perianth. Stamens four or five. Of
very easy culture; they thrive best in rich loamy soil, and are largely
employed for sub-tropical and other bedding, for vases and conservatory
decorations, being very ornamental. The seed should be sown in April in
a hotbed, and the plants thinned out in the same situation when about
1/2in. high. About the end of May, they can be transplanted out of
doors in their permanent situations. They are also very handsome when
grown in pots. The young plants should be potted off early, and freely
encouraged, allowing plenty of pot-room and moisture, and be kept near
the glass, to bring out their brightest colouring. To develop their
full beauty, plenty of room is required. There are about twelve species
(indigenous to warm and tropical countries).

    =A. bicolor= (two-coloured). _l._ green, variously streaked with
    light yellow. _h._ 2ft. India, 1802. This species is rather
    delicate, and must have a warm sunny situation.

    =A. b. ruber= (red).* _l._ brilliant glistening scarlet, merging
    into a dark violet red, mixed with green. Hardier than the type.

    =A. caudatus= (caudate).* Love Lies Bleeding. _fl._ dark
    purplish, collected in numerous whorls, which are disposed in
    handsome drooping spikes. August. _h._ 2ft. to 3ft. India, 1596.
    A very common and vigorous growing hardy annual. There is a
    yellowish-flowered variety, which, though less ornamental, is an
    effective contrast. See Fig. 72.

    =A. cruentus= (dark bloody). Synonymous with _A. hypochondriacus_.

    =A. Henderi= (Hender's). _l._ lanceolate, undulated, intense rosy
    carmine, varying with orange buff, golden yellow, and olive green.
    _h._ 3ft. A garden hybrid, closely allied to _A. salicifolius_.
    Pyramidal habit.

    =A. hypochondriacus= (hypochondriac).* Prince's Feather. _fl._
    deep crimson, on densely packed, erect spikes. July. _l._ purplish
    beneath. _h._ 4ft. to 5ft. Asiatic, 1684. SYN. _A. cruentus_. See
    Fig. 73.

    =A. h. atropurpureus= (dark purple).* An improved variety of above.

    =A. melancholicus ruber= (melancholy-red).* _h._ about 1ft. Japan.
    A compact growing variety, with large shaded crimson leaves.
    Largely used for bedding purposes.

    =A. salicifolius= (willow-leaved).* _l._ 7in. to 15in. long,
    willow-shaped, linear, and wavy, which, by their drooping outline,
    present a very elegant and effective appearance. When fully grown,
    the leaves are brilliantly banded and tipped with orange, carmine,
    and bronze. _h._ 3ft. Philippine Isles, 1871.

    =A. s. Princess of Wales.=* _l._ carmine, orange green, and bright
    yellow, beautifully blended. _h._ 3ft. A garden hybrid.

    =A. sanguineus= (bloody). _fl._ purple, disposed partly in small
    heads in the axils of the upper leaves, and partly in slender,
    flexible spikes, which form a more or less branching panicle. July.
    _l._ blood red. _h._ 3ft. Bahama, 1775.

[Illustration: FIG. 74. AMARANTHUS TRICOLOR.]

    =A. speciosus= (showy).* _fl._ dark crimson purple, disposed in
    large erect spikes, forming a fine plumy panicle. July. _l._
    suffused with a reddish tinge, which disappears at the time of
    flowering. _h._ 3ft. to 5ft. Nepaul, 1819.

    =A. s. aureus= (golden). _fl._ of a fine brownish-golden hue. Very
    effective when grown in masses.

    =A. tricolor= (three-coloured).* _l._ of a fine, transparent,
    purplish-red or dark carmine from the base to the middle; a large
    spot of bright yellow occupies the greater part of the upper end of
    the leaf; point generally green; leafstalks yellow. _h._ 1-1/2ft.
    East Indies, 1548. See Fig. 74. There are several garden varieties
    of this species, requiring a somewhat warmer situation.

=AMARYLLIDEA†.= A large and important order of usually bulbous plants,
sometimes with a stem. Flowers solitary, umbellate, or paniculate;
perianth superior, six-lobed, often with a corona at the top of
the tube. Leaves ensiform or linear. This order contains many
very beautiful genera, including _Agave_, _Amaryllis_, _Crinum_,
_HA|manthus_, _Hippeastrum_, _Narcissus_, _Pancratium_, and several
others.

=AMARYLLIS= (from _Amaryllis_, the name of a country-woman mentioned
by Theocritus and Virgil). ORD. _AmaryllideA|_. Half-hardy or hardy,
deciduous, bulbous plants. Flowers large, sweet-scented, pedicelled;
spathe two-leaved; umbels few-flowered; perianth with a very short
tube, funnel-shaped, six-parted, sub-regular or irregular; segments
many-nerved, broad, undulate, spreading somewhat at the apices;
stamens at the summit of the tube, unequal, declined; anthers fixed
by the middle, incumbent, curved into a circular arch after bursting;
style declined; stigma thickened, sub-three-lobed; scape tall, solid,
compressed. Capsule obovate; seeds globose, fleshy. Leaves appearing
at a different season from the scapes, numerous, strap-shaped. The
following genera are sometimes arranged hereunder, but in this work are
treated separately: _Brunsvigia_, _Crinum_, _Hippeastrum_, _Nerine_,
_Sprekelia_, _Sternbergia_, _Vallota_, _Zephyranthes_. Warm, dry, and
well-drained positions in front of hothouses, or at the base of south
or south-west walls, are the most suitable sites for _A. Belladonna_
and its varieties. The soil should be composed of good, fibrous loam,
leaf mould, and sand, in equal parts. Insert the bulbs 6in. to 8in.
deep, and surround with sand, after which they may be covered with
the compost, which should be pressed firmly about them; they should
not be again disturbed for years, when they will ultimately establish
themselves, and produce grand masses of blossom. The best time to
plant a fresh stock is June or July, when they commence root-action,
before the flower-stems are sent up. In their growing season, and in
dry weather, an occasional soaking of clear water, or liquid manure,
will be greatly beneficial. The extremely ornamental plants now
largely grown, and frequently classed as _Amaryllis_ in nurserymen's
catalogues, belong to the genus _Hippeastrum_. For pot-culture of the
Belladonna Lily, _see_ =Hippeastrum=.

[Illustration: FIG. 75. AMARYLLIS BELLADONNA, showing Habit at
Flowering Season.]

    =A. Belladonna.=* Belladonna Lily. This splendid species is very
    variable, both in the size and colour of the flowers, frequently
    producing variously-shaded flowers, from almost white to a reddish
    or purplish hue. Autumn. West Indies, 1712. See Fig. 75. The leaves
    and flowers are not produced together. In Fig. 76 they are both
    shown in the same illustration for economy of space.

    =A. B. pallida= (pale).* A pale-coloured variety. _h._ 2ft.

=AMASONIA= (named in honour of Thomas Amason, one of the earlier
American travellers). SYN. _Taligalea_. ORD. _VerbenaceA|_. A
genus comprising six species (which may be reduced to four) of
stove sub-shrubs, natives of tropical America. Flowers yellow or
sulphur-coloured, racemose or panicled; calyx five-cleft; corolla
five-cleft, sub-bilabiate. Leaves alternate, toothed or rarely entire.
For culture of the only species introduced, _see_ =Clerodendron=.

    =A. punicea= (reddish-brown). _fl._ yellow, with pretty, brownish
    bracts; peduncles once or twice trifid, cymose or one-flowered.

    elliptic-lanceolate, shortly acuminate, unequally toothed. Stem
    erect, simple or slightly branched. _h._ 2ft. to 3ft. Brazil, 1884.

=AMATEUR.= This term is usually meant to refer to one who has a taste
for a particular pursuit, and who is, in a pecuniary point of view,
independent of it. An Amateur gardener is one who rears and grows his
plants, and cultivates his garden, for his own amusement--for mere love
of horticulture.

Spike.]

=AMBER, SWEET.= _See_ =Hypericum AndrosA|mum=.

=AMBER-TREE.= _See_ =Anthospermum=.

=AMBROSINIA= (commemorative of Professor Giacinti Ambrosini, of
Bologna). ORD. _AroideA|_ (_AraceA|_). A curious, half-hardy, tuberous
perennial, thriving in any light soil, with protection in winter.
Increased by seeds, and by divisions. The former should be sown, as
soon as ripe, in a cool house; and the latter should be made just
previous to new growth in spring.

    =A. Bassii= (Bass's).* _fl._, spathes prolonged into a long tail,
    and a tongue-shaped spadix, with the male flowers on one side, and
    so placed as to preclude the access of pollen to the stigma on
    the other side of the spathe, save by insect agency. _l._ oblong,
    stalked. _h._ 4in. Corsica, Sardinia, 1879.

=AMBURY=, or =ANBURY=. The name given to galls of small Weevils
(_Ceuthorhynchus sulcicollis_) which appear on the roots of
Cabbages and Turnips, as well as of the Wild Mustard, and of other
weeds belonging to the genus _Brassica_. The galls form swellings
individually about the size of split peas, but often two or more are
joined to form considerable masses. In each is a space inclosing a
white grub. Anbury is usually not very hurtful. It is quite distinct
from Clubbing. The galled roots should be collected, before the grubs
emerge, and burned.

=AMELANCHIER= (Savoy name of the Medlar, to which this genus is closely
allied). TRIBE _PomaceA|_ of ORD. _RosaceA|_. Hardy, deciduous shrubs
or small trees, with racemes of white flowers, and simple, serrated
leaves; bracteas linear-lanceolate. Pome, when mature, three to
five-celled. They are of easy cultivation, in a somewhat rich, loamy
soil, and are propagated by layers or cuttings, in autumn, in sheltered
situations; by seeds, and by grafting, in early spring, on the Hawthorn
or the Quince, or the weaker on the stronger-growing species.

    =A. canadensis= (Canadian).* Grape Pear. _fl._ white. April. Pome
    purple. _l._ oblong-elliptic, cuspidate, when young rather villous,
    but at length glabrous. _h._ 6ft. to 8ft. Canada, 1746. A very
    ornamental tree, having a profusion of flowers in early spring, and
    rich autumnal foliage. SYN. _Pyrus Botryapium_.

    =A. c. florida= (flowery).* _fl._ white, numerous, in upright
    racemes. May. Pome purple. _l._ oblong, obtuse at both ends,
    coarsely serrate in the terminal portion, glabrous in every state.
    _h._ 10ft. to 20ft. North America, 1826.

    =A. c. ovalis= (oval-leaved). _fl._ white; racemes pressed
    together. April. _l._ roundish-elliptic, acute when rather young,
    velvety beneath, glabrous when mature. _h._ 6ft. to 8ft. North
    America, 1800.

    =A. c. parvifolia= (small-leaved). This has a dwarfer habit, and
    shorter leaves, than the type.

    =A. sanguinea=, (bloody). _fl._ white; racemes capitate. April.
    Pome blackish-purple. _l._ oblong, rounded at both ends, sharply
    serrated, always naked. _h._ 4ft. to 8ft. North America, 1800. This
    form differs principally from _A. canadensis_ in the fewer flowers,
    much shorter raceme, and shorter, broader, and more ovate petals.

    =A. vulgaris= (common).* _fl._ white. April. Pome darkish-purple.
    _l._ roundish-oval, bluntish, pubescent beneath, at length
    glabrous. _h._ 3ft. to 9ft. Europe, 1596. A desirable shrub,
    producing an abundance of flowers. SYN. _Mespilus Amelanchier_.

=AMELLUS= (a name employed by Virgil for a blue, Aster-looking plant
growing on the banks of the river Mella). ORD. _CompositA|_. Pretty,
branched, ascending or diffuse, perennial herbs. Flowers in solitary
heads. Leaves hairy, lower ones opposite, upper alternate. Of very easy
culture, in ordinary garden soil. Increased by divisions, or cuttings,
inserted under glass, in spring.

    =A. Lychnitis= (Lychnitis). _fl.-heads_ violet, solitary, terminal,
    and lateral. June. _l._ linear, lanceolate, entire, hoary. _h._
    6in. Cape of Good Hope. Evergreen, greenhouse trailer.

=AMENTUM.= A catkin. A deciduous spike of unisexual, apetalous flowers.

=AMERICAN ALMOND.= _See_ =Brabejum=.

=AMERICAN ALOE.= _See_ =Agave americana=.

=AMERICAN BLIGHT=, or =WOOLLY APHIS= (_Schizoneura lanuginosa_). The
white, cottony-looking matter which is found upon the bark of the Apple
and other trees of a similar nature, belongs to a species of Aphis,
which has short legs: the females are wingless, while the males are
winged; the latter appear in July and August. The insects belong to
a group of Aphides unprovided with honey tubes on the hinder part of
the body, and in which the third vein of the front wing shows only one
fork The woolly coating also distinguishes them from true Aphides. The
Blight is said to have been imported from America in 1787, but this is
uncertain.

As these insects get into the cracks and under the bark of trees, they
are hard to dislodge. The injury inflicted is not apparent for some
time; but, in process of time, large, cankerous wounds are produced,
which gradually (with the aid of the insects) destroy the branches, and
render the tree useless. If young trees are attacked, they are rendered
valueless in a very short time. The insects hide in crevices of the
bark of the trees each autumn, and remain dormant during the winter,
ascending to their old quarters as the weather becomes warm. Trees
which are covered with moss and lichens probably serve as places for
hybernation; hence, it is desirable to remove such hiding-places, as
well as all pieces of dead bark. To their being left may be frequently
attributed the severe attacks of Blight experienced where they exist
on trees. So soon as the cottony substance makes its appearance, one
of the following remedies should be applied, and, if persisted in for
a few seasons, the trees will be quite cleared.

_Brushing and Scraping._ In winter, the trees should be thoroughly
cleaned; and, so long as there is a chance of the insects being in the
bark, all loose pieces, moss, &c., should be brushed off, and the parts
affected should be thoroughly saturated with a strong solution of soft
soap or of soft soap and lime-water, applied with a stiff brush, so as
to enter all the crevices.

_Gas Liquor._ This is the ammoniacal liquor from gas works. It must be
diluted with from eight to twelve times its bulk of water, or it is
dangerous to the trees; in fact, after dilution, it is advisable to
test it, previous to using to any great extent. As the woolly covering
of the insects resists water, it is desirable that the liquor be
applied with a brush, and forced amongst the Blight.

_Infusion of Tobacco Leaves_ (1/2lb. to 1 gallon) kills the insects on
shoots dipped into it.

_Paraffin or Petroleum._ This is a simple and useful remedy. Obtain a
painter's half-worn sash-tool, free from paint, and just moisten it
in the oil. Then brush out each infested place as often as the Blight
appears, and in one season the trees will be cleared.

_Spent Tan._ Collect spent tan into a heap a month or two before it is
to be used, and if it has heated well and rotted, so much the better.
In winter, clear away all leaves, rubbish, grass, &c., and spread the
tan at the rate of about thirty loads to the acre, taking care that it
surrounds the base of each tree infested with Blight. Practical proof
of its utility has been given.

_Turpentine and other Spirits._ The mode of applying these is the same
as for paraffin, but they frequently injure the bark, and sometimes
kill young trees.

To kill insects on the roots, it is well to clear away the soil as
far as possible from them, and to saturate the place with soapsuds or
ammoniacal solutions; soot, quicklime, or other applications to the
soil would also prove useful.

Other remedies that have been suggested are the drainings of stables,
and grafting-clay plastered over the bark.

    short hairs. _h._ 6ft. to 10ft. Trinidad, 1817.

=AMERIMNUM.= A synonym of =Amerimnon= (which _see_).

=AMHERSTIA= (commemorative of Countess Amherst, a zealous promoter of
natural history, particularly botany). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A stove,
evergreen tree of almost unsurpassed magnificence and brilliancy,
requiring a very high and moist temperature. It delights in a rich,
strong loam, and may be propagated by cuttings of the half-ripened
wood, inserted in sand, under a glass in bottom heat of about 80deg.;
also by seeds.

    =A. nobilis= (noble).* _fl._ of a fine vermilion colour,
    diversified with yellow spots, large; racemes long, pendulous,
    axillary. May. _l._ large, impari-pinnate, bearing six to eight
    pairs of leaflets. _h._ 30ft. to 40ft. India, 1837. The flowers
    are, unfortunately, somewhat ephemeral, lasting but a few days in
    perfection, during which period, however, no object in the whole
    range of the vegetable kingdom presents a more striking aspect than
    this tree.

=AMICIA= (commemorative of J. B. Amici, a celebrated French physician).
ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A pretty, greenhouse or half-hardy perennial,
succeeding in any warm, sheltered spot. Young cuttings will root in
sand, under a hand glass, in heat.

    =A. Zygomeris= (two-jointed-podded).* _fl._ yellow, splashed with
    purple on the keel; peduncles axillary, five or six-flowered.
    Autumn. Legumes with two joints. _l._ abruptly pinnate, with two
    pairs of cuneate-obcordate, mucronate leaflets, which are full of
    pellucid dots; branches and petioles pubescent. _h._ 8ft. Mexico,
    1826.

=AMMOBIUM= (from _ammos_, sand, and _bio_, to live; in reference to the
sandy soil in which it is found). ORD. _CompositA|_. This well-known
everlasting is closely allied to _Gnaphalium_, from which it differs
principally in habit. Receptacle with oblong, pointed, toothed, chaffy
scales; involucre of imbricated leaflets. It may be treated as a
half-hardy annual, or as a biennial, if seeds are sown in September and
kept in a cool greenhouse during the winter, and this is the best way
to grow it. Any moderately good soil suits it.

    =A. alatum= (winged). _fl.-heads_ about 1in. across, of a silvery
    whiteness, with the exception of the yellow disk florets, very
    numerous, in loose, corymbose panicles. May to September. _l._
    oblong-lanceolate; radical ones in a tufted rosette. Stems
    winged--hence the specific name. _h._ 1-1/2ft. to 2ft. New Holland,
    1822. See Fig. 77.

    =A. a. grandiflorum= (large-flowered).* _fl.-heads_ purer white,
    nearly twice the size of those in the type. This variety, which
    comes true from seed, is a great acquisition.

=AMMOCHARIS.= _See_ =Brunsvigia=.

    June. _l._ bifoliolate; leaflets lanceolate, silky-white on both
    surfaces. _h._ 2ft. to 4ft. Siberia, 1837.

=AMMYRSINE.= _See_ =Leiophyllum=.

=AMOMOPHYLLUM.= _See_ =Spathiphyllum=.

[Illustration: FIG. 77. INFLORESCENCE OF AMMOBIUM ALATUM.]

=AMOMUM= (from _a_, not, and _momos_, impurity; in reference to
the quality of counteracting poison). ORD. _ZingiberaceA|_. Stove,
deciduous, herbaceous perennials, chiefly aromatic, formerly used in
embalming. Flowers produced close to the ground, in spikes or clusters,
bracteate. Leaves distichous, sheathing at the base, lanceolate,
entire. For culture, _see_ =Alpinia=.

    =A. angustifolium= (narrow-leaved).* _fl._ sometimes of a uniform
    chrome-yellow, sometimes crimson, with the labellum of a yellow
    colour, more or less pale, and sometimes entirely crimson; scape
    naked, from 3in. to 8in. in length; spike capitate. July. _l._
    linear-lanceolate. _h._ 8ft. Madagascar.

    =A. Cardamomum= (Cardamom).* _fl._ brownish; lip three-lobed,

    9in. long. _h._ 2-1/2ft. Western Africa.

    =A. grandiflorum= (large-flowered). _fl._ white, numerous, close;
    spike short. June. _l._ elliptic-lanceolate, pointed. _h._ 3ft.

    sub-erect; the most conspicuous portion is the lip, which is
    2-1/2in. in diameter; flower-scapes 6in. high. January. _l._
    narrow, oblong-lanceolate. _h._ 5ft. to 6ft. Old Calabar, 1863.

    =A. vitellinum= (yolk-of-egg-coloured). _fl._ yellow; lip oblong,
    obtuse, toothed; spike oblong, sessile, rather loose. April. _l._
    oval. _h._ 2ft. East Indies, 1846. Plant stemless, glabrous.

=AMORPHA= (from _a_, not, and _morphe_, form; incomplete formation
of the flowers). Bastard Indigo. ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A handsome genus
of hardy deciduous shrubs with very graceful impari-pinnate leaves,
and many pairs of leaflets, which are full of pellucid dots. Racemes
spicate, elongated, usually in fascicles at the tops of the branches;
corolla without wings and keel; vexillum or standard ovate, concave.
They are well adapted for small shrubberies, requiring a sheltered
situation, and thrive well in common garden soil. Increased by layers,
or cuttings, taken off at a joint, and planted in a sheltered situation
early in autumn; these should be allowed to remain undisturbed till the
following autumn. Amorphas produce an abundance of suckers, from which
they may be readily propagated.

    =A. canescens= (hoary).* The Lead Plant. _fl._ dark blue. July.
    _l._, leaflets ovate-elliptic, mucronate. _h._ 3ft. Missouri, 1812.
    Whole plant clothed with hoary hairs.

    =A. fruticosa= (shrubby).* The False Indigo. _fl._ very dark bluish
    purple. June. _l._, leaflets elliptic-oblong; lower ones distant
    from the stem. _h._ 6ft. Carolina, 1724. Shrub glabrous, or a
    little villous. There are several varieties, having mucronate,
    emarginate, or narrower leaflets, but all with purple flowers. A
    host of names, representing the merest forms of _A. fruticosa_,
    are to be found in nurserymen's catalogues. Amongst them are:
    _caroliniana_, _crocea_, _crocea-lanata_, _dealbata_, _fragrans_,
    _glabra_, _herbacea_, _nana_, _pubescens_, &c. These differ so
    slightly from the type and from each other, that it is impossible
    to distinguish them.

=AMORPHOPHALLUS= (from _amorphos_, deformed, and _phallos_, a
mace; alluding to the inflorescence). SYN. _Pythion_. Including
_Proteinophallus_. ORD. _AroideA| (AraceA|)_. A very remarkable genus,
closely allied to _Arum_, but distinguished therefrom by "their
spreading, not convolute, spathes; by their anthers opening by pores,
not by longitudinal slits; by the numerous cells to the ovary; and by
the solitary, erect ovules, those of _Arum_ being horizontal." A soil
consisting of two-thirds good rich loam, with the additional third of
sweet manure, thoroughly rotted, suits them well. Other essentials are
plenty of pot room, a genial atmosphere, and a temperature ranging from
55deg. to 65deg., or even 70deg. They require to be kept dry, and warm
in winter, as nothing is more fatal to them than cold or damp. Beneath
a shelf or stage in the stove is an excellent spot for them, or they
may be stored in sand, and kept free from frost. They are difficult to
increase; the corms of most of them are of great size, and rarely make
offsets. Efforts should consequently be made to induce the plants to
seed whenever practicable. All the species are strikingly effective in
sub-tropical bedding. For fertilising and growth of seedlings, _see_
=Arum=.

    =A. campanulatus= (bell-shaped).* Similar to _A. Rivieri_, but the
    flowers are brown, red, and black, and the scape is neither so
    stout nor so tall. _h._ 2ft. India, 1817. SYN. _Arum campanulatum_.

    =A. grandis= (large). _fl._, spathe green, white inside; spadix
    purplish. _h._ 3ft. Java, 1865. Stove species.

    =A. Lacourii= (Lacour's).* _l._ pedatisect, the ultimate segments
    lanceolate, yellow-spotted; petioles transversely mottled with
    yellow markings. Cochin China, 1879. Greenhouse. The correct name
    of this species is _Pseudodracontium Lacourii_.

    =A. nivosus.= _See_ =Dracontium asperum=.

    =A. Rivieri= (Rivier's).* _fl._, spadix, spathe, and scape,
    reaching 3ft. or more in height, appearing before the leaves; scape
    stout and strong, of a deep green colour, speckled or dotted with
    rose; spadix projecting, deep red; spathe of a rosy-green colour.
    March to May. _l._ solitary, decompound, 40in. to 50in. across,
    on tall marbled petioles. Cochin China. Perhaps the most useful
    species. SYN. _Proteinophallus Rivieri_. See Fig. 78.

[Illustration: FIG. 78. AMORPHOPHALLUS RIVIERI, Foliage and
Inflorescence.]

    =A. Titanum= (Titan's).* _fl._, spadix 5ft. high, black purple;
    spathe nearly 3ft. in diameter, campanulate in shape, with patent
    and deeply toothed edges. The deeper portion of the interior is
    pale greenish, but the limb is of a bright black purple hue; the
    outside is pale green, smooth in the lower portion, but thickly
    corrugated and crisp above; scape about 1-1/2ft. long, green,
    marked with small whitish orbicular spots. _l._ the divided blade
    covers an area of 45ft. in circumference. West Sumatra, 1878.
    As will be seen from the above, this extraordinary plant is of
    gigantic proportions, and, in size of the flowers, eclipsing nearly
    all others in the vegetable kingdom. SYN. _Conophallus Titanum_.

=AMORPHOUS.= Without definite form.

=AMPELOPSIS= (from _ampelos_, a vine, and _opsis_, resemblance;
resembling the Grape Vine in habit, and to which it is closely allied).
SYN. _Quinaria_. ORD. _AmpelideA|_. A genus nearly allied to _Vitis_.
Calyx slightly five toothed; petals concave, thick, expanding before
they fall; disk none. Fast growing and ornamental climbing, hardy
deciduous shrubs, of very easy culture in common garden soil. Cuttings,
having a good eye, may be taken in September, and pricked either under
handlights in sandy soil on the open border, or in pots stood on the
stage or shelf in a greenhouse; they root readily, and will be fit for
transplanting early in the spring. Or cuttings made from the young
soft wood, expressly grown for the purpose, in spring, root freely in
gentle heat. This applies especially to _A. tricuspidata_. They are
also easily increased by layers. Most of the species will thrive with
equal vigour in almost any position, however exposed.

    =A. aconitifolia= (Aconite-leaved).* _l._ palmisect, with
    pinnatifid segments. China, 1868. A slender and very elegant
    free-growing species, with long reddish branches. There are two or
    more varieties. SYNS. _A. lucida_, _A. triloba_, _A. tripartita_,
    and _Vitis dissecta_. See Fig. 79.

    =A. bipinnata= (bipinnate). _fl._ green, small; raceme stalked,
    twice bifid. Berries globose. June. _l._ bipinnate, smooth;
    leaflets deeply lobed. _h._ 10ft. Virginia, 1700.

    =A. hederacea= (Ivy-leaved). Synonymous with _A. quinquefolia_.

    =A. japonica= (Japanese). Synonymous with _A. tricuspidata_.

    =A. lucida= (shining). Synonymous with _A. aconitifolia_.

    =A. napiformis= (turnip-like).* Greenish. China, 1870. See Fig. 80.

    =A. quinquefolia= (five-leaved).* Virginian Creeper. _fl._
    greenish-purple; raceme corymbose. June. _l._ palmate, with three
    and five leaflets, smooth on both surfaces; leaflets stalked,
    oblong-acuminated, mucronately toothed; autumnal tint red. North
    America, 1629. SYN. _A. hederacea_.

    =A. q. hirsuta= (hairy). _l._ downy on both surfaces.

    =A. serjaniA|folia= (Serjania-leaved).* _l._ green, palmately
    five-parted, or the upper ones three-parted, the intermediate

=AMPHICARPA†A= (from _amphi_, both, and _karpos_, a fruit; in
allusion to the two kinds of pods--those of the upper flowers being
scimitar-shaped, three or four-seeded; those of the lower, pear-shaped,
fleshy, usually ripening but one seed; these lower pods bury themselves
in the ground after fertilisation). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A genus of

in reference to the seeds being furnished with a tuft of hairs at
both ends). ORD. _BignoniaceA|_. Flowers axillary or terminal. Leaves
alternate, unequally pinnate. Very ornamental greenhouse or half-hardy
rock herbaceous plants. If planted outside, they must be protected
during the winter from wet and severe frosts. A mixture of loam, sand,

corolla much curled). SYN. _Amphilobium_. ORD. _BignoniaceA|_. A
handsome stove evergreen climber. Corolla somewhat coriaceous, with a
short tube, and a large ventricose throat. Loam and peat, well mixed,
suits it best; cuttings from young shoots root readily in sand, under
a hand glass, with bottom heat, during the spring months.

America). ORD. _ApocynaceA|_. Very pretty hardy, herbaceous perennials,
with alternate leaves, and terminal panicles of pale blue flowers;
corolla with linear lobes, and a narrow funnel-shaped tube. They thrive
in half shady positions in borders, or the edges of shrubberies,
where they will not need to be frequently transplanted. Propagated by
cuttings during the summer months, or by divisions of the roots in
spring.

    =A. latifolia= (broad-leaved). Synonymous with _A. TabernA|montana_.

    SYNS. _A. latifolia_, _TabernA|montana Amsonia_.

=AMYGDALUS= (from _amysso_, to lacerate; fissured channels in the stone
of the fruit). Almond. ORD. _RosaceA|_. TRIBE _DrupaceA|_. Well known,
ornamental, deciduous spring flowering shrubs. Drupe clothed with
velvety pubescence, with a fibrous dry rind, separating irregularly,
having the stone of the fruit pitted or smooth. The larger-growing
species are very excellent for shrubberies, or as specimen trees;
being in blossom before most other trees, they make a fine appearance
in early spring. The dwarfer kinds are also well fitted for small
shrubberies or the fronts of large ones. For greenhouse culture they
should be obtained in a small pyramidal shape; they are not, however,
suited to a small house, as the plants, to bloom well and be effective,
ought to be at least 2ft. or 3ft. high, and proportionately wide.
Plenty of root room is essential. After potting, water thoroughly, and
place the trees in an orchard house for a few weeks, when they may be
removed to their permanent station. A temperature of about 50deg. or
55deg. is sufficient to hasten the flowering; a higher temperature is
apt to frustrate the object in view. After flowering, gradually harden
off the plants until about the end of May, when they may be plunged out
of doors for the season. Repotting should be done as soon as the leaves
fall. Increased by budding upon seedling plum-stocks in summer. The
Almond is grown on the Continent for its fruit. _See also_ =Prunus=.

meaning doubtful). Pimpernel. ORD. _PrimulaceA|_. Annual or perennial
trailers with angular stems, opposite or verticillate leaves, and
solitary pedunculate flowers; corolla rotate or funnel-shaped, deeply
five-cleft. All are very pretty and free flowering plants, of easy
culture. The annuals are raised from seed sown in a sunny spot in
spring; the perennials are increased by striking cuttings of the young

close frame. Keep in the shade until well established, and gradually
harden off. Plant outside in light rich soil for summer flowering, and
each year secure a stock in frames during the winter. They require, if

    denticulated. June to August. _l._ several, verticillate. _h._ 4in.
    Portugal, 1828.

=ANAGYRIS= (from _ana_, backwards, and _gyros_, a circle; the pods
are curved backwards at their extremities). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. An
ornamental greenhouse or half-hardy shrub, having the two stipules
placed opposite the leaves. It thrives in a mixture of loam, sand, and
peat in equal proportions. Young cuttings should be planted in July in

SYN. _Ananassa_. Pine Apple. ORD. _BromeliaceA|_. Stove herbaceous
perennials, having the berries collected with the bracts into a
compound fruit. Leaves rigid; edges spiny. The variegated form is a
useful plant for decorative purposes, and may be employed without the
usual harmful consequences attending stove plants generally, but it
must not be subjected to cold draughts. The soil should consist of
two parts fibrous loam, one of peat, one of dung and leaf mould, and
another of sand. Those propagated from suckers, which should be laid
by a day or two and then inserted in a strong heat, have, as a rule,
longer and lighter-coloured leaves. Offsets are often produced at the
base of the fruit, and make stout plants, with high-coloured foliage.
When the plants are potted in spring, plunge them in bottom heat, to
hasten their growth; but this is not absolutely necessary. Should it
be desired to fruit the variegated form, the plants may be submitted
to the same process of culture as detailed under =Pine Apple= (which
_see_).

    =A. bracamorensis= (Bracamora). Brazil, 1879.

_ScrophularineA|_. Elegant little half-hardy biennials or perennials
allied to _Antirrhinum_. Flowers small, drooping, in long spike-formed,
twiggy, and interrupted racemes. Radical leaves usually in a rosette;
stem and branch leaves palmate-parted, or toothed at the apex; superior
ones quite entire. They are of easy culture in ordinary garden soil;
seed may be sown outside in spring, or they can be increased by growing
cuttings, but they require protection during severe weather.

    =A. bellidifolium= (Daisy-leaved).* _fl._ white, or pale blue;
    racemes slender, elongated. June. _l._ radical ones spathulate or

    _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Portugal, 1818. SYN. _A. Duriminium_.

[Illustration: FIG. 85. DRY FRUITING PLANT OF ANASTATICA HIEROCHUNTINA.]

=ANASTATICA= (from _anastasis_, resurrection; plant recovering its
original form, however dry it may be, on immersion in water). ORD.
_CruciferA|_. A very curious and interesting little annual, the leaves
of which fall off from the plant after flowering, the branches and
branchlets then become dry, hard, and ligneous, and rise upwards and
bend inwards at their points. This plant has the remarkable property of
resuming vitality on being placed in water, after being kept in a dry
state for many years. Seeds should be sown in heat, in the spring, and
the plants afterwards potted off and plunged again in heat to hasten
their growth, which cannot otherwise be fully developed with our
precarious and sunless summers.

and beautiful stove tuberous-rooted perennial aroid, allied to
_Amorphophallus_, and requiring somewhat similar treatment. As soon as
the leaves die down, the plants should be repotted in rich sandy loam
and leaf mould, with ample drainage. They will need scarce any water or
attention until growth commences the following spring, when they must
have an abundance of water, and a moist atmosphere. Summer temperature,
60deg. to 85deg.; winter, 55deg. to 60deg. Propagated by seeds and
offsets.

    this is divided into three primary divisions, which are again cut
    up into several leaflets, the largest of these being toothed. _h._
    3ft. Fernando Po, 1832. There is a variety with a paler coloured
    spathe. SYN. _Caladium petiolatum_.

stamens are enclosed in a hollow formed by the folding of the limb of
the petals). ORD. _LiliaceA|_. A peculiar greenhouse bulbous plant,
requiring a light sandy soil, dry atmosphere, no shade, and a season
of rest; during the latter period, scarcely any water is required.
Propagated by seeds and offsets.

    =A. punctatum= (dotted). _fl._ whitish, few, in a dense sessile
    umbel, surrounded by about four spreading lanceolate, acuminate
    leaves, which are 5in. to 6in. long, 1/2in. to 3/4in. broad above

=ANDROMEDA= (named after the daughter of Cepheus, who was rescued from
the sea monster by Perseus). ORD. _EricaceA|_. A dwarf, hardy shrub,
found in peaty bogs in the temperate and Arctic regions of the northern
hemisphere. Sow seeds as soon as ripe in pots or pans, very thinly, in
sandy peat soil, and place in a cool frame, giving plenty of air. Place
the young plants out in spring. Layers, pegged carefully down during
September, will generally take twelve months to make sufficient roots
to allow of their being separated, and thus become independent plants.
For other species often included under this genus in catalogues, _see_
=Cassandra=, =Cassiope=, =LeucothoA"=, =Lyonia=, =Oxydendrum=, =Pieris=,
and =Zenobia=.

    =A. polifolia= (Polium-leaved). Wild Rosemary. _fl._ pinky white,
    drooping, sometimes tipped with red; corolla ovate, furnished with
    ovate, rather leafy imbricated bracteas, terminal, umbellate. June.
    _l._ linear-lanceolate, mucronulate, with the margins more or less
    revolute, quite entire, glaucous beneath, with an elevated rib, and
    reticulated veins. _h._ 1ft. The numerous varieties of this very
    beautiful native shrub principally differ in the colouring of the
    flowers.

=ANDROPOGON= (from _aner_, a man, and _pogon_, a beard; tufts of hair
on flowers). ORD. _GramineA|_. A large genus of grasses with polygamous
flowers. The majority of species are of no horticultural value;
several, however, are very ornamental subjects, and thrive well in
a rich, deep soil. Easily propagated by seeds or by division of the
roots. The South European kinds succeed in the open air if planted in
a warm dry border.

    =A. citratum= (Citrus-leaved). Synonymous with _A. SchA"nanthus_.

    =A. SchA"nanthus.= Lemon Grass. _fl._ in threes; spikes imbricate,

_pubescens_, _scoparius_, _squarrosus_, and _strictus_.

=ANDROSACE= (from _aner_, a man, and _sakos_, buckler; in reference
to the resemblance of the anther to an ancient buckler). Including
_Aretia_. ORD. _PrimulaceA|_. Dwarf annuals or perennials, entirely
alpine, agreeing in most characters with _Primula_, but having the
tube of the corolla narrowed at the mouth. An airy, well-drained,
and partially sunny position is essential in their culture. They
thrive well between fissures of rocks or stones with a rich sandy
peat soil. Drought and a sour soil are alike fatal, and both will be
greatly obviated if small pieces of sandstone are mixed with the soil.
The woolly species are best arranged beneath a jutting ledge of the
rockery, which will afford them protection from the hottest sunshine,
and from excessive wet in winter; additional comfort will be provided
from the latter ill if a piece of glass is placed over them during
the autumn and winter months. They can also be well grown, and make
charming little specimens, in pots, with rich sandy soil and thorough
drainage. Sprinkle sand among the small rosettes of leaves. They are
increased by divisions, cuttings, or seed; the latter should be sown as
early as possible, and raised in a frame.

    =A. alpina= (alpine). _fl._ purplish rose; throat and tube yellow,
    solitary; peduncles about 1/2in. long. June. _l._ crowded, small,
    tongue-shaped, in small rosettes. _h._ 2in. to 3in. Switzerland,

    increased. SYNS. _A. Lachenalii_, _A. puberula_.

    =A. c. eximia= (select).* Larger and more robust than the typical
    species, and a more rapid grower. Forms compact tufts of dense
    rosettes, bearing heads of rosy-crimson yellow-eyed flowers, on
    stems 2in. or 3in. high. Auvergne Alps, 1871. It requires moist
    sunny ledges and fissures of rockwork in peat, loam, and sand.

    =A. ChamA|jasme= (rock jasmine).* _fl._ blush, ultimately deep pink,
    with a yellow eye, umbellate. June. _l._ lanceolate, tapering
    to a point towards the base, in comparatively large, not dense,
    rosettes. _h._ about 2in. to 4in. Austria, &c., 1768. A very free
    flowering species, growing freely when established, ultimately
    forming large tufts. It thrives best in a deep, well drained and
    rich loam soil.

    =A. ciliata= (ciliated). _fl._ deep carmine red, on stems double as
    long as the leaves. June. _l._ lanceolate-oblong, smooth on both
    surfaces, with ciliated margins, imbricated. _h._ 2in. to 3in.,
    forming dense cushions. Pyrenees.

    =A. coronopifolia= (buckhorn-leaved).* _fl._ pure white, on slender
    pedicels, umbellate on peduncles, about 6in. high. April to June.
    _l._ lanceolate, distantly serrated, smooth, in flattish rosettes.
    Russia, 1755. This is a charming little biennial, well worthy of a
    place on the rockery. A colony of it is extremely pretty; it seeds
    freely, and a batch of young plants almost invariably takes the
    place of the old ones. SYN. _A. septentrionalis_.

    small yellow eye, umbellate. June to October. _l._ nearly 1in.
    long, clothed with shiny silken hairs. _h._ 6in. to 9in. Himalaya,
    1842. A very beautiful species, with spreading or trailing shoots,
    easily multiplied by cuttings or layers. It requires a warm sunny
    spot on the rockery, with a sandy peat soil. When planted so that
    its shoots drape the face of a rocky ledge, it is one of the most
    charming plants possible to grow.

    A. obtusifolia (blunt-leaved). _fl._ white or rose, with yellow
    eye; umbels five or six-flowered. Spring. _l._ lanceolate or
    rather spathulate, in rather large rosettes. Stems downy. _h._
    2in. to 6in. European Alps. A very pretty form, closely allied to
    _A. ChamA|jasme_, and differing principally in its somewhat larger
    rosette of leaves and stronger growth. SYN. _A. aretioides_.

    =A. pauciflora= (few-flowered). Synonymous with _A. lactea_.

    =A. penicillata= (finely hairy). Synonymous with _A. villosa_.

    pretty and diminutive little alpine plant, grown, according to Mr.
    Robinson, "to great perfection in fissures between large rocks,
    with, however, deep rifts of sandy peat and loam in them. It will
    also grow on a level exposed spot, but in such a position should be
    surrounded by half-buried stones."

    =A. sarmentosa= (trailing).* _fl._ bright rose, with a white eye,
    in umbels of ten to twenty, on an erect scape. May and June. _l._
    very silvery, forming dense rosettes, whence spring a number of
    runners, bearing at their extremities other tufts, which should
    be pegged down and covered with soil, when they will root freely.
    Himalayas, 1876. It requires rich sandy loam, a sunny position, and
    to be wedged between pieces of sandstone. Cover the rosettes during
    winter with a sheet of glass. See Fig. 91.

    =A. septentrionalis= (northern). Synonymous with _A. coronopifolia_.

    May to July. _l._ linear, acute, greyish. Stems numerous. _h._
    1in. to 2in. Pyrenees, &c., 1787. When well grown, it produces
    flowers in abundance, and is the only species in cultivation having
    yellow flowers. A well-drained, sunny pocket is desirable, with a
    calcareous soil, covering the surface with nodules of sandstone.
    SYN. _Gregoria Vitaliana_.

    =A. Wulfeniana= (Wulfen's).* _fl._ rosy or crimson, large. Summer.

to the absence of the involucre). ORD. _CommelynaceA|_. Greenhouse
and stove evergreen perennials, with generally a trailing habit.
A genus resembling _Commelyna_, from which it is distinguished by
the inflorescence being sub-paniculate, and the peduncles entirely
exserted from the bracts at the branching of the panicle. Flowers
without any involucre. They thrive in a compost of loam, peat, leaf
mould, and sand, well mixed. Increased by seeds and root divisions.
There are a large number of species known to botanists.

=ANEMONE= (from _anemos_, wind; the greater part of the species grow
in elevated places, much exposed to the wind). Wind Flower. ORD.
_RanunculaceA|_. An extensive genus of very ornamental hardy perennials.
The generic characters of Anemone proper are: Involucre of three cut
leaflets, distant from the flower; calyx of five to twenty petal-like
sepals; petals absent. Of sub-genus Hepatica: Involucre of three entire
leaflets, just under the flowers; calyx of six to nine petal-like
sepals; petals absent. For botanical purposes, they are both now
included under the one generic name of Anemone; but in gardens the
Hepaticas are frequently regarded as a distinct genus. They delight in
a rich sandy loam, but most will thrive in ordinary garden soil. Some
are suitable for borders, while others thrive best on the rockery,
most of them preferring a damp and partially shady position. For the
numerous varieties of _A. coronaria_, both double and single flowered,
the soil can hardly be too rich, and the position, though open, should
be a sheltered one, and well drained. The tubers may be planted early
in October, about 6in. apart, and 3in. deep, various colours being
intermixed, when a splendid effect is produced in the following spring.
After flowering, the tubers should be taken up--say in June--and spread
out thinly, in a shady, airy situation, until they are dry, when they
should be thoroughly cleaned, and, if necessary, divided, and finally
stored away in a cool place, in pots or boxes of dry sand until the
planting season. Anemones make admirable pot plants if placed in a
compost of two parts turfy loam, and one of leaf mould or rotten hotbed
or cow manure, with about a sixth part of sharp gritty sand; but, if
so grown, they should be protected through severe weather, and brought
into warmth as required. The herbaceous species are propagated by root
divisions or root cuttings, or by seeds, in autumn or early spring;
the seeds are better sown as soon as ripe in pans in a cold frame.
Some, such as _A. japonica_, are freely increased by division; while
others, such as _A. narcissiflora_, are very slow; and the tuberous
rooted ones, by root division and seeds. The best and most rapid means
of propagating the invaluable varieties of _A. coronaria_, and also of
obtaining new ones, is by seed. A careful selection of flowers, and
skilful hybridising, will produce results commensurate with the trouble
incurred. So soon as the seed ripen, they should be gathered and sown
at once in a warm sheltered situation outside, or in pans under glass,
covering lightly with sandy soil, and keeping moist. They are somewhat
difficult to sow on account of a mass of cotton-like down which adheres
closely to them; they should be thoroughly separated therefrom by
rubbing them in dry sand. Of course, if the seed are sown at different
times, plants will be produced which will flower at different periods,
and a succession of bloom may be had from April to November--indeed,
nearly all the year.

    with numerous black anthers surrounding a tuft of yellow styles;
    sepals eight to nine, elliptical, spreading. February. _l._
    palmately five-lobed; lobes serrated. _h._ 8in. to 12in. East
    Europe. A very fine species, twice the size of _A. Hepatica_ in all
    its parts; it is well suited for the border or rockery, enjoying a
    deep rich soil. SYN. _Hepatica angulosa_.

    =A. apennina= (Apennine).* _fl._ blue, 1-1/2in. across; sepals ten
    to fourteen, oblong, obtuse, erect; pedicel one-flowered. March.
    _l._ binately pinnate; segments lanceolate, deeply-toothed, acute.

    one of the species from which the majority of "florists' varieties"
    have originated, which can be purchased at such a cheap rate,
    either in named varieties, or in mixture, and are invaluable for
    spring flowering. It thrives best in a good loamy soil, and should
    be somewhat shaded from the mid-day sun. Tuberous rooted. See Fig.

[Illustration: FIG. 96. FLOWER AND LEAF OF ANEMONE JAPONICA.]

    =A. fulgens= (shining).* _fl._ of a dazzling vermilion or scarlet,
    with a black central patch of stamens, about 2in. across; sepals
    obovate. May. Greece, South Europe, &c., 1865. A very beautiful
    variety, much more showy than _A. hortensis_ (of which it is
    generally regarded as a variety), and a universal favourite. In
    "Hardy Perennials," Mr. Wood says of this splendid species: "It may
    be grown in pots for conservatory or indoor decoration. It needs
    no forcing for such purposes; a cold frame will prove sufficient
    to bring the flowers out in winter. Borders or the moist parts of
    rockwork are suitable for it; but perhaps it is seen to greatest
    advantage in irregular masses in the half shade of trees in front
    of a shrubbery; and, after all, it is impossible to plant this
    flower wrong as regards effect. To grow it well, however, it must
    have a moist situation and good loam." See Fig. 94.

    =A. Halleri= (Haller's).* _fl._ purplish inside, large, erect;
    sepals six, oval-lanceolate. April. _l._ pinnate, very villous;

    and scapes rather hairy. _h._ 4in. to 6in. There are numerous
    varieties of this species. England, &c. SYN. _Hepatica triloba_.
    Varieties: _alba_ has large pure white flowers; _cA"rulea_ (blue),
    the double form of _cA"rulea_ is scarce and very showy; _rubra_
    produces reddish-pink flowers, and of which there is also a double
    variety, very bright and lasting; _Barlowi_ has large sky-blue
    flowers. Besides these there are many others. They are all charming
    early spring-flowering plants, preferring rich light soil, and to
    remain undisturbed for years, when they form grand clumps, often
    producing seedlings where they stand. SYN. _A. americana_. See Fig.
    95.

    =A. Honorine Jobert= (Honorine Jobert). Synonymous with _A.
    japonica alba_.

    =A. hortensis= (garden). Nearly approaches _A. coronaria_, the
    parent of a large number of garden forms. _A. fulgens_ and _A.
    stellata_ are by competent authorities placed as varieties.

    See Fig. 96.

[Illustration: FIG. 97. ANEMONE JAPONICA ALBA.]

    =A. j. alba= (white).* This is a splendid variety, with a profusion
    of large pure white flowers, which are produced from August to
    November. This white form is one of the handsomest of border
    flowers. The blooms are 2in. to 3in. across, with a centre of
    dense lemon coloured stamens. For cutting purposes the flowers
    are invaluable. It thrives best in deep soil. SYN. _A. Honorine
    Jobert_. See Fig. 97.

    =A. j. elegans= (elegant).* Very like _A. japonica_, with broader
    leaves, and pale rose-coloured flowers, which are more than 3in.

[Illustration: FIG. 98. ANEMONE NARCISSIFLORA, showing Habit and
Flower.]

    =A. narcissiflora= (Narcissus-flowered).* _fl._ usually cream
    coloured, sometimes purplish on the outside; umbels generally
    many-flowered; pedicels in some instances twice or three times
    longer than the involucrum, and in others very short; sepals five
    or six, ovate or oval, blunt or acute. May. _l._ radical ones
    palmately three to five parted; lobes deeply toothed; lobules
    linear, acute; those of the involucrum three to five cleft. _h._
    about 1ft. Europe, North America, 1773. An extremely variable and

    very near, if not identical with, the variety _Robinsoniana_, of
    our native woods.

    =A. n. flore-pleno= (double-flowered).* _fl._ pure white, over 1in.
    across, solitary, double. This is an exceedingly pretty plant, and
    remains in beauty considerably longer than the type. It should be
    grown in large clumps, and in rich loam.

    =A. n. Robinsoniana= (Robinson's).* _fl._ bright azure blue, large,
    over 1-1/2in. in diameter. A charming variety for the rockery or
    border, and one of the prettiest in the whole genus.

    =A. n. rosea= (rosy).* A very pretty form, with rose-coloured
    flowers, of which there is a double flowered sub-variety; there is
    also a double form of the type, named _bracteata_ _fl.-pl._, white
    flowers, surrounded with a large involucrum.

    =A. obtusiloba= (blunt-lobed-leaved). _fl._ cream coloured; sepals
    five, obovate; peduncles two to three, one-flowered, villous,
    naked, or the lateral ones are bracteate. June. _l._ three lobed
    cordate, and are, as well as petioles, very villous; segments
    broadly cuneated, and deeply crenate; involucral leaves trifid.
    Himalaya, 1843. This species requires a warm and sheltered position.

    =A. palmata= (palmate).* _fl._ golden yellow; sepals ten to twelve,
    oblong, obtuse; scape one, rarely two, flowered. May. _l._ cordate,
    sub-orbicular, bluntly three to five-lobed, toothed; involucral

    silky, very handsome. April. _l._ pinnate; segments many parted;
    lobes linear. _h._ 6in. to 12in. England, &c. A singular
    and beautiful species, thriving best in a dry situation and
    well-drained soil of a calcareous nature. It is a very pretty
    plant for a border or rockery; when well grown, it forms handsome
    tufts, and flowers very freely. See Fig. 99. SYN. _Pulsatilla
    vulgaris_. There are numerous varieties, the best of which are:

    =A. P. dahurica= (Dahurian). _fl._ erect; sepals oblong, very

    white, slightly drooping, 1-1/2in. across when fully open,
    fragrant; sepals six, elliptical; pedicel solitary. April. _l._
    ternate or quinate, hairy beneath; segments deeply toothed at top,
    those of the involucrum stalked. _h._ 6in. to 18in. Europe, 1596.
    This distinct and showy species thrives best in a light vegetable
    soil in a rather shady and moist situation. The roots are creeping,
    and should be allowed plenty of room, so that they may ramble

    elliptical, obtuse. April. _l._ all stalked, ternate; segments
    ovate-lanceolate, acute, toothed. _h._ 6in. France, 1597. This
    species comes close to _A. nemorosa_.

    =A. vernalis= (spring).* _fl._ whitish inside, violet and covered
    with silky down outside, erect, sub-sessile or on pedicels; sepals
    six, straight, elliptic-oblong. April. _l._ pinnate; segments
    cuneate-lanceolate, trifid; involucrum very villous. _h._ 6in.
    Europe, 1816. A curious rather than a showy species; it makes a
    pretty pot plant, but must not, under any consideration, be allowed
    to want water. It can be plunged in sand or ashes in the open, and
    just as the flowers commence to expand, transfer to a cool frame.
    It thrives best in a peat and loam compost, to which small pieces
    of charcoal may be added. SYN. _Pulsatilla vernalis_. See Fig. 102.

    =A. virginiana= (Virginian).* _fl._ purplish green or pale purple,
    small; sepals five, elliptical, silky-pubescent on the outside;
    pedicels often rising in pairs from the involucel. May. _l._
    ternate; segments trifid, acuminated, deeply toothed; those of
    the involucre and involucels stalked; peduncles three to four,
    much elongated, middle one naked, sometimes 1ft. high; lateral
    ones bearing two-leaved involucels. _h._ 2ft. North America, 1722.
    Border or woodlands, and damp places.

    =A. vitifolia= (vine-leaved). _fl._ white, villous on the outside;
    anthers copper colour; sepals eight, oval, oblong; pedicels
    one-flowered. July. _l._ large, cordate, five-lobed, beneath
    as well as the stems clothed with white wool; lobes broadly
    ovate, cut, and crenate; those of the involucrum stalked, woolly
    underneath, smooth above, bluntly cordate, five-lobed. _h._ 2ft.
    Upper Nepaul, 1829. This requires a warm sheltered position to
    stand the winter. Very near _A. japonica alba_, and probably the
    progenitor of it.

=ANEMONOPSIS= (from _anemone_, and _opsis_, resemblance; flowers like
those of the Anemone). ORD. _RanunculaceA|_. A handsome and remarkable
hardy herbaceous perennial, not unlike _Anemone japonica_, but smaller.
It thrives in any light soil. Propagated by seeds and divisions of the
root-stock in spring.

    =A. macrophylla= (large-leaved).* _fl._ in loose racemes; sepals
    about nine, concave, the outer three purple, internally pale lilac;
    petals twelve, in many rows, one-third the length of the sepals,
    linear-oblong. July. _l._ large, biternate, coarsely toothed,
    glabrous. _h._ 2ft. to 3ft. Japan, 1869.

=ANEMOPA†GMA= (from _anemos_, the wind, and _paigma_, sport). ORD.
_BignoniaceA|_. A handsome stove climbing shrub. For culture, _see_
=Bignonia=.

    =A. racemosum= (racemose).* _fl._ delicate buff coloured, in
    axillary racemes, large. September. Brazil, 1879. This beautiful
    and vigorous climber is, as yet, very rare in cultivation.

=ANETHUM= (from _ano_, upwards, and _theo_, to run; in reference to its
quick growth). ORD. _UmbelliferA|_. A genus of erect glabrous annuals.
Flowers yellow; involucre and involucels wanting. Leaves decompound,
with linear-setaceous lobes. This genus is of no ornamental value, its
most important species being the garden Dill (_A. graveolens_), which
_see_ for culture.

=ANGELICA= (in reference to the supposed angelic medicinal virtues
of some species). ORD. _UmbelliferA|_. Perennial or biennial herbs.
Flowers white; umbels terminal; involucra wanting or of few leaves;
involucels of many leaves. Leaves bipinnate. The common Angelica (_A.
Archangelica_) is the only species that calls for mention. It is a
native biennial, and was at one time in much request for confectionery,
and as a herb of supposed great medicinal value. Seed should be sown in
September or March in ordinary soil, and the young plants thinned out
to about 18in. apart.

=ANGELICA TREE.= _See_ =Aralia spinosa=.

=ANGELONIA= (from _angelon_, the local name of _A. salicariA|folia_
in South America). SYN. _Schelveria_. ORD. _ScrophulariaceA|_. Very
pretty stove herbaceous perennials. Flowers axillary, racemose; corolla
irregular, bilabiate; lower lip saccate at the base, trifid; upper
one smaller, bifid. Leaves opposite. Stem and branches quadrangular.
A mixture of light turfy loam, peat, leaf soil, and sand, is a good
compost. Cuttings of young shoots in spring strike readily under a hand
glass, or plunged in the propagating bed, giving plenty of air daily.

    =A. salicariA|folia= (Willow-leaved).* _fl._ blue, hairy, axillary,
    solitary, pedicellate, disposed in terminal racemes. August. _l._
    sessile, lanceolate, acute, serrated towards the apex, finely
    pubescent on both surfaces. _h._ 1-1/2ft. to 3ft. South America,
    1818.

=ANGIOPTERIS= (from _aggeion_, a vessel, and _pteris_, a wing).
Including _Psilodochea_. ORD. _Filices_. A genus of gigantic greenhouse
ferns. Capsules eight to fifteen, opening by a slit down the side,
sessile, very close but not concrete, arranged in linear-oblong or
boat-shaped sori near the edge of the frond. These ferns require a very
liberal supply of water, and plenty of room to fully expand. The most
suitable compost is a mixture of strong loam and peat, with some sharp
sand. Thorough drainage must be afforded.

    =A. evecta= (evectic). _cau._ erect, 2ft. to 6ft. high, 1-1/2ft.
    to 2ft. thick, very fleshy. _sti._ swollen and articulated at
    the base, furnished with two large leathery persistent auricles.
    _fronds_ 6ft. to 15ft. long, bi- or tripinnate; pinnA| 1ft. to
    3ft. long, spreading, the lowest the largest; rachis swollen at
    the base; pinnules 4in. to 12in. long, 1/2in. to 1-1/2in. broad,
    linear-oblong, sessile or shortly stalked, acuminate; edge entire
    or finely toothed. Tropics of Old World. This is the only clearly
    defined species; the others usually known as distinct species are
    but varieties of it, and its culture should not be attempted if
    plenty of room cannot be afforded it.

=ANGOPHORA= (from _aggos_, a vessel, and _phero_, to bear; in reference
to the shape of the fruit). ORD. _MyrtaceA|_. Australian evergreen
greenhouse ornamental trees or shrubs. Flowers corymbose; calyx five or
six-cleft. Leaves large, opposite. A mixture of leaf soil, peat, and
sand suits them well. Ripened cuttings will root in sandy soil under a
hand glass in a cool house, in a few weeks.

    =A. cordifolia= (heart-leaved).* _fl._ yellowish, corymbose, large.
    May. _l._ sessile, ovate, cordate at the base, glabrous. _h._ 7ft.
    to 10ft. New Holland, 1789.

    =A. lanceolata= (lanceolate-leaved).* _fl._ white, corymbose. May.
    _l._ petiolate, lanceolate, acuminate, glabrous. _h._ 4ft. to 6ft.
    New Holland, 1816.

=ANGRA†CUM= (deduced from _angurek_, a Malayan name for air plants).
ORD. _OrchidaceA|_. TRIBE _VandeA|_. These are among the most beautiful
of epiphytal orchids. One characteristic, both remarkable and peculiar,
is the long, hollow, tail-like spur depending from the base of the lip.
The flowers are produced on spikes from the axils of the leaves. The
leaves are evergreen, and arranged in two rows, the one opposite to the
other, and, in many kinds, being curved, give the plant a very graceful
appearance. The fact of these plants producing their blooms during
the winter--a period when flowers are generally scarce--considerably
enhances their value. They usually continue six or eight weeks in
perfection, or even more. The following table of night temperatures
should be almost universally adhered to for all the species enumerated,
except _A. falcatum_, which thrives best in a cool house. From November
to February, 58deg. to 63deg.; March to May, September and October,
65deg.; June to August, 70deg. The day temperature should be 7deg. or
8deg. higher than that of the night. A compost of crocks, charcoal,
and sphagnum is best. A layer of a few large crocks at the bottom of
the pot or pan will be required; over these spread another layer of
charcoal and smaller crocks, just enough to allow the roots to support
the plant; so that the first pair of leaves will be, in large plants,
about 4in. above the rim of the pot, or proportionately less in the
case of small plants. When the plant is carefully adjusted in its
proper position, and held there with one hand, the other hand should
work in among the roots more crocks and charcoal, ceasing so to do
when within 2in. of the rim; the remaining space must be occupied with
fresh sphagnum, pressed firm (this is most essential) in a cone shape,
which may be built up to within 1/2in. of the lower pair of leaves.
Prior to potting, which ought to be done between February and April,
water should be withheld for a short time; but give a good soaking
immediately after the operation. In the process of repotting, clear
the roots of the old moss, all rotten stems, and particles of decayed
roots. If plants are potted as we have recommended, a thorough soaking
once a week only, or if grown on blocks of wood, or in suspended
baskets or pans, about twice weekly will be found sufficient. Excessive
fumigation, drought, whether atmospherical or at the roots, will cause
the leaves to drop, and prevent any growth being made, in which case
the plant ought to be lowered. If the stems have emitted but few roots,
a ring of moss fastened round the stems, and kept constantly wet, will
induce the plant to throw out additional roots, when the lowering
may be proceeded with. To keep the plants free from insect pests,
frequently sponge the foliage. Thrips generally prove very troublesome,
and a moderate fumigation is needful, dislodging the insects that may
be secreted low down in the centre of the plant, shortly before the
operation, by dropping a little weak tobacco water or sulphur among
them.

    =A. arcuatum= (curved).* _fl._ white; racemes from the axils of
    the two-year-old leaves, two or three being produced from a single
    growth, about 6in. long, arching. _l._ about 4in. long, and 3/4in.
    broad. Natal. SYNS. _Listrostachys arcuata_. _A. (Listrostachys)
    Sedeni_ comes close to the above species, but is excessively rare
    in cultivation.

    =A. bilobum= (two-lobed).* _fl._ white, with a tinge of rose, about
    1-1/2in. in diameter; spur 2in. long, produced from the side of
    the stem, just above the two-year-old leaves; racemes pendulous,
    6in. or more long, bearing about a dozen flowers, which possess
    a slight fragrance. October to December. _l._ 4in. long by 2in.
    broad, two-lobed at the apex, about eight on a plant. Stem erect,
    about 6in. high. Cape Coast, 1841. Should be grown in a basket.

    labellum pure white; spur thick, pale green, about 9in. long,
    two-lobed at the lowest portion; racemes arching, 1ft. or more
    long, produced from the base of the two-year-old leaves. Autumn.
    _l._ pale green, drooping, about 10in. long by 1in. broad. _h._
    1-1/2ft. Stem erect, or nearly so. Sierra Leone, 1834.

    =A. cephalotes= (capitate).* _fl._ white. Tropical Africa, 1873.

    =A. Chailluanum= (Chaillu's).* _fl._ white; sepals and petals
    narrow, acute; spur yellowish green, 4in. or more long; racemes
    pendulous, 8in. or 10in. long, about twelve medium sized flowers
    produced from the side of the stem, just above the axils of
    two-year-old leaves. _l._ 6in. long, 1-1/2in. broad, slightly
    wavy, two-lobed at the apex, arranged in an imbricate manner. West
    Africa, 1866. A rare species.

    =A. Christyanum= (Christy's). A curious species, with yellow or
    greenish-white flowers, having a much developed three-lobed lip.
    The plant has the aspect of _A. arcuatum_. 1880.

    =A. citratum= (citron-like).* _fl._ creamy white, or pale yellow,
    nearly 1in. in diameter; spurs about 1-1/2in. long; racemes
    three, on strong plants, produced from the axils of two-year-old
    leaves, arched, about 1ft. long, bearing sometimes twenty flowers.
    _l._ 4in. to 6in. long and 2in. broad, six or eight on a plant,
    occupying about 1-1/2in. of stem. Madagascar, 1868. Habit compact;
    stem nearly erect.

    =A. distichum= (two-rowed-leaved). _fl._ whitish, 1/4in. across,
    on one-flowered pedicels, which are produced from the axils of the
    leaves. _l._ very short, closely imbricated, deep bright green.
    _h._ 6in. Sierra Leone, 1834. A very neat growing little species,
    and quite distinct.

    =A. eburneum= (ivory-lipped).* _fl._ sepals and petals greenish
    white; lip uppermost, white, very large; racemes about 18in. long,
    from the axils of two-year-old leaves; footstalks erect, but
    gradually becoming pendulous from the commencement of the flowers.
    _l._ 20in. long by 2in. broad, light green, stiff. Madagascar,
    1826. SYN. _A†robion eburneum_. _A. virens_ is an inferior variety,
    but _A. e. superbum_ surpasses the type in beauty; it is, however,
    at present extremely rare.

    =A. Ellisii= (Ellis's).* _fl._ pure white, fragrant, about 2in.
    across, with narrow reflexed sepals and petals, the column
    standing very prominent; spur pale brownish, 6in. to 8in.; racemes
    frequently 2ft. long, on the side of the stem just above the axils
    of the two-year-old leaves, bearing about twenty blossoms. _l._
    dark green, 9in. or 10in. long, and 2in. broad, divided at the apex
    into two unequal lobes. Madagascar, 1879.

    spur upcurved, 2in. long; racemes from the axils of the
    two-year-old leaves, short, bearing from two to five blooms. _l._
    2in. to 4in. long, very narrow and fleshy, dark green. 1815.
    An elegant little cool house species, and one of the smallest
    belonging to this genus. It should be grown in peat, in a basket or
    small pot suspended about 2ft. from the glass, but rather shaded.

    similar to the common white pink, 1in. to 1-1/2in. across; spur
    reddish-tinted, 6in. or 7in. long, distinguished by the two spiral
    twistings; racemes from the axils of the lower leaves, 18in. long,
    bearing about twelve blossoms. _l._ 6in. long by 3in. broad, of
    which there are generally six or more on a good plant. Zanzibar,
    1880. Should be grown in a basket, or on a cylindrical block of
    teak wood.

    semi-transparent texture, and with a finely fringed labellum;
    racemes from the axils of the lowest leaves, hanging
    perpendicularly from the stems, about 1ft. long, bearing thirty
    to forty blossoms. _l._ 12in. long by 2in. or 3in. broad. Sierra
    Leone, 1842. Must be grown in a suspended basket.

    =A. pertusum= (broken).* _fl._ pure white; spur comparatively
    short, with a well-marked yellow tinge; racemes from the axils of
    two-year-old leaves, horizontal, or slightly nodding, 6in. to 7in.
    long, with from forty to sixty densely packed, small blossoms. _l._
    dark green, arching, 10in. long by 1in. broad. _h._ 1ft. Sierra
    Leone, 1836. Very distinct and attractive.

    on stout, solitary, axillary peduncles, with sepals and petals
    spreading out like rays, from 6in. to 8in. across; the whip-like
    spur or nectary hangs down from the labellum, often from 10in. to
    18in. long. November, December, and January, and lasts about three
    weeks in beauty. _l._ dark green, distichous, about 10in. long.
    _h._ 1ft. Madagascar, 1823. It is one of the grandest of winter
    flowering orchids.

    =A. virens= (green). An inferior variety of _A. eburneum_.

=ANGULAR.= Having angles, or forming angles.

=ANGULOA= (commemorative of Angulo, a Spanish naturalist). ORD.
_OrchidaceA|_. A small genus containing about six species. The flowers,
which are large and beautiful, are borne singly on scapes from 12in. to
16in. high, several of which are produced from the ripened pseudo-bulbs
of the preceding year's growth. Pseudo-bulbs from 5in. to 8in. high, as
thick as a man's wrist, bearing two to three erect, broad, lanceolate
leaves, 2ft. to 4ft. long. Temperature, summer, day (maximum), 70deg.;
night (minimum), 60deg. Winter, day (maximum), 60deg.; night (minimum),
45deg. These are bold growing cool-house plants, best grown in rough
fibrous peat, with good drainage. They delight in an abundant supply
of water both to the roots and foliage when growing, and require to
be kept in a somewhat dark or heavily-shaded place. During the season
of rest, and until young shoots commence growth, they should be kept
rather dry. They are propagated by dividing the pseudo-bulbs, just
before they commence to grow. The flowering season is summer.

    =A. Clowesii= (Clowes's).* _fl._ fragrant; sepals and petals
    concave, clear golden yellow; lip pure white; whole conformation
    globular, or tulip-like. Columbia (at 5000ft. to 6000ft.
    elevation), 1842. This is the largest growing species, of which
    there are one or two rare varieties.

    =A. eburnea= (ivory-flowered).* _fl._, sepals and petals of the
    purest white; lip spotted with pink. New Grenada. In other respects
    similar to above, but is very rare.

    =A. Ruckeri= (Rucker's).* _fl._, sepals and petals yellow, with
    crimson spots; lip deep crimson. Columbia, 1845. Not so large a
    grower as either of the foregoing, but with same sized flowers.

    =A. R. sanguinea= (bloody).* This variety has flowers of a deep
    blood red colour, but is rare.

    =A. superba= (superb).* Synonymous with _Acineta Humboldtii_.

    =A. uniflora= (one-flowered).* _fl._ sub-globose, pure white,
    sometimes freckled with brown, spotted profusely with pink inside.
    Columbia, 1844. One of the best in cultivation.

=ANGURIA= (one of the Greek names for the cucumber). ORD.
_CucurbitaceA|_. A stove genus of evergreen climbers allied to
_Momordica_. Flowers monA"cious; corolla joined to the calyx,
ventricose, red, with a five-parted spreading border. Fruit somewhat
tetragonal. Several species have been introduced from time to time, but
they are rarely seen in our gardens. Some of them are handsome plants,
and well worthy of cultivation.

=ANHALONIUM.= _See_ =Mammillaria=.

=ANIGOZANTHUS= (from _anoigo_, to expand, and _anthos_, a flower;
in reference to the branching expansion of the flower stalks). SYN.
_SchwA|grichenia_. ORD. _HA|modoraceA|_. Greenhouse or half-hardy
perennial herbs. Flowers large, racemose or corymbose; perianth
tubular, elongated, woolly. Leaves linear ensiform. The species thrive
in a turfy compost of peat and loam, three parts of the former to one
of the latter; the whole intermixed with sand to make it porous. In the
growing season they must be kept well watered, and somewhat dry during
their period of rest in winter. They are very easily propagated by
dividing the roots in spring.

    =A. coccineus= (scarlet).* _fl._ scarlet; perianth swelling
    towards the summit, hairy, segments a little reflexed; disposed in
    dichotomously-forked panicles; pedicels rather long. June. _l._

[Illustration: FIG. 103. INFLORESCENCE AND LEAF OF ANIGOZANTHUS
FLAVIDUS.]

    =A. flavidus= (yellowish-green-flowered).* _fl._ yellowish green,
    panicled; scapes long. May. _l._ lanceolate, smooth, as is also
    the stem; down of branches deciduous. _h._ 3ft. New Holland, 1808.
    There is a scarlet and green-flowered variety of this species. See

    clothed with purple tomentum. May. _l._ linear, stiff, straight,
    glabrous. Stem tall, ternate, panicled, clothed with hoary tomentum
    below. _h._ 3ft. Swan River, 1844.

=ANIL.= _See_ =Indigofera Anil=.

=ANIME RESIN.= _See_ =HymenA|a Courbaril=.

=ANIMATED OAT.= _See_ =Avena sterilis=.

=ANISANTHUS.= _See_ =Antholyza=.

=ANISE= (_Pimpinella Anisum_). A hardy annual, occasionally used for
garnishing or seasoning. Sow seed, in ordinary garden soil, on a warm
sunny border, in May, where it is intended for the plants to remain.

=ANISEED TREE.= _See_ =Illicium=.

=ANISOCHILUS= (from _anisos_, unequal, and _cheilos_, a lip; in
reference to the inequality of both lips of calyx and corolla). ORD.
_LabiatA|_. A very ornamental genus of stove perennials or biennials.
Whorls of flowers densely imbricate into oblong cylindrical spikes;
corolla with an exserted, defracted tube, inflated throat, and
bilabiate limb. They thrive in any light rich soil. Cuttings will root
in a sandy soil under a bell glass, in heat; seeds may be sown in
February in heat.

    =A. carnosum= (fleshy). _fl._ lilac; whorls densely imbricate into
    oblong cylindrical pedunculate spikes. June to September. _l._
    petiolate, ovate-roundish, obtuse, crenated, cordate at the base,
    thick, fleshy, tomentose on both surfaces. Stem erect. _h._ 2ft.
    East Indies, 1788.

=ANISOMELES= (from _anisos_, unequal, and _melos_, a member; in
reference to the anthers of the longer stamens being halved). ORD.
_LabiatA|_. Ornamental greenhouse or evergreen stove shrubs, herbaceous
perennials, or annuals. Whorls sometimes densely many-flowered, at
others few, and loose; corolla with upper lip erect, oblong, entire;
lower lip larger, spreading, and lateral lobes ovate, obtuse. They are
of very easy culture in light rich soil; young cuttings strike freely
in spring, in heat, under a bell glass. _A. furcata_ requires little or
no artificial heat, but the protection of a bell glass is beneficial.
Seeds of _A. ovata_ may be sown in spring, in heat, and, after due
hardening off, the seedlings may be planted outside in May.

    =A. furcata= (forked).* _fl._ small, elegantly variegated with
    white, red, and purple, in loose many-flowered racemose cymes.
    July. _l._ petiolate, ovate, acuminated, crenated, cordate at the
    base, hispid on both surfaces. _h._ 4ft. to 6ft. Nepaul, 1824.

    =A. malabarica= (Malabar). _fl._ purplish; whorls distant,
    many-flowered, dense. July. _l._ oblong-lanceolate, 2in. to 4in. in
    length, obtuse, serrately crenated in the upper part, quite entire

=ANNUALS.= All plants which spring from the seed, flower, and die
within the course of a year. A number of things, however, which are
not strictly of annual duration, but which are sown every year in
preference to housing the roots before they are killed by late autumn
or winter frosts, are generally classed, for the sake of convenience,
under the head of Annuals. Hardy Annuals are those which require no
artificial aid to enable them to develop, but grow and flower freely
in the open air. These are best sown in the spots where they are
intended to remain during March and April, and care must subsequently
be taken to keep the ground clear of weeds, and also to thin out the
seedlings, allowing each sufficient room to develop and exhibit its
true character. If allowed to remain too crowded, the plants, as a
matter of course, suffer, and the size and number of the flowers and
the general effect are considerably decreased. Successional sowings
of a good many of the showy species will be found to prolong their
flowering season. In well-kept establishments, where Annuals are duly
appreciated, several sowings are made in pots at intervals of a few
weeks. As the previously-sown clumps begin to get shabby, they are
removed, and replaced by others which have still to flower. By this
means a continual sheet of blossom can be maintained for a long time.
It is much better to trust to plants grown in pots in order to carry
out the plan just sketched, as these receive no check when placed in
their new quarters; whilst transplanted clumps frequently fail, and
many species do not transplant at all readily from an open border.
In order to secure, in early spring, a fine show of such plants as
several of the _Silenes_, _Myosotis_, _Saponaria_, and a number of
others, it is best to sow the seeds in an open, sheltered border, about
the end of July or beginning of August, taking care to keep a small
reserve stock in a cold frame, in case very severe weather kills the
unprotected plants. Half-hardy Annuals are those for which our climate
is not sufficiently warm, or, rather, our summer is not, as a rule,
either hot enough or long enough, to allow them to grow, flower well,
and ripen seeds, if sown in the open air. Many of these are amongst
the showiest of garden plants, so it is worth while to give them the
shelter of a warm frame during their earlier stages, and gradually
harden them off, planting out at the end of May or beginning of June,
when danger resulting from severe weather is passed. After germination,
the seedlings should have plenty of light and air, or a weak, spindly
growth, and, as a consequence, poor flowers, will result. The most
satisfactory method of watering very tiny seeds is to place a piece of
fine muslin over the seed-pot, through which the water will be easily
conveyed to the seeds, and thus prevent disturbance. Tender Annuals
require the same treatment as the half-hardy ones, except that they
need throughout their existence the protection of a glass structure.
All, or nearly all, garden Annuals delight in full sunlight and plenty
of air. In the open, these requirements, as a rule, obtain, but
sometimes mistakes are made under glass by keeping the plants too close
and over much shaded, as well as too great a distance from the glass.

=ANNULAR.= Having a ring-like form.

=ANNULATE.= With the appearance of rings.

=ANA'CTOCHILUS= (from _anoiktos_, open, and _cheilos_, a lip; in
reference to the spreading apex of the lip). SYNS. _Anecochilus_,
_Chrysobaphus_. ORD. _OrchideA|_. Stove terrestrial orchids, the radical
leaves of which are the chief attraction, being amongst the most
beautiful and delicate objects in the vegetable kingdom. The flowers,
which should be pinched off so soon as they appear, are, as a rule,
small and unattractive. Few of the species exceed 6in. in height,
with leaves from 2in. to 6in. long, including the fleshy petioles.
They require a good deal of attention. To one part of silver sand,
thoroughly washed twice or three times, add two of sphagnum, which
should also be well washed and picked over, when it should be chopped
into minute particles, in order that it may freely amalgamate with
the sand; mix a little loam and peat with the whole. In the pots,
when well drained by first placing a large piece of potsherd over the
bottom and nearly half filling up with pieces broken small and of
uniform size, place a thin layer of crude sphagnum, afterwards filling
firmly with the mixture above mentioned, and bringing it up more or
less in the form of a cone above the rim of the pot, into which the
plants should be firmly fixed. Plants which have been propagated by
division should be carefully transferred to 32-sized pots. About five
separate pieces might be placed evenly over the surface. Make holes
with a neat dibble, and into these drop the roots their entire length,
pressing the soil firmly with the dibble. Fix them so that they may
grow inwardly, and not out over the rim of the pots, pegging each
creeping root needing such attention firmly down upon the surface of
the soil afterwards; after a good soaking, they may be replaced in any
warm, shady situation. For propagating, a strong plant is necessary; it
may be cut into pieces just below the first joint, each piece having
a root. The bottom piece should have two eyes--one to root from, and
the other to push into a shoot. The "bottom," or plant which has been
cut, should be replaced in its pot, and then put under a bell glass.
It will soon throw up a young shoot; this ought to be left on until
well rooted, when it may be separated and treated similarly to the
portion first removed, still leaving the old part in the pot. These
plants must be grown in glass cases, or under bell glasses, but they
should always have a little air, for, as Mr. Williams says, when too
much confined, they grow up spindly, and damp off in the stem; the
latter, being fleshy, requires more substance and sturdiness. Air
should be admitted through a space of about 1in. or 2in. The following
ranges of temperature are advised: Winter, night, 55deg. to 60deg.;
day, 65deg. to 70deg. during March, April, and May; night, 60deg. to
70deg.; and, afterwards, a few degrees higher, with a maximum day
temperature of 80deg. Bottom heat should not be given, as it induces
a weak, fast growth. Great care will be needed to prevent ravages of
insects. The most suitable month for repotting is March, just before
growth commences, when the plants will need plenty of water up to
October, excepting when it is desirous to utilise them as drawing-room
ornaments, in which case they should be kept rather dry for a short
time previous. _See also_ =Dossinia=, =Goodyera=, =HA|meria=, =Macodes=,

=ANOMATHECA= (from _anomos_, singular, and _theca_, a capsule, or
seed-pod). ORD. _IrideA|_. Very pretty little bulbous perennials.
Perianth hypocrateriform; tube triquetrous, constricted at the throat.
The species are hardy when planted in warm sunny situations in the
open border. Their dwarf stature, brilliance, profusion of flowers,
and habit of blossoming continuously over a long period, render them
very popular subjects amongst growers of hardy perennials. Although
generally credited with being hardy, when cultivated out of doors they
should be lifted and stored in frost-proof quarters before winter
commences, until the following March. They are excellent as window
garden plants, and also for pot culture. If grown in pots, they should
be shaken out, and repotted in February or March. They multiply very
rapidly, and may be divided in patches, not by single bulbs, once
yearly. Light sandy loam, mixed with a little leaf mould, is the best
compost. Anomathecas are sometimes increased by seed, which may be sown
so soon as ripe, very thinly, in seed pans. Thin out the seedlings if
growing very close together; the next season they may be put out four
or five in a pot. When they become crowded, shift into a much larger
pot, but do not disturb the ball. The young seedlings will probably
produce flowers the second season.

    =A. cruenta= (bloody).* _fl._ rich carmine-crimson; perianth
    segments elliptical, three lower ones broader than the others,
    with a dark blotch at the base; tube long, whitish; scapes secund,
    bearing about five or six flowers. Summer and autumn. _l._
    two-ranked, about 1/2in. broad, sword-shape, somewhat tapering.
    Bulb ovate, rather large. _h._ 6in. to 12in. Cape of Good Hope,
    1830.

    =A. juncea= (rushy). _fl._ very bright pink, with a dark spot at
    the base, produced in profusion. The leaves are narrower than those
    of the foregoing. Cape of Good Hope, 1791. A rare species.

=ANONA= (_Anona_ is the name applied to these plants in St. Domingo).
Custard Apple. ORD. _AnonaceA|_. Stove evergreen shrubs, with fragrant
leaves. Petals six, in two rows. Carpels indefinite, joined into one
fleshy, many-celled, edible, roundish fruit, with a muricated, scaly,
or reticulated skin. Anonas thrive best in rich loamy soil, mixed with
a little peat. Ripened cuttings, with leaves intact, will root if
inserted in sand and placed under a hand glass, in a moist heat. When
seeds are procurable, they should be sown in pots, and plunged into a
hotbed.

    =A. Cherimolia= (The Cherimoyer). _fl._ outer petals somewhat
    concave, linear-oblong, brown on the outside, each marked with a
    dark spot at the base; peduncles opposite the leaves, solitary.

    the Peruvians as one of their most delicate, and as being not
    inferior to any fruit in the world. _l._ ovate-lanceolate, not
    dotted; under surface silky tomentose, strong scented. _h._ 20ft.
    Peru, 1739.

    _fr._ ovate-globose, dotted, and reticulated, flesh-coloured. _l._
    oblong, acuminated, mucronate, smooth. _h._ 20ft. Guiana, 1820.

    =A. muricata= (muricated-fruited).* The Sour Sop. _fl._ outer
    petals cordate, concave, thick, acuminated, green on the outside,
    yellow inside, and spotted; peduncles solitary, one-flowered,
    sweet-scented. _fr._ muricated, with fleshy points, green. _l._
    ovate-lanceolate, smooth, shining. _h._ 15ft. West Indies, 1656.

    =A. palustris= (marsh). Alligator Apple; Cork-wood. _fl._ yellow;
    petals all acute. _fr._ rather areolate, large, heart-shaped,
    sweet-scented. _l._ ovate-oblong, leathery, quite smooth. _h._
    10ft. to 20ft. South America, 1788.

    =A. reticulata= (netted). The Custard Apple, or Bullock's Heart.

    the base, brownish on the outside, whitish-yellow on the inside,
    marked with dark purple spots. _fr._ ovate-globose, reticulate,
    as large as a tennis ball, with yellowish soft flesh; it is much
    esteemed by some people. _l._ oblong-lanceolate, acute, smooth,
    somewhat dotted. _h._ 15ft. to 25ft. Brazil, 1690.

    =A. squamosa= (scaly). Sweet Sop. _fl._, outer petals
    linear-oblong, somewhat concave at the base, nearly closing,
    greenish-yellow. _fr._ egg-shaped, scaly. _l._ oblong, bluntish,
    smooth, full of pellucid dots, rather glaucous beneath. _h._ 20ft.
    South America, 1739.

=ANONACEA†.= An order of trees or shrubs, mostly tropical, with axillary
peduncles, lateral or opposite the leaves, and with alternate, simple,
entire or hardly toothed leaves, without stipules. _Anona_ is the
typical genus.

=ANONYMO.= A synonym of =Saururus= (which _see_).

=ANONYMOS BRACTEATA.= _See_ =Zornia tetraphylla=.

=ANOPLANTHUS= (in part). A synonym of =PhelipA|a= (which _see_).

=ANOPLOPHYTUM.= _See_ =Schlumbergeria= and =Tillandsia=.

=ANOPTERUS= (from _ano_, upwards, and _pteron_, a wing; in reference
to the seeds, which are winged at the apex). ORD. _SaxifrageA|_. A very
handsome greenhouse evergreen shrub, having a free branching habit,
large dark shining green leaves, and long panicles of salver-shaped
flowers. It would probably prove quite hardy in the south and west
of England, and parts of Scotland, provided it had a slight winter
protection. It grows well in sandy loam and peat. When grown in pots,
it requires plenty of room and water. Half-ripened cuttings root freely
under a bell glass in a cool house or frame in summer.

    =A. glandulosa= (glandular).* _fl._ white, rose tinted, large;
    racemes erect, simple, terminal. April, May. _l._ alternate, rarely
    nearly opposite, ovate-oblong, attenuated at both ends, nearly
    sessile, leathery, toothed. _h._ 3ft. Van Diemen's Land, 1823.

=ANSELLIA= (named after Mr. Ansell, the botanical collector who
accompanied the ill-fated Niger Expedition). ORD. _OrchidaceA|_. Strong
growing, free flowering stove epiphytal orchids. Best grown in large
pots, as they produce a quantity of roots. They require a compost of
turfy peat, with moderate drainage. An ample supply of water during the
growing season is needed; but care must be taken not to let any remain
in the heart of the plants, as they are very likely to rot. During the
season of rest, little or no water, but a damp atmosphere, are the
chief requirements. Propagated by divisions of the bulbs just after
flowering.

    =A. africana= (African).* _fl._, sepals and petals nearly 2in.
    long, greenish yellow, spotted with brownish red; lip small,
    yellow; spikes large, drooping, branched, each sometimes bearing
    nearly a hundred blooms. Stems 3ft. to 4ft. high, with light
    evergreen foliage. Fernando Po, 1844. Lasts two months in
    perfection.

    =A. a. gigantea= (gigantic).* _fl._ on upright spikes from the top
    of the pseudo-bulbs, but smaller, of a light yellow tint, with
    very few narrow, transverse, brown bars, and a deep yellow lip,
    without warts of any kind on its middle lobe, and with more or less
    crenulated keels. Natal, 1847. The perfume is very peculiar. Very
    rare.

    =A. a. lutea= (yellow). Not so strong a grower; producing clusters
    of light yellow flowers from the top of the pseudo-bulbs. Natal.

    =A. a. nilotica= (Nile district).* As a garden plant this is
    much superior to the type. The habit is dwarfer, the colours of
    the flowers brighter and more distinctly defined. The sepals and
    petals, too, are more spreading. Eastern Africa.

=ANSERINA.= _See_ =Potentilla anserina=.

=ANTENNA†.= Two movable, articulated organs attached to the heads of
insects and crustacea, commonly called "horns" or "feelers." They are
variable in form and length. AntennA| seem to serve for touch, and,
perhaps, for smell and hearing.

[Illustration: FIG. 105. ANTENNARIA MARGARITACEA, showing Habit and
Inflorescence.]

=ANTENNARIA= (from _antennA|_; in reference to the similarity which
exists between the seed down of the plant and the antennA|, or feelers,
of an insect). ORD. _CompositA|_. Hardy herbaceous perennials,
distinguished by the dry, coloured, chaffy scales encircling each
head of flowers, of which the stamens and pistils are on different
plants. These are charming little alpine plants, admirably adapted for
rockwork, pots, edgings, or borders, in any light soil. Propagated by
divisions of the roots in spring, and seeds; the latter should be sown
in spring in a cold frame. Grown chiefly for their leaves.

    =A. dioica= (diA"cious).* _fl.-heads_ pink, in crowded corymbs, 3in.
    to 4in. high. June. _l._ radical ones spathulate, woolly chiefly
    beneath; upper ones lanceolate. Stems simple; shoots procumbent.
    Britain. The two or three varieties of this pretty species exceed
    the type in beauty. SYN. _Gnaphalium dioicum_.

    =A. d. hyperborea= (northern). _l._ woolly on both surfaces.

    =A. d. minima= (smallest).* A very small growing variety.

    =A. margaritacea= (pearly).* _fl.-heads_ white, corymbose. August.
    _l._ linear-lanceolate, acute, alternate, cottony, especially
    beneath. Stems branched above. _h._ 2ft. Naturalised in England
    and on the Continent. Said to have been introduced from America
    about the sixteenth century. The prettier but much rarer _A.
    triplinervis_, from Nepaul, comes close to this species. See Fig.
    105.

    =A. tomentosa= (downy).* _fl.-heads_ corymbose. Summer. One of the
    dwarfest and best of silvery-leaved plants, either as an edging for
    small beds or for covering the higher portions of rockwork; it is
    much used in carpet bedding. It scarcely grows more than 1in. high,
    and forms a dense carpet in a short space of time. It should be
    grown separate from other plants. It is frequently known under the
    name of _A. candida_.

=ANTERIOR.= Placed in front, or outwards.

floriferous character). Camomile. ORD. _CompositA|_. Receptacle convex,
chaffy. Involucre hemispherical or nearly flat; scales imbricated,
membranaceous at the margin. Pappus none; ray florets ligulate; disk
tubular. This is a large genus, principally of medicinal value, and
contains very few species worth the cultivator's trouble. Of easy
culture in any ordinary soil. Propagated by divisions.

    =A. Aizoon= (Aizoon).* _fl.-heads_ resembling a white Daisy;
    florets of the ray fourteen to eighteen, trifid, twice as long as
    the breadth of the disk. Summer. _l._ lanceolate, or broadly so,
    acutely and deeply serrated, narrowed towards the base, covered
    with white down; lower ones crowded; stem-leaves rather acute,
    gradually lessening in size. _h._ 2in. to 4in. Northern Greece.
    Free grower, dwarf, and compact.

    =A. Biebersteinii= (Bieberstein's).* _fl.-heads_ yellow. Summer.
    _l._ pinnately divided into linear three-lobed segments, which are
    covered with white silky pubescence. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Caucasus.

    =A. Chamomilla fl. pl.= _See_ =Matricaria=.

    =A. nobilis= (noble). Common Chamomile. _fl.-heads_ solitary; disk
    yellow; ray white; scales of the receptacle membranaceous, scarcely
    longer than the disk. _l._ bipinnate, segments linear-subulate, a
    little downy. Stem procumbent, and much branched. England. A very
    strong smelling plant, of great medicinal value. For culture, _see_
    =Chamomile=.

    =A. tinctoria= (dyer's). _fl._ bright yellow, in large heads.
    July and August. _l._ bipinnatifid, serrate, downy beneath. Stem
    angular. _h._ 1-1/2ft. England. A very pretty plant.

=ANTHER.= The male part of a flower containing the pollen.

=ANTHERICUM= (from _anthos_, a flower and _kerkos_, a hedge; in
reference to the tall flower stems). SYN. _Phalangium_. ORD.
_LiliaceA|_. A large genus, belonging to the capsular group of the
order, and inhabiting, for the most part, the Cape of Good Hope.
Flowers white, racemose or panicled, scapose; perianth segments either
spreading from near the base or campanulately united; stamens short,
with naked or bearded filaments. Leaves radical, filiform or linear.
The hardy varieties are now extensively grown, and are among the most
ornamental of border plants. They thrive best in rich light soil, and
are excellent subjects for pot culture; for which purpose use a compost
of fibrous loam, leaf mould, or well-decayed manure, and coarse sand.
The pots should be about 12in. across, well drained, and the plants
potted just previous to, or so soon as, growth commences. During
activity, plenty of water is needed, until the plants have finished
flowering, when the quantity may be lessened; but never allow them
to get dry. Propagated by division of the roots or seeds, sowing the
latter, as early as possible after they are ripe, in a cold frame.

=ANTHOCERCIS= (from _anthos_, a flower, and _kerkis_, a ray; in
reference to the radiated corolla). ORD. _SolanaceA|_. Handsome
greenhouse evergreen shrubs, with alternate leaves, attenuated into
the petioles or base, thick, sometimes glandularly dotted. Flowers
axillary, generally solitary; corolla campanulate. Cuttings strike
freely in sand under a bell glass, with a mild bottom heat. So soon as
they have well rooted, pot off into very small pots in two-thirds good
loam and one of peat. After having made a little headway, the leading
shoots should be pinched off, to induce a lateral growth; they may
be transferred to pots a size larger when the roots have filled the
first pot. Continue growing throughout the summer in frames or in the
greenhouse, near the glass, allowing plenty of air. Vigorous growth
should be checked; thus encouraging bushy plants.

    =A. albicans= (whitish-leaved).* _fl._ white, streaked with
    bluish-purple inside the tube, fragrant; petals longer than the
    tube. April. _l._ oblong, obtuse, densely tomentose on both
    surfaces, as well as the branches. _h._ 1-1/2ft. to 2ft. New South
    Wales, 1824.

    glandularly dotted with scabrous margins; young leaves and branches
    clothed with fine down. _h._ 4ft. to 6ft. New Holland, 1822.

=ANTHOLOMA= (from _anthos_, a flower, and _loma_, a fringe; in allusion
to the fringed or crenulated limb of the corolla). ORD. _TiliaceA|_. A
very fine greenhouse evergreen tree; it thrives best in a light loamy
soil, mixed with a little peat. Cuttings of ripened wood will strike
root in sand, under a hand glass.

    =A. montana= (mountain).* _fl._ white; corolla ovately cylindrical,
    with a crenate, rather toothed margin; racemes axillary, somewhat
    umbellate, reflexed. May. _l._ elliptical-oblong, leathery,
    stalked, scattered at the top of the branchlets. _h._ 20ft. New
    Caledonia, 1810.

=ANTHOLYZA= (from _anthos_, a flower, and _lyssa_, rage; in reference
to the opening of the flowers, which resemble the mouth of an enraged
animal). SYN. _Petamenes_. Including _Anisanthus_. ORD. _IrideA|_. A
very pretty genus of bulbous plants from the Cape of Good Hope, having
narrow, erect, Iris-like leaves, and flower-spikes that over-top the
foliage, bearing numerous bright-coloured flowers. Perianth tubular,
six-cleft, unequal, the upper segments longest; stamens three. The
species may be grown in a greenhouse, or planted out in a frame. They
also thrive excellently out of doors, and should be planted 8in. or
9in. deep for fear of frost, or have a winter protection of several
inches of cocoa-nut fibre refuse or litter. The safer plan is to
raise the roots, winter them in some dry part of the greenhouse; but,
previous to storing, divide the clumps, clean them, and re-plant or pot
in February, or early in March. A mixture of equal parts peat, sandy
loam, and leaf soil is most suitable for their culture. Just previous
to flowering, if in pots, frequent doses of weak manure water will be
found beneficial. They may be propagated by offsets, which are produced
in abundance, at almost any time. Seeds are sometimes procured, which
should be sown so soon as ripe, in light soil, in a cool house, where
they will germinate the following spring, and will be fit to plant out
in the summer of the same year. With the exception of _A. Cunonia_,
they all much resemble each other. Only four or five species of this
genus are worth cultivating.

_GramineA|_. A pretty native hardy perennial, of easy culture in common
garden soil.

[Illustration: FIG. 107. ANTHOXANTHUM ODORATUM.]

    =A. odoratum= (sweet). _fl._ panicle spiked, oblong, dense,
    becoming dullish yellow. _l._ short, pale green. _h._ 1ft. The
    pleasant smell of new-made Hay is chiefly owing to this plant,
    which in drying emits an odour similar to that of _Asperula
    odorata_. See Fig. 107.

=ANTHURIUM= (from _anthos_, a flower, and _oura_, a tail; referring
to the inflorescence). ORD. _AroideA|_. Flowers densely disposed on a
cylindrical spadix, at the base of which is a large bract-like spathe,
that ultimately bends backwards. Leaves of various shapes. This very
large genus of handsome stove and greenhouse plants is remarkable
both for the peculiar inflorescence and often noble leaves, and is
distinguished in structure from all the European members of the order
in the flowers being hermaphrodite. Fibry peat, loam, sphagnum, broken
crocks, or charcoal, and silver sand, form the most suitable compost.
In preparing the peat, it should be broken up into small lumps, and
then have most of the earthy matter knocked out of it by giving it a
few raps with a stick, or by shaking it about in a sieve. To this,
after so treated, add about one-fourth its bulk of sphagnum, and about
half its bulk of fibrous loam, and just a sprinkling of fresh broken
crocks, or small pieces of charcoal and sharp silver sand. In placing
them in the pots--A--which must be well drained--A--carefully spread out the
roots and work the mixture among them, keeping the plant well up, so
that when finished it stands clear above the rim of the pot at least
2in. or 3in., and forms a kind of mound or hillock. They must then be
kept freely syringed or watered, and placed in a moist atmosphere,
where they can enjoy a temperature ranging between 60deg. and 70deg.,
or a few degrees lower for the less tender species. Raising plants
from seed requires patience. About a year elapses from the time the
flowers are fertilised--A--which should be done artificially--before
the seed ripens, and often another to get up plants. Sow as soon as
ripe in shallow, well-drained pans or pots, filled with the potting
mixture, and cover slightly, and place in a close, moist propagating
case, where a temperature of from 75deg. to 85deg. is maintained, or
they may be covered with bell glasses. The principal thing is to keep
the air about them constantly humid, and the material in which they
are sown in a uniformly moist condition; if this is done, the young
seedlings will make their appearance in due course. When these are of
sufficient size to handle, they should be pricked off in the same sort
of compost, and be kept close and moist till they get a start, after
which gradually inure them to more air. January is the best month of
the year wherein to propagate these plants by divisions. This is done
by carefully turning them out of their pots and shaking out what soil
they have amongst their roots, which must be tenderly dealt with, so as
not to bruise or injure them. This done, they may then be pulled apart,
and as many plants made as there are separate crowns, or the mass may
be simply halved or quartered, according to the stock required. Treat
now as recommended above for potting. They are all moisture-loving
plants, and must have a copious supply of water at all times, although,
of course, much less during the winter than spring and summer months.
There is no season of the year when they can be handled for any purpose
with less risk or check than January. A moderate moist stove heat is
advisable for them generally. The species enumerated are selected from
nearly 150, and will be found to be a very representative collection.

    green, of a velvety lustre; midribs and veins light, forming a very
    pleasing contrast. Columbia, 1878. A very free grower.

    =A. Wildenowii= (Wildenow's). A synonym of _A. lanceolatum_.

    It may be here remarked that by far the majority of species
    enumerated in the _Supplement_ of Johnson's Dictionary are
    chiefly of botanical interest, and will, therefore, never become
    extensively cultivated.

=ANTHYLLIS= (from _anthos_, a flower, and _ioulos_, down; flowers
usually downy). Kidney Vetch. ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Herbaceous or
sub-shrubby plants, of variable habit. Flowers in spikes or heads;
calyx tubular, five toothed, permanent after flowering, more or less
inflated. Petals nearly equal. Although not extensively grown, all
the species are very beautiful when in flower, the hardy sorts being
admirably adapted for rockwork. The herbaceous perennials may be easily
propagated by seed or division. The seeds of the annual kinds should be
sown in a rather dry, warm situation in the open ground. The shrubby
evergreens will need the protection of a frame or cool greenhouse in
cold northern climates, and are best grown in a mixture of loam, sand,
and peat. Young cuttings of most species will root in a pot of sandy
soil, with a bell glass placed over them, in a cool house or frame.

    =A. Barba-Jovis= (Jupiter's beard).* _fl._ pale yellow, numerous,
    in globose, bracteate heads. March. _l._ pinnate, and are as well
    as the branches, clothed with silky tomentum; leaflets nine to
    thirteen, oblong-linear. _h._ 4ft. to 8ft. Spain, 1640. Shrub.

    =A. erinacea= (prickly).* _fl._ bluish-purple; heads few flowered,
    on short peduncles, bracteate. April. _l._ very few, oval, or
    oblong. _h._ 6in. to 12in. Spain, 1759. A much branched, spiny,
    almost leafless, and slow-growing species; hardy in a dry sunny
    position on the rockery. SYN. _Erinacea hispanica_.

    =A. HermanniA|= (Hermann's). _fl._ yellow; heads few flowered,
    nearly sessile in the axils of the upper leaves. April. _l._ almost
    sessile, simple, or trifoliate; leaflets oblong-cuneated, glabrous
    or clothed with adpressed pubescence. _h._ 2ft. to 4ft. Corsica,
    1739. Shrubby, much branched.

    =A. montana= (mountain).* _fl._ pink or purplish, in dense heads,
    on peduncles, with a leafy involucre. June. _l._ pinnate, and
    are as well as the branches, silky and hoary; leaflets numerous,
    oval-oblong, acute, small, entire. _h._ 3in. to 6in. Alps of
    Europe, 1769. A very handsome little rock plant, with a dwarf and
    tufted habit.

    =A. tetraphylla= (four-leaved). _fl._ white; heads axillary,
    sessile, few flowered. July. _l._ pinnate, the terminal leaflets
    ovate and large, the other three small and acute. South Europe,
    1640. A procumbent annual.

    =A. Vulneraria= (Common Woundwort).* _fl._ generally yellow,
    sometimes white, red, or pinkish, in crowded twin heads. Summer.
    _l._ pinnate, with five or more unequal leaflets; the lower ones
    smallest. An elegant native herbaceous, perennial, admirably
    adapted for rockwork. It is plentiful in most dry pastures. There
    are several varieties, the best of which is _alba_.

=ANTIARIS TOXICARIA.= This is the famous Upas tree of Java, from which
is obtained poison of a most deadly nature. It belongs to the NAT. ORD.
_UrticaceA|_.

=ANTIGONON= (from _anti_, against, or opposite, and _gonia_, an
angle). ORD. _PolygonaceA|_. Elegant stove climbers. Flowers racemose,
cirrhose at the apex of the rachides; petals five, three outer ones
broadly cordate, two inner oblong. Leaves alternate, cordate. Although
extremely handsome plants, they are difficult to flower. They seem to
succeed best when planted out in a very thoroughly drained border over
hot-water pipes or flues, the long climbing stems being trained near
the glass in full light.

    =A. amabile= (lovely).* _fl._ bright rose, profusely borne
    in axillary and terminal racemes. _l._ 3in. to 5in. long,
    ovate-cordate, and deeply lobed at the base. It is of free slender
    growth, the young shoots are pubescent, and having a slight reddish
    tinge. An exceedingly attractive and effective species.

    =A. guatemalensis= (Guatemala). Probably the same as _A. insigne_.

    =A. insigne= (remarkable).* _fl._ very numerous, borne in tufts
    along the sides of long racemes or panicles, which terminate in
    branched tendrils; the calyx, which is the showy part of the
    flower, has five membranous sepals, the three outer are of a
    beautiful rosy pink colour, about 1in. in length by rather less in
    breadth, cordate at the base, oblong, rounded towards the apex; the
    two inner sepals about the same length as the outer ones, but much
    narrower, falcate, lanceolate; pedicels 3/4in. long. _l._ broadly
    ovate oblong, deeply cordate at the base, with two rounded lobes;
    4in. by 3in., the upper ones smaller, supported on short terete
    downy stalks. Stems slender, angular, pubescent. Columbia, 1876.

    _A. leptopus_ (slender-stemmed). _fl._ numerous; the outer three
    sepals of a beautiful rose colour, the centre of a much deeper
    tint; racemes secund, bearing several coloured bracts as well as
    flowers, and end in a branched tendril. _l._ alternate, cordate,
    petiolate. Stem slender, sub-pubescent. Mexico, 1868.

=ANTIGRAMME.= _See_ =Scolopendrium=.

[Illustration: FIG. 113. ANTIRRHINUM CAPSULE, with Persistent Style.]

[Illustration: FIG. 114. ANTIRRHINUM ASARINA, showing Habit and Flower.]

=ANTIRRHINUM= (from _anti_, like, and _rhin_, a nose or snout; alluding
to the shape of the corolla). Snapdragon. ORD. _ScrophulariaceA|_.
Hardy herbaceous plants. Flowers in terminal racemes, or solitary and
axillary; corolla personate; tube ample, saccate at the base; lobes
of the upper lip erect; lower lip spreading, having the middle lobes
smaller than the lateral ones, with an ample bearded palate, which
closes the throat. Seed pod or capsule two-celled, upper cell bursting
by one pore, lower by two many-toothed pores. See Fig. 113. Leaves
entire, rarely lobed. The genus contains several very handsome species,
suitable for borders and the rockery, while innumerable varieties have
originated from _A. majus_, which are very popular, and extremely
useful for bedding purposes; these may be increased by cuttings or
seeds; if it is desired to increase certain colours or varieties,
the former is the only sure method to adopt. They should be taken in
September, when they will readily root in a cold frame, or under a
hand glass, or they may be rapidly propagated in gentle heat in spring.
Seeds should be sown in July or August, when they will produce good
plants by the following season; or if sown in March in warmth, the
plants will bloom late in the same year. The "Tom Thumb" strain is
especially desirable for bedding, being very dwarf and free. All the
other species may be increased by cuttings and seeds treated in the
same way. Light soil, well enriched with manure, is most suitable for
all of them, especially for the varieties of _A. majus_.

    Pyrenees, 1752. A very pretty plant, which should have a warm
    position on the rockery. _A. sempervirens_ comes close to this
    species.

    =A. siculum= (Sicilian). _fl._ in loose racemes; corolla hardly
    1in. long, white or yellowish, rarely purple; tube rather hairy;

    Italy.

=ANTONIA.= A synonym of =Rhynchoglossum= (which _see_).

=ANTROPHYUM= (from _antron_, a cavern, and _phuo_, to grow; referring
to its place of growth). Including _PolytA|nium_. ORD. _Filices_.
A small genus of stove ferns, very rarely seen in cultivation,
all with simple fronds, of firm but fleshy texture, and copious,
uniform, hexagonal areolA|. Sori carried along the veins, imperfectly
reticulated. For culture, &c., _see_ =Ferns=.

    =A. cayennense= (Cayenne). _sti._ 1in. to 4in. long. _fronds_ 6in.
    to 9in. long, 1in. to 1-1/2in. broad, lanceolate-oblong, narrowed
    at both ends; edge thickened, entire; areolA| half as broad as long.

    1/2in. broad, narrowed very gradually from the centre to the base,
    very acute at the apex, very thick; areolA| very long and narrow,
    distinctly raised on the upper surface. _sori_ quite immersed,
    sometimes confluent. Himalayas, &c.

    =A. lanceolatum= (lance-leaved).* _fronds_ 1ft. or more long,

    narrowed very gradually to the base; areolA| two or three times as
    long as broad, about three rows between the midrib and the edge.
    _sori_ slender, superficial, often joining. West Indies, southwards
    to New Grenada, 1793.

=ANTS= (_FormicidA|_). Well-known pests, easily distinguished from
all other insects. There are a great number of species, differing
more or less in habits; but, as a rule, they dwell underground in
communities, and construct extensive ant-cities, which are occupied
by three classes--the neuters or workers (by far the most numerous),
the males, and the females. There are often, in addition to these,
larger and stronger neuters, known as the "soldiers," or defenders
of the community. Ants have a long, slender body, supported on long
and slender legs. The head bears a pair of elbowed horns or antennA|,
constantly waving about and touching everything the insect comes
across. They have powerful mandibles for cutting, sawing, and biting,
and it is with these instruments that Ants do mischief in gardens. The
winged males and females become mature in summer, and on a warm day
they ascend in a body into the air; after a short time, they fall to
the ground, the females at once free themselves from the henceforth
useless wings, and begin to form new colonies. Vast numbers of eggs
are laid, from which issue larvA|, and these soon become pupA|, and
then perfect Ants. Some kinds are injurious from their habit (in some
species) of collecting aphides together, and farming them for the
sake of the honey secreted by the aphides, and that passes out from
their honey-tubes (thus helping to perpetuate the stock of these most
injurious insects); and also from the mechanical damage they do in
pots, and other receptacles for plants. They likewise cause unsightly
hills on lawns and paths, and the large black species that live in
decayed wood often injure the framing of greenhouses, &c., when the
woodwork has become somewhat decayed. Where fruit, such as peaches
or wall pears, are grown, Ants will at times inflict damage, and,
therefore, they should be kept away; but this is a comparatively easy
matter, as the placing of an obnoxious substance along the base of
the walls and around the stems of the trees will deter them. For the
extirpation of Ants from indoors, the Arsenical solution described
below is most efficacious, but it is extremely dangerous.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Lime._ Air-slaked lime plentifully dusted, in warm, dry, weather, over
and around the hills and other places infested, will cause the Ants to
vacate them in a short time. A thick chalk line drawn round a smooth
tree, or across an upright board or post, will render it impassable.

_Arsenic._ This must be used with the utmost caution, as it is a poison
most fatal to animal life. Recipe: 1oz. of ordinary arsenic is placed
in an old iron pot with a quart of water, and then boiled until reduced
to a pint or a little more of liquid, to which is added 1/2lb. of
coarse sugar. This mixture can either be dropped about the runs and
around the nests, or placed in saucers in the Ants' haunts.

_Ferrocyanide of Potassium._ This is also very dangerous: Ferrocyanide
of potassium, 1dr.; raspings of quassia, 1dr.; and enough sugar to form
a syrup. Use in the same way as the preceding.

_Calomel and Sugar._ Mix together one part of calomel and ten parts
of finely-powdered loaf sugar, and lay it in little heaps about their
nests and runs; the Ants will eat it and die. Spring is the best season
for this method.

_Guano_, when fresh, if sprinkled on and around their quarters, is said
to be efficacious in driving them away.

_Camphor._ If a piece of camphor, about the size of a filbert, be
placed in two quarts of hot water, and this, when cool enough, applied
to pot or other plants infested with Ants, the insects will be driven
off without injury to the plants.

_Bones._ Lay a quantity of partially-picked boiled bones in the haunts,
and they will be quickly covered with insects. As soon as this occurs,
throw the bones into hot water. Before laying them down again, let
all superfluous moisture drain off. This is a cheap remedy, and, if
persisted in, is very effectual.

_Carbolic Acid._ This, if of good strength, diluted with about ten or
twelve times its bulk of water, and well sprinkled over paths or other
places where there is no vegetation, will keep the Ants away. It has,
however, an objectionable smell.

_Paraffin Oil._ Paraffin, mixed with six times its bulk of water, and
sprinkled over the nests every few days, will kill and drive away Ants;
but the smell is disagreeable.

_Quassia._ 4oz. of quassia chips, boiled in a gallon of water for about
ten minutes, and 4oz. of soap added to the liquor as it cools, if used
like the preceding, is fairly effectual; but this, like the other
remedies, must be persisted in for some time.

Fly pans or saucers, nearly filled with thin honey or sweet oil,
attract Ants, and they are drowned in them. Ants are very hard to clear
effectually out of a place, and therefore it is very desirable, in all
attempts to be rid of them, to persist in the above remedies. When
not living close to the roots or stems of plants, the best and surest
remedy of all is to flood them out or scald them in with boiling water.
The specifics are endless, but the best are mentioned above.

=ANTWERP HOLLYHOCK.= _See_ =AlthA|a ficifolia=.

=AOTUS= (from _a_, without, and _ous_, an ear; in allusion to the
absence of appendages in the calyx, which distinguishes it from its
allied genus, _PultenA|a_). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Elegant little greenhouse
evergreen shrubs, with yellow flowers, and simple, linear-subulate
leaves, revolute at the margins, alternate or nearly opposite, or three
in a whorl. They should be grown in a compost of equal parts loam,
sand, and peat, with a little charcoal, and the pots should be well
drained. Cuttings of half-ripened wood, made in April, root freely in
sand, under a bell glass.

    =A. gracillima= (most slender).* _fl._ yellow and crimson, small,
    on long, dense, graceful spikes, which are often over a foot long;
    pedicels short. May. _h._ 3ft. New Holland, 1844. A very pretty
    slender growing shrub.

    =A. villosa= (soft-haired). _fl._ axillary, disposed in racemose
    spikes along the branches; calyx silky. April. _l._ smoothish on
    the upper surface. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. New Holland, 1790.

=APEIBA= (the native name in Guiana.) ORD. _TiliaceA|_. Very handsome
stove evergreen trees or shrubs, clothed with starry down. Flowers
large, golden yellow, pedunculate, bracteate. Capsule spherical,
depressed, rough from rigid bristles. Leaves broad, alternate, entire
or serrate. They thrive in a mixture of loam and peat. The best way
to induce them to flower in this country is by cutting a ring round
the bark of a large branch; by this means the growth is stopped. Well
ripened cuttings should be planted in sand in heat, under a bell glass,
which should be tilted occasionally, so as to give a little air to the
cuttings, otherwise they are apt to damp off.

    =A. aspera= (rough).* _fl._ golden yellow; peduncles opposite the
    leaves, branched, many flowered. May. _l._ ovate-oblong, somewhat
    cordate, quite entire, smooth. _h._ 30ft. to 40ft. Guiana, 1792.

    =A. Petoumo= (Petoumo). _fl._ yellow, similarly disposed to
    _A. aspera_. August. _fr._ densely clothed with bristles. _l._
    ovate-oblong, somewhat cordate at the base, entire, hoary beneath.
    _h._ 40ft. Guiana, 1817.

    =A. Tibourbou= (Tibourbou).* _fl._ dark yellow. August. _fr._
    densely clothed with bristles. _l._ cordate, ovate-oblong,
    serrated, hairy beneath. _h._ 10ft. Guiana, 1756.

=APETALOUS.= Without petals.

=APEX.= The summit or point of anything.

=APHELANDRA= (from _apheles_, simple, and _aner_, a male; the anthers
being one-celled). ORD. _AcanthaceA|_. Very handsome stove evergreen
shrubs, mostly of an erect habit of growth, and having handsome shining
leaves, which in some instances are variegated. Flowers produced in
terminal four-sided spikes-A--the preponderating colours being brilliant
shades of orange or scarletA---conspicuously situated above the foliage;
they are exceedingly attractive; corolla ringent, two-lipped, upper
lip three-lobed; central lobe large. They bloom generally during the
autumn months, and if the plants are removed to a warm dry atmosphere
so soon as the flowers begin to open, they will continue much longer
in perfection than if left in the moisture-laden atmosphere of the
stove. From the time the flower spikes are at first seen till they
bloom, the plants will derive much benefit from frequent applications
of clear manure water. When the plants have finished flowering, they
should be allowed to rest, by reducing the supply of water, but never
allow them to shrivel. During this time they may be kept in a house or
pit, where the atmosphere is rather dry, with a night temperature of
50deg. to 55deg. Here they may remain till March, when they should be
pruned. This operation is commenced by thinning out the weakest shoots
altogether, and cutting the others back to one or two of the strongest
joints or buds above the old wood in order to keep the plants dwarf and
bushy. When pruned, the plants should be placed in the stove, giving
moderate supplies of water at the roots, and occasionally sprinkling
the stems overhead till growth commences. When the young shoots have
attained an inch or so in length, the plants should be turned out of
the pots, removing the crocks and as much of the old soil as can be
got away easily, at the same time shortening-in any of the straggling
roots. They should then be placed into smaller-sized pots, keeping
them rather close, and watering them carefully for a time till growth
has commenced. When fairly started, they may be transferred into
larger-sized pots, in which they are to flower. During the summer,
these plants require a moist atmosphere, with a temperature of 65deg.
by night, allowing it to rise 15deg. or 20deg. by day, and whilst
active growth is taking place they should be frequently supplied with
moisture at the roots, keeping them well exposed on all sides to the
light. After growth has commenced, it is not advisable to stop the
shoots, for the stouter and stronger they grow up the finer will be the
flower spikes when they appear. The compost should consist of equal
parts fibry loam, leaf soil, and peat, with a good proportion of sand
added. In preparing it, it should be rather lumpy, and, before using,
should be warmed to about the temperature of the house in which the
plants are grown. Clean pots and perfect drainage are most essential.
Cuttings are best prepared from half ripened wood, or taken off when
young with a heel. The base of each cutting should invariably be cut
clean across. These may be inserted an inch apart, in pots of sandy
soil, and plunged in a brisk bottom heat. To obtain young shoots for
cuttings, if the old plants break freely after pruning, and very large
specimens are not required, when the shoots are 2in. long they should
be thinned out, leaving the requisite number of the strongest to form
the plant. If the surplus pieces are removed with a slight heel of the
older wood, they make good cuttings, and should be treated the same
as the others. These cuttings strike root quickest, and when rooted,
if potted into 5in. or 6in. pots, and allowed to grow up without
stopping or pinching out the tops, they will flower the first season.
Although Aphelandras can be grown into large sized specimens, it will
be found to be more generally satisfactory to have specimens of neat
and moderate dimensions. The mealy bug and scale insects are very
troublesome, and must be kept down, otherwise they will prove most
prejudicial to the plants.

    on the upper surface, dark vinous purple underneath. _h._ 2ft. to
    3ft. Columbia, 1867.

    =A. Porteana= (Porte's).* _fl._ in fine terminal heads; corolla and
    bracts bright orange. _l._ rich green, with metallic silvery-white
    veins. _h._ 2ft. Brazil, 1854.

    others.

    =A. punctata= (dotted).* _fl._ bright yellow, in large and rather
    dense spikes; the spiny-edged long pointed bracts are also yellow,
    with the exception of the tip, which is green, and forms a pleasing
    contrast. November. _l._ opposite, elliptic, acuminate; the green
    midrib is conspicuous in the middle of a white central band, which
    also extends beside the green veins, this silvery band breaking up

    green with white veins. _h._ 1-1/2ft. Brazil.

=APHELEXIS= (from _apheles_, simple, and _exis_, habit). ORD.
_CompositA|_. A genus of elegant dwarf evergreen greenhouse shrubs.
Flower-heads large, solitary, or small and two or more together. Leaves
small. These plants are valuable for exhibition purposes, on account of
their bright colours, and the length of time they last in perfection;
they are included among what are familiarly known as "everlastings."
The most suitable soil is a compost of two parts of good fibrous peat
and one of leaf mould, with a liberal supply of silver sand, and a few
pieces of charcoal added to it. Repot the plants firmly in February,
and allow thorough drainage. Cuttings can be made in spring or summer;
small half-ripened side shoots are best; and these will root in sandy
soil, under a bell glass, in a cool greenhouse.

    =A. ericoides= (heath-like).* _fl.-heads_ white. April. _l._ very
    small, three-cornered, imbricated, appressed; branches numerous,
    very fine, filiform. _h._ 1ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1796.

    =A. fasciculata= (fascicled). _fl.-heads_ purplish, solitary,
    terminal; peduncles scaly. March. _l._ acerose linear, roundish,
    downy above; lower spreading; upper appressed. _h._ 2ft. Cape of
    Good Hope, 1779. There are two or three forms of this species,
    varying in the colour of the flowers.

    =A. humilis= (humble, or dwarf).* _fl.-heads_ pink, solitary,
    terminal, opening only in sunshine; peduncles scaly. April. _l._
    subulate, erect, imbricate. Branches numerous, slender, covered
    with white tomentum. _h._ 2ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1810. A handsome
    greenhouse plant, with much-branched stems, terminated by the
    flower-head. SYNS. _A. macrantha_ and _Helipterum humile_.

    =A. h. grandiflora= (large-flowered).* _fl.-heads_ rosy-purple,
    produced in great abundance. Habit rather dwarf, and free
    branching. Very highly esteemed.

    =A. h. purpurea= (purple).* _fl._ dark purple, very abundant. _l._
    silvery white and shining. A vigorous grower, and perhaps the best
    for exhibition purposes. It is known in gardens as _A. macrantha
    purpurea_; also under the name of _A. spectabilis_.

    =A. h. rosea= (rose-coloured).* _fl.-heads_ delicate rose, very
    profuse. Habit very compact and free-branching. A very showy and
    desirable variety, known in gardens as _A. macrantha rosea_.

    =A. macrantha= (large-flowered). Synonymous with _A. humilis_.

    =A. sesamoides= (Sesamum-like). _fl.-heads_ purple and white,
    sessile, solitary, terminal. April. _l._ acerose linear, keeled,
    smooth, appressed. _h._ 2ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1739.

=APHIDES=, or =PLANT LICE=. These belong to the order _Homoptera_,
meaning "same winged," and the name has reference to the fact that
the fore wings are uniform in their structure from base to apex, not
divided into a leathery base and a membranous tip. Aphides are all
minute in size, soft bodied, and generally long legged; the mouth is
furnished with a curiously-constructed beak, or rostrum, for sucking
the juice of plants; the antennA|, or feelers, are long and slender; the
legs have usually two joints in the tarsi, one of which is generally
very ill-developed; and near the tip of the abdomen, on the back of a
ring, in many kinds, stand two prominent tubes, called honey-tubes,
from which a sweet secretion, much sought after by ants, is emitted.
They are very destructive, and nearly every plant has its own peculiar
Aphis; but among the worst are the cherry fly and bean fly. All these
insects are very destructive to the young shoots and foliage of plants,
on which they cluster in large numbers, sometimes completely hiding
the stems, increasing with marvellous rapidity. They produce eggs in
autumn, which lie dormant through the winter, and upon the approach of
warm weather in spring, hatch and produce individuals which, during
the summer, are viviparous, budding off young insects at a surprising
rate, which quickly in turn become possessed of the same marvellous
power; hence the enormous number which are produced in so surprisingly
short a time. It has been computed that in a few weeks many millions
of young might be produced directly or descended from a single female.

The following remedies may be successfully employed:

_Tobacco._ This is applied, as a rule, in three forms, each of which
is useful for particular purposes. Tobacco powder is useful as a
dry application to plants where, from any cause, the other modes of
employing it are not desirable. It causes no smell, and is useful in
conservatories, &c., for that reason. The mode of applying it is to
dredge or dust it over the foliage of the plants affected, and to
syringe off in from three to thirty hours, according to the nature of
the plants. Fumigation with tobacco, if done in a proper way, is very
effective, but it leaves an unpleasant smell. The foliage of the plants
should be quite dry, and a still day must be chosen for the work; the
house should be filled with smoke, but no flame must arise in the
burning. The plants should be well syringed the next morning, and full
ventilation allowed; if the fumigation is repeated twice or thrice, it
will prove very effectual. Tobacco water is made by soaking a pound of
coarse shag in 6gals. of hot water, to which 1/2lb. of size or soft
soap has been added. The plants should be dipped into or syringed with
this mixture, and well syringed with clean tepid water about twelve
hours after. It should not be employed for plants having woolly or
hairy foliage. Tobacco paper and cloth are used for fumigating in
the same manner as tobacco; but as they vary in strength, more care
is necessary, as they sometimes cause the leaves to become spotted.
Judiciously employed, they are cheaper than Tobacco.

_Quassia._ Boil 1lb. quassia chips in 4gals. of soft water, for about
ten minutes, and after straining off the chips, add 1lb. of soft soap.
Apply in the same way as Tobacco water, and syringe the plants with
clean water after ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.

_Soft Soap._ This, in proportion of 8lb. to 12gals. of rain water, and
1gal. of tobacco water added after it is cold, is a cheap and good
remedy out of doors, and requires the same mode of application as
tobacco water.

_Soap Suds._ Where bleaching powder, or much soda, is not mixed with
these, they make a good insect killer for hard-foliaged plants, but
should be washed off with clean water in twelve hours. No mixture
containing chloride of lime should be used.

_Various._ Fir-tree Oil, Gishurst's Compound, and Fowler's Insecticide,
are all serviceable, if used as directed on the labels. Hardeman's
Beetle Powder, applied with the little French powder-bellows which is
sold with it, is very efficacious. For outdoor work, nothing surpasses
clean cold water, applied often and forcibly with a syringe.

The best mode of clearing Aphis off Beaus, Currants, &c., is to remove
the tops of the infested shoots, and to wash the plants with soapy
water, or a solution of Gishurst's Compound. In some cases, a good
dusting with soot and wood ashes, while the plants are wet, will keep
them in check. The "Golden Eyes" or "Lacewing" fly, and also ladybirds,
are to be encouraged, as the larvA| of each of these wage incessant war
against Aphides, especially the green varieties, and thin them out
considerably.

ORD. _ApocynaceA|_. Dog's Bane. Perennial erect herbs, with cymose
flowers and membranous, opposite leaves. There are several species
belonging to this genus, but only the one described below is worthy of

=APONOGETON= (from _apon_, Celtic for water, and _geiton_, neighbour;
alluding to the habitat of these plants). ORD. _NaiadaceA|_. Very
ornamental aquatic perennials. There are several species, but _A.
distachyon_ is superior to the others. This species may be cultivated
in small tanks or aquaria; it delights in an abundance of light and
air, and is perfectly hardy, having become naturalised in many parts
of the country. Pot the plants in rich sandy loam and rotten cow
manure, using, of course, small pots, if the vessel in which it is to
be grown is restricted. When introducing it to large tanks or lakes,
commence with strong, previously well-established plants, in large
pots, breaking the latter when the plants are immersed. Place them in
positions where the water is about 1ft. 6in. to 2ft. deep; they will
then rapidly increase by offsets and seeds, and, when established, will
flower nearly all the year round. The other kinds will thrive with the
same treatment; but they are neither so hardy nor so vigorous, and
should only be grown in small tanks or aquaria.

[Illustration: FIG. 121. APPLE BLOSSOM.]

=APPLE= (_Pyrus Malus_). The Apple is one of the most useful, and
probably most largely cultivated, of our hardy fruits. It is known
as the Crab in its wild state, and is indigenous to Britain and to
all the temperate and warmer parts of Europe. It is supposed that the
progenitors of the varieties now grown were introduced to this country
at various times from the Continent, and not obtained here as direct
improvements on the native Crab. Those now cultivated are extremely
numerous, and include good varieties that can be made to prolong the
season all the year round. Apart from its great value as a fruit, the
apple is a strikingly handsome tree when in flower (see Fig. 121). A
fruiting branch is shown at Fig. 122.

[Illustration: FIG. 122. FRUITING BRANCH OF APPLE.]

_Propagation._ Seeds are sown extensively, chiefly for raising stocks
to graft approved sorts on; also with a view to raising new varieties.
The seeds do not retain their germinative properties very long,
consequently they must be sown soon after being taken from the fruit.
As grown in this country, they are generally sown in the autumn,
transplanted the following year, and so on until they are of sufficient
size for Grafting purposes. The standard of excellence being at present
so high, improved forms raised from seed are comparatively scarce.

_Grafting._ This method of propagation is the one generally adopted
for most purposes, the stocks being previously prepared for size or
height of tree required. Cordon and other dwarf-trained trees should be
worked near but not below the ground, while standards are best worked
on stocks of the desired height. The practice of working standard trees
low, and growing the scion to form the stem of the future tree, is not
recommended, as many of the tenderer sorts will not grow straight or
strong enough for the purpose. Whip-grafting is the most preferable
mode adopted. The scions should be selected from healthy trees not
later than January, and laid in singly in the ground until the stocks
have slightly advanced in growth, which is generally about the middle
of April. Several other methods of Grafting may be adopted with
success, but the one above recommended is considered the best.

_Budding._ Apples may be successfully propagated by Budding, and
this method is practised much more now than formerly. It has many
advantages, as it requires to be performed at a season when there is
not so much work in hand. It should be done in damp, dull weather, if
possible, as the weather if dry soon destroys the buds. July and August
is the proper time for the purpose. The stocks and woods from which the
buds are taken should be as much as possible in the same condition.

_Propagation by Cuttings, Layers, &c._ This system may be made use
of in the case of new varieties or where it is desired to increase
any one variety with a limited number of scions, but the results are
uncertain--at least in the case of cuttings; consequently, it is much
better to resort to the safer method of Grafting.

_Pruning._ _See_ =Pruning=.

_Training._ _See_ =Training=.

_Planting._ The best time to plant is as soon as most of the leaves
have fallen, which is generally about the end of October. The roots
being then in an active state, and the ground still retaining a certain
amount of heat, they will form new roots before winter, which is a
material advantage. Where it is impossible to plant at this time, it
may be done in suitable weather any time during the winter, but it
is best not deferred till spring. It is important in planting that
the soil should be moderately dry and free from frost; this condition
cannot always be obtained during winter. The effects of soil and
situation have a very important bearing on the Apple, specimens of
the same sort from different places being often hardly recognisable.
Although not over fastidious in the matter of soil as far as growing
is concerned, the best results are obtained where it is of a rich
loamy character and well drained. Dry, sandy soils invariably produce
canker, while the trees are often overgrown with lichens in undrained
land. The addition of heavier loam, or sometimes trenching and mixing
the sub-soil with that at the top, will convert light soils into those
suitable for Apple culture; while, on the other hand, heavy soils
may be improved by drainage, the addition of lime, vegetable refuse,
burnt earth, and other matters. Rank manure should on no account be
used anywhere near the roots, but a little well-decayed manure, mixed
with the soil or used as a mulching, is beneficial. The site best
suited is an open, though not exposed one, with a south, south-east,
or south-west aspect. Shelter from north-east winds in spring, which
destroys the bloom, and from west and south-west winds in autumn, which
blow down the fruit, should be the aim of cultivators. Planting in a
valley should be avoided on account of spring frosts. In Planting,
care must be taken to make the bottom of the hole tolerably firm, and
slightly raised under the base or bole of the tree. The roots should
then be carefully spread out all round, and if any have been ruptured
in transplanting, cut them clean off on the upper side, thus inducing
new roots to be formed near the surface. The soil should be trodden
firmly after a quantity has been filled in, if it is in a dry, suitable
condition, as previously recommended. Secure with stakes in proportion
to the size of tree, or injury will be caused by the wind. The distance
at which Apple trees are planted varies considerably. Standards in
orchards may be planted in good soil, from 20ft. to 40ft. apart,
especially if they are strong-growing culinary sorts. Pyramids may be
planted from 5ft. to 15ft., according to size; and similar distances
will suit Bush trees. The oblique Cordon system of training admits of
a large number of varieties being cultivated in a small space, as they
may be planted as close as 18in. or 2ft. apart. Horizontal Cordons
should be planted about 5ft. asunder, and one branch trained each way.
Watering will be necessary after planting in most cases, especially
should the winter and following season be at all dry. Thinning the
fruit is sometimes advisable for obtaining good specimens, but it is
not generally necessary, at least with many of the shy-setting sorts.
If, however, the crop should be exceptionally heavy, it is best to thin
the fruit, or the tree may be unable to make and ripen its wood for the
crop of the succeeding year.

_Gathering._ The three following tests are sure indications of the
gathering period: (1) The apples will begin to fall of their own
accord; (2) their seeds will be plump and brown in colour; and (3) the
fruit will separate with a mere touch from the trees; the second test
may be said to be infallible. All Apples should be gathered before
the end of October, for none will bear frost with impunity. They must
be gathered in dry weather, and handled with the greatest care, laid
gently in baskets and trays, in single file only, and conveyed to the
store room.

_Storing._ The simplest and best method is in choosing or forming some
room or place free from extremes of heat and cold, dryness or damp,
where a temperature of about 45deg. is maintained. A current of air is
not necessary. The shelves should be made of poplar, sycamore, lime, or
other white wood. Deal, oak, ash, elm, and almost all other woods, give
a bad taste to the fruit. One sheet of paper--and paper only--should be
placed under the fruit. They ripen best, and are of the highest flavour
when left fully exposed to the free atmosphere of the fruit room, and
in order to preserve a more even temperature the light should be shut
out. Early and late ripening varieties must be stored in separate
places, as well as all inferior or injured fruit. The plan of isolating
each fruit by packing in tissue paper, sand, burnt earth, or other
substances, often destroys the flavour of the fruit, and possesses no
material benefit otherwise.

=APPLE BERRY.= _See_ =Billardiera=.

=APPLE-BLOSSOM WEEVIL= (_Anthonomus pomorum_). This is a small beetle
of a reddish-brown colour, with three inconspicuous stripes of a paler
colour behind the head; the wing cases show a large pitchy-coloured
blotch, with oblique striA| and yellowish spots thereon. The female
busily engages herself in piercing the flower buds; while the male may
be usually seen flying about the trees during the breeding season,
which, of course, varies according to the earlier or later expansion
of the buds. The female, by means of strong jaws at the end of the
long proboscis, bores a hole in the bud, in which she lays a single
egg, finally closing the opening, then passing on to other buds. The
laying season lasts for two or three weeks, or, indeed, as long as the
buds remain unexpanded; eggs are never laid in open blossoms. In warm
weather, the eggs are hatched in six or seven days, usually about the
end of April, into small, white, legless maggots, which feed upon the
stamens and pistil; hence, although the petals are normally coloured,
and expand, the flowers ultimately wither, and in some seasons very
serious consequences have arisen from these injurious little pests. The
maggot is fleshy, whitish, with a few hairs and a black, hard head; in
a few days, it turns into a brown chrysalis or pupa, which, in turn,
is changed into the Weevil, only about a month having elapsed from the
deposition of the egg till the Weevil is developed. It feeds upon the
foliage during summer, and hybernates in crannies of the bark, or under
the soil at the base of the trees, during winter, waking up in the
following spring to go through the same performances as its parents.

_Remedies._ Some of the methods advised for the extirpation of the
American Blight will prove very useful for the destruction of this
pest. Clear away all useless portions of the bark and rubbish round
about the tree during the winter, and many will be destroyed. Place
bandages of tarred cloth around the stem in spring; this will prevent
the females crawling up, as they seldom fly. If a white cloth is placed
beneath the tree affected when in bud, and the tree is severely shaken,
a large number will be caught, as the Weevil falls to the ground when
alarmed. Timely thinning of the trees, allowing the free admission of
light and air, is also a very effectual preventive, as it has been
proved that the greatest ravages are committed where neglect of this
has been the rule; and that, on the other hand, in proportion to its
being done, the pest has been lessened in numbers.

=APPLE MUSSEL SCALE= (_Aspidiotus conchiformis_). This insect attacks
the bark of Apple and Pear-trees. It is in outward appearance like the
half of a mussel shell. Under the scale is the insect. It is closely
allied to the true scale insects, and has similar habits. The scales
are about 1/8in. long, brown, and wider at one end than at the other.
The female is like a fat, green, fleshy maggot, without jointed limbs.
The eggs of this curious insect are not laid, but simply remain in the
body of the mother until she dies, thus leaving a protecting shield or
case from which the hatched larvA| emerge. To get rid of this insect,
therefore, the females containing eggs should be destroyed. It differs
from most other species in the absence of the long tail filaments. If
numerous, this Scale causes the trees to become sickly and unfruitful.
It is difficult to extirpate.

_Soft-soap Lather._ When the leaves fall, in autumn, the trees should
be treated with a stiff sash-tool, and all the Scale rubbed off,
keeping the brush just moist, and not rubbing the buds. Applied for two
seasons, this should clear the trees. All loose bark should be removed.

_Seal Oil_ is sometimes recommended as a good remedy: but oils are
rather unsafe applications to the bark of trees, especially of the
young branches.

[Illustration: FIG. 127. CODLIN MOTH AND GRUB (CARPOCAPSA POMONANA).]

=APPLE OR CODLIN GRUB= (_Carpocapsa pomonana_). During the month of
May, the well-known Codlin Moth (see Fig. 127) lays its eggs in the
calyces, usually one in each, of the young, quickly-growing apple.
The moth itself is a small insect; the fore-wings are grey, prettily
speckled with delicate, darker streaks, and with a curved golden mark
on the hinder part, inclosing one of a reddish-brown colour. The hind
wings are usually dark, as is also the body. The caterpillar, when
hatched, is white, with black head and neck, and with four rows of
black marks along the whole body. The colours soon, however, become
less decided, taking an indistinct brownish or grey hue. After being
hatched, the caterpillar gnaws its way down the fruit, keeping clear
of the core, and gradually forces its gallery towards the rind of the
fruit, which it finally pierces, the opening serving as the outlet for
the dirt. When nearly full grown, it pierces the core and feeds upon
the pips, which injury speedily causes the fruit to drop. The insect
then emerges therefrom, and finds a suitable shelter in a cranny of the
bark, where it spins a cocoon; and, according to British authorities,
it remains in the larval state for some weeks, finally assuming the
chrysalis form, and thus passing the winter; the moth emerges the
following season. Shortly after development, the moths pair, the female
depositing eggs in the fruit in June or July, according to the season.

Practically, there is no preventive; but the following hints will serve
to greatly reduce the numbers. All apples that fall ere they are ripe
should be picked up as promptly as possible, and be given to the pigs;
or pigs should be turned into the orchard to clear off the fallen
fruit. The following is the only serviceable remedy:

_Hayband Trap._ This is simply a loosely made hayband twisted around
the stems of the trees, about 1ft. from the ground. The grubs, in
searching for a suitable place in which to make a cocoon, will
generally choose the bands. At the end of the season, all the haybands
should be collected and burnt, and the stems of the trees from which
they were removed should be cleared of any cocoons which may adhere to
them. All loose bark and other rubbish should be removed from the tree
trunks, and also from the ground below.

=APPLE OR CODLIN GRUB TRAP.= An exceedingly ingenious and effective
method of alluring that obnoxious pest, the Apple Grub. The trap (Fig.
128) consists of two, three, or more thin pieces of board, 12in. to
20in. in length, and 2in. to 4in. wide, with a screw (_a_) through
their centre. The screw must be long enough to be firmly driven into
the trunk of the tree, so as to hold the boards in position. Small
slips of wood (_b_) are inserted between the boards, to keep them
sufficiently open to allow of the entry of the grubs, as shown at _d_.
The boards are cut on each side of the screw, as at _c_, to facilitate
their separation when fastened together by the silken threads of the
grubs, and to better expose the latter when the trap is opened. This
handy trap, which is of American origin, is very cheap. A great number
of them may be collected with little trouble, submitted to a killing
heat, and replaced again; and they can be used either on the ground or
on the trees. As regards killing the grubs when caught, Mr Weir, the
inventor, says: "The quickest and best way is to have a large tin pan,
bent in on one side, so as to fit closely to the trunk of the tree.
When you reach the tree, drop upon your knees, place the depression in
the pan against the trunk of the tree, hold it there by pressing your
body against it, and you have both hands free to open the trap. When
opening it, many of the pupA| or chrysalids will fall into the pan. The
trap must be turned clear around, as many will be found between it and
the bark. A person will open and kill the worms in from four hundred to
eight hundred traps in a day."

=APRICOT= (_Armeniaca vulgaris_). The Apricot, or, as it was formerly
written, "Abricock," is a much esteemed and luscious fruit. It is said
to have been introduced into this country during the reign of Henry
VIII. The Apricot is one of the earliest flowering of fruit-trees (see
Fig. 129), and is generally in bloom during February. This fact is a
great drawback, as it is a difficult matter to save the flowers from
destruction by the spring winds and frosts. The fruit (see Fig. 130)
contains less acid than most stone fruits, and in appearance it is
perhaps the handsomest of all. Success with its culture in many gardens
is by no means certain, but with careful preparation of borders and
protection of the flowers in spring, satisfactory results are often
obtained. Large quantities of fruit are annually imported to this
country from France; but their quality and flavour cannot be compared
with that of good home-grown produce.

[Illustration: FIG. 129. BLOSSOM OF APRICOT.]

_Propagation_ is effected by seeds or budding. The stones, selected
from the best varieties, may be sown as soon as the fruit is ripe, in
August or September, in light rich soil, and covered with about 2in.
of earth, over which a little litter should be spread during winter.
After one season's growth, the plants should be lifted, and the tap
roots slightly cut back if the trees are intended for walls. They
should then be planted in nursery lines, allowing about a yard between
the rows, and 2ft. from plant to plant.

[Illustration: FIG. 130. FRUITING BRANCH OF APRICOT.]

Budding is the most general mode of propagating Apricots. They
are frequently budded from the beginning to the middle of June on
seedling, and also on plum stocks, of which latter the Mussell, Saint
Julien, Brussels, and Black Damson are the best. For dwarf trees, the
stock should be budded about 1ft. from the ground. There are many
disadvantages in having a great length of stem. "Rider" trees require
a stem from 3-1/2ft. to 6ft.; half-riders, 2-1/2ft. to 3ft. Grafting
by the Whip method is sometimes employed, but, for many reasons, it is
much inferior to Budding.

_Planting, &c._ South-west and western aspects suit the Apricot best,
but the fruit has been ripened in warm localities on walls facing
several points north. Large areas of garden wall (see Figs. 131 and
132), the walls of stables, barns, outbuildings, and two sides of at
least hundreds of cottages, might thus be utilised for the cultivation
of this tree. If well drained, almost any garden soil will bring these
fruits to perfection; light, fibrous, rather sandy loam will, however,
prove most satisfactory. There should be a considerable depth of soil;
a yard is not too much, provided it be on a dry base, which is most
important. Heavy soils may be improved for Apricot culture by the
addition of an equal portion of light loam, mortar rubbish, or charred
refuse. In furnishing walls, the distance apart may vary from 2ft.
between Cordons, to 12ft., 15ft., or even 20ft. between Fan-shaped
trees. The roots should be carefully arranged, interlayered at all
points with fine soil, and the whole covered to a depth of 3in. or 4in.
Not only should the roots have a good covering of suitable earth, but
a secondary one of litter, or other light material, should be added,
to render them frost proof in winter, and drought and heat proof in
summer. Newly planted trees should, on no account, be allowed to get
dry at the root. A thorough soaking of soft rain, or manure water,
will often save a crop, and restore the trees, when all other surface
remedies or appliances fail. Surface sprinklings overhead with the
garden engine, in the afternoons of bright days, are beneficial, and
help to keep the foliage clean and healthy. So soon as the trees are
cleared of their fruit, attention should be directed to the maturation
of the wood. All superfluous shoots should be removed, any excess of
growth left on the shoots cut back, and every effort made to perfect
the wood already made, rather than force the tree to make more. Unless
the weather be very dry, water should not be applied after this stage.

[Illustration: FIG. 131. APRICOT TREE, showing method of Wall Training.]

_Protection._ It is almost hopeless to expect a crop unless the
blossoms are protected, by mats or other means, from spring frosts.
Temporary wooden copings, from 1ft. to 2ft. wide, laid on iron
brackets, are indispensable for warding off storms, and keeping other
coverings away from the flowers. These should not be put up till the
trees are just bursting into bloom, and may safely be removed about the
end of May. A few fish or other nets, spread over the trees, afford
considerable resistance to the radiation of heat. This is assuredly one
of the easiest, if not one of the most efficient, modes of protection.
Frigi-domo and other thick shadings are sometimes used, but they
require to be removed from the trees in the day time. The thinner nets
mentioned are generally not in use for other purposes at this time of
year, and may remain over the trees altogether. Glass copings are the
best, but, being rather expensive, they cannot be used by the majority
of cultivators. They have, however, been applied with good results to
trees that had previously failed.

[Illustration: FIG. 132. APRICOT TREE, showing method of Training
suitable for Gable Ends of Cottages.]

_Cropping, &c._ Thinning of the fruit needs early and careful
attention. The average of 3in. apart may be chosen for a maximum yield.
As the fruit approach maturity, overhanging leaves, or branches of
young wood, must be removed, to admit sun and light to properly ripen
and colour them. Apricots for preserving should be gathered quite dry,
and with the sun upon them. For dessert, they should be plucked in the
morning, and placed in a cool room till wanted.

_Under Glass._ The Apricot will hardly bear forcing. It is more
sensitive to heat than almost any other of our semi-hardy fruits.
Practically, it is found that a confined atmosphere, or the slightest
excess of heat, brings its blooms off in showers, and this, of
course, mars all prospect of fruit. But in cold climates and northern
latitudes under glass is the best and only means of growing them.
Should red-spider appear, it is proof that the roots or the atmosphere,
probably both, have been too dry; more moisture, and syringing over
the leaves, are the surest remedies. The borders need to be about 2ft.
or 2ft. 6in. deep, of any light rich soil. Fresh planted trees should
be frequently syringed overhead before and after the flowering period.
After they have become fully established, less overhead sprinkling is
needed. During all the earlier stages of growth, and until the fruit
are stoned, an artificial temperature of 45deg. should not be exceeded.
After that stage, the fruit will bear a heat of 50deg. or 55deg. It is
hardly safe or desirable to exceed the latter under glass, and unless
abundance of air is given, 55deg. may bring off the fruit, even at
an advanced stage. A thorough soaking, at intervals of fourteen days
during the height of the growing season, may be applied; and, should
the trees be heavily cropped, manure water may be given at every
alternate watering. It is also a good practice to mulch the surface of
heavily cropped trees with 3in. or 4in. of good dung. The fruit should,
however, be freely thinned to distances of from 4in. to 6in. apart
at the most. There are three general methods of growing them under
glass: The trees may be trained on trellises or walls; grown as natural
standards, tall or dwarf; and as bushes, either planted out or in pots.

_Varieties._ The varieties of Apricot, unlike most other fruit, are not
numerous; and the following will be found in every way representative
and satisfactory:

    =Blanche=, or =White Masculine=. A small and delicate fruited sort.
    Fruit pale whitish-yellow, tinged with brownish-red next the sun,
    covered with a fine white down; rich, delicate, and sugary.

    =Blenheim=, or =Shipley's=.* Very early and prolific. Colour deep
    yellow; flesh medium, rich, and juicy. Ripe in July.

    =Breda.=* A small sort, of excellent quality. Colour deep orange;
    flesh firm, juicy, and rich. Hardiest sort grown.

    =Kaisha.=* Fruit round, much smaller than Moorpark. Colour pale
    citron; flesh tender, rich, juicy; flavour delicate and delicious;
    kernel very sweet.

    =Large Red.= The deepest coloured of all. Fruit very large; colour
    deep reddish-orange; flesh rich and juicy; kernel bitter.

    =Moorpark.=* The sort most generally grown; large, handsome, and of
    excellent quality. Colour brownish-orange; flesh rich, juicy, and
    sweet. It is one of the best and most useful sorts in cultivation.

    =Peach=, or =Grosse Peche=. Distinct and very desirable. Fruit very
    large; flesh rich, firm, and juicy. One of the very best.

    =Royal.=* Not unlike Moorpark, but with a more robust constitution,
    and less given to limb dying. Fruit large, dull, yellow, rich, and
    juicy.

    =Turkey.=* A good variety. Colour pale yellow; flavour rich and
    juicy; flesh firm.

information will be found under each individual title.

=APTERANTHES.= _See_ =Boucerosia=.

=APTEROUS.= Without wings.

=AQUATIC PLANTS.= The culture of Aquatic Plants, both indoors and in
the open air, has been greatly neglected of late years; they are,
therefore, rarely seen to perfection in places other than where their
culture is made a speciality. Generally speaking, they are most
easily grown. The following stove and greenhouse genera are well
worth attention: _Aponogeton_, _Cyperus_, _Damasonium_, _Herpestis_,
_Limnocharis_, _Nelumbium_, _NymphA"a_, _Ouvirandra_, _Pistia_,
_Pontederia_, _Salvinia_, _Thalia_, _Trianea_, _Victoria_. Many species
belonging to some of the foregoing genera are hardy, as are also the
following: _Alisma_, _Butomus_, _Calla_, _Hottonia_, _Menyanthes_,
_Nuphar_, _Polygonum_, _Sagittaria_, _Trapa_, _Typha_, _Villarsia_.

=AQUATICUS.= Living in water.

=AQUATILIS.= Living under water.

=AQUIFOLIACEA†.= _See_ =IlicineA|=.

=AQUILEGIA= (from _aquila_, an eagle; in reference to the form of the
petals). Columbine. ORD. _RanunculaceA|_. Erect hardy perennial herbs
with fibrous roots. Flowers solitary or panicled, drooping; sepals
five, petaloid, deciduous; petals five, concave, spurred; spurs very
large, produced downwards into hollow tubes, and frequently curved at
the extremity; carpels five, sessile, free. Radical leaves on long
stalks, twice or thrice ternate, with trifid-toothed, usually blunt
segments. Too much praise can scarcely be lavished upon this elegant
genus of plants. They prefer a moist and sheltered situation, with
exposure to the sun. The more robust species will thrive in ordinary
garden soil, but the rarer and more delicate kinds require a good
friable sandy loam and leaf soil, with good drainage. Seed is produced
in abundance, and must be sown very thinly, as soon as practicable
after being ripe, in a shady place or in pans in a cold frame. When up,
and strong enough to remove, the seedlings may be planted out where
they are to bloom, allowing every plant at least 9in. each way. The
strong-growing kinds may be placed in the border, the dwarf ones on
the rockery. When in bloom, the inferior sorts should be weeded out,
retaining only the best varieties. To obtain seed true of any species,
it is absolutely necessary to plant the separate kinds far apart, and
cover them with fine muslin, to prevent the access of insects to the
flowers, as none are more easily cross-fertilised. Division of the root
is the only way to perpetuate any particular variety with certainty,
unless seed is saved in the way mentioned, or imported from the native
habitats of particular species. There are many beautiful hybrids, as
well as species, in cultivation.

    =A. alpina= (alpine).* _fl._ from 2in. to 3in. in diameter

    slender in the lower half, nearly straight, distinctly knobbed at
    the tip; stems many-flowered. May to September. _l._ biternate.
    _h._ 2ft. to 4ft. North America. Border. The following are synonyms
    and varieties: _A. arctica_, _A. californica_, _A. eximia_, and _A.
    f. truncata_, revealing only trivial differences. There is a very
    beautiful hybrid known in gardens as _A. californica hybrida_, with
    the sepals and petals yellowish, or tinged with orange, while the
    long slender spurs are orange red; it is one of the handsomest of
    all. All the forms are very showy, and well worth growing.

    =A. fragrans= (fragrant).* _fl._ white or pale claret purple,
    finely pubescent, very fragrant; sepals about 1-1/2in. long, not
    reflexing, twice longer than the broad petals' limb; spur slender,
    slightly curved, knobbed at the top, same length as the petals;
    stems few-flowered. May to July. _l._ biternate. _h._ 1-1/2ft. to
    2ft. Himalayas, 1839. This requires a warm position.

    the rockery.

    =A. Reuteri= (Reuter's). Synonymous with _A. Bertoloni_.

    =A. sibirica= (Siberian).* _fl._ bright lilac; sepals very blunt,
    1in. or a little more in length, spreading or slightly reflexing
    when fully expanded; limb of petals sometimes white, about 1/2in.
    long; spur stout, much incurved, 1/2in. to 3/4in. long; stems
    many-flowered, glabrous. Summer. _l._ biternate. _h._ 1ft. Siberia,
    1806. Rockery species. Here are referred, by Mr. Baker, _A.
    bicolor_, _A. Garnieriana_, and _A. speciosa_. See Fig. 137.

    shorter than the petals; spurs straight and longer than the petals;
    stems two to three-flowered. _h._ 1ft. to 1-1/2ft. Siberia, 1780.
    Border. Rather a pleasing and sweet-scented green-flowered species,
    but not very ornamental.

    =A. vulgaris= (common). Common Columbine. _fl._ variously coloured;
    sepals ovate acute, about 1in. long, and half as broad; limb of the
    petal rarely exceeding 3/4in. long, and half as much broad, rounded
    at the apex; spur much incurved, stout, knobbed at the end, as long
    as the petals; stems many-flowered. Spring and early summer. _l._
    biternate. England, &c. There are numerous varieties of this very

and Flower.]

    =A. v. Wittmanniana= (Wittmann's). _fl._ large, bright lilac
    purple; sepals ovate-acute, 1in. to 1-1/4in. long, more than half
    as much broad; limb of petals white, about half the length of
    sepals; spur curved. A very fine variety.

    The following names are also met with in gardens, some of which
    represent specific forms, but none are effective as garden
    ornaments: _advena_, _Burgeriana_, _Haylodgensis_ (hybrid),
    _grata_, _longissima_, _nevadensis_, _oxysepala_, &c.

=AQUOSUS.= Watery.

=ARABIS= (origin of the word not clear). Wall Cress; Rock Cress. ORD.
_CruciferA|_. Hardy perennial trailers, except where otherwise stated.
Flowers mostly white; racemes terminal; pedicels bractless. Radical
leaves usually stalked; cauline ones sessile or stem-clasping, entire
or toothed, rarely lobed. Most members of this genus are peculiarly
well adapted for rockwork and the alpine garden, both from their
natural hardihood as well as their early and profuse flowering habits.
They are of the easiest possible culture in any dry soil. The perennial
species may either be increased by divisions of the root, by cuttings,
placed in a shady border during the summer, or by seed. The latter
may be sown outside, or in pans, in spring, when most of them will
germinate in two or three weeks. The annuals and biennials are for the
most part devoid of any cultural beauty.

    =A. albida= (whitish).* _fl._ white; racemes terminal; pedicels
    longer than the calyx. January to May. _l._ few-toothed, hoary, or
    downy with branched hairs; radical ones obovate-oblong; cauline
    ones cordately sagittate, clasping the stem. _h._ 6in. to 9in.
    Tauria and Caucasus, 1798. SYN. _A. caucasica_.

    =A. a. variegata= (variegated).* A very pretty variegated form for
    edgings.

[Illustration: FIG. 138. ARABIS ALPINA, showing Habit and Flowers.]

    =A. alpina= (alpine).* _fl._ white, smaller than those of _A.
    albida_; racemes terminal; pedicels longer than the calyx, which
    is smoothish. March to May. _l._ many-toothed, lanceolate, acute,
    villous with branched hairs; radical ones somewhat stalked; cauline
    ones cordate, clasping the stem. _h._ 6in. European rocks, in
    sunny places, 1596. There are one or two varieties, including a
    variegated-leaved form, in cultivation. See Fig. 138.

[Illustration: FIG. 139. ARABIS ARENOSA, showing Habit and Flowers.]

    =A. arenosa= (sand-loving).* _fl._ rose coloured, very rarely white
    or bluish; petals obovate; pedicels spreading. April to July. _l._
    villous, with forked hairs; radical ones pinnatifid, with the upper
    lobes much larger than the lower; cauline ones deeply toothed. Stem
    branched, hispid, with simple hairs. _h._ 6in. Middle Europe, 1798.
    See Fig. 139.

    =A. blepharophylla= (fringed-leaved).* _fl._ rosy purple; petals
    roundish, narrowing to the base, with slender claws. Spring. _l._
    naked, except the margins, which are fringed with very stiff hairs;
    radical ones spathulate; cauline ones oblong, sessile. _h._ 3in. to
    4in. California, 1874. This succeeds best in a cool frame, where it
    will flower in January.

    =A. caucasica= (Caucasus). A synonym of _A. albida_.

    =A. lucida= (shining).* _fl._ white; petals entire, narrowed at the
    base, twice as long as the calyx. Summer. _l._ obovate, thickish,
    shining, clasping the stem. _h._ 4in. to 6in. Hungary, 1790. A very
    pretty species, with a dwarf habit; it is especially adapted for
    edgings, borders, or rockwork.

    =A. l. variegata= (variegated).* A great improvement upon the type,
    being broadly edged with yellow, and the green somewhat lighter.
    When grown in tufts or as edging, it is very effective, and should
    be prevented from flowering. This exceedingly desirable variety
    is a gem for the rockwork, and when seen in crevices, or in bold
    tufts, it is very striking. It must be increased by slips or
    rootlets, which should be taken in early summer.

    =A. mollis= (soft). _fl._ white, in terminal racemes. May to July.
    _l._ grossly toothed, somewhat pubescent, with small stellate
    hairs; lower ones on long petioles, cordate-roundish; cauline ones
    ovate-cordate, clasping the stem. _h._ 2ft. Caucasus, 1823.

    =A. petrA|a= (rock).* _fl._ white; petals ovate, with stalks.
    June. _l._ smooth, ciliated or scabrous, with simple or bifid
    radical ones on longish stalks, entire, toothed; cauline ones
    oblong-linear, entire, or toothed. _h._ 3in. or 4in. Britain.

    =A. prA|cox= (early). _fl._ white; petals obovately cuneated,
    double the length of the calyx. April to June. _l._ oblong, acute,
    sessile, quite entire, smooth. Stem covered with close pressed
    rigid hairs. _h._ 6in. to 9in. Hungary.

    =A. procurrens= (procurrent). _fl._ white; petals obovate, double
    the length of the calyx. May and June. _l._ ovate, quite entire,
    smooth, ciliated with two-parted hairs; radical ones narrowed into
    a petiole; cauline ones sessile, pointed. Stolons creeping. _h._
    9in. Servia, 1819. There is a brilliantly variegated form of this
    pretty species well worth growing.

    =A. rosea= (rosy).* _fl._ rosy purple; petals oblong, somewhat
    wedge-shaped, double the length of the calyx; pedicels longer
    than the calyx. May to July. _l._, cauline ones oblong, somewhat
    cordate, and rather stem-clasping, scabrous with branched hairs.
    _h._ 1ft. Calabria, 1832.

    =A. verna= (spring). _fl._ small, purple, with a white claw;
    pedicels shorter than the calyx. May to June. _l._, cauline ones
    cordate, clasping the stem, toothed, scabrous with three-parted
    hairs. _h._ 3in. to 6in. South Europe, 1710. The best annual
    species.

=ARACEA†= or =AROIDEA†=. An extensive order of herbaceous plants, with
tuberous rhizomes. Flowers on a spadix, unisexual or hermaphrodite,
protected by a spathe. Leaves large, radical. Well known genera
belonging to this order are: _Alocasia_, _Arum_, _Caladium_,
_Colocasia_, and _Dieffenbachia_.

=ARACHIS= (from _a_, without, and _rachis_, a branch; plant
branchless). Ground or Earth Nut. ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A stove annual,
of economical value. Corolla resupinate; calyx a long tube, with a
bilabiate limb; ovary stipitate, inclosed in the tube of the calyx; the
stipe at first short, but afterwards becoming elongated. Sandy loam is
the soil most suitable for their cultivation. Seeds should be sown in
heat; and, when the plants have grown to a sufficient size, they should
be potted off singly, and placed among other stove annuals. After the
plant has finished flowering, and the pods begin to lengthen, the
pedicels force them into the earth, where they ripen their seeds.

    =A. hypogA|a= (underground). Monkey Nut. _fl._ yellow, five to seven
    together in the axils of the leaves. May. _l._ abruptly-pinnate,
    bearing two pairs of leaflets, without any tendril; stipulas
    elongated, adnate to the petioles. _h._ 1ft., or procumbent. South
    America, 1812. See Fig. 140.

=ARACHNIMORPHA.= A synonym of =Rondeletia= (which _see_).

=ARACHNOID.= Resembling a cobweb in appearance; seeming to be covered
with cobweb, in consequence of the entanglement of long, white hairs.

[Illustration: FIG. 140. ARACHIS HYPOGA†A, showing Leaf, Flower, &c.,
and Cluster of short wrinkled Pods.]

=ARALIA= (meaning unknown). ORD. _AraliaceA|_. This widely-grown genus
includes stove, greenhouse, and hardy, herbaceous and shrubby plants.
Flowers inconspicuous, umbellate, the umbels usually disposed in
panicles; petals five, inserted on the margin of the disk; stamens five
(see Fig. 142). Leaves usually compound. These plants are of moderately
free growth, and the majority are easy to manage. Those requiring
indoor treatment thrive well under the ordinary routine of management.
One most important requirement, however, is that they must be kept well
supplied with water at the roots. The finer, or stove varieties, should
be potted in a mixture of sandy loam and peat, with the addition of a
little fibrous leaf soil, and sufficient sand to keep the whole porous.
The stronger growing kinds thrive in a richer compost. Propagation
by cuttings of the roots is a common and very successful method. To
obtain the roots, one of the strongest plants should be turned out of
the pot, and the roots should be cleared of soil by shaking or washing
it out; the requisite number of pieces should then be selected. As
each piece is removed, it should have the end nearest the stem cut
horizontally, to distinguish it from the other or furthermost end. In
planting cuttings of the roots, it is best to place the end nearest the
stem uppermost. The pieces may be left about 2in. long, and should be
inserted in pots, well drained, and filled with sandy soil, leaving
the tops of the cuttings about level with the surface of the soil. A
square of glass must be placed over the top of each pot, plunging them
in moderate bottom heat. The stems of the plants from which the roots
have been taken may be cut into pieces 1in. or 1-1/2in. long, leaving
an eye or bud near the top; a slice of half the shoot may be taken off
opposite the bud. When prepared, these pieces should be pressed into
pots of sand or sandy soil, and plunged into bottom heat. The stems may
be cut down without disturbing the roots; in that case, if the pots
are plunged in bottom heat, and kept moderately supplied with water,
they will probably throw up several suckers or shoots from the roots.
These, if taken off with a portion of root to each, and placed in small
sized pots, will, with a little care, soon make useful plants. All the
hardy species and most of the greenhouse ones are propagated readily
by cuttings or pieces of roots. Some of the stove species, however,
are very difficult to increase, except by grafting. Among these are
_A. leptophylla_, _A. Veitchii_, &c. These should be worked on stocks
of _A. Guilfoylei_ or _A. reticulata_, the latter being the better of
the two. Cuttings of either of these strike readily, and stocks fit
for grafting are easily procured. In sheltered and warm positions, the
greenhouse species are admirably suited for sub-tropical gardening,
either planted singly or in groups. _See_ also =Dimorphanthus=,
=Fatsia=, =Hedera=, =Heptapleurum=, =Monopanax=, =Oreopanax=, and
=Panax=.

    shade of the same colour. A very handsome species, requiring stove
    heat during winter. In spring and summer it is admirably suited
    for conservatory or indoor decoration, having a light and graceful
    aspect.

    =A. rotunda= (round). _l._ sometimes of a single leaflet only,
    which is spreading, orbicular, cordate at the base, margined with
    distinct white tipped teeth; at other times, especially when

    variety is undoubtedly the finest for table decoration, and is
    frequently grafted upon stocks of the typical form. It enjoys
    plenty of heat. SYN. _A. gracillima_.

=ARALIACEA†.= An order of trees, shrubs, or (rarely) herbaceous plants,
often pubescent, and sometimes spiny. Flowers variously disposed,
hermaphrodite or unisexual, regular; petals usually five, and valvate.
Leaves alternate, or (rarely) opposite. This order is closely allied to
_UmbelliferA|_; and the best known genera are _Aralia_ and _Hedera_.

=ARAR-TREE.= A common name for =Callitris quadrivalvis= (which _see_).

=ARAUCARIA= (from _Araucanos_, its name in Chili). SYN. _Eutacta_. ORD.
_ConiferA|_. A noble genus of diA"cious or sub-diA"cious evergreen trees,
with usually imbricated persistent flat sessile scale-like leaves. Male
cones large, cylindrical, terminal; female ones very large, globular,
terminal, with dense ligneous deciduous scales, each bearing a solitary
seed. The majority of the species are not, unfortunately, sufficiently
hardy to withstand our winters out of doors. Few trees can compete
with them in symmetry and elegant proportion for conservatory
decoration, where they may be grown in large tubs, or planted out.
Small plants grown in pots are most serviceable for table and other
decorative purposes. They thrive in a good fibrous loam, mixed with
leaf soil and sand. Propagation by means of seed is the surest and
most satisfactory method; the seed should be sown in pans or boxes, or
if in large quantities, in a bed, with but gentle heat; they usually
take some time to germinate. Cuttings are procured by taking off the
leading shoots, and fixing them firmly in a pot of sand; they first
require a cool place, but may afterwards be subjected to slight warmth.
When rooted, they should be potted off into the soil above mentioned.
The young growths which afterwards shoot from the plant, whence the
cutting, may be taken off and treated in much the same manner. These
are the only methods of propagation worth pursuing.

    =A. BalansA|= (Balansa's). _male cones_ cylindrical-conical, 2in.

    =A. Cookii= (Cook's).* _l._ awl-shaped, short, densely imbricated
    around the frondose branches. Described by Mr. Abbay as having
    "a somewhat curious habit, even when growing alone, of shedding
    their branches for five-sixths or more of their height, and then
    replacing them by a smaller and more bushy growth, so that the tree
    at a distance presents a very columnar appearance, the resemblance
    being increased by the summit being crowned with a mass of foliage
    somewhat like a capital." _h._ 200ft. New Caledonia, 1851. SYN. _A.
    columnaris_.

[Illustration: FIG. 144. ARAUCARIA EXCELSA.]

    dark brown. The branches are horizontal, inflexed, and ascending at
    the extremities, and are produced in whorls. _l._ ovate-lanceolate,
    sessile, thickened at the base, stiff, leathery, straight,
    somewhat keeled-shaped below, and strongly mucronate at the apex;
    verticillate, with seven or eight in a whorl, imbricate, and
    closely encircling the branches, concave, glabrous, shining, marked
    with longitudinal lines, dotted on both sides. _h._ 50ft. to 100ft.

    indispensable to Arboreta and shrubberies. See Fig. 145.

    =A. Rulei= (Rule's).* _male cones_ oblong obtuse; _female cones_
    oval. _l._ oblong-lanceolate, with a prominent dorsal nerve, more
    closely appressed, and less sharply pointed than in the foregoing

from which the main branches grow.

=ARBORESCENT.= Having a tendency to become a tree.

=ARBORETUM.= A collection of hardy trees formed for pleasure or
instruction, and which, when well managed, is a source of much
interesting study. They afford shelter, improve the local climate,
renovate bad soils, &c., and also, by concealing or hiding disagreeable
objects, heighten the effect of agreeable ones, create beauty, and add
value. A properly arranged Arboretum should be constructed with a view
to picturesque beauty, and not systematically, as is usually the case
in Botanic Gardens, although scientific purposes are best served by a
systematic arrangement.

sand during March; by budding, and by inarching; the first mentioned
method is the one most generally employed, with good results. The
various sorts may be grafted, budded, or inarched upon _A. Unedo_. The
greenhouse species are rare in cultivation, but their management does
not materially differ from other plants requiring a similar temperature.

margin; receptacle pitted, studded with bristles between the florets;
achenes grooved, crowned with a pappus of membranous scales. The
species of this genus are of easy culture in a compost of loam and leaf
soil. Propagated by cuttings at any time of the year; these should
be pricked in pots of very sandy soil, and placed in gentle warmth;
they must be kept uncovered and moderately dry, or they will rot. The
Arctotis are very handsome plants in sunny, dry positions outside
during the summer months, but they must be protected during winter.

=ARCUATE, ARCUATED.= Curved or bent like a bow; forming an arch.

=ARDISIA.= (from _ardis_, a point; in reference to the acute,
spear-pointed anthers). SYN. _Pyrgus_. ORD. _MyrsineA|_. An extensive
genus of greenhouse or stove, mostly ornamental, evergreen trees and
shrubs. Flowers white or rose-coloured, more or less panicled; panicles
sometimes many-flowered at the extremities of the branches, and longer
than the leaves, sometimes few-flowered and in the axils of the leaves.
Leaves alternate, rarely almost opposite, or three in a whorl, dotted.
Propagated by cuttings of the half-ripened wood taken from the side
shoots of the plant any time from March to September; but, as the
points of these side shoots bear the blossoms and fruit, they are
not well adapted for making good plants. To obtain the best plants,
the largest, ripest, and best-coloured berries should be sown early
in spring, as soon as gathered, in a wide-mouthed pot or seed pan,
well drained and filled with loam and peat in equal parts, with the
addition of some sand, and plunged in bottom heat, the soil being kept
moderately moist. The seeds will germinate in a few weeks after sowing,
and when about 2in. high, the strongest seedlings should be selected
and placed in 3in. pots, the same mixture of soil being used, with
the addition of a fourth part well decomposed manure. After potting,
the plants must be moistened overhead twice a day with a fine rose or
syringe, and be kept in a close atmosphere until the roots have taken
to the fresh soil. When the plants begin to grow again, they should be
removed to a light situation in the house; and when the pots are well
filled with roots, a shift into 6in. pots may be effected, water being
given judiciously until well established, and here they may remain to
fruit. Until the berries are coloured, clear manure water, given once
or twice a week, will be found beneficial. The plants arrive at their
best when about 18in. or 2ft. high; after that, they begin to get naked
at the bottom. It will then be wise to cut the worst plants down to
within 2in. of the pots, in early spring, allowing them to become dry
at the roots before this operation is performed. By giving moisture
to the roots when the cut has become dry, the plants will soon break
into growth again, when some of the worst placed shoots should be
rubbed off, leaving only one or two of the strongest and best placed,
calculated to develop into a well formed plant. When the shoots have
grown 2in. or 3in., the plants should be turned out of their pots,
the soil shaken out from the roots, and the long ends of the roots
trimmed in a little with a knife; they must then be placed in a pot
sufficiently large to hold the roots without squeezing. The plants
should now occupy the warmest end of the house in which they are grown,
care being taken in watering until new roots are formed, when they may
have more air and somewhat liberal supplies of water. As soon as they
are sufficiently advanced in growth, they should be transferred to a
larger-sized pot. With proper treatment, they will flower and fruit the
same season as they are cut down, and form handsome plants. Although
most species of this genus are classed as stove plants, they will
succeed very well in a temperature that does not fall below 45deg. in
winter; and, when so grown, they are not so liable to become infested
with large brown scale and other insect pests. This is particularly the
case with _A. crenulata_, and cool treatment is also favourable to the
ripe berries hanging on the plants for a much longer time than when
grown in a stove. Moreover, they do not suffer so much when removed for
decorative purposes.

    =A. acuminata= (taper-pointed). _fl._ nearly white; petals small,
    acute, dotted; panicles terminal and axillary, many-flowered. July.

    _h._ 3ft. to 5ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1760. SYN. _Carissa Arduina_.

=ARECA= (_Areec_ is its name in Malabar, when an old tree). The Cabbage
Palm. ORD. _PalmeA|_. This genus is now broken up into several, and many
species formerly here arranged are now found under _AcanthophA"nix_,
_Euterpe_, _Hyophorbe_, _Kentia_, _Oncosperma_, _PhA|nicophorum_. Very
ornamental and graceful stove palms, with a branching spadix, and
double spathe, which incloses the flowers. Flowers unisexual, borne
upon the same spike; female flowers having six rudimentary stamens,
and male flowers a six-cleft perianth. Fruit one-seeded. They thrive
in a compost of loam, peat, and leaf soil, in equal parts, with a
liberal addition of sand; but when they are fully grown, loam should
preponderate to the extent of about two-thirds, and some rotten
cow-manure may be added. Propagated from seeds, which should be sown in
a compost similar to above, and placed in a moist gentle heat. They are
employed, when young, with much success for the decoration of drawing
rooms and dinner tables.

    =A. AliciA|= (Princess Alice's). _l._ pinnatisect; segments sessile.
    North Australia. A very handsome species, with a comparatively
    dwarf habit; it is a valuable decorative plant.

    1810.

=ARENARIA= (from _arena_, sand; in which most of the species are
found). Sandwort. ORD. _CaryophyllaceA|_. TRIBE _AlsineA|_. A very large
genus of hardy herbaceous plants, consisting of about 150 species. It
is distinguished by having generally three styles. The perennials only
are worth growing; these are extremely pretty little alpine plants, and
will thrive in any ordinary soil in exposed places; the rarer species
may be grown in small pots, well drained, in a mixture of sand, loam,
and leaf soil, or in well-drained crannies of the rockery. They may be
increased by either division, seeds, or cuttings; the latter, placed
under a hand-glass, will root freely. The best time to divide the
plants is early spring, or July and August. Seeds should be sown in
spring in a cold frame.

    =A. balearica= (Balearic).* _fl._ white, sepals erect; peduncles
    elongated, one-flowered. March to August. _l._ very small, ovate,

=ARETHUSA= (mythological: named after a nymph of Diana's, who was
changed into a fountain; in allusion to the habit of the plants).
ORD. _OrchideA|_. A small genus of very pretty, but rare, terrestrial
orchids. They require a moist shady spot with a northern aspect, and
thrive best in a compost of well-rotted manure and sphagnum. A mulching

fine greenhouse evergreen tree, said by Don to flourish against a south
wall, out of doors, with the protection of a mat in severe weather. It
will thrive in ordinary garden soil. Increased by layers and cuttings
in autumn and spring, the latter requiring a bell glass covering; both
operations must be performed in a moderately heated greenhouse.

    =A. Sideroxylon= (Iron-wood). _fl._, corolla greenish yellow,
    cup-shaped, five-parted, with ovate-lanceolate, sub-emarginate
    segments; lateral and axillary, scattered, crowded, sessile. _fr._

undersides of the leaves). Silver-weed. ORD. _ConvolvulaceA|_. An
elegant genus of greenhouse and stove climbers. Sepals five; corolla
campanulate. Shrubs for the most part silvery, but sometimes silky and
tomentose. The greater number of the species are robust, extensive
twiners or climbers, usually requiring plenty of room to run, before
they will flower. _A. cuneata_, and one or two others, are of dwarf
habit, and produce their splendid blossoms in abundance. All the
species grow well in light rich soil, or a mixture of peat, loam, and
sand. Cuttings root readily if planted in sand, with a hand glass
placed over them, in a little bottom heat.

    =A. zebrina= (zebra). A synonym of _A. triphylla_.

=ARISARUM= (name of Greek origin). ORD. _AroideA|_. A small genus of
half-hardy herbaceous plants, possessing but little horticultural
interest, and allied to _ArisA|ma_. Flowers unisexual, spadix having
no rudimentary flowers. Leaves on long stalks, heart-shaped or
spear-shaped. The only species in cultivation thrives in a sand, loam,
and peat compost. Propagated by seeds or divisions of the root in
spring.

    =A. vulgate= (common). _fl._, spathe livid purple. May. _h._ 1ft.
    South Europe, 1596.

=ARISTATE.= Having a beard or awn, as the glumes of barley.

=ARISTEA= (from _arista_, a point or beard; in reference to the
rigid points of the leaves). ORD. _IridaceA|_. A genus of greenhouse
herbaceous perennials from the Cape of Good Hope. Flowers blue;
perianth rotate, six-parted, twisted after flowering; scape two-edged,
rigid, often branched. Leaves narrow, sword-shaped. The species are
more interesting than ornamental, and may be grown in a compost of
three parts turfy peat, and one of loam. Easily propagated by divisions
and seeds. They vary in height from 3in. to 3ft., and flower generally
in summer.

    =A. capitata= (headed). _fl._ blue. July. _h._ 3ft. Cape of Good
    Hope, 1790.

    =A. cyanea= (bright blue). _fl._ blue. June. _h._ 6in. Cape of Good

=ARISTOLOCHIA= (from _aristos_, best, and _locheia_, parturition;
in reference to its supposed medicinal character). Birthwort. ORD.
_AristolochiaceA|_. A very large genus of stove, greenhouse, or hardy,
evergreen or deciduous, climbing or erect shrubs. Flowers axillary,
clustered, or solitary, pendulous, of most extraordinary forms;
perianth tubular, curved, or straight, with an oblique, cordate limb;
stamens six, rarely four, or numerous, adhering to the stigma; capsule
six-valved. Leaves cordate entire or lobed. Good loam, with a small
proportion of decayed manure and a slight addition of sharp sand to
secure efficient drainage, is a good compost for the whole. They will
thrive when planted out in the conservatory more satisfactorily than
elsewhere; for as they usually grow a considerable height before
flowering, they require very long trellises in pots, and have to be
trained up and down; or, better still, round a pillar of uniform
circumference, a pyramid form being useless. The best way is to train
them round, close down to the pot, and keep on about 2in. from one turn
to the next. Some of the larger sorts will require more room. Cuttings
root freely in sand under a bell glass with bottom heat.

    =A. anguicida= (snake-killing). _fl._ white, spotted brown; tube
    of perianth inflated at base, dilated and oblique at the mouth;

    with chocolate veins inside, bent into two unequal portions,
    the lower portion surmounting the ovary about 8in. in length,
    somewhat cylindrical, terminating in a club-shaped curved knob; the
    upper portion, commencing from this knob, is about a foot long,
    funnel-shaped, ribbed, dilated above into a somewhat three-lobed
    limb. Stamens twenty-four--a very unusual number in the whole
    family. The enormous flowers are 26in. long by 11in. in diameter.
    July. _l._ ovate, or triangular-cordate, acuminated. Old Calabar
    River, 1867. This noble climber should be repotted in fresh soil
    in February or March. But little water will be necessary until the
    young shoots have made about 6in. of growth; the quantity should
    then be increased with moderation until early in September, when
    the old stem dies down within a few inches of the surface of the
    pot--at this period, and during winter, water must be entirely
    withheld. This species blooms freely in a temperature of 65deg. to
    70deg.

    =A. ornithocephala= (bird's-head).* _fl._ purple, very large, and
    extremely singular. To render any description at all lucid, this
    species may be said to have the head of a hawk and the beak of a
    heron, with the wattles of a Spanish fowl, which, however, are
    grey, netted with brown; head of the same colour, veined; and the
    beak grey. _l._ between cordate and reniform, obtuse. October. _h._
    20ft. Brazil, 1838. Stove species.

    =A. ringens= (gaping).* _fl._ extremely grotesque, 7in. to 10in.
    long, pale green, marbled and reticulated with black purple. The
    perianth has an obovoid ventricose sac, or cup, 2-1/2in. long,
    which is woolly inside; tube ascending obliquely from the sac,
    terete, dividing into two very long lips, the upper of which
    (lower as the flower hangs) is oblong-lanceolate, recurved, and
    hairy inside below the middle, while the lower one is shorter,
    with recurved margins, and expanding into an orbicular or almost
    reniform limb. Unlike many other species, the flowers are
    produced on the young shoots. July. _l._ bright green, glabrous,
    roundish-reniform. _h._ 20ft. Brazil, 1820. Stove evergreen.

    =A. Ruiziana= (Ruiz's). A synonym of _A. Duchartrei_.

    =A. saccata= (pouch-flowered). _fl._ purplish-red, forming a large
    pouch; throat circular, vertical. September. _l._ 12in. to 15in.
    long, and 4in. broad, scattered, ovate-cordate, narrowed at apex,
    slightly waved and sinuated, entire, more silky beneath than above.
    _h._ 20ft. Sylhet, 1829. Stove evergreen.

    species.

=ARISTOLOCHIACEA†.= An order of very curious plants, with singularly
inflated flowers, consisting of a calyx only, of a dull, dingy colour.
It is popularly known as the Birthwort family, and has an English
representative in _Aristolochia clematitis_.

=ARISTOTELIA= (said to be named in honour of Aristotle, the Greek
philosopher). ORD. _TiliaceA|_. A hardy evergreen shrub. Calyx
campanulate; petals five, inserted in the base of the calyx, and
alternating with its lobes. Easily grown, in ordinary garden soil, in
the shrubbery. Propagated by ripened cuttings, which root freely if
placed under a hand glass; or by layers.

    =A. Macqui= (Macqui's).* _fl._ small, greenish, axillary. May. _l._
    nearly opposite, stalked, oblong, acute, smooth, shining, dentate,
    permanent. _h._ 6ft. Chili, 1733. A shrub esteemed for its handsome
    foliage. The berries are about the size of a pea, very dark purple,
    at length becoming black. The variegated form is not so hardy as
    the type, but much more ornamental.

=ARMENIACA= (from Armenia, the native country of the Apricot). Apricot.
ORD. _RosaceA|_. TRIBE _DrupaceA|_. Small, hardy, deciduous trees.
Flowers appearing before the leaves from scaly buds, solitary, or
few together, almost sessile. Leaves, when young, convolute. Drupe
ovate-globose, fleshy, covered with velvety skin, containing a nut, or
stone, which is acute at one end and blunt at the other, with a furrow
on both sides; the rest smooth, not wrinkled. For culture, &c., _see_
=Apricot= and =Prunus=.

    =A. brigantiaca= (Brigancon).* _fl._ white or pink, glomerate,
    almost sessile. March. _l._ somewhat cordate, acuminated, sharply
    toothed; the teeth numerous, and lapping over each other. _h._ 6ft.
    to 8ft. South Europe, 1819.

    =A. dasycarpa= (thick-fruited).* _fl._ white, pedicellate; pedicels
    filiform. March. _l._ ovate, acuminate, serrated; petioles
    glandular. _h._ 10ft. to 15ft. China, 1800.

    =A. sibirica= (Siberian). _fl._ rose-coloured. April. _l._ ovate,
    acuminate; petioles glandless. _h._ 8ft. to 20ft. Dahuria, 1788.

    =A. vulgaris= (common).* Common Apricot. _fl._ pinkish-white,
    sessile. February. _l._ ovate, or cordate, glabrous, glandularly
    serrated. _h._ 15ft. Levant, 1548. Of this species numerous
    varieties, differing in the foliar outline, &c., are sometimes met
    with. _See_ =Apricot=.

=ARMERIA.= (from _Flos ArmeriA|_, Latin name for the flowers of a
species of Pink). Thrift; Sea Pink. ORD. _PlumbagineA|_. A very
interesting and pretty group of hardy alpine tufted perennials. Flowers
pedicellate, collected in dense solitary heads; involucre scarious,
sheathing the scape and turned downwards; petals cohering at the base,
persistent; flower scapes leafless. Leaves linear, radical. As the
majority of the species differ in mere technical details, we have given
a representative group only. They are easily cultivated in a sandy loam
and leaf soil, and are increased by seeds and division, separate pieces
being planted as cuttings under hand glasses; or the rarer kinds should
be potted and placed in a frame. The seed should be sown in spring, in
pots of sandy soil, and placed in a cold frame. Although best grown as
rock plants, most of them do well in pots and borders. _A. vulgaris_
makes one of the best of edging plants.

    =A. cephalotes= (round-headed).* _fl._ deep rose or crimson,
    in a large roundish head on erect stalk. Autumn. _l._ broadly
    lanceolate, glabrous, acute; petioles channelled, sheathing at the
    base. _h._ 12in. to 18in. South Europe, 1800. This is perhaps the
    finest species, and is best raised from an annual sowing of seed,
    as it is somewhat difficult to increase by divisions. SYNS. _A.
    formosa_, _A. latifolia_, _A. mauritanica_, and _A. pseudo-armeria_.

    =A. dianthoides= (Pink-like).* _fl._ light pink, in close heads
    about 6in. high. May and June. _l._ spreading, flattened, nerved,

=ARNEBIA= (its Arabian name). ORD. _BoraginaceA|_. Handsome hardy
herbaceous perennials or annuals, allied to _Lithospermum_. Cuttings
should be removed with a heel in autumn, dibbled in sandy soil in small
pots, and placed in a cool house, where they will ultimately, though
slowly, root; they should then be gradually hardened off, and finally
planted out. _A. echioides_ is also easily increased by making cuttings
of the strong roots, which should be dibbled in pots of sandy soil, and
placed in gentle heat; it is also raised from seed.

    narrower leaves, rather smaller flowers, which are of a more
    decided yellow, a differently shaped calyx, and a longer corolla.
    _h._ 9in. North-west India. Equally desirable, were it a perennial;
    but, being an annual, it must be constantly raised from seed.

=ARNICA= (from _arnakis_, lambskin; in reference to the texture of the
leaves). ORD. _CompositA|_. Hardy, dwarf, herbaceous perennials, allied
to _Senecio_. They thrive best in loam, peat, and sand; the plants are

=ARPOPHYLLUM= (from _arpe_, a scimitar, and _phyllon_, a leaf; the leaf
is sword-shaped). ORD. _OrchideA|_. Distinct evergreen epiphytes. There
are about six species known, and the genus belongs to the _EpidendreA|_
division of orchidaceous plants; their general characters are: Flowers
small, numerous, in closely packed cylindrical spikes; anther-bed
broad, shorter than the broad extension of the upper edge of the
stigma; pollinia eight. Stems rather long, with white sheaths. They
thrive well in fibrous peat, one-third turfy loam, freely interspersed
with lumps of fresh charcoal and an abundance of crocks. When growing,
a liberal supply of water at the roots is essential, as is also a
situation near the light, where they will blossom much more profusely
than if in any way shaded. The flowers last in perfection about four
weeks.

    =A. cardinale= (cardinal). _fl._, sepals and petals light rose; lip
    deep red, on upright spikes about 1ft. high. Summer. New Grenada.

=ARRACACHA= (its Spanish name in South America). ORD. _UmbelliferA|_. A
half-hardy tuberous perennial, highly esteemed as an esculent in South
America, where it yields a food, which is prepared in the same manner
as potatoes, and is said to be grateful to the palate and extremely
easy of digestion. It thrives best in rich loam, and is increased by
divisions of the roots.

    =A. esculenta= (edible). _fl._ white; umbels opposite the leaves
    or terminal; involucre wanting. July. _l._ pinnate; leaflets

grapes; in reference to the way the fruit is supported by the curious
tendril). ORD. _AnonaceA|_. A handsome stove evergreen shrub, thriving
in a good sandy loam and peat, to which a little rotten dung may be
added. Propagated by cuttings made of ripened wood, insert in sand
under a bell glass, with bottom heat, in early spring. Seed, when
procurable, should be sown as soon after receipt as possible.

reference to a tooth-like process growing on the longer filaments).
ORD. _ScrophularineA|_. An interesting and handsome greenhouse evergreen
shrub, allied to _Torenia_. Flowers disposed in terminal racemes, and
on short pedicels. Leaves opposite, sub-serrated. It may be treated as
hardy during summer, for which purpose seeds should be sown in spring;
but it requires the protection of a greenhouse during winter. Artanema
grows freely in light rich soil, and is readily increased by cuttings
and seeds.

    =A. fimbriatum= (fringed). _fl._, corolla blue, large, tubularly
    funnel-shaped, clothed with minute glandular pubescence
    outside; lobes unequally serrated; racemes terminal, four to

=ARTEMISIA= (from Artemis, one of the names of Diana). Mugwort;
Southernwood; Wormwood. ORD. _CompositA|_. A very large genus of mostly
hardy herbaceous perennials, few of which, comparatively speaking, are
worth growing. Flower-heads disposed in spikes, or racemes, and these
are usually arranged in panicles; pappus none; involucre few-flowered,
ovate or rounded, imbricated; florets of the disk all tubular; of the
ray, if any, slender, awl-shaped. Leaves alternate, variously lobed.
All the species are of the easiest possible culture in any dry soil.
The shrubby kinds are best propagated by cuttings; the herbaceous ones,
by dividing at the root; and the annuals, by seeds.

=ARTICHOKE, GLOBE.= (_Cynara Scolymus_, a cultivated form of _C.
Cardunculus_). As a vegetable, the Globe Artichoke is cultivated for
the use of the immature flower-heads, and is highly esteemed. A good
open position, free from overhanging trees, is best suited for its
culture generally, but, by planting successional suckers in different
aspects, the season may be considerably prolonged. The soil must be
of good depth, rich, and not too heavy. It may be greatly improved
for Artichoke culture by the addition of sea-weeds or salt applied as
manure.

[Illustration: FIG. 151. GLOBE ARTICHOKE.]

_Preparation of Soil._ Trench the ground two spits deep if possible,
mixing a liberal dressing of well-rotted manure in autumn, and ridge
up for the winter, to sweeten. Crude manure full of straw, leaves,
and sticks, often induce fungoid growths, and are most injurious to
the crowns of the plants. Clay or stiff loam is about the worst soil
on which to attempt the culture of this vegetable; this drawback may,
however, to some extent be alleviated by the addition and thorough
amalgamation of a light free soil or liberal dressings of sandy road
drifts, or similar materials. An ill-drained soil is also fatal to good
results. During hot, dry weather, the plants are greatly benefited by
copious applications of clear water and dilute liquid manure; and this
must be especially attended to on such soils as are liable to burn or
dry up in summer.

_Cultivation._ When the beds have been properly prepared, the plants
should be put in them in April or May. Place three together in rows
between 3ft. and 4ft. apart, and about 3ft. from plant to plant.
Water-in carefully to settle the soil around the roots, and apply a
mulching of half-decayed manure, to prevent an undue evaporation of
moisture. During hot, dry weather, give liberal supplies of water, and
the plants will become established as fine stools the first season.
A few heads will probably be produced the first year; but there will
not be much of a crop until the second season, when five or six good
heads will be got from each plant, and for three or four years the
produce will be large if the beds are properly attended to; after
which time it will become desirable to make up new plantations. In
October or November, it will be necessary to apply a good mulching
of straw or fern to the beds, to protect the plants from frost. In
April, all this litter should be cleaned off, a dressing of rotten
manure applied, and the beds forked over and kept clean for the rest
of the season, treating as before described. Great care must be taken
to remove the heads as soon as they are in a fit state; and, when the
whole of them are removed from the stems, cut the latter out as low
as possible. Globe Artichokes will keep for some considerable time if
laid in a cool place, although they will deteriorate in quality. These
plants may be used in the background of flower borders in the kitchen
garden, their handsome foliage being peculiarly well adapted for such
purposes, whilst their economical value is also secured. See Fig. 151.
Where there is plenty of room in light, warm sheds, orchard houses, or
other places where frost can be kept out, some stools can be taken up
with the root intact in the early part of November, placed in boxes
of soil, and well watered-in. When drained, the boxes may be put in
any of those positions for their winter quarters, and, if kept moist,
will develop much earlier than the outdoor crops, provided they are
planted out early in April on a warm border, and protected with mats
when the weather is cold. Propagation may be effected by seeds, or by
suckers from the old stools, the latter being the better plan. In the
former case, sow the seeds in March, on a gentle hotbed, and prick
the seedlings off singly, when large enough, into small pots. Harden
off by the last week in May, and plant out in threes as previously
recommended, protecting the plants from late frosts. During the growing
season, give an abundance of water and liquid manure mulching, to
prevent undue evaporation. In November, well cover with dry litter
which will not heat; and, in hard frosts, or heavy snow, throw a few
mats over the beds, uncovering at the same time as recommended above
for the older plants. To propagate by rooted offsets or suckers, take
up and divide the stools, when they have made a fair amount of growth
in April or early in May, separating the suckers with as many roots and
as much soil adhering to them as possible. The old woody portions are
of little use, but they may be replanted to give off a fresh supply of
suckers for the next year, if required. Propagation by suckers, if they
are to be obtained, has many advantages; but care must be taken, in
removing them from old plants, that some roots are attached, or growth
will be uncertain. Seeds generally produce a large percentage of plants
that are useless, and this is not found out until the flower-heads
appear. On the other hand, suckers reproduce the parent plant, and
if these are previously selected, the superior stock is thereby
perpetuated.

_Sorts._ The Green and Purple are the best for ordinary purposes; and
of these preference should be given to the former. _See also_ =Cynara=.

=ARTICHOKE, JERUSALEM= (_Helianthus tuberosus_). A hardy
tuberous-rooted herbaceous perennial, native of Brazil. The roots are
used as a vegetable principally during the winter, sometimes as a dish,
but more generally for flavouring purposes. Plants will grow in almost
any position, but the best results and largest tubers are obtained
where they receive plenty of room and liberal treatment. Their culture
has been recommended as a substitute for the potato, but they are not
likely to take the place of this vegetable, the flavour being disliked
by many persons. A few are, however, generally acceptable.

_Cultivation._ To ensure the most successful results, trench over a
piece of ground in autumn, and give a light dressing of manure. Fork
over in March; at the same time plant good-shaped tubers (see Fig.
152) in rows about 3ft. apart, and allow from 18in. to 2ft. between the
tubers in the rows. Keep clear of weeds; and, as soon as the foliage
is yellow, in the latter part of the autumn, the roots will be fit for
use. The best plan with this crop is to leave it in the ground till
wanted, or till the end of February, and then to take up every tuber,
replanting those which are wanted for stock, and storing the others
away in a cold dry place. When they commence growth, they turn black,
and are of little use for cooking, save for flavouring soups. This
vegetable has of late years grown into favour as a marketable crop, and
the demand seems to be increasing. Considering its very easy culture,
it is fairly remunerative. _See also_ =Helianthus=.

[Illustration: FIG. 152. TUBERS OF JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE.]

=ARTICULATE, ARTICULATED.= Jointed; having joints.

=ARTILLERY PLANT.= _See_ =Pilea microphylla=.

=ARTOCARPEA†.= A tribe of the large order _UrticaceA|_.

=ARTOCARPUS= (from _artos_, bread, and _carpos_, fruit; the fruit, when
baked, resembling bread). Bread Fruit. SYNS. _Polyphema_, _Rademachia_,
_Rima_. ORD. _UrticaceA|_. TRIBE _ArtocarpeA|_. Included in this most
remarkable tribe, in addition to the Bread Fruit Tree, is the virulent
poisonous _Antiaris toxicaria_, and the economic Cow Tree (_Brosimum
Galactodendron_), of Caraccas. A genus of stove evergreen trees,
requiring a high and very moist atmosphere, a copious supply of water,
perfect drainage, and a compost of two parts rich loam and one of leaf
mould, with the addition of a little silver sand. Under all conditions,
this genus is difficult to propagate; the young and slender lateral
growths are adapted for cuttings; and suckers may be utilised when
procurable, which is very rare.

    =A. Cannoni= (Cannon's).* _l._ alternate, petiolate; petiole and
    midrib bright red; upper surface glossy, of a rich, full bronzy
    crimson hue, beautifully tinted with purple; under surface bright
    vinous red. The leaves vary much in form; some are simple and
    cordate at the base, with the apex irregularly lobate; some have
    the apex regularly three-lobed, with short, entire lobes; and
    others, again, are deep three-lobed, being divided nearly to the
    base, the segments, of which the centre one is largest, being
    slightly sinuate-lobed. _h._ 7ft. Society Islands, 1877. This is a
    most distinct and handsome ornamental-leaved plant.

    =A. incisa= (incised).* True Bread Fruit. _l._ from 2ft. to 3ft.
    long, deeply lobed or incised, deep green on the upper side, paler
    below. _h._ 50ft. South Sea Islands, 1793. This is a noble tree
    when full grown, and forms a most distinct and beautiful stove
    plant. The extraordinary fruit is produced from the axils of the
    leaves in large globular heads, and is highly valued as an article
    of food in its native country.

    =A. integrifolia= (entire-leaved). _l._ oblong, undivided,
    sinuated, scabrous, downy beneath. _h._ 30ft. India, 1778.

    =A. laciniata metallica= (laciniate, metallic). _l._ bronzy above,
    reddish purple beneath. Polynesia.

[Illustration: FIG. 153. ARUM MACULATUM.]

=ARUM= (formerly _aron_, and probably of Egyptian extraction). ORD.
_AroideA|_. A large genus of ornamental or curious, hardy, greenhouse
or stove perennials, with thick rhizomes and pedate or hastate leaves.
Spathe large, convolute; spadix naked and club-shaped at the top. They
are all of easy culture, and the indoor species will thrive with such
treatment as is given to _Alocasias_, _Caladiums_, &c. Rich soil is
one of the first conditions of success. Like most plants grown for the
beauty of their foliage, rapid and free growth is necessary. A compost
of good rich loam, with a third of sweet manure, thoroughly rotted, or
leaf mould, with some sharp sand, is very suitable. Plenty of moisture
is necessary during the growing season, after which the tender kinds
should be kept moderately dry, warm, and at rest during the winter. The
hardy kinds may be left in the ground. Propagated by seeds or division
of the roots--usually the latter. The best time to divide them is just
as they commence their new growth, securing as many roots as possible
to each division. Any rootless pieces should be placed in heat shortly
after removal; this hastens the formation of roots and excites top
growth. Arums are useful in sub-tropical gardening, and are otherwise
interesting plants both for indoors and outside cultivation; and the
hardy kinds are very suitable for naturalising in woodlands, &c. There
are many other species besides those here described, but the following
list comprises the best. Sub-sections of the genus will be found
treated separately, such as =Amorphophallus= (which _see_), &c.

[Illustration: FIG. 154. ARUM DRACUNCULUS.]

    =A. bulbosum= (bulbous). Synonymous with _A. ternatum_.

    =A. Dracontium= (Green Dragon). _fl._, spadix subulate, longer than
    the oblong convolute green spathe. June. _l._ pedate, entire. _h._
    2ft. North America, 1759. Hardy.

    =A. Dracunculus= (Common Dragon).* _fl._, spadix lanceolate,
    shorter than the ovate, flat, smooth, brown spathe. July. _l._
    pedate, entire. _h._ 3ft. South Europe, 1548. Hardy. SYN.
    _Dracunculus vulgaris_. See Fig. 154.

    =A. indicum= (Indian). _See_ =Colocasia indica=.

    =A. italicum= (Italian).* _fl._, spathe ventricose below, opening
    nearly flat and very broad above; apex often falling over very
    shortly after expansion, sometimes greenish yellow, at others
    nearly white; spadix yellowish or creamy white, club-shaped, about
    one-third as long as the spathe. Spring. _l._ appearing before
    winter, radical, triangular-hastate. _h._ 9in. to 2ft. Channel
    Islands and Cornwall, &c. Hardy.

    =A. i. marmorata= (marbled).* _l._ marbled with yellow. A very
    pretty and effective hardy border plant.

    =A. maculatum= (spotted). Lords and Ladies; Cuckoo Pint. _fl._,
    spathe ventricose below and above, constricted in the middle, with
    inflexed edges when open, spotted with dull purple; spadix usually
    purple, shorter than the spathe. Spring. _l._ vernal radical,
    hastate-sagittate, with deflexed lobes. _h._ 9in. Britain, &c. This
    species is admirably adapted for a corner in the wild garden. See
    Fig. 153.

    =A. Malyi= (Maly's). _fl._ whitish. Montenegro, 1860.

    =A. Nickelli= (Nickel's). Levant, 1859. A form of _A. italicum_.

    =A. orientale= (eastern). _fl._ resembling those of _A. maculatum_.
    June. _l._ brownish, simple, ovate, slightly sagittate. _h._ 1ft.
    Tauria, 1820. Hardy.

    =A. palA|stinum= (Palestine).* _fl._, spathe 7in. to 11in. long,
    purplish blotched or spotted outside, rich velvety black inside and
    yellowish white at the base of the tube; spadix much shorter than
    the spathe; petiole usually rising 8in. or 9in. above the leaves.
    May. _l._ four or five, triangular-hastate, acute, from 6in. to
    14in. long, and from 3-1/2in. to 7-1/2in. broad; petioles 12in. to
    18in. long. Jerusalem, 1864. Tender.

    =A. pictum= (painted). _h._ 2ft. Corsica, 1801. Hardy.

    =A. proboscideum= (proboscis-like).* _fl._, spathe greenish purple,
    navicular, horizontal, terminated by a straight tail; scapes
    arising from among the petioles. May. _l._ radical, about four,
    cordate-elliptic, entire. _h._ 6in. South Europe, 1823. Hardy.

    =A. spectabile= (showy). _fl._, spathe ovate-oblong, acuminate,
    dark purplish inside, longer than the purplish spadix. _l._ broadly
    hastate-sagittate. _h._ 1ft. Asia Minor. Half-hardy.

    =A. spirale= (spiral). _fl._, spadix lanceolate, shorter than
    the oblong-lanceolate spirally twisted brown spathe. May. _l._
    linear-lanceolate. Plant stemless. _h._ 1ft. China, 1816. Tender.

    =A. tenuifolium= (narrow-leaved).* _fl._, spadix subulate, longer
    than the white lanceolate spathe. April. _l._ linear-lanceolate.
    Plant stemless. _h._ 1ft. South Europe, 1570. Hardy.

    =A. ternatum= (three-leafleted). A synonym of _Pinellia tuberifera_.

    =A. variolatum= (variegated). Dalmatia, 1859. Hardy.

    =A. venosum= (veined). A synonym of _Sauromatum guttatum_.

    =A. Zelebori= (Zelebor's). A form of _A. maculatum_.

=ARUM LILY.= _See_ =Richardia A|thiopica=.

=ARUNDINARIA= (altered from _arundo_, a reed). ORD. _GramineA|_. A small
genus of hardy or nearly hardy shrubby grasses, having strong jointed
stems, and frequently included under _Bambusa_. For sub-tropical
gardening purposes more particularly it is exceedingly ornamental as
an isolated tuft. It thrives best in a deep, rich soil, and requires
plenty of water when in a growing state. Increased by division of the
roots.

[Illustration: FIG. 155. ARUNDINARIA FALCATA.]

    =A. falcata= (sickle-shaped).* _l._ linear-lanceolate, very acute,
    shortly stalked, very light green. Stems freely branched, deep
    green, and very slender. _h._ 3ft. to 6ft. India. An extremely
    handsome species for greenhouse decoration; also for outdoor work,
    particularly in the South of England, &c. SYN. _Bambusa gracilis_,
    of gardens.

    =A. Maximowiczii= (Maximowicz's). This Japanese species is believed
    to be allied to, if not identical with, _Bambusa Simonii_. Quite
    hardy.

    =A. Metake= (Metake). _l._ lanceolate, with very sharp points,
    dark green, persistent, narrowed into a short leafstalk, 6in. to
    12in. long; sheath ample. _h._ 4ft. to 6ft. Japan. A handsome,
    hardy, dwarf, much-branched species, forming grand specimens, and
    producing flowers very freely. SYN. _Bambusa japonica_.

=ARUNDO= (origin of word doubtful; stated by some authorities to be
from _arundo_, a reed; and others as from the Celtic _arn_, signifying
water). Reed. ORD. _GramineA|_. A very ornamental group of half or
quite hardy plants, of very easy culture in ordinary garden soil,
preferring damp situations. Panicle loose; calyx two-valved, unequal,
many-flowered; corolla of two very unequal valves; all, except
the lower and imperfect one, surrounded by a tuft of hairs. Fruit
free, covered by the corolla. Arundos are very valuable either for
conservatory decoration, sub*-tropical gardening, or cultivation in
clumps on the turf of the flower-garden or pleasure ground, and the
margins of lakes. Although well worth growing, all are inferior to
their ally, the Pampas Grass. Propagated by seeds or divisions, the
spring being the best time to adopt either method of increase.

    =A. conspicua= (conspicuous).* _fl._ silky-white, on large drooping
    racemes, and lasting in beauty for several months. _h._ 3ft. to
    8ft., but in a good deep and sandy loam it sometimes attains the
    height of 12ft. New Zealand, 1843. This fine species grows in dense
    tufts, from which arise numerous leathery, narrow, smooth (or
    slightly rough), long curving leaves, and erect, slender culms. The
    plant is not sufficiently hardy to withstand a severe winter, and
    should, therefore, be protected with mats, or be grown in tubs, so
    that it can be removed under shelter before the approach of winter.
    These precautions are unnecessary in the more southern counties of
    England.

    =A. Donax= (Donax).* Great Reed. _fl._ reddish, ultimately whitish,
    in numerous spikelets, forming a large compact panicle 12in. to
    16in. long. Autumn. _l._ alternate, lanceolate-acute, large, and
    ornamental, glaucous green, arching. _h._ about 12ft. South Europe,
    1648. This also requires protection during winter in the colder
    counties. See Fig. 156.

    =A. D. versicolor= (various-coloured).* _h._ 3ft. South Europe.
    Although much smaller, this variety is far superior to the type
    for gardening purposes, and has its leaves ribboned with white. It
    requires a deep, well drained, sandy loam to thrive well, and a
    thorough winter protection of cocoa-fibre refuse or coal ashes. For
    isolated tufts or groups, few plants can equal it. It is propagated
    by placing a stem in water, which induces little rooted plants to
    start from the joints; these should be separated, potted off, and
    kept in frames until thoroughly established.

    =A. mauritanica= (Mediterranean Reed). This is a rare greenhouse
    species, closely allied to _A. Donax_, but inferior to it.

[Illustration: FIG. 156. ARUNDO DONAX.]

=ARYTERA.= A synonym of =Ratonia= (which _see_).

=ASAFA"TIDA.= _See_ =Narthex AsafA"tida=.

=ASARABACCA.= _See_ =Asarum europA|um=.

=ASARUM= (from _a_, not, and _saron_, feminine; derivation doubtful).
ORD. _AristolochiaceA|_. Curious hardy herbaceous perennials, with
bell-shaped, three-cleft perianths. They should be planted at the
foot of the rockery, or in borders or woodlands, as they are not very
showy, but are, nevertheless, worth growing, and easily propagated by
divisions, in spring.

    =A. canadense= (Canadian).* _fl._ brown, campanulate, on a short
    peduncle, sometimes nearly buried. May and June. _l._ in pairs,
    broadly reniform. _h._ 1ft. Canada, &c., 1713.

[Illustration: FIG. 157. ASARUM CAUDATUM.]

    =A. caudatum= (tailed).* _fl._ brownish-red, with attenuated
    or caudate calyx lobes. July. _l_. cordate-reniform, hooded,
    sub-acute, or bluntish, slightly pubescent. California, 1880. A
    rare and pretty species. See Fig. 157.

    =A. europA|um= (European). A sarabacca. _fl._ dull brown, solitary,
    rather large, drooping; segments of perianth incurved. May. _l._
    two on each stem, roundish-reniform, stalked, slightly waved. _h._
    1ft. England.

=ASCENDING.= Directed upwards; as the stem, which is the ascending axis.

=ASCLEPIADEA†.= A large order of, for the most part, lactescent,
climbing shrubs. Flowers sub-umbellate, fascicled or racemose,
interpetiolar; pollen collected in the form of waxy masses, coalescing
to the cells of the anthers; follicles two, one of which is abortive.
Leaves entire, usually opposite.

=ASCLEPIAS= (the Greek name of A†sculapius of the Latins). Swallow-wort.
ORD. _AsclepiadeA|_. Erect, hardy, herbaceous or sub-shrubby perennials,
except where otherwise specified. Corolla five-parted, reflexed;
umbels interpetiolar; corona seated on the upper part of the tube of
the filaments, five-leaved. Leaves opposite, verticillate, sometimes
alternate. Most of the hardy species are very handsome border plants,
thriving in peaty, or light rich soil, and are increased by dividing
the roots in spring, and sometimes also by seeds. The doubtfully hardy
or rarer species should always be grown in a peat soil, and have a
little protection during severe frost, by mulching the roots. The most
important of the greenhouse and stove species is _A. curassavica_. In
order to obtain good bushy specimens of this, it will be necessary to
cut the plants back annually, after keeping them slightly dry, and
resting for a month or two in midwinter. When growth has sufficiently
advanced, they should be shaken out and repotted. At this stage, a
close, moist atmosphere will be needful to produce the usually very
free growth. The points of the shoots must be nipped out, in order to
promote a bushy habit. When the pots have become filled with roots,
liquid manure may be applied; but it must be quite clear and not over
strong. All the indoor species grow best in good fibry loam and leaf
mould, and require to be potted firmly. Cuttings should be secured in
spring, struck in gentle heat, under a bell glass, and as soon as they
are well rooted, potted into 60-size pots. A shift must be given as
often as the pots become filled with roots, up to the time when the
plant commences flowering. Seeds may be sown in pots in spring, pricked
out singly when large enough, and then treated similarly to cuttings.

    =A. acuminata= (taper-pointed).* _fl._ red and white; umbels
    lateral, solitary, erect. July. _l._ ovate, sub-cordate,
    acuminated, on short petioles; superior ones sessile, glabrous, but
    rough on the edges. Stems erect, glabrous, simple. _h._ 2ft. New
    Jersey, 1826. Hardy, herbaceous.

    rather downy, simple, seldom a little branched. _h._ 1ft. to 3ft.
    Tropical America, 1692. The white-flowered variety is a very pretty
    contrast. Stove herbaceous.

    glabrous above, downy beneath. Stem thick, woolly, simple. _h._
    2ft. to 3ft. West America, 1846.

    =A. hybrida= (hybrid). A synonym of _A. purpurascens_.

    =A. incarnata= (flesh-coloured).* _fl._ red or purplish; umbels
    numerous, usually twin. July. _l._ opposite, lanceolate, rather
    woolly on both surfaces. Stem erect, branched and tomentose at
    the top. _h._ 2ft. Canada (on the banks of rivers), 1710. Hardy,

    =A. phytolaccoides= (Phytolacca-like). _fl._ purple; corona white,
    with truncate leaflets; umbels lateral and terminal, solitary, on
    long peduncles, drooping. July. _l._ broad, ovate-oblong, acute,
    glabrous, paler beneath. Stem erect, simple, spotted with purple.
    _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. Virginia and Carolina (on the mountains), 1812.

    =A. purpurascens= (purplish). _fl._ purple; umbels erect. July.
    _l._ opposite, large, ovate, with a purplish middle nerve, villous
    beneath. Stem simple, rather hairy at top, brownish green at
    bottom. _h._ 2ft. to 3ft. Virginia (in shady swamps), 1732. Hardy.
    SYN. _A. hybrida_.

    =A. quadrifolia= (four-leaved).* _fl._ white, small, sweet-scented,
    with red nectaries; umbels twin, terminal, loose-flowered; pedicels
    filiform. July. _l._ ovate, acuminated, petiolate; those in the
    middle of the stem larger, and four in a whorl; the rest opposite.
    Stems erect, simple, glabrous. _h._ 1ft. New York, 1820. Hardy
    species.

    =A. rubra= (red), _fl._ red; umbels compound, July, August. _l._
    alternate, ovate, acuminated. Stem erect, simple. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft.
    Virginia, 1825.

    =A. Sullivanti= (Sullivant's). Similar to _A. syriaca_, but having
    larger and deeper coloured flowers.

    =A. syriaca= (Syrian).* _fl._ pale purple, sweet scented, in large,
    loose, drooping umbels. July. _l._ opposite, lanceolate-oblong, or
    oval, gradually acute, tomentose beneath. Stems simple. _h._ 3ft.
    to 5ft. North America, 1629. SYN. _A. Cornuti_.

[Illustration: FIG. 158. FLOWERING BRANCH OF ASCLEPIAS TUBEROSA.]

    =A. tuberosa= (tuberous).* _fl._ bright orange, very showy;
    umbels disposed in a terminal sub-corymb. July to September. _l._
    scattered, oblong-lanceolate, hairy. Stems erectish, divaricately
    branched at top, very hairy. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. North America (in
    stony, sandy fields and woods), 1690. A desirable hardy herbaceous
    border plant. See Fig. 158.

    =A. variegata= (variegated). _fl._, petals and foliola of corona
    white, fructification red, in dense umbels, very handsome; umbels
    almost sessile; pedicels hairy. July. _l._ opposite, ovate,
    petiolate, wrinkled, naked. Stems simple. erect, variegated with
    purple. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. New York to Carolina (on dry, sandy
    hills), 1597.

    =A. verticillata= (whorled). _fl._, corolla with yellowish green
    petals and white nectaries; umbels many-flowered. July and
    August. _l._ very narrow, linear, thick, quite glabrous, usually
    verticillate, but sometimes scattered. Stems erect, often branched,
    having a downy line on one side. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. New Jersey, 1759.

=ASCYRON.= _See_ =Hypericum Ascyron=.

=ASCYRUM= (from _a_, without, and _skyros_, hard; that is to say,
a plant which is soft to the touch). ORD. _HypericinA|_. A genus of
elegant little herbs and sub-shrubs, with sessile, entire leaves,
destitute of pellucid dots, but usually furnished with black dots
beneath. Flowers resembling _Hypericum_. They require to be protected
during winter by a frame; for this purpose they should be grown in
pots, as they never exist long in the open border. A compost of peat,
pure leaf soil, and sand, in equal portions, suits them well; young
cuttings of the shrubby kinds will root in sand under a hand bell
glass. Propagated by careful divisions of the roots in spring. All may
be raised from seeds.

    =A. amplexicaule= (stem-clasping). _fl._ yellow, few, axillary, and
    terminal; corymbs naked. July. _l._ stem-clasping, ovate, cordate,
    sinuately-curled. Stem dichotomously panicled. _h._ 2ft. North
    America, 1823. The flowers and leaves are longer in this than in
    any other of the species.

    =A. Crux AndreA|.=* St. Andrew's Cross. _fl._, petals narrow-pale,
    yellow, nearly sessile, in terminal corymbs. July. _l._
    ovate-linear, obtuse, usually in bundles in the axils. Stem
    shrubby, round. _h._ 1ft. North America (in sandy fields), 1759.
    This proves to be quite hardy in many situations.

    =A. hypericoides= (Hypericum-like). _fl._ yellow. August. _l._
    linear-oblong, obtuse. _h._ 2ft. North America, 1759.

    =A. stans= (standing). St. Peter's Wort. _fl._ yellow. August. _l._
    oval or oblong, somewhat clasping. _h._ 2ft. North America, 1816.

=ASHES.= The earthy or mineral particles of combustible substances,
remaining after combustion. Ashes are amongst the most economical
manures.

_Vegetable Ashes_ are generally the best application for manuring
boggy, cold, and, consequently, sour and unprofitable land, in
quantities of about forty bushels per acre, thinly and evenly
distributed. The annual exhaustion of salts from large crops of grain,
roots, and grass, is from 180lb. to more than 250lb. per acre; and the
aggregate of a few years will so far impoverish the soil in one or more
of the principles necessary to sustain a luxuriant vegetation, that
it will cease to yield remunerating returns. The ashes of vegetables
consist of such elements as are always required for their perfect
maturity, and it is evident they must furnish one of the best saline
manures which can be supplied for their growth; they contain, in fact,
every element, and generally in the right proportions, for insuring a
full and rapid growth. Both gardener and farmer will therefore perceive
the great value of Ashes to their crops.

_Coal Ashes._ The bituminous and anthracite coals afford Ashes, and,
although inferior in quality to those made from wood and vegetables,
are, like them, a valuable manure, and they should be applied to the
land in a similar manner. If they contain many cinders, from not having
been thoroughly burned, they are more suited to heavy than to light
soils. Coal Ashes, if very fine, may be sprinkled half an inch deep on
the surface, over peas and beans, &c., to preserve them from mice; they
may also be used for garden and greenhouse walks, where bricks or tiles
are absent, being tidy in appearance, and an excellent substitute for
other and more expensive material.

_Peat Ashes._ Peat approaching to purity, when thrown out of its bed
and thoroughly dried, may be burned to an imperfect Ash, and when
it does not reach this point, it will become thoroughly charred,
and reduced to cinders. The process of burning should be as slow as
possible. In either form, it is a valuable dressing for the soil.

=ASH-TREE.= _See_ =Fraxinus=.

=ASIATIC POISON BULB.= _See_ =Crinum asiaticum=.

=ASIMINA= (meaning unknown). ORD. _AnonaceA|_. Hardy shrubs, with
oblong, cuneated, usually deciduous leaves. Flowers sometimes rising
before the leaves, usually solitary and axillary. They thrive freely
in a mixture of sand and peat. Propagated by layers put down in the
autumn, or by seed, procured from their native country. Seedlings
should be raised in pots, and sheltered in winter, until they have
acquired a considerable size.

[Illustration: FIG. 159. FLOWERING BRANCH OF ASIMINA TRILOBA.]

    =A. triloba= (three-lobed).* _fl._ campanulate, the three outer
    petals pale purplish, and the three inner ones smaller, purplish
    on the outside as well as the inside at the base and apex, with
    the middle yellow, about 2in. diameter, produced between the upper
    leaves. May. _l._ oblong-cuneated, often acuminated, and, as well
    as the branches, smoothish. _h._ 10ft. Pennsylvania, 1736. A small
    tree or shrub. See Fig. 159.

=ASKALLON= (the Eschallot). _See_ =Allium ascalonicum=.

=ASPALATHUS= (from _a_, not, and _spao_, to extract; in reference
to the difficulty of extracting its thorns from a wound). Including
_Sarcophyllus_. ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Shrubs or sub-shrubs, natives,
with one exception, of the Cape of Good Hope. Flowers usually yellow,
furnished with three bracteoles, or a leaf comprised of three leaflets.
Leaves of three to five leaflets, disposed palmately, rarely pinnately,
having scarcely any or very short petioles. All the species are pretty
when in flower, and thrive in a mixture of loam, peat, and sand. Young
cuttings of half-ripened wood will strike in April, in sand, under
bell glasses, which must be wiped dry occasionally. But little water
is needed. Over a hundred species are known; those introduced are very
rarely seen in cultivation.

=ASPARAGUS= (from _a_, intensive, and _sparasso_, to tear; in
reference to the strong prickles of some species). ORD. _LiliaceA|_.
Erect or climbing herbs or shrubs, with very small scale-like leaves,
and a profusion of numerous slender fascicled-needle, rather spiny
branchlets. Flowers axillary, inconspicuous. Fruit baccate. The indoor
species will all thrive well in a warm greenhouse temperature, provided
they have partial shade, a good supply of moisture at the roots, and
are not kept too close, in a moderately rich sandy compost. The hardy
species are propagated chiefly by seeds and divisions of the roots.
Rich sandy loam is necessary, and otherwise they may be treated as
ordinary perennials. Some of the species belonging to this genus are
among the most elegant of foliage plants for cutting purposes. _A.
decumbens_ and _A. scandens_ make excellent plants for Wardian cases,
and may be cut in freely if they exceed their limits.

ASPARAGUS (_A. officinalis_) AS A VEGETABLE. The value and importance
of this plant as a vegetable cannot be over-estimated; it is
extensively grown, and, when properly managed, produces a fairly
lucrative crop.

_Soil and Bed._ The first thing to be done in the preparation of
an Asparagus bed to stand for any length of time, is to secure an
efficient drainage; and on wet soils this is best effected by placing
a layer of brick rubbish over the whole of the bottom, and connecting
this with a drain. On gravelly or other soils which are drained
naturally, of course, this is not needed; but if really good crops are
a _desideratum_, water should not stand within 3ft. of the surface. In
all cases, the ground must be dug to a depth of 18in., and, if stiff,
a goodly amount of road sweepings, or other gritty materials, should
be well mixed with the staple soil. Asparagus requires a good soil,
neither too heavy nor too light.

_Manuring._ After the soil has been well trenched, and has lain long
enough to settle down, a good dressing of manure--thoroughly rotted,
and not too rank, at the rate of from twenty to thirty tons to the
acre, dug into the surface of the beds-A--will be found very beneficial.
If possible, this should be introduced in January; and then, if the
weather permits, the beds should be forked two or three times by the
end of March, so as to render the soil as friable as possible. A very
good manure, and one that is easily obtained, is common garden salt.
This may be given annually to established beds. A moderate dressing
should be applied just before growth commences in spring, but a little
will do no harm at other times during the summer. It is best scattered
on with the hand, and a showery day should be selected, as it will
then soon disappear. Salt, besides acting as a manure, has also the
properties of keeping the beds cool and moist in hot weather, and of
preventing the growth of weeds.

_Planting._ Asparagus can be planted during March and April, the latter
month being the best time for the work. The soil having been thoroughly
prepared, the next point is to decide on the size of the beds; this
depends on the size of garden, and the class of "grass" desired. When
very large and fine stocks are the object in view, the best results
will accrue if the plants are fully a yard apart each way; but this
means a comparatively small crop. A good plan is to make the beds 3ft.
wide, planting two rows, at a distance of 1ft. from each other, and
allowing 18in. between each plant, placing them in alternate order.
An 18in. alley should be allowed between the beds. The roots used for
making the beds should be one year old, and fresh from the ground. In
planting, pull out a wide drill with a hoe, or other tool, to the depth
of about 3in. or 4in., and spread out the roots all round. Carefully
shake the soil in amongst the roots, and, if dry, apply some water
through a coarse-rosed watering pot, to settle the earth around them.
At intervals, as necessary, give other waterings till September, when
they should be discontinued. At all times, keep the beds free from
weeds, removing them by the hand to prevent injury to the crowns of
the plants. If the ground is good, no liquid manure will be needed the
first year. As soon as the foliage turns yellow, cut it off, cleanly
rake over the beds, and leave till about January, when a top-dressing
of from 1in. to 3in. of thoroughly rotted manure may be applied with
advantage. At the end of February, rake off the bed all loose straw
or other _debris_, and throw on them a little of the soil from the
alleys, raking down, and finishing off the edges squarely and neatly.
During this and succeeding years, apply liquid manure and clear water,
from time to time, as required; and, provided the manure is not of too
great strength, there is scarcely any limit to its application; but,
in many instances, beds which have only received an annual dressing
have given a good return. Each year they must be cut over and dressed
as before described, but care must be taken to keep them flat on the
surface, otherwise the plants will die out for want of moisture. When
the produce appears, the beds should be kept cut over until the 20th
of June, after which, cutting should cease, or they will be rendered
comparatively unproductive. Cutting can commence the second or third
year, or as soon as there is any "grass" worth taking. Several methods
of growing these plants could be cited, but that which we have
recommended will be found most satisfactory.

[Illustration: FIG. 160. ASPARAGUS, Crown for Lifting.]

_Seeds._ Plants are raised by sowing seeds in rows across the kitchen
garden, or selected quarter, about the month of April. The seedlings
make a growth, and form good plants during the first season. In March
or April of the following year, or the year after, they may be removed,
and planted out permanently, as already alluded to. Many cultivators
prefer growing their own plants from seed; because during the transit
of the roots from any distance to where they are to be grown, a
frequent and injurious exhaustion takes place, and particularly so when
they are carelessly packed.

_Forcing._ Asparagus can, if properly treated, be obtained from
December onwards; and at Christmas time the produce is very valuable;
but, in order to obtain it at this season, it will be necessary to
resort to forcing. Prepare some beds to secure a lasting heat, and on
these place about 3in. of ordinary garden soil, not very stiff. Then
take the roots, and place them crown upwards, and moderately close
together, shaking the soil well amongst the roots, and covering about
a couple of inches deep. Water well, to settle the whole, and put on
the lights, allowing a little ventilation, to let out any steam which
may arise. Unless the weather be very cold indeed, give a little air
at all times, and only cover the lights in actual frost. From time to
time, apply fresh linings of hot manure, and in cold rains, or wind,
cover the outsides of the frames with old sacks, or other things which
will keep in the heat. A regular and steady temperature of 60deg. will
force this plant with better results than a higher one. Houses that are
fitted with hot-water pipes to give bottom heat can be used equally as
well as manure beds, and so long as the soil is kept moist, the heat
thus obtained is as good as any for the purpose, and much less trouble
than fermenting materials. To keep up a regular supply, a succession of
beds will be necessary. Asparagus can be forced, or rather forwarded,
in pots or boxes, in a warm greenhouse or vinery, and, of course,
when the plants are done with, they can be cast away. We give an
illustration (Fig. 160) of a bearing crown fit for gentle forcing; but,
of course, it must not be left so bare of earth as appears here, which
is done for the purpose of clearness.

_Varieties._ Connover's Colossal, and Giant, are the most esteemed.
Strains are frequently largely advertised as improvements on the sorts
above-mentioned, and the charges are higher accordingly. The difference
may be generally attributed to the culture the plants receive more than
to an improved variety. When saving seed for home sowing, they should
be taken from the strongest growths, or deterioration will ensue.

    numerous spreading or ascending branches and branchlets.

    =A. scandens= (climbing).* _fl._ whitish, axillary on the ultimate
    branchlets, succeeded by round orange-coloured berries. The annual,
    much-branched, unarmed stems bear, usually in threes, numerous
    small linear-pointed leaves, which on the ultimate branches spread
    nearly in one plane. Cape of Good Hope, 1795. An elegant climbing
    greenhouse perennial.

    =A. virgatus= (twiggy).* A remarkably elegant feathery looking
    plant, of shrubby habit. The stems, which issue from the crown of
    the stout fleshy roots, are of a dark green colour, and bear at
    the upper end a corymbose head of erect branches, of which the
    lowest is the youngest or most recently developed. These branches
    are again twice branched, the ultimate branchlets being furnished
    with needle-shaped false leaves, 1/2in. long, which usually grow in
    threes. South Africa, 1862.

=ASPARAGUS BEETLE= (_Crioceris asparagi_), or "Cross-bearer." This
beautiful little insect is blue-black or greenish; the thorax is red
with two black spots, and the wing-cases are yellow, with a black cross
on them; the legs and antennA| are black. The short grey larva is flat
underneath, arched on the back, and covered with hairs. The sides are
of an olive hue, and the little legs and head are black. It ejects a
drop of blackish fluid from the mouth when touched. When full grown,
which takes about a fortnight, the larva measures about two lines in
length; the average length of the perfect Beetle is about three lines.
Although this insect does not actually destroy the plants, it inflicts
much damage on the foliage, and checks the growth of the stems after
they have attained some size, in consequence of which the foliage
becomes much less in the next season. The eggs are fixed to the shoots,
and are small, dark, pointed bodies. The larvA| do the harm, as they
feed on the bark and tender portions of the plants. The mature Beetles
should be picked off by hand, and, by commencing early enough in the
season, their numbers will be greatly reduced. Syringing the plants
with water, heated to a temperature that will not injure the plants, is
found a useful method for removing the grubs.

_White Hellebore._ Freshly-ground White Hellebore, sprinkled over the
foliage while it is damp, and repeating the operation at intervals of
about eight days for a season, will generally effect a riddance; but
the following will usually be found better in such cases. Neither must
be applied until after cutting ceases, as they are very poisonous.

_Paris Green._ This, mixed and used as for Cherry Fly (_see_ =Black
Fly=), will generally got rid of the Beetle, if applied about thrice
each season for two years. It should, however, only be used in severe
cases.

_Soot_, applied in the same manner as White Hellebore, and in liberal
quantities, will, in a season or two, clear the beds. If a bushel of
salt be mixed with each twenty bushels of soot, it will enhance the
effect.

=ASPARAGUS KNIFE.= The Asparagus Knife consists of a strong blade
fixed in a handle. There are, or were, three kinds employed: In one
form, the blade was blunt on both sides, straight, with a sharp tip,
and not unlike a small chisel. Another had its blade slightly hooked,
and serrated at one end. But the best is that now almost universally
employed, and which is illustrated by Fig. 162.

[Illustration: FIG. 162. ASPARAGUS KNIFE.]

=ASPASIA= (from _aspazomai_, I embrace; the column embraced by the
labellum). ORD. _OrchidaceA|_. A genus of elegant stove Epidendrum-like
epiphytal orchids, with the lip united to the column, and broad, thin
pseudo-bulbs. The name Aspasia is now and then met with attached to a
totally different genus. Salisbury gave it to a liliaceous plant which
is now referred to _Ornithogalum_. For culture and propagation, _see_

    halves; lip fiddle-shape, its back very great, elliptic, apiculate;
    an orange-coloured area stands at its base, a wide violet disc
    before and around it. _h._ 9in. Costa Rica, 1876. Distinguished
    from _A. lunata_ in having thirteen keels at the base of the lip,
    which is higher inserted, and in the echinulate anther. It is a
    beautiful but rare novelty.

    =A. psittacina= (parrot-like).* _fl._, sepals and petals light
    green, with brown transverse bars, which sometimes consist
    of separate stripes, at other times of confluent ones; the
    fiddle-shaped lip shows two keels and a few purplish dots over its
    top; the column is brown at its top, then violet, and white at the
    base. Ecuador, 1878. It has a raceme of several flowers, usually
    one-sided, bent over.

    =A. variegata= (variegated).* _fl._ green, spotted with yellowish
    red; sepals linear oblong; petals somewhat rhomboid, acute; lateral
    lobes of lip recurved, middle one fleshy, serrated. February. _h._
    9in. Panama, 1836. Deliciously sweet-scented in the morning.

=ASPEN.= _See_ =Populus tremula=.

=ASPERA.= Rough, with hairs or points.

=ASPERULA= (from _asper_, rough; in allusion to the leaves). Woodruff.
ORD. _RubiaceA|_. Hardy herbs, rarely small shrubs. Flowers terminal
and axillary, in fascicles. Leaves opposite, with one, two, or three
stipulas on each side; they are therefore called four to eight in a
whorl, but between the uppermost leaves there are no stipulas. Stems
and branches usually tetragonal. Most of the species are very pretty
when in flower, and are, therefore, well adapted for borders, rockwork,
and shady places, in almost any garden soil. Propagated by divisions of
the roots during spring and early summer. Herbaceous perennials, except
where otherwise stated.

    bracts of involucre shorter than the flowers. Summer. _l._
    lanceolate, bristly, about eight in a whorl. _h._ 1ft. Caucasus,

    clusters of fragrant flowers, admirably adapted for bouquet making.
    SYN. _A. azurea-setosa_. See Fig. 163.

[Illustration: FIG. 163. ASPERULA ORIENTALIS, showing Habit and Portion
of Inflorescence.]

    ovate. Plant procumbent, unless supported. Stem 1ft. to 2ft. long,
    purplish. Europe, 1764.

=ASPHALT.= Artificial Asphalt is now generally used in England for
footpaths, &c. The recipes are various, one of the best being the
following: Lime rubbish two parts, coal ashes one part (both must be
very dry), sifted very fine; mix them, and leave a hole in the middle
of the heap, wherein pour boiling hot coal tar; mix well together. When
as stiff as mortar, lay it down, 3in. thick, on a dry and previously
well-levelled surface. A boy should follow with dry, finely-sifted
sand, distributing just enough to prevent his boots sticking to the
tar. Two men should be employed for the tarring, whilst another should
attend to the boiling operation. Only just enough tar to last ten
minutes must be taken from the furnace at one time, as, if it be not
boiling, the walks will become soft under the action of very hot sun.
This may be repeated every three years. It is imperative that the
surface, lime, coal ashes and sand be perfectly dry, and that the days
selected for the operation be very fine, the hotter the better. Another
excellent plan is that of using gas lime and coal ashes. There must
be a firm foundation and smooth surface. Spread the gas lime to about
1-1/2in. deep, and level with the back of a spade. Over this place a
thin layer of coal dust, and well roll. The work is then complete.

=ASPHODEL.= _See_ =Asphodelus=.

    awl-shaped, triangular, furrowed, smooth, dark green, marked with
    lines of a paler tint; root leaves tufted. Stem 3ft. or 4ft.
    high. Sicily, 1596. The best known and handsomest species. SYN.
    _Asphodelus luteus_.

    =A. l. fl.-pl.= This resembles the species, but the flowers are

    and often cordate, the lower merely rounded at the base. _sori_
    linear-oblong, two or three on each side of the midrib. Andes of
    Columbia and Peru. A very rare greenhouse species, allied to our
    native _A. Trichomanes_.

    toothed, the two sides unequal, and the lower one at the base
    obliquely truncate. _sori_ in long irregular lines reaching nearly
    to the edge. Polynesian Islands, &c., widely distributed. A very
    elegant greenhouse species.

    =A. fejeense= (Fijian).* _rhiz._ wide-climbing. _sti._ 6in. long,
    scaly below. _fronds_ 18in. to 24in. long, 1in. to 1-1/2in.
    broad, lanceolate, caudate, or acuminate at the apex, and often
    proliferous, narrowed below to a truncate base, the margin nearly
    entire. _sori_ reaching from the midrib nearly to the edges. Fiji,
    Samoa. &c. Stove species.

    =A. Fernandesianum= (Juan Fernandez). A variety of _A. lunulatum_.

    =A. Filix-fA"mina= (Lady Fern).* _sti._ tufted, 6in. to 12in. long.
    _fronds_ 1ft. to 3ft. long, 6in. to 12in. broad, oblong-lanceolate,

    inciso-pinnatifid. _sori_ linear-oblong, the lower ones often
    curved. Britain, and world-wide in its distribution. SYN. _Athyrium
    Filix-fA"mina_. This handsome deciduous species has a great number
    of varieties, the most important of which are described below:

    =A. F.-f. acrocladon= (summit-branched).* _fronds_ 9in. to 15in.
    long, slender, bi- or tripinnate, the lower part very narrow, with
    the apices of the pinnA| sometimes crested; upper portion of the
    frond freely branched, divisions narrow and crested, the whole
    forming a broad head.

    =A. F.-f. acuminatum= (taper-pointed).* _fronds_ 9in. to 12in.
    long, lanceolate-acuminate in outline, with closely set pinnA|,

    2in. to 4in. broad, lanceolate-acuminate in outline, with variously
    furcate apices; pinnA| closely set with distinctly acuminated
    apices, and small roundish obtuse serrated pinnules.

    =A. F.-f. Applebyanum= (Appleby's).* _fronds_ narrow, 12in. to
    24in. long, with short blunt pinnA|, while the extremities are
    dilated into a broad furcated crest, which is very striking upon
    such a narrow frond.

    =A. F.-f. Barnesii= (Barnes's).* _fronds_ 9in. to 15in. long, 3in.
    to 4in. wide, lanceolate in outline, abrupt at the top, bipinnate;
    pinnA| alternate, closely set, lanceolate, acutely pointed, with
    densely set, narrow, acutely serrate pinnules, with a very
    membranous texture.

    =A. F.-f. calothrix= (beautiful-hair).* _fronds_ 9in. to 15in.
    long, copiously divided into exquisitely fine segments, so that the
    fronds present a very light and delicate appearance.

    =A. F.-f. contortum= (contorted).* _fronds_ very diversified,
    the various pinnA| occasionally combining the characters of the
    varieties _Applebyanum_ and _VictoriA|_.

    =A. F.-f. coronatum= (coronate).* _fronds_ 6in. to 12in. long, 2in.
    wide; pinnA| distinctly forked, sometimes slightly crested at the
    apices; the upper extremity of the frond copiously forked, and by
    the ramification of the divisions a broad crest is formed, about
    3in. to 4in. across.

    =A. F.-f. corymbiferum= (corymbose).* _fronds_ 12in. to 18in. long,
    4in. to 7in. broad, lanceolate-acuminate in general outline; pinnA|
    closely set, usually forked and crested at the apices, while the
    extremities of the fronds are dilated into broad crests, nearly or
    quite as wide at the broadest portion of the frond.

    =A. F.-f. crispum= (crispy or curled).* _fronds_ 6in. long, densely
    set with very finely divided pinnA|, which are thickly curled,
    presenting a crispy appearance.

    =A. F.-f. dissectum= (dissected).* _fronds_ 6in. to 12in. long,
    ovate or broadly lanceolate in form, with irregular and unequal
    pinnA|; the pinnules also differ very much, and are deeply cut,
    nearly down to the rachises.

    =A. F.-f. Elworthii= (Elworth's).* _fronds_ 12in. to 20in. long,
    lanceolate, tripinnate, terminated with a very dense crest, from
    4in. to 6in. across; pinnA| and frequently the pinnules also more or
    less forked and crested.

    =A. F.-f. FieldiA|= (Field's).* _fronds_ 12in. to 20in. long,
    narrow, with regular or variously-forked divided pinnA|, sometimes
    arranged crosswise, with a very graceful disposition.

    =A. F.-f. FriselliA|= (Frisell's).* _fronds_ pendent, sometimes
    2ft. long, rarely exceeding 1in. wide, bi- or tripinnate; pinnA|
    alternate, imbricated, flabellate, with the margins of the pinnules
    or ultimate divisions dentated.

    =A. F.-f. grandiceps= (large-crested).* _fronds_ 9in. to 15in.
    long, lanceolate in outline, copiously forked both at the
    extremities of the pinnA| and frond. The latter is furnished with
    a very large globose crest, which causes the frond to present a
    beautifully arched appearance.

    =A. F-f. GrantA|= (Grant's).* _fronds_ 9in. to 12in. long,
    lanceolate, or broadly so, very thickly set with pinnA|, copiously
    divided, with the apices of the latter turned up, so that the plant
    has a crisp or bristly appearance.

    =A. F.-f. Jonesii= (Jones's).* _fronds_ 12in. to 18in. long,
    oblong-lanceolate in outline, slightly acuminate, bipinnate,
    furnished at the extremities with a small crest; pinnA| alternate,
    copiously forked and crested at the apices, even having larger
    crests than the one at the upper extremity of the frond; pinnules
    narrow, dentate, slightly crested.

    =A. F.-f. minimum= (smallest).* _fronds_ 4in. to 6in. long, 1in.
    wide, lanceolate, bipinnate; pinnules densely set, imbricated, and
    crispy.

    =A. F.-f. Moorei= (Moore's).* _fronds_ 4in. to 8in. long, linear,
    terminated with a broad tasselled crest, 3in. or more in diameter;
    pinnA| small, scattered, variously forked, crested, and slender.

    =A. F.-f. multifidum= (many-fid).* A very vigorous growing variety,
    producing fronds as large as those of the type, terminated with
    large tasselled crests; pinnA| and pinnules narrow, the former
    furnished with small crested apices. A variety known as _nanum_
    much resembles the foregoing, but the crests are more dense, and
    the fronds are usually not more than half the length.

    =A. F.-f. pannosum= (pannose).* _fronds_ 10in. to 20in. long,
    lanceolate in outline, from 4in. to 6in. in the broadest part, bi-
    or (rarely) tripinnate; pinnA| thickly set, closely alternated,
    lanceolate-acuminate in form, with deep cut pinnules, and
    distinctly but irregularly lobed; the whole frond is frequently
    tinged with reddish-purple.

    =A. F.-f. plumosum= (feathery).* _fronds_ 12in. to 30in. long,
    4in. to 10in. broad, broadly lanceolate in outline, tripinnate,
    beautifully arched; pinnA| of the same form as the frond, copiously
    divided; pinnules again divided into very fine segments. There are
    several forms of this charming variety.

    =A. F.-f. Pritchardii= (Pritchard's).* _fronds_ 12in. to 30in.
    long, very narrow, tapering especially towards the apices; pinnA|
    decussate, imbricate, rather irregular, with the margins of the
    pinnules dentate. There is also a variety named _cristatum_, which
    is finely crested at the apices of the pinnA|, and is particularly
    striking.

    =A. F.-f. ramosa= (branched).* _fronds_ 9in. to 12in. long, the
    lower portion sparsely set with short irregular pinnA|, sharply cut
    into finely dentate pinnules; the upper part is divided into two
    main branches, which are again variously forked, and furnished with
    short pinnA|, the ultimate divisions furcate and slightly crested.

    =A. F.-f. scopA|= (heavily-crested).* _fronds_ 6in. to 16in. long,
    with a few scattered irregular pinnA| along the main rachis; some
    of the pinnA| are almost obsolete, while others are an inch long
    with oblong-dentate pinnules and a heavy terminal crest; the upper
    portion has several ramifications, each of which is copiously
    forked and heavily crested, the whole forming a corymbose head 3in.
    or 4in. in diameter, which gives the plant a pendent habit.

    =A. F.-f. sub-lunatum= (half-crescent-shaped).* _fronds_ 9in. to
    20in. long, less than 1in. wide, with curious alternated, nearly
    crescent-shaped, much contracted pinnA|, sparingly divided, arching.

    =A. F.-f. VictoriA|= (Victoria's).* _fronds_ long, lanceolate in
    outline, with the apices crested, as well as those of the pinnA|;
    the latter are forked at the base, the divisions being divergent,
    and crossing those of the neighbouring pinnA|. A form named
    _gracilis_ has narrower fronds, is more compact, and cresting
    rather thicker. There is also another form named _lineare_, having
    very small heavily crested fronds, and an extremely elegant
    appearance. The foregoing are the most important varieties, but
    a very comparative few of the total number. Although forms of an
    essentially hardy species, the greater number--and particularly the
    rarer sorts--should have a winter protection; or, what is far more
    preferable and satisfactory, they should be grown in the frame or
    temperate fernery.

    =A. firmum= (firm-textured). Synonymous with _A. abscissum_.

    =A. fissum= (cut).* _sti._ tufted, 2in. to 6in. long. _fronds_ 2in.

    deeply pinnatifid; ultimate segments under half a line broad.
    _sori_ linear-oblong, when mature occupying the whole breadth of
    the segments. South Europe. A pretty little frame or greenhouse
    species.

    1/2in. each way, broadly lobed; lobes sharply toothed, the base
    cut away in a curve on the lower side. _sori_ oblique, irregular,
    copious. Temperate Australia, &c. Greenhouse species.

    =A. f. majus= (greater). This is a larger form, with longer fronds
    and broader pinnA|.

    =A. flaccidum= (relaxed). _sti._ tufted, 4in. to 8in. long.
    _fronds_ 1ft. to 3ft. long, 4in. to 8in. broad, often pendent,

    about 1/2in. broad, sometimes rather rigid and recurved, sometimes
    quite flaccid and drooping, like the main rachis, sometimes
    deeply pinnatifid, but more often cut down to the thick rachis in
    oblique or sub-falcate linear lobes. _sori_ in the divided form
    quite marginal. New Zealand, &c. SYNS. _A. odontites_ and _Darea
    flaccida_.

    linear, when mature covering the whole breadth, but falling short
    of the point of the pinnA|. Scotland and Norway to Hungary and
    Dalmatia. Hardy or frame species. SYN. _A. alternifolium_.

    =A. giganteum= (gigantic). A synonym of _A. radicans_.

The annuals (_Callistemma hortensis_), usually known as French, German,
or China Asters, are very extensively grown, both for beds and pots,
and their diversity and generally compact growth render them almost
universal favourites. They require a rich loamy soil, and as the roots
are produced near the surface, a mulching of rotten dung will be found
most beneficial. Seeds may be raised in a cold frame in March or April,
and, when the seedlings are large enough, they must be transplanted
into beds from 9in. to 12in. apart each way. If it is desired to have
them in pots, they may be removed thence with a good ball of earth
adhering just before they commence flowering, liberally watered, and
kept lightly shaded from the sun, until root action is resumed. Those
kinds required for exhibition purposes should have several of the side
shoots removed, so that the whole growing energy of the plant may be
centralised into from five to seven flower-heads, by which means fine
blooms may be obtained. The dwarf kinds are most valuable for bedding
and pots, as the taller kinds frequently require stakes for support.
The following are the most important sections:

    =Betteridge's Prize.= Very beautifully formed and brilliantly
    coloured varieties, unsurpassed for exhibition purposes. As this
    class has rather a straggling habit of growth, it is less suitable
    for bedding and borders than many of the others.

    =Boltze's Miniature Bouquet Pyramidal.= Dwarf and elegant, in
    compact bouquets of six or eight; the truss of flower-heads springs
    directly from the ground, having only a few leaves at base. Colours
    very varied. _h._ 6in. to 8in.

[Illustration: FIG. 183. TRUFFAUT'S PEONY-FLOWERED ASTER.]

[Illustration: FIG. 184. TRUFFAUT'S PERFECTION ASTER.]

    =Crown.=* Distinct. The central portion, or disk, of the head of
    flowers is pure white, surrounded by a broad margin of coloured ray
    florets, such as purple, violet, crimson, rose, &c. Flower-heads
    large, flat, freely produced. _h._ 1ft. to 1-1/2ft.

    =Dwarf Chrysanthemum-flowered.=* In size of flower-heads and habit
    of growth, this surpasses all other dwarf varieties. The flowers
    are full, Chrysanthemum-shaped, produced in clusters, or bouquets,
    from ten to twenty in a truss, very delicate and beautiful in
    colour. _h._ 1ft.

    =Dwarf Pyramidal= or =Dwarf Bouquet=. A pretty little class, and
    extremely floriferous, each plant producing from twenty to fifty
    heads of bloom. Some of the colours are: Exquisite carmine with
    white points, white with blue or carmine points, white with salmon
    centre, &c. _h._ 1ft.

    =Improved Imbricate.= The best strain of pyramidal Asters with
    recurved florets; fine regular form of flowers, double to the
    centre, producing but few seeds. Colours very brilliant. _h._ 2ft.

    =Improved Rose.= A handsome class, producing a branched head,
    displaying no less than fifty large double flower-heads, the outer
    florets finely imbricated, and filled up to the centre when quite
    open. The colours are of great brilliancy, and of many shades. _h._
    2ft.

    =Pompone Goliath.=* Flower-heads globular, and florets very closely
    set. Valuable for bouquets, as the flowers remain intact for a
    considerable time.

    =Pyramidal Hedgehog.= Singular and unique. Stems upright, and
    branched; each branch terminated by a single flower-head, which is
    filled up with quill-like florets. Colours various. _h._ 1-1/2ft.

    =Truffaut's PA|ony Perfection.=* Vigorous upright growers, having
    large, hemispherical-formed heads of flowers with incurved florets,
    4in. across. The colours also are very varied. _h._ about 2ft. See
    Figs. 183 and 184.

[Illustration: FIG. 185. VICTORIA ASTER.]

    =Victoria.=* One of the most popular classes of Asters grown;
    flower-heads very double, imbricate, globular, 4in. in diameter,
    from ten to twenty on a plant, of various shades. _h._ 1ft., with
    a pyramidal habit. See Fig. 185.

=ASTERACANTHA= (from _aster_, a star, and _acantha_, a spine; referring
to the disposition of the spines). ORD. _AcanthaceA|_. A handsome
greenhouse herbaceous perennial, of easy culture in sandy loam. It
should be grown in a sunny position, and be kept moderately dry,
otherwise little but foliaceous growth will be produced; but, if thus
treated, it flowers freely. Propagated by divisions in spring; or by
seeds, sown in August.

    =A. longifolia= (long-leaved). _fl._ yellow, in dense axillary
    fascicles. July. _l._ lanceolate, tapering to the base, narrow,
    sessile, serrately ciliated. Stem quadrangular. Plant rather hairy.

=ASTERACEA†.= _See_ =CompositA|=.

=ASTEROCEPHALUS.= _See_ =Scabiosa=.

=ASTILBE= (from _a_, without, and _stilbe_, brilliancy; in allusion to
the inconspicuous flowers of some of the species). ORD. _SaxifragaceA|_.
Tall branching herbs, with triternate or biternate leaves, allied to
_SpirA|a_, from which they differ in having not more than three carpels,
eight or ten stamens, and numerous albuminous seeds. They are all more
or less graceful, and some indispensable, either when grown in isolated
clumps, or intermingled with other herbaceous plants. They thrive well
in almost any rich garden soil, preferring damp positions, and are
easily propagated by division, which is best done in early spring.
_A. japonica_ is grown very extensively for decorative purposes, its
elegant spikes of pure white flowers rendering it especially valuable.
The majority of the plants cultivated are imported, but they may be
grown fairly well in this country in heavily manured soil. They should
be potted as early as possible in the autumn, and plunged in ashes
or fibre outside, when they will soon commence to root, after which
they may be placed in heat, and forced as required, always giving an
abundance of water. Indeed, the pots may be stood in pans of water,
especially when the plants are well furnished with growth.

    =A. barbata= (bearded). A synonym of _A. japonica_.

    =A. decandra= (ten-stamened). _fl._ white, in spicate racemose
    panicles. May. _l._ biternate; leaflets cordate, deeply lobed and
    serrated, glandular beneath, and on the petioles. _h._ 2ft. to 3ft.

    branching racemose panicles. May. _l._ triternate or pinnate,
    serrated. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Japan. This is best grown in pots, as
    early frosts generally cut it down in the open air. SYNS. _SpirA|a
    barbata_ and _japonica_, also _Hoteia_ and _A. barbata_. See Fig
    186.

    =A. j. variegata= (variegated).* _l._ prettily variegated with
    yellow; panicles much more dense than the type; indeed, it is far
    superior in that respect.

    Continent for forcing purposes.

=ASTRAGALUS= (a name applied to a shrub by Greek writers). Milk Vetch.
ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A very large genus of hardy herbs or sub-shrubs.
Flowers in axillary clusters; standard larger than the wings. Leaves
unequally pinnate. About one hundred species have from time to
time been introduced in English gardens; many of these are lost to
cultivation; the comparative few here described are still generally
grown, and are good representative species. They are all of easy
culture. The shrubby kinds grow well in any light dry soil, and are
slowly increased by cuttings placed in a cold frame, or by seeds. The
herbaceous perennials prefer a dry light soil, and may be increased by
divisions or seeds; the latter mode is preferable, as many species are
very liable to die if transplanted or divided, which is at best but a
slow method. Seed should be sown in pots of sandy soil placed in a cold
frame as soon as ripe, or very early in the spring, as they may lie a
long time before germinating. The dwarfer species constitute admirable
rockwork plants, and can be grown in pots containing a mixture of loam,
peat, and sand. Seeds of the two annual species, _A. Cicer_ and _A.
Glaux_, merely require to be sown in the open border early in spring.

aspect of a stately conifer. Flowers panicled, diA"cious; perianth five
to eight-fid. Leaves opposite, aromatic. A compost of loam and peat, in
about equal proportions, is necessary. It can be readily propagated by
cuttings.

    =A. moschata= (Musk-scented). Plume Nutmeg. _fl._ white. June. _h._
    40ft. New Holland, 1824.

=ATHEROSPERMEA†.= _See_ =MonimiaceA|=.

=ATHRIXIA= (from _a_, not, and _thrix_, a hair; the receptacle being
destitute of hairs). ORD. _CompositA|_. A greenhouse evergreen shrub. It
succeeds best in turfy loam, peat, and sand, and requires to be potted
firmly. Propagated by cuttings of young wood, placed under a bell glass
in sandy soil, and treated like _Ericas_ (which _see_).

    =A. capensis= (Cape).* _fl.-heads_ bright crimson, solitary,
    terminal. April. _l._ narrow, lanceolate, alternate, entire. _h._
    3ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1821.

arrangement; in reference to the disposition of the scales of the
cones). ORD. _ConiferA|_. A small genus of Tasmanian evergreen diA"cious
trees or shrubs, with small scale-like leaves, and small globular cones
of many imbricated scales, with from three to six carpels under each
scale. In very sheltered situations they will probably prove hardy;
but, otherwise, they are only suitable for botanical collections.
Increased by cuttings. This genus is almost universally misspelt
_Arthrotaxis_.

    =A. laxifolia= (loose-leaved). Differing from _A. cupressoides_
    in having longer, more pointed, open, and spreading leaves, which
    stand out from the stem in a Juniper-like fashion. Its lateral
    growths are rather pendulous. _h._ 20ft. to 25ft. SYN. _A. Doniana_.

    =A. selaginoides= (Selago-like). _l._ glossy green, scale-like,
    spirally disposed, closely appressed to the shoots, branches and
    their ramifications very numerous. _h._ variable, up to 40ft. Very
    interesting, and quite distinct. SYN. _A. imbricata_ (of gardens).

=ATHYRIUM.= _See_ =Asplenium=.

=ATRAGENE= (a name originally given to _Clematis Vitalba_ by
Theophrastus). ORD. _RanunculaceA|_. A genus of ornamental, hardy,
climbing, deciduous shrubs, closely allied to _Clematis_, from which
they differ in having numerous petals. They are increased by cuttings,
which should be pricked in light sandy soil and placed under a hand
glass; also by layering in the autumn. Both methods are slow; the
layers should not be separated for about a year, when they will be
vigorous plants. Seeds must be sown in early spring, in gentle heat;
when the seedlings are large enough to handle, they should be pricked
off and grown on in pots till they are strong plants.

[Illustration: FIG. 189. ATRAGENE ALPINA, showing Habit, Twining
Leafstalk, and Flower.]

    =A. alpina= (alpine).* _fl._ blue, varying to white; petals ten
    to twelve, linear at the base, but dilated at the apex; peduncles
    one-flowered, longer than the leaves. May. _l._ biternate; leaflets
    ovate-lanceolate, acuminated, serrate. Mountainous parts of Europe,
    1792. The white-flowered variety, named _alba_, is in cultivation.

    acute; peduncles one-flowered. May. _l._ whorled, in fours,
    leaflets stalked, cordate, lanceolate, acuminated, entire or
    somewhat lobed, or serrated. North America, 1797. SYN. _Clematis
    verticillaris_.

    =A. austriaca= (Austrian). Synonymous with _A. alpina_.

    =A. macropetala= (large-petaled).* _fl._ blue. Manchuria, 1870.

=ATRIPLEX= (from _a_, not, and _traphein_, to nourish). Orach. ORD.
_ChenopodiaceA|_. A genus of, for the most part, uninteresting weeds, of
very variable form and habit, and having the calyx, which encloses the
fruit, enlarging after flowering. For culture, _see_ =Orach=.

    =A. hortensis= (garden). An annual species from Tartary, of no
    value as an ornamental plant, but considered a very desirable
    substitute for spinach. The leaves must be gathered for use when
    young. The variety _A. h. atro-sanguinea_ is a very pretty form,
    having handsome crimson leaves, and growing to a height of about
    4ft. It is well worth growing with such plants as _Amaranthus_, &c.

=ATROPA= (name of mythological origin). Belladonna; Dwale. ORD.
_SolanaceA|_. A small genus, having a campanulate regular corolla, and a
leafy persistent calyx. The berries of this native herbaceous perennial
are exceedingly poisonous. The plant is of no horticultural value.

[Illustration: FIG. 190. FLOWER OF ATROPA BELLADONNA.]

    =A. Belladonna.= _fl._ green and purple, solitary, pedunculate,
    drooping. Summer. Berries about the size of a small cherry. _l._
    ovate, acuminate, 4in. to 8in. long _h._ 2ft. to 4ft. Britain. See
    Fig. 190.

=ATTALEA= (from _attalus_, magnificent; referring to the beauty
of the genus). ORD. _PalmaceA|_. A genus of handsome stove palm
trees, distinguished from other genera in having the pinnA| arranged
vertically, and not horizontally. The leaves spring up almost
perpendicularly at the base, but in the upper part arch over. The pinnA|
stand at right angles to the rachis--which is very narrow in proportion
to its thickness--and while those of the lower side of the arch hang
straight down, those of the upper side point straight up. They thrive
well in a mixture of peat and loam in equal quantities, and enjoy a
copious supply of water. Summer temperature, 65deg. to 80deg.; winter,
55deg. to 60deg. All the species are robust trees; but, although
several have been introduced, few appear to be generally grown.

    furnished with from three to four dozen dark green pinnA|, sometimes
    18in. in length; petioles rounded, and dark brown below, flat and
    green upon the upper side. Plant unarmed. _h._ 50ft. or more in its
    native habitat. Honduras.

    =A. compta= (decked). _h._ 22ft. Brazil, 1820.

    =A. excelsa= (tall).* _h._ 70ft. Brazil, 1826.

    green, very ornamental, and of economic value in Brazil. 1824. The
    sheathing bases of the leafstalks separate into a coarse black
    fringe, which is collected and exported to Europe, being used in
    the manufacture of brooms, brushes, &c.

    =A. nucifera= (nut-bearing). A synonym of _A. amygdalina_.

    =A. speciosa= (showy).* _h._ 70ft. Brazil, 1825.

[Illustration: FIG. 191. FRUITING BRANCH OF ROUND AUBERGINE.]

[Illustration: FIG. 192. FRUITING BRANCH OF LONG AUBERGINE.]

=AUBERGINE=, or =EGG PLANT= (_Solanum melongena_, variety _ovigerum_).
These plants, besides being useful for culinary purposes, are very
ornamental, and present an attractive appearance on walls or trellises,
or in the flower garden; and, as they do well in any ordinary rich
garden soil, if the position is warm, they give a good variation to the
general run of plants used for decorative effects. The Black-fruited
kind is particularly suited for this purpose. Sow the seeds in a gentle
heat, in the middle of April. As soon as the seedlings are large enough
to handle, prick off into 4in. pots, replacing in heat till they root
out freely. Gradually harden off by June, and then transfer to the
positions where they are to grow. Let the plants be at least 2ft.
apart, and place a strong stick to each one to support the fruit when
it comes. For trellises, select the more moderate-sized varieties. In
hot, dry weather, the application of liberal supplies of liquid manure
tends to increase the size of the fruit, and also to make the foliage
more vigorous and handsome. Where very large fruit are needed for show
or other purposes, it is well to remove all but the best one on the
plant, and, by careful feeding with liquid manure, specimens of from
10lb. to 12lb. weight can be had. The foliage should not be pinched,
as this would prevent the free swelling of the fruit. Aubergines are
not so much grown in England for culinary purposes as in France and
Italy, where they are largely used in stews and soups. The following
are the most desirable varieties: New York Purple, the largest kind
grown, and although not as ornamental as the next, is quite as useful;
Black-fruited, large black fruit, with blackish violet leaves; and
White-fruited, the sort most generally cultivated. See Figs. 191 and
192.

=AUBRIETIA= (named after M. Aubriet, a famous French botanical
draughtsman). ORD. _CruciferA|_. A small genus of hardy evergreen
trailers. Racemes opposite the leaves, and terminal, lax, few-flowered.
Leaves ovate or oblong, entire or angularly toothed, hairy. They make
excellent rock plants, and will thrive in a deep rich loam anywhere,
excepting under the shelter of trees. Cuttings struck, or seeds sown,
during April or May generally make fine, dense, cushion-like growths,
if transplanted on to a somewhat cool or shaded border, and carefully
lifted in the autumn; the cuttings are best "drawn," or grown until
they are soft, in a frame before they are removed. Where a stock of old
plants exist, layer the long slender branches any time after flowering,
and cover with a mixture of sand and leaf soil; they will then root
freely and establish themselves in time for spring blooming, for which
purpose, when grown _en masse_, they are most useful. After flowering,
they may be divided and transplanted.

[Illustration: FIG. 193. AUBRIETIA DELTOIDEA.]

    =A. deltoidea= (deltoid).* _fl._ purple; petals twice the length of
    the calyx; pedicels short, filiform; racemes opposite the leaves
    and terminal, lax, few-flowered. Early spring. _l._ with one or two
    large teeth on each side (therefore they are rhomboidal, not truly
    deltoid), scabrous, with short branchy stellate hairs. _h._ 2in.
    to 4in. Naples, &c., 1710. There are several garden varieties, the
    best of which are described below; most of them are regarded as
    distinct species. See Fig. 193. (S. F. G. 628.)

[Illustration: FIG. 194. AUBRIETIA PURPUREA.]

    =A. d. Bouganvillei= (Bouganville's).* _fl._ light violet purple,
    with very even imbricated petals. Habit very dwarf and compact,
    with short peduncles. A pretty form.

    =A. d. Campbelli= (Campbell's).* Larger deep violet blue flowers,
    and of far more vigorous constitution than the typical form.
    _Grandiflora_ comes very near this. SYN. _A. Hendersonii_.

    =A. d. Eyrei= (Eyre's).* A very fine variety, with a free branching
    habit, and large flowers of a rich violet-purple colour, rather
    longer than broad. _A. olympica_ is very near, if not identical
    with this.

    =A. d. grA|ca= (Grecian).* _fl._ light purple. _h._ 4in. Greece,
    1872. One of the best and largest flowered forms; very vigorous
    grower, with neat compact habit. A variety of this, named
    _superba_, has rather deeper-coloured flowers, produced over a very
    extended period. (R. G. 697.)

    =A. d. purpurea= (purple).* Larger flowers and more erect habit
    than the type. _l._ broader, with two to five teeth. Stems more
    leafy. There is a variegated form, which is very pleasing and
    effective, useful for carpeting or edging small beds. See Fig. 194.

    =A. d. violacea= (violet).* This is a hybrid form, even finer than
    _Campbelli_, with large deep violet-purple flowers, fading to
    reddish-violet, and is more effective than any of the others.

    =A. Hendersonii= (Henderson's). A synonym of _A. d. Campbelli_.

=AUCUBA= (the Japanese name of the shrub). ORD. _CornaceA|_. A genus
of hardy evergreen shrubs, thriving better than any other in the
smoky atmosphere of dense cities. They grow in ordinary well-drained
garden soil, and require no special culture. If grown in pots, they
should be planted firmly in rather sandy yellow loam, with plenty of
drainage. They should not be allowed too large pots, or an unfruitful
growth is likely to result. During the growing season, an abundance
of water is needed, which must be lessened when the plants are fully
developed. If cultivated in the greenhouse or conservatory, they should
be plunged out of doors during summer. To insure a good supply of
the very ornamental berries, which are produced on the female plant,
careful fertilising is necessary. The time for applying the pollen is
when the pistil exudes a slightly gummy substance, and otherwise shows
signs of maturity. When it happens, as is sometimes the case, that the
male blooms are open and the pollen mature before the female blooms
are ready, the pollen should be collected on a dry camel-hair pencil,
transferred to a piece of glass, and covered over by another piece,
both of which must also be dry. It may be applied afterwards when
wanted, as it retains its power for some weeks. Propagated by cuttings,
inserted in any light sandy soil, with or without a covering, in spring
or autumn; or readily increased from seeds, sown as soon as ripe.

    =A. himalaica= (Himalayan).* _l._ lanceolate, or lanceolate
    acuminate; branches of the panicle very pilose. Berries spherical,
    not oblong. Himalaya. (F. d. S. 12, 1271.)

    =A. japonica= (Japanese).* _l._ opposite, petiolate, broad,
    ovate-lanceolate, acuminated, toothed, leathery, glabrous, shining,
    pale green, beautifully spotted with yellow, having the midrib
    rather prominent, the rest of the leaf reticulately veined. _h._
    6ft. to 10ft. Japan, 1783. The numerous varieties, both of the male
    and female forms, among which will be found many of great beauty,
    all differ, more or less, in the variegation of their leaves.
    They are in very general cultivation, and nearly every nurseryman
    has an assortment. Among the best of them are the following:
    _albo-variegata_, _aurea_, _bicolor_, _latimaculata_, _limbata_,
    _longifolia_, _macrophylla_, _ovata_, _pygmA|a_, and _pygmA|a
    sulphurea_.

=AUDOUINIA= (in honour of V. Audouin, a profound entomologist). ORD.
_BruniaceA|_. An ornamental greenhouse evergreen shrub, thriving in a
mixture of peat and sandy loam. Propagated by cuttings of half-ripened
wood, inserted in sand, under a bell glass, in gentle heat.

    =A. capitata= (headed). _fl._ purple, crowded into oblong,
    spike-like, terminal heads. May. _l._ spirally inserted, a little
    keeled. Branches erect. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1790.

=AULACOSPERMUM.= A synonym of =Pleurospermum= (which _see_).

=AULAX= (from _aulax_, a furrow; the under surface of the leaves of
the original species being furrowed). ORD. _ProteaceA|_. Greenhouse
evergreen shrubs, from the Cape of Good Hope, thriving best in a
compost of fibrous loam, leaf soil, and sharp sand, with thorough
drainage. Ripened cuttings, taken off at a joint, and inserted in pots
of sandy soil, will root readily under a hand glass, in a cool house.

    =A. pinifolia= (Pine-leaved). _fl._ yellow, racemose. July. _l._
    filiform, channelled. _h._ 2ft. 1780.

    =A. umbellata= (umbelled). _fl._ yellow. June. _l._ flat,
    spathulate*-linear. _h._ 2ft. 1774. (B. R. 12, 1015.)

=AURANTIACEA†.= An order of trees or shrubs, including the Orange and
Lemon trees. Flowers fragrant. Fruit fleshy, edible. Leaves alternate,
articulated above the stem, filled with transparent oil cysts, giving
them a dotted appearance. Well-known genera are _Citrus_ and _Limonia_.

=AURICULA= (_Primula Auricula_). This favourite spring flower (see Fig.
195) was, at one time, almost universally cultivated, but has of late
years fallen into much neglect; it is now, however, happily regaining
enthusiastic admirers. Although its culture is not nearly so difficult
as is generally understood, a few special items of treatment are
nevertheless necessary to grow it successfully.

[Illustration: FIG. 195. A VARIETY OF PRIMULA AURICULA.]

_Frames_ for the reception of Auriculas should be prepared, with a good
bottom drainage, and an inside staging, similar to the back stage of
a lean-to greenhouse, arranged as near the glass as possible. If the
frames are about 4ft. wide, they will be very convenient; 1ft. deep in
the front, and about 3ft. at the back. This will allow for a good stage
arrangement. Of course, it is not necessary to construct an expensive
staging, as common boards can be laid upon pots of various heights, the
same results being practically secured. These frames should face north
from May to October, and south in winter, during which latter time it
will be necessary to well cover the sides with straw or brake. When
frosty, the lights must also be mated; but, unless there is absolute
fear of frost, the glass should not be covered, as the more light the
plants receive the better. On all suitable occasions, both during
summer and winter, air must be freely admitted, and a good look-out
kept during showery weather; hence it may be necessary to tilt the
lights with blocks rather than remove them entirely. The latter plan
should be adopted whenever practicable, especially during early spring,
and after they are well established in their fresh pots in summer.
This will greatly assist to ripen the crown, and produce hard, stout
foliage, which will endure the winter much better than if grown with
less air. Many cultivators prefer small span or lean-to houses to
frames; and it must be admitted that these are better, more convenient,
and in every way more beneficial. Simple, inexpensive structures, no
higher than is absolutely necessary for convenience, with top and side
ventilation, will meet all requirements; and if a 2in. hot-water pipe
is arranged next the eaves inside, it will be a decided advantage
during very severe weather.

_Soil._ The best compost that can be prepared for Auriculas is as
follows: Four parts good fibrous loam, one part well-rotted cow manure,
one part good leaf soil, and one part coarse river or silver sand,
with a little charcoal or pounded oyster-shells added. Carefully mix
the whole together before using. The loam should be stored about
twelve months previous to being used, and it should be selected from
districts with a fine atmosphere; the turf should be cut about 3in.
thick. Cow manure that has lain for a year or so, and been subjected to
sharp frosts, is most suitable, as insect life, which it very probably
contains, is thereby destroyed, and the whole materially sweetened.

_Potting._ This operation requires to be carefully done as soon after
flowering as possible, unless it is desired to save seed, when it
must be deferred until the seed is ripened. May and June are the best
months for general potting, and whatever the size of the pots used,
they should be carefully and thoroughly drained. After a good layer
of potsherds, place some charcoal, leaf mould, or spent hops. Many
good growers use the last very advantageously. For good flowering
plants, 48-sized pots are used, many cultivators preferring glazed
pots to the unglazed; but such are not absolutely necessary to ensure
success. Before repotting, remove most of the old soil, and with a
sharp knife cut off any bruised or cankered portion of roots; the stout
tap-root may also be cut away if devoid of fresh rootlets. Do not pot
very firmly. Remove the plants to their summer quarters, withholding
water for a few days, and keep the frames close. About a week after
potting, water may be advantageously given, the plants will then soon
resume root-action, and air may be admitted afterwards on all suitable
occasions. The collar or neck of the plant must be left well above the
surface of the soil.

_Watering_ is a point that requires careful attention, as neglect
in this matter will result in failure. During the growing season,
Auriculas require an abundance of water; in fact, they must never be
allowed to get dry. In the winter, they must only be watered when
they are really dry, especially during a severe season. Care must be
taken to avoid watering the leaves, particularly in early spring, as
this tends to spoil the effect of the charming farinose foliage. Above
all, water must not be allowed to stand in the heart of the plant, as
such will inevitably cause incipient decay. Hence it is necessary to
keep a sharp lookout for drippings from the glass, and to maintain
tightly-glazed frames. On all occasions, decaying leaves must be
removed, and especially during winter.

_Top-dressing._ About the middle or end of February, when the plants
commence new growth, the surface soil should be removed about an inch
or so deep, and the pots re-filled with a rich compost made up of the
following: Two parts of turfy loam, one of rotten cow or hen manure,
and one of leaf soil; if a little Standen's Manure is added, the
compost will be improved. After this top-dressing, the plants may be
watered freely.

_Propagation by Offsets._ When top-dressing, any offsets with roots
should be removed, and as soon after as possible the remaining ones
should be taken off, as it is much more desirable to do so early than
later on, when repotting; for, when making the first growth, they are
the more likely to root better, and stand a greater chance of making
good plants before the season is over. Fill well-drained 3in. pots with
sandy soil, and arrange about four offsets round the sides; place under
a bell glass, or in a close handlight, watering very sparingly so as to
prevent them damping off. They will soon establish themselves, after
which air may be admitted, and the plants may ultimately be potted off
singly. To induce choice varieties to make offsets, the top of the old
plant should be removed and treated like the others, when, as a rule,
several shoots will be produced, which in due time may be removed. By
this means, a nice stock of the rarer kinds may be obtained; whereas,
if such a course were not adopted, the rate of increase would be
extremely slow.

_Flowering._ During the flowering period, watering, as already stated,
must be carefully attended to, for if the plants are allowed to get
dry, the flowers will quickly shrivel. They must also be kept well
shaded from sunshine, which quickly destroys the delicate blossoms.
As the trusses are developing, particular attention must be given to
night protection. It is, perhaps, better to cover every night than to
run the risk of exposing the unexpanded flowers to frost, as the effect
is very prejudicial; in fact, if subject to frost, smooth even flowers
may not be expected.

_Seed Saving and Sowing._ The only way to obtain new varieties is by
seed; hence the value of careful seed-saving will be apparent. Severe
discrimination must be exercised in the selection of parents, and
the flowers must be very carefully crossed. The anthers should be
removed from the pistillate parent, if possible, before expansion,
so as to prevent any possibility of self-fertilisation; and, when
the stigma is ready, the pollen must be conveyed by means of a small
camel's-hair brush, care being taken not to mistake the brushes used
in different classes. It has been observed in Auriculas that the
issue from crossbred seed favours the pollen more than the pistillate
parent; hence the necessity of selecting good pollen parents. It is
best to confine hybridisation to separate classes--_i.e._, cross a
Self with a Self, and a Green-edged variety with another of the same
class. The importance of selecting the best in each class scarcely
needs suggestion, having regard to constitution as well as the quality
of the flowers. The seed should be sown as soon as ripe, or early in
March, in well-drained pots, filled with sandy soil, which must be well
watered previous to sowing. When this operation is completed, the seed
must be lightly covered with coarse sand, a sheet of glass placed over
the pot, and the latter stood in the hand glass, where the offsets are
rooted. Some of the seedlings will appear in a month, but the bulk
from that sown when ripe will not be seen until the following spring;
while others will germinate even during the ensuing summer. The late
comers should be particularly cared for, as they frequently produce
the best varieties. When the seedlings are large enough, they must be
pricked off in pots of sandy soil; and, when well established, potted
off singly into small thumb pots, and afterwards encouraged as judgment
suggests. Some growers allow the seedlings to remain in the store
pots till they flower, when the best are kept, and those not required
disposed of.

_Insect Pests._ Green fly are often very troublesome, and should be
exterminated as speedily as possible, by tobacco fumigation, or by
dipping the plants in a solution of Gishurst's Compound, or carefully
prepared Fir-tree Oil, all of which are effectual. Many authorities
denounce fumigation, while others advocate it. The roots are also
attacked by a mealy louse, named _Trama auriculA|_, which clusters about
the roots and collar of the plants, sucking nutriment therefrom; and
although, provided they do not attack the collar, they have no greatly
prejudicial effect on the plant, yet it is desirable to exterminate
them. The only effectual way of accomplishing this is to remove all
soil, and thoroughly cleanse the roots and collar in a solution of soft
soap, with a little Fir-tree Oil added. Of course, this is most easily
managed when repotting; and, unless the plants are very badly infested,
it would not be advisable to run the risk of root washing later in the
year.

_Classes._ Auriculas are now arranged in five classes, four of which
constitute what are known as "show or stage Auriculas," while the
other is known by the name of "Alpines." Each class is characterised
by special points of distinction, which, in the opinion of the strict
"florists" school, it is of the utmost importance to observe; and as
there is room for systematists in this, as well as in any other branch
of floriculture, we will follow the arrangement usually adopted, and
describe the distinguishing features of, and enumerate some of the best
varieties in, each class, with their raisers' names attached:

    =Green-edged.= Outer edge green, or but sparingly dusted with
    powder; next, a zone of colour known as the body colour, which
    varies, the darkest being most esteemed; both edges of this zone
    should be even, especially the inner one, but there are few flowers
    perfect in this respect. Next to the body-colour is the paste,
    which occupies the space between the inner circle of the latter
    and the throat, this should be pure and dense, with a distinctly
    circular outline at the throat; the throat and tube should be
    bright yellow. Of course, this ideal standard has not yet been
    reached, as there are supposed defects in all or some sections of
    the flowers at present known. _Leading Varieties_: ADMIRAL NAPIER
    (Campbell), ALDERMAN WISBEY (Headley), APOLLO (Beeston), CHAMPION

    (Traill), PRINCE OF WALES (Ashton).

    =Grey-edged.= Edge heavily dusted with powder, so as almost
    to hide the normal green colour; other points same as the
    Green-edged varieties. _Leading varieties_: ALEXANDER MEIKLEJOHN
    (Kay), CHAS. E. BROWN (Headley), COMPLETE (Sykes), CONQUEROR OF

    HERO (Lancashire), RICHARD HEADLEY (Lightbody), ROBERT TRAILL
    (Lightbody).

    =White-edged.= Edge so heavily dusted with farina as to completely
    hide the green and give it a white appearance; the powder
    frequently as dense as on the paste portion; other points like
    the first. _Leading varieties_: ACME (Read), ANNE SMITH (Smith),
    ARABELLA (Headley), BEAUTY (Traill), BRIGHT VENUS (Lee), CATHERINA
    (Summerscales), CONSERVATIVE (Douglas), COUNTESS OF WILTON
    (Cheetham), EARL GROSVENOR (Lee), FAVORITE (Taylor), FRANK SIMONITE
    (Simonite), GLORY (Taylor), JOHN SIMONITE (Walker), NE PLUS
    ULTRA (Smith), REGULAR (Ashworth), SMILING BEAUTY (Heap), SYLVIA
    (Douglas), TRUE BRITON (Hepworth).

    =Selfs.= Tube bright yellow, and circular at the top; paste
    dense, pure, with an even edge; all the rest of the flower of one
    colour, without shades or edging; any colour holds good. _Leading
    varieties_: APOLLO (Hay), BLACKBIRD (Spalding), C. J. PERRY
    (Turner), DUKE OF ARGYLE (Campbell), FORMOSA (Smith), GARIBALDI
    (Pohlman), HELEN LANCASTER (Pohlman), LORD OF LORNE (Campbell),
    MAZINNA (Pohlman), METEOR FLAG (Lightbody), METROPOLITAN
    (Spalding), MRS. DOUGLAS (Simonite), MRS. STURROCK (Martin),
    OTHELLO (Netherwood), PIZARRO (Campbell), TOPSY (Kaye).

    =Alpines.= Centre golden yellow, or white, and destitute of powder;
    body colour various; edge one-coloured, shading off paler towards
    the margin. These are much hardier than any of the other classes,
    and will do well outside in most places. _Leading varieties_: A. F.
    BARRON (Turner), BEATRICE (Turner), BLACK PRINCE (Turner), BRONZE
    QUEEN (Turner), COLONEL SCOTT (Turner), DIADEM (Gorton), DUCHESS

    SAILOR PRINCE (Turner), SELINA (Turner), SPANGLE (Turner), SYDNEY
    (Turner), TRIUMPHANT (Turner).

=AURICULATE.= Having ear-like appendages.

=AUSTRIAN ROSE.= _See_ =Rosa lutea=.

=AVENA= (derivation obscure). The Oat. ORD. _GramineA|_. A genus of
grasses with loose panicles and compressed spikelets. Of agricultural
importance only, with the following exception, which is an annual of
easy culture in ordinary garden soil. Propagated by seeds, sown in
spring or autumn.

    =A. sterilis= (barren). The Animated Oat. _fl._ in drooping
    panicles of large spikelets. _h._ 1-1/2ft. to 2ft. Barbary, 1640.
    An elegant plant.

=AVENS.= _See_ =Geum=.

=AVENUES.= In forming an Avenue, the plan must neither be tortuous nor
of a "tedious sameness," but a gradually winding line should, above
all, be obtained, which must in no way interfere with the view from
the house. About 12ft. is the width usually allowed for the road, but
this depends upon individual taste or idea--this remark applies to
planting in double rows, the trees forming a series of triangles, or
in single rows. The distance across the road from one row of trees
to those opposite should be at least 24ft. The Lime is extensively
used for Avenues on account of its regular growth and the shade it
affords. The Cedar of Lebanon is one of the best and most suitable
evergreens. The Dutch Elm is used because of its rapid growth, and
forms one of the best deciduous trees for this purpose. The well-known
Horse Chestnut, in sheltered spots, is very ornamental, as is also the
Spanish Chestnut; the latter spreads rapidly. Where immediate effect
is required, nothing gives more satisfaction than the White Poplar; it
grows in a wet soil better than anything else. Deodars, Araucarias,
Douglas Pine, the Mexican, Chinese, and Japanese Cypresses, and many
others, are eminently suited for Avenue planting. Shrubs and herbaceous
plants should be introduced between the trees, and so remove any
bareness that may occur. _Diervilla rosea_, and its variegated form,
_Aucubas_, _Rhododendrons_, _Hypericums_, and many others, could be
mentioned to serve this purpose. A moderately good soil will be found
to answer generally.

=AVERRHOA= (in honour of Averrhoes, of Cordova, a celebrated Arabian
physician, who resided in Spain during the domination of the Moors,
about the middle of the twelfth century; he translated Aristotle into
Arabic). ORD. _GeraniaceA|_. Ornamental stove trees, thriving in loam
and peat. Half-ripened cuttings will strike in sand, under a hand
glass, about April, with bottom heat. The leaves of the first-named
species are irritable to the touch.

[Illustration: FIG. 196 AZALEA BALSAMINA†FLORA.]

    =A. Bilimbi= (Bilimbi-tree). _fl._ reddish purple, disposed in
    racemes, rising from the trunk. May. _fr._ oblong, somewhat
    resembling a small cucumber, with a thin, smooth, green rind,
    filled with a grateful acid juice, and the substance and seeds not
    unlike that of a cucumber. _l._ alternate, with from five to ten
    pairs of ovate-lanceolate, entire, smooth leaflets on short stalks.
    _h._ 8ft. to 15ft. Native country unknown, 1791. (B. F. S. 117.)

    =A. Carambola.= Carambola-tree. _fl._ red, scattered, disposed
    in short racemes, usually rising from the smaller branches, but
    sometimes from the larger ones, and even the trunk. _fr._ the
    size of a hen's egg, acutely five-cornered, with a thin, yellow
    rind, and a clear watery pulp. _l._ alternate, with about four to
    five pairs of ovate, acuminated, entire, stalked leaflets, the
    outer ones largest. _h._ 14ft. to 20ft. 1793. This, as well as the
    first-named species, is cultivated throughout the hotter parts of
    India, but where it occurs truly wild is not known.

=AVOCADO PEAR.= _See_ =Persea gratissima=.

=AWL-SHAPED.= Narrow-pointed, resembling an awl.

=AWLWORT.= _See_ =Subularia=.

=AXIL.= Literally the armpit; in plants applied to the angle formed by
union of the leaf and stem.

=AXILLARIA.= _See_ =Polygonatum=.

=AXILLARY.= Growing in the axil of anything.

=AYRSHIRE ROSE.= _See_ =Rosa repens capreolata=.

=AZALEA= (from _azaleos_, dry, arid; in allusion to the habitat of
the plant). ORD. _EricaceA|_. A genus of very popular and beautiful
hardy or greenhouse plants. The species enumerated were included
under _Rhododendron_ by Don, Loudon, and others, contrary to the
classification of LinnA|us, but the distinctive characters are not
consistent. In this genus, the stamens are usually five, but in
_Rhododendron_ ten is the typical number.

_Ghent_ or _American Azaleas_. These are extremely popular hardy
deciduous shrubs. When plants are grown in the open, artificial
crossing will be unnecessary; but this method must be employed upon
those grown in the cool greenhouse, if well fertilised seeds are
required. The seed should be gathered and sown when ripe in a large
shallow frame containing from 2in. to 3in. of peat, over which more
peat must be laid very level by means of a fine sieve; or they may be
kept until early the following spring. No covering will be necessary,
but a thorough watering with a fine-rosed water-pot must be given.
The lights should be darkened, and the frames kept close until the
young seedlings begin to appear, when they must have air (carefully
admitted), shade, and a daily sprinkling of water. By the autumn, they
will be large enough to transplant in small clumps into boxes of peat
and coarse sand, and to place in other frames, or in the open. In each
case, they will need watering, shading, and to be kept close until
growth commences. The hardier the plants are before winter commences,
the better; but a protection of mats or similar material will prevent
the probability of their being killed by severe frosts. During the
following season, they will only require water during dry weather,
and no protection need be afforded this winter. The next spring, they
should be planted out singly in beds, sufficiently wide apart to allow
the development of two years growth. If an upright growth is being
made, the leading shoot must be shortened, in order to secure dwarf,
well-branched plants. The same methods should be employed on a smaller
scale where but a few are wanted. Grafting is largely practised to
increase the stock of named varieties or choice seedlings, the stock
employed being _A. pontica_. This process, of course, ensures the
quicker production of flowering plants. Layering in March, encasing
the part buried with moss, is also some times practised; but the layer
must be left two years before separating. Cuttings of the last year's
wood, 2in. or 3in. long, taken with a heel, root readily in sand; about
the end of August is the best time for so doing. If they are pricked
off in pots or pans of sandy soil, and kept in a cool frame until
they are calloused, and afterwards introduced into a slight bottom
heat, they root quicker, but this is not absolutely essential. When
placed outside, they should be covered with a handlight for about two
months, and, at the end of this time, air should be gradually given
and increased. Ghent Azaleas are now forced extensively for the market
as well as in private gardens; and, by judicious culture, they can be
had in full blossom by Christmas. With this end in view, they should
be grown in pots, and have the growth prematurely completed soon after
flowering with the aid of a little artificial heat; after which they
may be placed outside. During very hot and dry weather, the north side
of a wall is necessary, to prevent their flowering in the autumn. The
same plants must only be forced every alternate year. Commence to place
the plants in heat in October, and keep up a succession until the
following March. The best plants for forcing purposes are obtained from
the Continent, where they are grown in enormous quantities. When grown
permanently out of doors, the most suitable soil is peat and rough sand
mixed. Failing this, leaf mould, maiden loam, and sand, will be found
satisfactory. In many cases, we have known them to flourish in ordinary
garden soil.

    The following varieties of Ghent Azaleas are distinct, and all
    worth growing; ADMIRAL DE RUYTER, deep red-scarlet, very fine;
    ALTACLERENSIS, bright yellow; AMA'NA, light pink; CARNEA ELEGANS,
    pale pink, shaded sulphur; COCCINEA MAJOR, dark scarlet, very fine;
    CUPREA SPLENDENS, rich pink, shaded yellow; DECORATA, lovely pink;
    DIRECTEUR CHARLES BAUMANN, rich vermilion, spotted yellow; ELECTOR,
    rich orange-scarlet; GEANT DES BATAILLES, deep crimson, very fine;
    MADAME JOSEPH BAUMANN, bright pink, very free and good; MARIA
    VERSCHAFFELT, shaded pink and yellow; MIRABILIS, very lovely pink;
    MORTERI, rich yellow, shaded rosy-red; PONTICA MACRANTHA, rich deep
    sulphur, very large and fine; PRINCESSE D'ORANGE, salmon-pink, very
    fine; SANGUINEA, deep crimson; VISCOSA FLORIBUNDA, pure white, very
    fragrant.

    =A. arborescens= (tree-like).* _fl._ large, reddish, not clammy,
    leafy; tube of corolla longer than the segments; calyx leafy, with
    the segments oblong and acute. May. _l._, of the flower buds large,
    yellowish-brown, surrounded with a fringed white border, obovate,
    rather obtuse, smooth on both surfaces, glaucous beneath, ciliated
    on the margins, and having the midrib almost smooth. _h._ 10ft. to
    20ft. Pennsylvania, 1818. Deciduous species.

    =A. balsaminA|flora= (Balsam-flowered).* _fl._ bright salmony
    red, finely double and rosette-like, the segments regularly
    imbricated, much resembling in general appearance the blooms of
    a Camellia-flowered Balsam. Japan. It is a distinct species,
    and remains in bloom for a considerable period; the flowers are
    invaluable for bouquets. See Fig. 196, for which we are indebted to
    Mr. Bull.

    =A. calendulacea= (Marigold-like).* _fl._ yellow, red, orange, and
    copper coloured, large, not clammy, rather naked; tube of corolla
    hairy, shorter than the segments. May. _l._ oblong, pubescent on
    both surfaces, at length hairy. _h._ 2ft. to 6ft. Pennsylvania to
    Carolina, 1806. This is said to be the handsomest shrub in North
    America. There are several varieties of it in cultivation. Hardy;
    deciduous. (B. M. 1721, 2143.)

    =A. hispida= (bristly). _fl._ white, with a red border and a
    tinge of red on the tube, which is wide and scarcely longer
    than the segments, very clammy, leafy; stamens ten. July. _l._
    long-lanceolate, hispid above, and smooth beneath, glaucous on both
    surfaces, ciliated on the margins, and having the nerve bristly
    beneath. Branches straight, and very hispid. _h._ 10ft. to 15ft.
    New York, &c., 1734. A hardy deciduous species. (W. D. B. 1, 6.)

[Illustration: FIG. 197. FLOWER OF AZALEA LEDIFOLIA.]

    =A. ledifolia= (Ledum-leaved).* _fl._ pure white, showy; corolla
    campanulate; in threes at the extremities of the branches; calyx
    erect, glandular, and viscid. March. _l._ elliptic-lanceolate. _h._
    2ft. to 6ft. China, 1819. The whole shrub is very hairy. Hardy;
    evergreen. SYN. _A. liliiflora_. See Fig. 197. (B. M. 2901.)

    =A. liliiflora= (lily-flowered). Synonymous with _A. ledifolia_.

    =A. nudiflora= (naked-flowered).* _fl._ in terminal clustered
    racemes, appearing before the leaves, rather naked, not
    clammy; tube of corolla longer than the segments; teeth of
    calyx short, rather rounded; stamens much exserted. June. _l._
    lanceolate-oblong, nearly smooth and green on both surfaces,
    ciliated on the margins, having the midrib bristly beneath, and
    woolly above. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. North America, 1734. This species
    hybridises very freely with _A. calendulacea_, _A. pontica_, _A.
    viscosa_, &c., and descriptive lists of a host of hybrids of almost
    every conceivable shade, both double and single, are to be found in
    continental and home catalogues, to which the reader is referred.
    Hardy. (W. F. A., t. 36.)

    =A. pontica= (Pontic).* _fl._ leafy, clammy; corolla funnel-shaped;
    stamens very long. May. _l._ shining, ovate, oblong, pilose,
    ciliated. _h._ 4ft. to 6ft. Levant, Caucasus, &c., 1793. The
    varieties of this species are also numerous, differing principally
    in the colour of the flowers and the hue of the leaves. The flowers
    are of all shades, and frequently striped. The name generally
    adopted, as above, must not be confounded with _Rhododendron
    ponticum_. If the genus _Azalea_ is merged into Rhododendron, as is
    done by most systematists, this plant must be called by Don's name,
    _Rhododendron flavum_. (I. H. 1864, 415.)

    =A. procumbens= (procumbent). _See_ =Loiseleria procumbens=.

    =A. speciosa= (showy).* _fl._ scarlet and orange coloured; corolla
    silky, with obtuse, ciliated, lanceolate, undulated segments; calyx
    pubescent. May. _l._ lanceolate, ciliated, acute at both ends.
    Branches hairy. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. North America. The varieties
    of above are several, varying in the shape of the leaves and the
    colour of the flowers. (L. B. C. 1255)

    =A. viscosa= (clammy).* _fl._ white, sweet-scented, in terminal
    clusters, downy, clammy, leafy; tube of corolla as long as the
    segments. July. _l._ oblong-ovate, acute, smooth, and green on both
    surfaces, ciliated on the margins, having the midrib bristly. _h._
    2ft. to 4ft. North America, 1734. Like nearly all species belonging
    to this genus, the varieties are many, varying in the colour of the
    flowers and otherwise. (T. S. M. 438.)

    =A. v. nitida= (shining).* _fl._ white, tinged with red, clammy,
    leafy; tube of corolla a little longer than the segments. April.
    _l._ oblanceolate, rather mucronate, leathery, smooth on both
    surfaces, shining above, having the nerve bristly beneath, with
    revolute, ciliated margins. _h._ 2ft. to 4ft. New York, 1812.
    Hardy; deciduous. (B. R. 5, 414.)

_Indian or Chinese Azaleas._ This is a section of greenhouse
evergreen varieties obtained from _A. indica_ (which _see_), blooming
continuously from November to June, or even later, and of the greatest
value for all purposes, whether for decoration, cutting, or exhibition.
Cultivation: Thorough drainage is essential, and a compost of half
peat, the other half made up of fibrous loam, leaf soil, and sand, in
equal quantities. They cannot have too much light and air, and may be
grown to almost any size by shifting from one pot to a size larger.
In repotting, the whole of the crocks should be taken away from the
base of the ball of soil and roots, and the top should also be removed
till the fine roots are reached. The plant should then be put in the
new pot, and the additional soil rammed firm, in order to prevent the
water running through it, and thus depriving the plant of any benefit
therefrom. In all cases, the roots near the stem must be above the
soil, so that the water may not sink in next the stem, or death will
most certainly ensue. After potting, for a few days the plants should
be kept close and freely syringed, and as the growth is completed,
they may be well hardened off. The best time for potting is after
flowering, before the new growth has been made. From October to June
the plants should be in the greenhouse, and during the other months in
a cold frame, or plunged in pots in the open; or, what is preferable
in favoured localities, planted out in prepared beds; they will thus
be kept cleaner, and the growth will be much superior. In autumn they
may be lifted and repotted, placing in a shady position for a few days.
Water in abundance must be given throughout the blooming and growing
season; and the plants must, on no account, be allowed to become dry.
At the same time, a proper amount of care is most essential, as an
excessive amount of moisture is equally as fatal as drought. Cuttings
should be placed in sand under a bell glass with moderate bottom heat;
half-ripened ones are preferable. They must be cut up to a joint--the
base of a leaf--the lower leaves for an inch stripped off, and the stem
stuck into the sand, which should lay, about an inch thick, on the top
of sandy peat soil; the bottom of the cuttings should reach, but not go
quite into, the soil. The whole should be covered with a bell glass,
which must be wiped dry every morning. Soon after the cuttings have
commenced growing, place them in small pots. They are also very largely
and easily increased by grafting; indeed, this is the only satisfactory
method of securing standards. Seeds may be sown similar to the last
section, but in the greenhouse, and, when well up, pricked out into
little pots 1in. apart. Azaleas are liable to the attacks of thrips and
red spider, the latter being especially troublesome if the plants are
in a dry position; frequent syringing will materially help to eradicate
both pests. If insufficient, syringe with a solution of Gishurst's
Compound.

    =A. amA"na= (pleasing). _fl._ almost campanulate, rich crimson,
    about 1-1/2in. across, hose-in-hose conformation, produced in great
    profusion. April. _l._ small, size of the common Box, hairy. _h._
    1ft. China. This is an elegant little neat and compact growing
    shrub, which has proved to be quite hardy in England. (B. M.
    4728.) A very beautiful series of hybrids have been obtained by
    crossing this species with _A. indica_, which are most serviceable
    and free. The following are most desirable: LADY MUSGRAVE, light
    carmine; MISS BUIST, pure white; MRS. CARMICHAEL, rich magenta,
    shaded crimson; PRIME MINISTER, soft pink, deep shaded, very free;
    PRINCESS BEATRICE, light mauve, very distinct and free; PRINCESS
    MAUDE, rich magenta, rose shaded.

[Illustration: FIG. 198. FLOWER OF AZALEA INDICA.]

    =A. indica= (Indian).* _fl._ campanulate, terminal, solitary or
    twin; calycine teeth long-lanceolate, obtuse, ciliated, spreading.
    _l._ cuneate-lanceolate, finely crenelated, covered with sharp,
    close-pressed rigid hairs, attenuated at both ends. Branches
    also covered with sharp, close-pressed, rigid hairs. _h._ 3ft.
    to 6ft. China, 1808. See Fig. 198. There are a great number of
    garden seedlings of the Indian Azalea, including every shade and
    colour. A selection to any extent may be made from the nurserymen's
    catalogues, but, for the guidance of the amateur, we have made a
    rigid selection of the best double and single varieties.

    =A. mollis= (soft). Synonymous with _A. sinensis_.

    =A. sinensis= (Chinese). _fl._ campanulate, downy, flame coloured;
    stamens equal in length to the petals. May. _l._ slowly deciduous,
    elliptic, acutish, pilosely pubescent, feather-nerved, with
    ciliated margins, greyish beneath. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. China and
    Japan. A large number of seedlings and hybrids from this species
    are in cultivation, known under the name of Japanese Azaleas, and
    all are valuable for the decoration of the cool conservatory, or
    for outdoor work. SYN. _A. mollis_. (L. B. C. 885.)

=AZARA= (in honour of J. N. Azara, a Spanish promoter of science, but
of botany in particular). ORD. _BixineA|_. Showy evergreen, hardy and
half-hardy shrubs, with alternate, simple, stalked stipulate leaves,
and fragrant flowers. They thrive well in a compost of loam, leaf
soil, and sand. Ripened cuttings root readily if placed in sand, under
glass, in slight heat. It is believed that all the species enumerated
will prove hardy if a slight winter protection in midland and northern
counties be afforded. This precaution will be unnecessary in more
southern parts.

    =A. dentata= (toothed). _fl._ yellow; corymbs sessile,
    few-flowered. June. _l._ ovate, serrated, scabrous, tomentose
    beneath; stipules leafy, unequal in size. _h._ 12ft. Chili, 1830.

    densely packed. Spring. _l._ large, Holly-like, ovate, coarsely
    toothed, smooth. _h._ 15ft. Chili, 1859. (B. M. 5178.)

[Illustration: FIG. 199. AZARA MICROPHYLLA, showing Habit, and Foliage
(half natural size).]

    =A. integrifolia= (entire-leaved).* _fl._ yellow, on numerous
    short axillary spikes, of an aromatic fragrance. Autumn. _l._
    obovate or oblong, entire, smooth; stipules equal, permanent. _h._
    18ft. Chili (about Conception), 1832. The variegated-leaved form,
    although rare, is very ornamental. The variegation consists of
    greenish-yellow, with a blotch of dark green, and in a young state
    edged with deep pink.

    =A. microphylla= (small-leaved).* _fl._ greenish, corymbose,
    succeeded by numerous small orange-coloured berries. Autumn. _l._
    small, distichous, obovate, obtuse, dark-shining green. _h._ 12ft.
    Chiloe and Valdavia, 1873. This shrub is very ornamental as a
    standard, and also excellent for covering walls. Quite hardy. See
    Fig. 199, for which we are indebted to Messrs. Veitch and Sons.


=BABIANA= (from _babianer_, the Dutch for baboon; in reference to
the bulbs being eaten by baboons). ORD. _IridaceA|_. A genus of very
ornamental bulbous plants confined to the Cape of Good Hope, with the
exception of a single species, which is found in Socotra. Flowers
occasionally fragrant, and generally characterised by their rich
self-colours, or the striking contrast of very distinct hues in the
same flower; perianth regular and symmetrical, with six ovate divisions
(tube varying in length). Stems from 6in. to 9in. high, arising from
a small bulb-like corm, and bearing tapering plaited leaves, which
are usually more or less densely covered with long hairs; the scapes
are racemose, each bearing about six or more simultaneously expanding
flowers. They may be successfully grown in pots. By this plan there
is, perhaps, less danger of loss, and their flowering season can be
prolonged considerably. A light sandy compost, with a small proportion
of well-decayed manure, is required, and thorough drainage is also most
essential. Use 48 or 60-sized pots, placing four or five corms in the
former, and two or three in the latter, and keep moderately dry until
they commence to form roots. October is the best time to pot. As soon
as the plants appear above ground, water may be carefully given, and
the supply proportionately increased as the plants develop. Very weak
liquid manure, applied twice a week, just as the spikes are pushing up,
will be beneficial. When the flowers fade, and the stems show signs of
decay, the supply of water must be gradually decreased, thus inducing
the thorough maturation of the corms, upon which the next season's
display depends. When quite down, store the pots in a dry place till
the time for repotting arrives, when the corms should be carefully
cleaned, and all offsets separated, the latter being potted up in the
same way as the parent corms in order to produce flowering specimens;
or they may be kept in a pot of sand and planted in a warm border
outside in March. Outdoor culture: A sheltered, sunny, and well-drained
situation is most essential to success. Although not absolutely
necessary, it is preferable to replant every year in early spring,
placing the bulbs about 5in. or 6in. deep, with a little sand sprinkled
about them. Planting may, of course, be done in autumn, when it will be
necessary to cover with cocoa nut fibre refuse to the depth of 5in. or
6in. In warm, sheltered situations, the corms may remain undisturbed;
but, as a rule, it is desirable to remove them late in autumn, when
the leaves are dead, and store them in dry sand through the winter in
a cool, airy position, free of frost. Mixed Babianas may be purchased
from dealers at a cheap rate, and, for general purposes, they are best
to plant. Propagation may be effected by offsets and seeds. The former
is the best and quickest method. The offsets should be grown in boxes
or planted out in light rich soil until large enough for flowering.
Seeds sown in pans, and placed in a gentle heat, will grow at almost
any time; the young plants will require to be carefully transplanted
each season until they develop into blooming corms.

=BABINGTONIA= (named after C. C. Babington, Professor of Botany at
Cambridge, and a distinguished botanical author). ORD. _MyrtaceA|_.
A very pretty greenhouse evergreen shrub, allied to _BA|ckea_, from
which it differs in having the stamens collected in groups opposite
the sepals. Cuttings of the young unflowering shoots may be planted
in sand under a bell glass, and kept in a moderate heat until rooted,
when they should be placed singly in small pots, in a compost of equal
parts loam and peat, with the addition of a little sand. As the small
pots fill with roots, the plants should be removed into larger ones,
and the compost have less sand in it; but this should not be done until
the next February. The established plants must have a good shift about
March or April, and should be kept in a light, airy greenhouse; the
first shoots may be topped to moderate their vigour, and to produce
a greater profusion of less luxuriant ones. In May, when most plants
are removed from the greenhouse, these should be set to grow under a
frame which, while shielding them from heavy rains, and supporting
some slight shading in the hottest parts of the sunny days, will not
prevent a free circulation of air. To this end, the frame should be
elevated from the rests or supports at its corners; the lights should
be left off at night in fine, mild weather, and on dull, cloudy days,
being only replaced during heavy rains, and when shading is necessary.
Towards autumn, the plants must be returned to the greenhouse.

    =B. CamphorasmA|= (camphor-smelling).* _fl._ pinkish-white, in
    little cymes, disposed in long terminal racemes. Summer. _l._
    linear, opposite, nerved. _h._ 7ft. Australia, 1841. (B. R. 28, 10.)

=BACCATE.= Berried, fleshy; having a pulpy texture.

=BACCHARIS= (from Bacchus, wine; referring to the spicy odour of
the roots). Ploughman's Spikenard. ORD. _CompositA|_. A genus of
hardy, stove, or greenhouse herbs, shrubs, or trees. Flower-heads
many-flowered, diA"cious, terminal. Involucre sub-hemispherical
or oblong, in many series, imbricated. Leaves simple, alternate,
exstipulate, deciduous, oblong-lanceolate, notched, serrated, or
entire. Shrubs of short duration. These plants are neither beautiful
nor ornamental, but are of easy cultivation in ordinary soil.
Propagated by cuttings.

    =B. halimifolia= (Halimus-leaved). Groundsel Tree. _fl.-heads_
    white. July. _l._ oblong-cuneate, obovate, coarsely toothed;

=BACKHOUSIA= (commemorative of the late James Backhouse, a botanical
traveller in Australia and South Africa). ORD. _MyrtaceA|_. A greenhouse
evergreen shrub, requiring a compost of fibry peat, loam, and a little
white sand. Propagated, in April, by half-ripened cuttings, inserted in
sand, under a bell glass, in a cool house.

    =B. myrtifolia= (Myrtle-leaved).* _fl._ white, disposed in corymbs,
    and often produced on cuttings soon after having struck root. May.
    _l._ ovate, acuminate, smooth. Branches slender. _h._ 16ft. New
    South Wales, 1844. (B. M. 4133.)

=BACONIA.= A synonym of =Pavetta= (which _see_).

=BACTRIS= (from _baktron_, a cane; the young stems being used for
walking sticks). ORD. _PalmaceA|_. Very ornamental, slender growing, and
prickly stove palms. Peduncle of the spadix bursting through about the
middle of the leaf sheath. Drupes small, ovate, or nearly round, and
generally of a dark blue colour. Leaves pinnatisect; segments generally
linear and entire. Instead of being confined to the apex of the trunk,
the leaves are scattered over nearly the whole surface, and the
lower ones retain their verdure long after the upper ones have fully
developed. Stems slender, varying from 2ft. to 10ft. in height. Some
of the species are of easy culture in a compost of loam, peat, loaf
mould, and sand, in equal parts; but most of them are very difficult to
manage. Propagation may be effected by suckers, which are very freely
produced. Many species are ornamental only when in a young state.

    =B. baculifera= (cane-bearing). _l._ pinnate, bifid at the apex,
    2ft. to 6ft. long; pinnA| arranged in clusters about 1ft. long and

    yellow spines, which are tipped with black. Brazil. SYN. _B.
    flavispina_.

=BACULARIA= (from _baculum_, a walking-stick). ORD. _PalmaceA|_. A small
genus containing a couple of stove species, which are amongst the
smallest palms of the Old World. Both are confined to the east coast of
tropical Australia. _B. monostachya_--in allusion to its slender stem,
which rarely exceeds in thickness that of the thumb--is known as the
Walking-stick Palm.

Commerson, the discoverer of the genus). SYN. _Dorcoceras_. ORD.
_GesneraceA|_. Curious and pretty greenhouse herbaceous perennials,
requiring a rich sandy loam. They are easily propagated by seeds.
Probably the only species in cultivation is the following:

    =B. hygrometrica= (hygrometric).* _fl._ pale blue-coloured,
    yellowish at the throat; segments of the limb more or less
    reflexed; corolla five-lobed, somewhat resembling that of the
    Violet; scapes numerous, naked, few-flowered. Summer. _l._ in a
    rosette, thinly covered with coarse white hairs, ovate acute at
    both ends, crenate serrate. _h._ 6in. North China, 1868. (B. M.
    6468.)

=BA†CKEA= (named after Abraham BA|ck, a Swedish physician, and an
esteemed friend of LinnA|us). ORD. _MyrtaceA|_. Very pretty greenhouse
evergreen shrubs. Flowers white, pedicellate, small. Leaves opposite,
glabrous, dotted. They thrive in a compost of sandy peat, leaf soil,
and lumpy, fibrous loam. Cuttings, taken from young wood, root
readily, if pricked in a pot of sand, with a bell glass placed over
them, in a cool house.

    =B. diosmA|folia= (Diosma-leaved).* _fl._ axillary, solitary,
    approximate, sessile. August to October. _l._ oblong, rather
    cuneated, keeled, acute, crowded, imbricate, and are, as well as

=BA†RIA= (named in honour of Professor Baer, of the University of
Dorpat). ORD. _CompositA|_. A genus consisting of about half a dozen
species. Probably the only one in cultivation is that mentioned below;
it is a very pretty plant, of easy culture in ordinary garden soil.
Propagated by seeds, sown in spring.

    =B. chrysostoma= (golden-mouthed). _fl.-heads_ bright yellow,
    solitary, terminal, about 1in. across; involucre of about ten
    leaflets, in two series. Early summer. _l._ linear, opposite,
    entire. Stems erect, downy. _h._ 1ft. California, 1835. (S. B. F.
    G. ii. 395.)

=BAGGED.= Swelled like a sac or bag.

=BAHIA= (probably from Port of Bahia, or San Salvador, in South
America). SYN. _Phialis_. ORD. _CompositA|_. An ornamental, hardy,
herbaceous perennial, much branched from the base of the stem, and
having a greyish appearance. It may be increased by seeds, or by
divisions.

    =B. lanata= (woolly). _fl.-heads_ yellow, solitary, produced in
    great numbers. Summer. _l._ alternate, or with the lower ones
    sometimes opposite, deeply divided, and sometimes ligulate and
    entire. _h._ 6in. to 15in. North America. This species thrives on
    borders of light and well-drained sandy soil. (B. R. 1167.)

=BALANIUS.= _See_ =Nut Weevil=.

=BALANTIUM= (of Kaulfuss). _See_ =Dicksonia=.

=BALANTIUM= (of Desvaux). _See_ =Parinarium=.

=BALBISIA= (commemorative of Giovanni Battista Balbis, a Professor
of Botany at Turin). SYN. _Ledocarpum_. ORD. _GeraniaceA|_. A very
ornamental half-hardy evergreen shrub, requiring a cool, dry
atmosphere. As it is very liable to rot off, water must be applied with
great care. Propagated by cuttings of half-ripened wood, inserted in
sand, under a hand glass; or by seeds.

    =B. verticillata= (whorled). _fl._ yellow, large, with a whorl
    of narrow bracts beneath. Autumn. _l._ opposite, three-parted;
    segments linear-oblong. Branches slender, glaucous. _h._ 3ft. to

=BALCONY.= A projection from the external wall of a house, usually
resting on brackets, and having the sides encompassed by a balustrade.
It should at all times be prettily decorated with plants, which in the
summer is a comparatively easy matter. During winter, evergreens of
various kinds are most serviceable, the best being Arbutus, Aucubas,
Boxes, Euonymuses, Hollies, Irish and Goldon Yew, Portugal Laurel,
Retinosporas, Vincas, &c. These may be grown in pots, and when
replaced by the summer occupants, should be plunged in some reserve
quarter, where they should receive plenty of water; by this means,
they will increase in size, and keep in a healthy condition. Very
little water will be required during the winter. Climbing plants, such
as Ivy, Passion Flower, Virginian Creeper, Climbing Roses, &c., are
indispensable for covering the trellises, and draping the pillars and
arches.

=BALDINGERA.= A synonym of =Premna=.

=BALL.= This term is used in reference to the roots and mass of earth
as they are moulded into form and pressed into hardness by the pot. The
masses of roots and earth which, in the case of fibrous-rooted subjects
(such as Rhododendrons), must be taken intact when removing the plants,
are also termed Balls.

=BALM= (_Melissa officinalis_). A perennial herb, often used in the
manufacture of a drink for sick persons, and sometimes employed for
culinary purposes. It may be grown in ordinary garden soil, and is
propagated by divisions, in spring. A pretty variegated form is
sometimes met with, having the additional advantage of being equal to
the normal species for medicinal purposes.

=BALM OF GILIAD.= _See_ =Cedronella triphylla= and =Populus
balsamifera=.

[Illustration: FIG. 201. CAMELLIA-FLOWERED BALSAM.]

=BALSAM= (_Impatiens Balsamina_). A well-known ornamental and tender
annual, native of India. It is one of the showiest of summer and
autumn flowers, and well deserves a place in every garden. Although of
comparatively easy cultivation, good blooms and well-grown plants are
far too rarely seen. A good Balsam bloom should be quite as double as a
perfect Camellia, and to show to the greatest advantage should appear
like one in the arrangement of the petals. To secure this, seeds should
only be saved from the finest and most perfect flowers, although the
quantity must, of necessity, be small. They should be sown, about the
third week in March, in properly prepared pans of rich sandy soil, and
placed in a gentle bottom heat of about 65deg. As soon as the first
rough leaf appears, the plants should be potted off into 3in. pots,
care being taken to let the cotyledon, or seed leaves, be close to the
soil. When the roots touch the sides of the pots, the plants should
be moved into larger ones, and this should be repeated until they are
in 8in. or 10in. pots. Some growers place one or two seeds in small
pots, so as to avoid the first shift, and a good plan it is. During
the time the plants are under glass, they should be kept as near the
light as possible, and be frequently turned around, so that they do
not draw to one side; and careful training must be given to those that
are required in fine form. Disbudding is also necessary to such as
are wanted at their best, removing all bloom from the main stem and
base of branches until the plants are of sufficient size, and then the
buds at the tops will bloom almost simultaneously. The buds that will
be formed afterwards will cause a continuance of blossom for a long
time, in fact, for some months, if the plants are liberally supplied
with liquid manure. If it is desired for them to flower out of doors,
the plants should be transferred, about May, to a frame where the
heat is not above 50deg., and be kept in a steady growing state, air
being admitted on all suitable occasions, cold winds and heavy rains
avoided, and water supplied when needed; never allow them to get dry.
They require training and disbudding the same as those grown in the
greenhouse. About June, the plants should be fully exposed during
the day; and, when danger of frost is over, the lights may be kept
off altogether. These should bloom at the end of July. In all cases,
plenty of drainage must be allowed, as the amount of water required is
very great. Insects must be sharply looked after, as well as slugs and
snails. There are several sections, such as Camellia-flowered (see Fig.
201), Rose-flowered, &c., each containing variously striped, spotted,
and entire coloured blooms, and it is best to pay an extra figure to
secure a good strain.

=BALSAMINEA†.= A tribe of plants belonging to the order _GeraniaceA|_.
Sepals and petals all coloured, consisting of six segments, "two outer
ones small, flat, and oblique; the next large, hood-shaped, ending
below in a conical spur; the fourth opposite to it, small, very broad,
concave; the two innermost very oblique, and more or less divided into
two unequal lobes." The best known genus is _Impatiens_.

=BALSAMODENDRON= (from _balsamon_-A--an old Greek word used by
Theophrastus-A--balm or balsam, and _dendron_, a tree). ORD.
_BurseraceA|_. Greenhouse or stove balsamiferous trees. Flowers small,
green, axillary, often unisexual; calyx four-toothed, permanent; petals
four, linear-oblong, induplicately valvate in A|stivation; stamens
eight, inserted under the annular disk, having elevated warts between
them. Berry, or drupe, ovate, acute, one to two-celled, marked with
four sutures. Leaves with three to five sessile, dotless leaflets. They
thrive in a compost of thoroughly drained sandy loam. Propagated by
cuttings of ripe young wood, taken in April, and placed under a hand
glass, in bottom heat. The species named below doubtfully belongs to
this genus, as the characteristics above enumerated will show.

[Illustration: FIG. 203. BAMBUSA AUREA.]

=BAMBUSA= (from _bambu_, the Malay name). Bamboo Cane. ORD. _GramineA|_.
A genus of ornamental, shrubby, greenhouse, half-hardy or hardy shrubs,
each culm flowering but once. Flowers usually hexandrous. Leaves, as
a rule, relatively shorter than the stems, lanceolate, and narrowed
at the base. Stems jointed, flexuose, branching, usually hollow, and,
when mature, of a hard, woody nature. In well drained, sheltered
situations, in the open, with rich, loamy soil, some of the species
make extremely graceful objects, particularly so in the more southern
counties of England, and in parts of Scotland. Unless a very severe
winter is experienced, they may be left without protection. Plants of
all the species, however, should have the shelter of a cold greenhouse
till about the end of April; when they should be gradually hardened
off, and transferred to a warm, sheltered spot, such as in woodlands,
by the margins of lakes, &c., as they like plenty of moisture during
the summer. A good watering must be given after planting, to settle the
soil. Propagation is effected by careful division of well-developed
plants, which should be done in early spring, just as new growth is
commencing; and it is advisable to establish the divisions in pots.

[Illustration: FIG. 204. BAMBUSA NANA.]

    =B. arundinacea= (reed-like).* Stem very stout, rising like a
    beautiful column to some 50ft. or 60ft. in height; the laterals
    producing a profusion of light green leaves, the whole presenting
    the appearance of a huge plume of feathers. India, 1730. This
    species is best treated as a stove plant, but it may be placed out
    of doors in summer. See Fig. 202. (B. F. S. 321.)

    =B. aurea= (golden).* _l._ lanceolate, acute, light green,
    distinguished from _B. nana_ by having their under surface less
    glaucescent, and the sheath always devoid of the long silky hairs.
    China. This very handsome species forms elegant tufts, with its
    slender much-branched stems, which attain a height of from 6ft. to
    10ft., and are of a light green colour in a young state, ultimately
    changing into a yellowish hue. Hardy in most parts of the country.
    See Fig. 203.

    =B. Fortunei= (Fortune's).* _l._ linear-lanceolate, abruptly
    pointed, somewhat rounded at the base, on very short hairy stalks,
    serrated and often fringed with long hairs on the margin, downy
    on both sides, and distinctly variegated, the transverse veins
    often of a bottle-green colour. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Japan. A dwarf
    tufted species, with very slender stem. Quite hardy. There are only
    variegated varieties of this in cultivation, viz., _variegata_ and
    _argenteovittata_. (F. d. S. 1863, t. 1535.)

    =B. mitis= (small). _l._ deep green, lanceolate, acute, striated,
    clasping the stem; panicle simple, erect, close; spikes long,
    imbricated. Stem tapering. _h._ 40ft. Cochin China and Japan. This
    vigorous-growing species can be cultivated out of doors during
    summer, and, in most localities, it may be left out all the year.

    =B. nana= (dwarf).* _l._ lanceolate, acute, glaucous, stoutish,
    with the footstalks slightly downy. _h._ 6ft. to 8ft. India, 1826.
    A rather tender species, requiring to be grown in the stove or
    greenhouse. SYNS. _B. glauca_ and _B. viridi-glaucescens_. See Fig.
    204.

    =B. nigra= (black). _See_ =Phyllostachys nigra=.

    =B. Ragamowski= (Ragamowsk's).* _l._ 9in. to 18in. long, and about
    1in. to 3in. broad. China and Japan. This species "can readily
    be recognised by the tomentose line on one side of the midrib,
    running nearly the whole length of the leaf on the underside, this
    line being always on the longer side of the leaf." Hardy. SYN. _B.
    tessellata_.

    =B. Simonii= (Simon's).* _l._ narrow, nearly 6in. to 10in. long,
    occasionally striped with white. Stems growing with great rapidity,
    mealy-glaucous at the joints; branchlets numerous, rather closely
    crowded. _h._ 10ft. China and Japan, 1866.

    =B. striata= (striated).* _l._ linear-oblong; culms striped yellow
    and green. _h._ 6ft. to 20ft. China, 1874. A very slender and
    graceful, rather tender, species. May be grown in the open air
    during summer, and in very favoured spots it is probably hardy,
    especially if covered with a mat in winter. It makes an excellent
    pot plant. SYN. _B. viridi-striata_. (B. M. 6079.)

    =B. tessellata= (tessellated).* A synonym of _B. Ragamowski_.

    =B. violescens= (nearly-violet).* _l._ green above, bluish-grey
    beneath, with an elongated ligule, surrounded by a bundle of
    black hairs. Stems much branched, blackish-violet. China, 1869.
    This handsome and vigorous species is intermediate between
    _Phyllostachys nigra_ and _B. nana_. It requires protection during
    winter.

plants, inserted in Ray's "Historia Plantarum"). ORD. _MalpighiaceA|_.
Stove trees or shrubs, frequently climbing. Flowers yellow; calyx
five-parted; petals furnished with long stalks; stamens ten. Leaves
simple, stalked. They are for the most part very ornamental, but are
not often seen in flower in this country. They will grow in a mixture
of loam, leaf soil, and peat, with some sharp sand added. Cuttings,
made from ripened wood, will root freely in sandy soil, under a hand
glass, in stove heat, taking about three or four weeks to do so.

    =B. chrysophylla= (golden-leaved).* _fl._ deep orange, axillary,
    corymbose. _l._ ovate, oblong, acutish, somewhat sinuated towards

=BANKS.= These are usually formed with a view to increasing the amount
of surface ground, and for the acceleration or retarding of vegetable
crops, such as strawberries, &c. They should be from 6ft. to 12ft.
apart, according to the depth of soil, and run from east to west. In
constructing Banks of a uniform size, great care, and a constant use
of the garden line, will be found necessary. For the warmest side of
the Banks, Dwarf French Beans, Peas, Vegetable Marrows, Cucumbers,
New Zealand Spinach, Capsicums, &c., may be grown. On the opposite
side, and when a prolonged supply is desired, Cauliflower, Broccoli,
Lettuce, Turnip, Spinach, &c., may be sown thinly in drills, to be
thinned out, and remain. It needs but little discretion to produce
valuable crops by this method.

=BANKSIA= (named in honour of Sir Joseph Banks, once President of the
Royal Society, and a distinguished patron of science, particularly
of Natural History). ORD. _ProteaceA|_. Greenhouse evergreen shrubs,
natives of Australia, principally grown for the beauty of their
foliage. Leaves variable in form, usually dark green, clothed with
white or rufous down beneath; margins deeply serrated or spinous,
rarely entire. The following is the mode of culture recommended many
years ago by Sweet. The pots should be well drained, by placing a
potsherd about half way over the hole at the bottom of the pot, then
laying another piece against it that it may be hollow, afterwards
putting some smaller pieces all around them, and on the top of these
some others broken very small. All the plants belonging to the order
_ProteaceA|_ should be drained in a similar manner, as the roots are
very fond of running amongst the broken potsherds, and consequently
there is less danger of their being overwatered. Care must also be
taken not to allow them to flag, as they seldom recover if once allowed
to get very dry. The plants should be placed in an airy part of the
house when indoors. Cuttings are generally supposed to be difficult to
root, but this is not the case if properly managed. Let them be well
ripened before they are taken off; then cut them at a joint, and place
them in pots of sand, without shortening any of the leaves, except on
the part that is planted in the sand, where they should be taken off
quite close. The less depth they are planted in the pots the better, so
long as they stand firm when the sand is well closed round them. Place
them under hand glasses in the propagating house, but do not plunge
them in heat. Take the glasses off frequently to give them air, and dry
them, or they will probably damp off. When rooted, transfer to small
pots; after which, place them in a close, unheated frame, and harden by
degrees. Seeds are a very unsatisfactory means of multiplying the stock.

=BARBACENIA.= (named after M. Barbacena, a Governor of Minas Geraes).
Formerly placed in ORD. _HA|modoraceA|_, but now referred by Bentham and
Hooker to _AmaryllidaceA|_. Very singular and pretty stove evergreen
herbaceous perennials, allied to _Vellozia_. Flowers purple, large,
showy; perianth funnel-shaped, resinosely hairy on the outside; limb
spreading; scapes one-flowered, usually clothed with glandular hairs.
Leaves firm, spiral, spreading, acutely keeled. Lindley says that they
are capable of existing in a dry, hot air without contact with the
earth, on which account they are favourites in South American gardens,
where, with Orchids and Bromeliads, they are suspended in the dwelling
houses, or hung to the balustrades of the balconies, in which situation
they flower abundantly, filling the air with their fragrance. They are
rarely seen in our gardens. They may be grown in baskets of fibrous
loam and peat, with some nodules of charcoal added.

=BARBADOS GOOSEBERRY.= _See_ =Pereskia aculeata=.

=BARBADOS LILY.= _See_ =Hippeastrum equestre=.

=BARBAREA= (anciently called Herb of St. Barbara). Winter Cress;
American Cress. ORD. _CruciferA|_. Hardy glabrous perennial herbs.
Flowers yellow; racemes erect, terminal. Stems erect. They are of easy
culture, but scarcely worth growing in the pleasure garden. Propagated
by cuttings, suckers, divisions, or seeds.

    =B. prA|cox= (early). _l._, lower ones lyrate; terminal lobe ovate;
    upper ones pinnate-parted; lobes linear-oblong, quite entire. _h._
    1ft. to 1-1/2ft. Commonly known as American, or Black American
    Cress. Here and there on roadsides, and in dry gravelly places in
    Great Britain. An escape from cultivation. (Sy. En. B. 124.)

    =B. vulgaris= (common). _l._, lower ones lyrate; terminal lobe
    roundish; upper ones obovate, toothed, or pinnatifid. _h._ 1-1/4ft.
    The double flowering form of this native species is the only one
    of this genus worth growing for beauty; it is generally known as
    Double Yellow Rocket. The variegated form is also rather pretty,
    and comes true from seed. (Sy. En. B. 120.)

=BARBATUS.= Having long weak hairs, in one or more tufts; bearded.

=BARBERRY.= _See_ =Berberis=.

=BARBIERIA= (in honour of J. B. G. Barbier, M.D., a French physician
and naturalist, author of "Principes Generaux de Pharmacologie ou de
MatiA"re Medicale," Paris, 1806). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. An ornamental stove
evergreen, requiring a mixture of peat, loam, and sand. Propagated by
cuttings of half-ripened wood, which should be placed in sand, under a
glass, in stove heat.

    =B. polyphylla= (many-leaved).* _fl._ scarlet, 2in. long;
    racemes axillary, few-flowered, shorter than the leaves. _l._
    impari-pinnate, with nine to eleven pairs of elliptic-oblong,
    mucronate leaflets, pubescent in an adult state. Porto Rico, 1818.
    SYNS. _Clitorea polyphylla_ and _Galactia pinnata_.

=BARBS.= Hooked hairs.

=BARK.= The outer integuments of a plant beyond the wood, and formed of
tissue parallel with it.

=BARK-BOUND.= This condition is generally the result of very rich soil,
or insufficient drainage. In most fruit trees a gummy exudation takes
place. If caused by stagnancy, thorough drainage should immediately be
effected. Scrubbing the stem is also recommended. Slitting the bark
with a knife is likely to do more harm than good, particularly so in
the hands of the inexperienced.

=BARKERIA= (name commemorative of the late G. Barker, of Birmingham,
an ardent cultivator of orchids). ORD. _OrchidaceA|_. From a scientific
point of view, this genus should be included in _Epidendrum_. Very
handsome, deciduous, epiphytal, cool-house orchids, having slender
pseudo-bulbs, from 6in. to 12in. high, from the top of which the
numerous flower-stems are produced. In a cool, airy temperature, these
plants grow vigorously, suspended in pans or small baskets close
beneath the glass, and slightly shaded with tiffany. They succeed well
also on flat blocks of wood, on the top of which they should be tied,
without any moss, as their freely-produced, thick, fleshy roots soon
cling to the blocks. During the season of growth, a good supply of
water is needed, and in hot weather it may be applied three or four
times daily; the blocks and plants are best immersed in water; but when
at rest, a slight watering twice or three times a week will suffice.
Propagated by divisions, just previous to the commencement of new
growth.

    =B. elegans= (elegant).* _fl._ in loose racemes, four or five in
    each; each blossom about 2in. across; sepals and petals dark rose;
    lip reddish crimson, spotted and edged with a lighter colour.
    Winter. _h._ 2ft. Mexico, 1836. Of this beautiful slender-growing
    species, there are two or three varieties in cultivation. (B. M.
    4784.)

    =B. Lindleyana= (Lindley's).* _fl._, raceme 2ft. long, very
    slender, bearing from five to seven blossoms near its apex; sepals
    and petals rosy purple; lip white, with a deep purple blotch at its
    apex. September, remaining in beauty for a considerable time. _h._
    2ft. Costa Rica, 1842. (B. M. 6098.)

    =B. L. CenterA|= (Center's).* _fl._ rosy lilac; lip oblong; margins
    crenulated or crisped; apex blotched deep purple. Costa Rica, 1873.

    =B. melanocaulon= (dark-stemmed).* _fl._ on an erect spike; sepals
    and petals rosy lilac; lip broader at the base than at the top,
    reddish-purple, having a blotch of green in the centre. August.

    =B. Skinneri= (Skinner's).* _fl._ deep rose-coloured; spikes
    6in. to 9in. long, from the apices of the ripened growth, often
    branched, forming a dense mass of deep purple blossoms, which, if
    kept dry, lasts from eight to ten weeks. _h._ 1-1/2ft. Guatemala.
    (P. M. B. 15, 1.)

    =B. S. superbum= (superb).* _fl._ dark rose; lip somewhat deeper
    tinted, and marked towards the base with yellow streaks. Guatemala.
    This far surpasses the type in size and number of flowers, as well
    as in brilliancy of colour. (W. S. O. 38.)

    =B. spectabilis= (showy).* _fl._ quite 2in. across, produced
    eight or ten together, on a spike issuing from the top of the
    pseudo-bulb; sepals and petals oblong, acuminate, rosy lilac; lip
    white, margined with deep lilac or rosy purple, and dotted or
    spotted with crimson. This very distinct and desirable species
    lasts from eight to ten weeks in beauty, and forms a very handsome
    object when placed in the drawing-room and covered over with a
    large glass shade. Guatemala, 1843. (B. M. 4094.)

=BARKING-IRONS.= Instruments used in taking off the bark of trees.

=BARKLYA= (named after Sir H. Barkly, formerly Governor of South
Australia). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A large greenhouse tree, thriving in a
compost of loam and leaf mould. Propagated by seeds and cuttings; the
latter should be half ripened, and placed in sandy soil, under a bell
glass, in a cool house.

    =B. syringifolia= (Syringa-leaved). _fl._ golden yellow, numerous,
    disposed in axillary or terminal racemes. _l._ alternate, simple,
    coriaceous. _h._ 30ft. Moreton Bay, 1858.

=BARK STOVE.= A hothouse adapted for moisture-loving exotics, and
having a pit from 2ft. to 4ft. deep, containing fermenting matter,
chiefly tanners' bark, by which means a steady heat is maintained for
a considerable time. The Bark Stove is now almost obsolete. Bark is,
however, still largely used in pine pits, and in some propagating beds;
but such beds are generally superseded by hot-water or hot-air tanks.

=BARLERIA= (named after J. Barrelier, a French botanist of the
seventeenth century). ORD. _AcanthaceA|_. A genus of interesting and
ornamental stove evergreen shrubs. Flowers axillary or terminal; calyx
four-sepaled, the two outer larger than the others. They thrive best if
grown in loam and peat, with a little rotten dung added. Propagated by
cuttings made of the young wood, and placed in a similar compost, under
a bell glass, in stove temperature, with bottom heat.

    =B. flava= (yellow).* _fl._ yellow, aggregate, terminal, tubular;
    bracts very narrow, setose. Summer. _l._ lanceolate, hairy, entire.
    Plant unarmed. _h._ 3ft. India, 1816. SYN. _B. mitis_. (B. M. 4113.)

    =B. Gibsoni= (Gibson's). _fl._ pale purple, rather large,
    sub-terminal. Winter. _l._ ovate or oblong-lanceolate. India, 1867.
    A glabrous stove shrub, of branched habit. (B. M. 5628.)

    =B. Leichtensteiniana= (Leichtenstein's).* _fl._ very curious;
    spikes axillary, 2in. to 3in. long, ovoid or oblong, consisting of
    a large number of closely packed overlapping bracts, all turned
    to the fore or lower part of the spike; bracts ovate-acuminate,
    mucronate, spine-toothed, one-ribbed, with prominent and curved
    veins, and 1in. to 1-1/2. long. _l._ opposite, 1in. to 2in. long,
    linear-lanceolate, entire, mucronate, tapering at the base into a
    very short stalk. Branches slender, virgate, sub-angular. South
    Africa, 1870. This plant is covered over its whole surface with
    close, white, hoary down. (G. C. 1870, p. 73.)

    =B. longifolia= (long-leaved). _fl._ white; spines of whorls six.
    Summer. _l._ ensiform, very long, rough. _h._ 2ft. India, 1781.
    This is a biennial.

    =B. lupulina= (Hop-headed). _fl._ yellowish; spikes ovate; bracts
    ovate, concave, imbricated. August. _l._ lanceolate, quite entire;
    spines simple, spreading. _h._ 2ft. Mauritius, 1824.

    =B. Mackenii= (MacKen's).* _fl._ purple, large, in a
    terminal raceme. Spring. _l._ recurved, narrow-ovate, or
    elliptic-lanceolate, sub-acute, petioled. Natal, 1870. (B. M. 5866.)

    =B. mitis= (small). Synonymous with _B. flava_.

    =B. prionitis= (Prionitis-like). _fl._ orange; spines axillary,
    pedate, in fours. Summer. _l._ quite entire, lanceolate-ovate. _h._
    3ft. India, 1759.

=BARLEY.= _See_ =Hordeum vulgare=.

=BARNADESIA= (named after Michael Barnadez, a Spanish botanist). ORD.
_CompositA|_. Pretty greenhouse deciduous shrubs, requiring a dry
atmosphere. They should be grown in peat, loam, and sand, in equal
proportions. Propagated either by seeds, sown in hotbeds in March, or
by cuttings, made of half-ripened wood in April, and placed in sand
under a bell glass.

[Illustration: FIG. 206. BARNADESIA ROSEA.]

    =B. rosea= (rosy).* _fl.-heads_ rose-coloured, solitary,
    ovate-cylindrical, downy, sessile; florets bilabiate, one lip
    oblong-emarginate, villous, the other filiform; hairs on receptacle
    twisted; pappus stiff, plumose. May. _l._ alternate, ovate, acute
    at both ends. _h._ 1-1/2ft. South America, 1840. See Fig. 206. (B.
    M. 4232.)

=BARNARDIA.= Included under =Scilla= (which _see_).

=BAROMETER.= An instrument for measuring the density of the atmosphere,
and hence determining the probable changes of weather, or the height of
any ascent. To the gardener the Barometer is indispensable as a warning
to take due precaution.

=BAROSMA= (from _barys_, heavy, and _osme_, smell; referring to the
powerful scent of the leaves). Name often incorrectly spelt _Baryosma_.
SYN. _Parapetalifera_. ORD. _RutaceA|_. Very pretty small, Heath-like,
greenhouse evergreen shrubs, from the Cape of Good Hope. Calyx equally
five-parted; petals five, oblong; stamens ten. Leaves opposite or
scattered, coriaceous, flat, dotted, with their margins sometimes
glandularly serrulated, sometimes almost entire or revolute. They
thrive in a mixture of sand, peat, and a little turfy loam, with good
drainage and firm potting. Cuttings, taken from ripened wood, inserted
in a pot of sand, and placed in a shady position in a cool house, with
a bell glass over them, will root readily in a few weeks.

    =B. betulina= (Birch-leaved). _fl._ white, axillary, solitary.
    February to September. _l._ opposite, obovate, serrulate, sessile,
    spreading. _h._ 1ft. to 3ft. 1790. (B. M. Pl. 45.)

    =B. dioica= (diA"cious).* _fl._ purplish; peduncles axillary,
    usually in threes, shorter than the leaves. April. _l._ scattered;
    upper ones ternate, lanceolate, tapering to both ends, full of
    glandular dots, spreading. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. 1816. (B. R. 502.)

    =B. latifolia= (broad-leaved). _fl._ white, usually solitary,
    lateral. July. _l._ opposite, ovate-oblong, sessile, serrulated,
    smoothish, without glandular dots; branches villous. _h._ 1ft. 1789.

    =B. pulchella= (pretty).* _fl._ pale red or purple; peduncles
    axillary, usually solitary, exceeding the leaves. February. _l._
    crowded, ovate, quite smooth, with thickened, crenate-glandular
    margins. _h._ 1ft. to 3ft. 1787.

    =B. serratifolia= (saw-edged-leaved).* _fl._ white; peduncles
    axillary, sub-divided. March to June. _l._ nearly opposite,
    lanceolate, stalked, glandularly serrulated, smooth. _h._ 1ft. to
    3ft. 1789. (B. M. 456, and B. Z. 1853, 12.)

=BARRED.= Marked in spaces with a paler colour, resembling bars.

=BARREN FLOWERS.= The male or staminate flowers of many plants, such
as the Cucumber, Melon, &c., are popularly known as Barren Flowers,
_i.e._, they produce no fruit. This condition is, in some respects,
similar to "blind" Strawberries or "blind" Cabbages, so far as fruition
is concerned, but structurally and functionally it is widely different.
The Barren Flowers of the Cucumber, Melon, &c., are produced by what
are known as monA"cious plants, _i.e._, having male and female organs
in different flowers, but on the same plant. In the Strawberry, &c.,
Barren Flowers are generally the result of unfavourable surroundings,
or unskilful cultivation. A good example of Barren Flowers is seen in
the ray-florets of many Composite plants, which are frequently really
neuter, having neither male nor female organs.

=BARREN SOILS.= A term signifying such soils as are normally
unprofitable. The term can only be correctly applied in very few
cases; as almost any soil may be rendered capable of affording a basis
for some kind of vegetable life, arboreal or other. The question of
planting up the enormous quantity of what is now waste land, might
well engage the most practical consideration. Of course, the natural
state of any land will, to a great extent, determine what would be its
ultimate condition, after all that could be effected by mechanical
agency has been accomplished. Drainage, irrigation, enrichment,
pulverisation, are all matters which can only be considered upon a
particular basis; but we doubt not that the thousands of acres of land
now practically almost useless, might, by the adoption of proper means,
be rendered fairly remunerative.

=BARREN-WORT.= _See_ =Epimedium=.

=BARRINGTONIA= (named after the Hon. Daines Barrington, F.R.S.). ORD.
_MyrtaceA|_. A genus of stove evergreen trees and shrubs, very difficult
to cultivate. Flowers large, racemose. Leaves opposite or whorled,
generally obovate; margins toothed or entire. Fruit one-seeded, fleshy.
They require a compost of two parts loam, one peat, and one sand. Water
should be given in abundance, and a moist atmosphere at all times
maintained, the temperature ranging from 65deg. to 95deg. Propagated
by cuttings obtained from the lateral shoots; these, taken off at a
joint when the wood is ripe, planted in sand, with a hand glass over
them, root readily. The cuttings should not be stripped of any of their
leaves.

    =B. racemosa= (raceme-flowered). _fl._ red; racemes pendulous,
    very long. _l._ cuneate-oblong, acuminated, serrulated. _h._ 30ft.
    Malabar, 1822. (B. M. 3831.)

    =B. speciosa= (showy).* _fl._ purple and white, large and handsome,
    disposed in an erect thyrse. _l._ shining, cuneate-oblong, obtuse,
    quite entire. _h._ 20in. to 30in. in England. This beautiful
    species seldom attains a height of more than 6ft. or 8ft. (G. C.
    1845, p. 56.)

=BARROW.= Garden Barrows are very numerous, both with and without
wheels. The Flower-pot Barrow has a wheel and a flat surface, on which
plants, pots, or leaves are placed, either directly, or, when small,
in shallow baskets. The Haum Barrow is an open box or case, of wicker
or other work, placed on, or suspended from, a pair of handles, with
or without a wheel, and is useful for carrying litter, leaves, &c. The
Water Barrow, instead of a box, contains a barrel, tub, or cistern, in
which fluid manure, or ordinary water, is conveyed to different parts
of the garden. The Hand-barrow is a frame of wood, carried by two
levers, which form four handles; for removing large pots or tubs of
trees or shrubs it is very useful.

[Illustration: FIG. 207. FLOWER OF BARTONIA AUREA.]

=BARTLINGIA.= A synonym of =Plocama= (which _see_).

=BARTONIA= (in honour of Benjamin S. Barton, M.D., formerly Professor
of Botany at Philadelphia). ORD. _LoasaceA|_. Hardy annuals or
biennials, downy, with stiff and bearded hairs. This genus is now
placed under _Mentzelia_ in most standard botanical works. Flowers
white or yellow, large, terminal, expanding in the evening, when they
are very fragrant, and becoming reddish as they fade. Leaves alternate,
interruptedly pinnatifid. The species are very showy, and well worth
growing. Any ordinary garden soil suits them. Seeds should be raised
in a gentle heat in spring; and, when the seedlings are sufficiently
large, they should be potted singly into small, well-drained pots. In
winter, they should be placed on a dry shelf in a greenhouse or frame.
_B. aurea_ is one of the brightest of hardy annuals, and may be sown
either in a frame, or in the open border in April.

    =B. albescens= (whitish).* _fl._, petals ten, pale yellow, disposed
    in a leafy panicle. July. _l._ sinuately toothed. Stem with a
    white shining epidermis. _h._ 1ft. to 4ft. Chili, 1831. Annual or
    biennial. (S. B. F. G. ii., 182.)

    =B. aurea= (golden).* _fl._ two or three together, terminal, bright
    golden yellow, as large as a half-crown; petals five. June. _h._
    1ft. California, 1834. Annual. See Fig. 207. (B. M. 3649.)

    =B. nuda= (naked) and =B. ornata= (adorned) are two very pretty
    white-flowered biennial species. _h._ 2ft. Missouri, 1811.

=BARYOSMA.= _See_ =Barosma=.

=BASAL=, or =BASILAR=. Situated at the base of anything; as the embryo,
when situated at the bottom of the seed.

=BASELLA= (its Malabar name). Malabar Nightshade. ORD. _BasellaceA|_.
Annual or biennial stove trailers, with white or pinkish flowers, of
no great horticultural value. In India, and elsewhere throughout the
tropics, some of the species are cultivated as pot herbs, and are used
as a substitute for Spinach.

    =B. alba= (white).* _fl._ white. August. _l._ heart-shaped,
    pointed. _h._ 8in. India, 1688. This plant, either when allowed to
    fall in festoons from the roof of a warm house, or treated as a
    basket plant, forms an elegant object when in flower.

=BASELLACEA†.= A series of usually herbaceous climbers, and considered
a tribe of _ChenopodiaceA|_.

=BASIL, SWEET= (_Ocymum basilicum_). This is a tender annual from
India, and must be raised in gentle heat. The foliage is somewhat
largely used for flavouring purposes. Seeds should be sown in April,
the seedlings pricked out into boxes to strengthen, and finally planted
out about 8in. asunder, in beds of light rich soil, in June, being well
watered until fully established. As soon as they bloom, they should be
cut down to within a few inches of the ground, and the portions cut off
should be tied up in small bunches and dried in the shade for winter
use. Some of the plants can be lifted in September, potted up, and
placed in a warm greenhouse for the winter, when the fresh green leaves
will be found very useful. Bush Basil (_Ocymum minimum_) is a dwarfer
plant, but may be treated in the same way. Wild Basil is botanically
known as _Calamintha Clinopodium_.

=BASIL-THYME.= _See_ =Calamintha Acinos=.

=BASI-NERVED.= When the nerves of a leaf spring from the base.

=BASING-UP.= The raising of a small bank of earth entirely round a
plant, so as to retain water immediately about the root. The term is
sometimes used to signify =Earthing= or =Moulding=, which _see_.

=BASKETS.= Few objects contribute more to the adornment of a window,
or the decoration of the diningroom, drawing-room, or glass-house,
than Hanging Baskets, tastefully filled with handsome foliaged and
flowering plants. Baskets are made in different forms and of various
materials, such as wire, terra-cotta, wood, and cork. The Wire Baskets
have a very light and elegant appearance, and are generally used. In
filling Baskets, the inside should be lined with a thick layer of moss,
or _Selaginella Kraussiana_, next to which a layer of coarse sacking
must be placed, to prevent the soil from working through. Terra-cotta
Baskets are very pretty, and are extensively employed in domestic
rooms, but they should always have one or more holes at the bottom, to
facilitate drainage. Rustic Baskets, of cork or wood, are also very
suitable for floral arrangements; those composed of teak-wood are very
generally used for orchids. The compost should be prepared according to
the requirements of the plant or plants intended to be grown, which can
be easily ascertained on reference to such plants in this work. The
soil should not be allowed to get dry; in the event of this happening,
however, a thorough soaking by immersion must be given. As a rule,
attention should be given in the matter of watering every other day,
and light syringing every morning and evening during the spring and
summer months will be most beneficial. The Baskets should be examined
every week, all dead or decaying leaves being removed, and any insects,
which are so likely to get a foothold, destroyed. In arranging the
subjects, the centre plant should be the tallest, the next outer ones
shorter, and the marginal ones of a trailing or drooping habit, so that
the whole may present a symmetrical, and at the same time a natural,
appearance. Wickerwork Baskets are used for carrying or transferring
plants, and are generally made 18in. wide by 20in. deep; they are
extremely useful, and should be in every garden. Split wood and withes
are largely employed in making Baskets. The Planter's Basket, described
by Loudon as a flat, rectangular utensil of wickerwork or boards,
partitioned into three or more parts, for the purpose of carrying
with the gardener when about to plant or remove plants, is now,
unfortunately, almost obsolete. One division is for the plants, another
for those taken up, and a third for the tools to be made use of, and
for any decayed parts of plants, stones, weeds, or other refuse which
may be collected. By using this Basket, order, accuracy, and neatness
are secured. The Sussex "Truck" Baskets, made of willow-wood, are very
useful, being both light and durable. _See also_ =Measures=.

=BASSIA= (named after Ferdinando Bassi, Curator of the Botanic Garden
at Bologna). ORD. _SapotaceA|_. Handsome lofty-growing lactescent stove
trees, with axillary, solitary, or aggregate flowers, and quite entire,
smooth, coriaceous leaves. They require stove heat, and a compost of
peat and loam. Cuttings, taken from ripened wood, strike readily in
sand, under a hand glass, in a strong moist heat.

    =B. butyracea= (buttery). The Indian Butter Tree. _fl._, pedicels
    aggregate, and are, as well as the calyces, woolly. _l._ obovate,
    8in. to 9in. long, and 4in. to 5in. broad, tomentose beneath. _h._
    30ft. to 70ft. Nepaul, 1823. (B. F. F. 35.)

    =B. latifolia= (broad-leaved). The Mahwah Tree of Bengal. _fl._,
    corolla thick and fleshy; pedicels drooping, terminal. _l._ oblong
    or elliptic, smooth above, whitish beneath, 4in. to 8in. long, and
    2in. to 4in. broad. _h._ 50ft. India, 1799. (B. F. S. 41.)

    =B. longifolia= (long-leaved). _fl._, pedicels axillary, drooping,
    crowded round the ends of the branchlets. _l._ ovate-lanceolate,
    approximate at the tops of the branches, 6in. long, deciduous. _h._
    50ft. Malabar, 1811. (B. F. S. 42.)

=BASS= or =BAST MATS=. These are prepared, chiefly in Russia, from
the inner bark of various Limes (_Tilia_), and are very largely used
in this country by nurserymen for packing purposes. They are also
extensively employed as coverings, being excellent preventatives of the
effects of frost. They are beneficial as a covering for beds of early
vegetables, to prevent radiation during the night. For tying purposes
they are now greatly superseded by Raffia Grass. Archangel Mats are
larger, and of better quality than the St. Petersburgh. Dunnage Mats
are heavy, and generally used for covering, as they are much cheaper.

=BATATAS= (its aboriginal name). ORD. _ConvolvulaceA|_. This genus is
now referred to _IpomA|a_. Strong, free-growing, greenhouse or stove
deciduous twiners. Calyx of five sepals; corolla campanulate; stamens
inclosed. They are of easy culture, only requiring plenty of room to
spread, and are well adapted for trellis work, or to run up pillars.
They are all tuberous rooted, and therefore require to be kept dry when
in a dormant state. A rich, open, loamy soil is most suitable. Young
cuttings strike readily under a hand glass, in heat.

    =B. bignonioides= (Bignonia-like).* _fl._, corolla dark purple,
    funnel-shaped, with a curled limb; peduncles many-flowered, nutant,
    shorter than the petioles. July. _l._ three-lobed; hind lobes
    rounded, imbricate. Cayenne, 1824. (B. M. 2645.)

    =B. Cavanillesii= (Cavanilles').* _fl._ pale whitish-red; lobes
    of corolla obtuse, crenulated; peduncles one to three-flowered.
    August. _l._ quinate; leaflets ovate, entire, unequal. Native
    country unknown, 1815.

[Illustration: FIG. 208. BATATAS EDULIS, showing Tuber.]

    =B. edulis= (edible).* Sweet Potato. _fl._, corolla 1in. long,
    white outside and purple inside; peduncles equal in length to the
    petioles, or exceeding them, three to four-flowered. _l._ variable,
    usually angular, also lobed. Stem creeping, rarely climbing. East
    Indies, 1797. See Fig. 208.

    =B. glaucifolia= (milky-green-leaved). _fl._, corolla small,
    purplish, with an inflated tube, and ovate, acute segments;
    peduncles two-flowered, length of leaves. May. _l._ sagittate,
    truncate behind, on long petioles. Mexico, 1732.

    =B. heterophylla= (various-leaved). _fl._ blue; peduncles solitary,
    axillary, bearing each three sessile flowers. July. _l._ quinately
    palmate; lobes or leaflets ovate-spathulate, acute. Plant very
    villous. Cuba, 1817.

    =B. paniculata= (panicled).* _fl._ large, purple; peduncles
    much exceeding the petioles, many-flowered, dichotomously and
    corymbosely panicled. June _l._ palmate, five to seven-cleft;
    lobes ovate-lanceolate or elliptic, bluntish, rarely
    sub-acuminated. India, 1799. (G. C. n. s., x., 341.)

    =B. senegalensis= (Senegalese). _fl._ white or purplish, large;
    peduncles three-flowered. June. _l._ quinately palmate; lobes
    ovate, obtuse, middle one the largest. Stem white, tubercular.
    Guinea, 1823.

    =B. venosa= (veiny). _fl._ purple; peduncles umbellate, with an
    ovate-cordate, solitary leaf at the base of each pedicel. July.
    _l._ digitately quinate; leaflets petiolate, acuminated, quite
    entire. France, 1820.

=BATEMANNIA= (named after Mr. J. Bateman, a collector and cultivator
of orchids, and author of a "Monograph of Odontoglossum," and other
works on orchidaceous plants). ORD. _OrchidaceA|_. A small and
easily-grown genus of dwarf, compact-growing epiphytes, closely
allied to _Maxillaria_, but differing from that genus in having the
anther-bed with a membranous border. They may be grown in pots, in
a compost of peat and moss, or on blocks of wood with moss. They
require an intermediate house and plenty of water in the growing
season. Propagated by divisions and offsets. They have generally a
free-flowering habit; but some of the species are not so ornamental as
many other orchids.

    up with the young growth, bearing three or four flowers, of
    curious structure; sepals and petals olive-green, striped with
    reddish-brown; lip white, with reddish-purple streaks, orange or
    yellow towards the base. Pseudo-bulbs ovate, 3in. or 4in. long, and
    bearing two large, broad, leathery leaves. New Grenada, 1866. (B.
    M. 5567.)

    =B. Wallisii= (Wallis').* _fl._, sepals light greenish-yellow
    outside, olive-green to chestnut-brown inside, with some yellow
    at the base; petals with scarlet stripes at the very base, but
    otherwise coloured like the sepals; lip blade greenish, with a
    brownish hue at the anterior part; peduncles slender, corymbose.
    _h._ 1ft. Columbia, 1876.

=BATSCHIA.= _See_ =Lithospermum=.

=BAUERA= (named after Francis and Ferdinand Bauer, German botanical
draughtsmen). ORD. _SaxifragaceA|_. Small shrubs, natives of Australia,
New Zealand, &c. Flowers axillary, solitary, pedunculate. Leaves six in
a whorl, approximating by threes, and therefore, as it were, opposite
and ternate, exstipulate. Easily cultivated in a compost of sandy loam
and peat. Propagated by cuttings, placed in sandy soil, under a glass.
These very pretty little greenhouse evergreens flower nearly the whole
year through.

    =B. humilis= (low). _fl._, corolla red, one-half smaller than _B.
    rubioides_, and the plant is altogether much smaller. July to
    December. _l._ oblong, crenated. _h._ 1ft. New South Wales, 1804.
    (L. B. C. 1197.)

    =B. rubiA|folia= (madder-leaved). Synonymous with _B. rubioides_.

    =B. rubioides= (madder-like).* _fl._ pale red, or pink. _l._
    lanceolate, crenated. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. New South Wales, 1793. SYN.
    _B. rubiA|folia_. (A. B. R. 198.)

=BAUHINIA= (in honour of John and Caspar Bauhin, two famous botanists
of the sixteenth century). Mountain Ebony. ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Very
showy stove evergreen shrubs. Flowers racemose; petals five, spreading,
oblong, rather unequal, upper one usually distant from the rest. Leaves
two-lobed, constantly composed of two jointed leaflets at the top of
the petiole, sometimes nearly free, but usually joined together, more
or less, and with an awn in the recess. They succeed well in a mixture
of sand, loam, and peat, requiring good drainage and moderately firm
potting. Propagated by cuttings, which should be taken when the wood is
neither very ripe nor very young; the leaves must be dressed off, and
the cuttings planted in sand, under a glass, in moist heat. Although
glorious objects in the tropics, few of the species flower under our
comparatively sunless skies; those which hitherto have succeeded well
in Britain are marked with an asterisk.

    =B. acuminata= (taper-pointed-leaved). _fl._ pure white; petals
    broadly ovate, hardly stipitate. June. _l._ rather cordate at the

    =B. aurita= (eared). _fl._ white; petals ovate, on short stipes.
    August. _l._ glabrous, cordate at the base; leaflets connected the
    fourth part of their length, oblong-lanceolate, nearly parallel,

    as well as the petioles, branches, and calyces, clothed with rufous
    villi. Shrubby climber. India, 1818. (G. C. 1881, xvi., p. 204.)

    =B. inermis= (unarmed). _fl._ white; petals linear; racemes
    terminal, leafless, simple. _l._ ovate at the base, ferruginous
    beneath; leaflets oblong, acute, four-nerved, parallel, connected
    a little beyond the middle. _h._ 6ft. to 8ft. Mexico, 1810.

    =B. multinerva= (many-nerved). _fl._ snow-white; petals linear.
    Legume 8in. to 12in. long. _l._ elliptic, rounded at the base,

    obovate; peduncles three to four-flowered. _l._ rather cordate at
    the base, pubescent beneath and on the petioles; leaflets connected
    beyond the middle, oval, obtuse, four-nerved, nearly parallel. _h._
    4ft. to 6ft. Jamaica, 1823.

    =B. purpurea= (purple). _fl._, petals red, one of them streaked
    with white on the claw, lanceolate, acute. Legume linear, 1ft.

    spot at the claw, obovate, obtuse; peduncles one to three-flowered.
    _l._ ovate or roundish at the base; under surface villous, as
    well as the petioles, branches, stipules, peduncles, bracts, and
    calyces; leaflets connected beyond the middle, oval, obtuse, three
    to four-nerved. _h._ 6ft. to 12ft. Ceylon, 1808.

    =B. variegata= (variegated).* _fl._ red, marked with white, and
    yellow at the base, in loose terminal racemes; petals ovate,

    spot at the base of each, acute. _l._ rounded at the base. China.

=BAWD-MONEY.= _See_ =Meum=.

=BAY-TREE.= _See_ =Laurus nobilis=.

=BEAK.= Anything resembling the beak of a bird, as in _Aconitum_; the
point which ends the helmet or upper sepal; hard, sharp points.

=BEAM TREE.= _See_ =Pyrus Aria=.

=BEAN BEETLE= (_Bruchus granarius_). This insect, by depositing its
eggs in the seeds of Beans and Peas, causes a great amount of injury.
It is about an eighth of an inch long, black, with brown hairs and
white spots; tip of the tail prolonged, downy; front pair of legs
reddish. The most effectual means of prevention is to destroy, when
sowing, all seeds infested by it; and this may be detected by the skin
of the seed being unusually transparent above the tunnel for exit.
Imported seeds of Broad Beans are often much infested. "Dipping the
Beans or Peas in boiling water for one minute is stated to kill the
grub inside; but, as dipping for four minutes generally destroys the
germinating power, the experiment is much too hazardous for general
use", (Ormerod).

=BEAN CAPER.= _See_ =Zygophyllum=.

=BEAN FLY.= _See_ =Aphides= and =Black Fly=.

=BEANS.= There are three sections of these in cultivation for garden
purposes, viz.: The Dwarf or French Bean; the Climbing, or Scarlet
Runner; and the ordinary Broad Bean. _See also_ =Faba= and =Phaseolus=.

[Illustration: FIG. 209. BROAD BEAN PLANT IN FLOWER (FABA VULGARIS).]

_Soil._ All Beans like a somewhat loamy soil, which, to secure good
crops, must be deeply worked and heavily manured. The Kidney Beans,
dwarf and tall, however, do not care for so heavy a soil as the Broad
and Long-podded kinds; and this fact should be borne in mind when
selecting their respective situations. The term Kidney is generally
applied to both the Dwarf or French and the Climbing or Scarlet Runner.

[Illustration: FIG. 210. PODS OF BROAD BEAN.]

[Illustration: FIG. 211. BROAD BEAN SEED.]

BROAD AND LONG-PODDED (_Faba vulgaris_). _Cultivation_: As early as
possible in the autumn, deeply trench a piece of ground, and work in a
heavy dressing of manure, leaving the surface of the soil in ridges, to
become well aA"rated by winter frosts. Where desired, a piece of ground
on a warm, protected border, can also be deeply dug in November, and a
few rows of Mazagans sown to stand the winter. When up, draw a ridge
of soil on either side the rows, and in frosty weather strew a few
handfuls of bracken, or other light, dry litter, over them. Not much
is, however, gained by this winter sowing. Early in January, level the
ridges with a fork, working the whole of the surface soil over, and
towards the end of the month, make the first sowing, choosing Mazagan
and other early varieties. Mark out two rows, 9in. asunder, leave a
space of 30in., then another two rows, and so on throughout the piece
sown. If preferred, they may be sown in single rows at intervals of
1-1/2ft. The drills should be about 3in. deep, and the seed from 7in.
to 9in. apart in the rows. Where the double-row system is adopted,
arrange the seed for the plants to come alternately. In March, get
in the main sowing of the Broad and later Long-podded kinds, in the
manner already described; another sowing for late use may be made in
April. When the plants are about 6in. high, earth up as recommended
for those sown in the autumn. As soon as a good crop is set, pinch out
the tops of the plants, to assist the maturation of the Beans, and
prevent the attacks of the fly. Figs. 209, 210, and 211 are excellent
representations of the flowering plant, pods, and seed of the Broad
Bean.

_Sorts._ For early use: Early Mazagan, Long-pod, Marshall's Early
Prolific, and Seville Long-pod. For late use: Carter's Mammoth
Long-pod, and Broad Windsor (white variety). These are all distinct and
good varieties.

[Illustration: FIG. 212. FRUITING PLANT OF DWARF OR FRENCH BEAN
(PHASEOLUS VULGARIS).]

DWARF OR FRENCH KIDNEY BEANS (_Phaseolus vulgaris_). _Cultivation_:
This class (see Fig. 212) also requires a rich and deeply trenched
rather light soil. A very important point is to get the ground into a
good condition, by frequently forking it over; and, as the seeds are
not sown till the beginning of May, there is plenty of time for the
work. The finer the soil is, and the more it is aA"rated, the better
will it suit the crop. From the beginning of May till the end of June,
at intervals, draw out drills about 2ft. apart, and 3in. deep, and in
these place the Beans tolerably thick, as generally they are not all
certain to grow. As soon as up, carefully thin them, and slightly earth
up to prevent the wind blowing them about. They should not, however,
be earthed higher than the seed leaves, or they will probably rot off
in wet weather. Keep free from weeds, and maintain a sharp look out for
slugs. In dry weather, water occasionally, giving good drenchings, and
not mere sprinklings, which do more harm than good. A good mulching
of half-rotted manure is very beneficial, as it prevents evaporation
to a great extent, besides affording some amount of nourishment to
the plants. Great care must be taken to pick off the Beans as soon as
large enough for use, or they will exhaust the plants. Where seeds are
needed, a number of plants should be left for the purpose, and these
should be some of the best, to prevent deterioration, or loss of the
true variety.

_Forcing._ French Beans require more heat than can be obtained in
either a frame or an ordinary greenhouse; and, although easy enough to
grow in a structure suited to their requirements, yet, if such does
not exist, they are almost sure to fail. A good heat, from 60deg.
to 70deg., with abundance of moisture, is necessary for successful
results. Plenty of light is also most essential. A position such as
that of a cucumber house is generally a suitable one; but the plants
must not be placed under the cucumbers. Successional sowings in pots
or boxes must be made, from the end of August till March, to keep up
a supply. For soil, use good maiden loam, with a little well-rotted
manure added. Use 8in. pots, sowing five or six beans in each. The
first sowing should be placed in a frame and kept well watered,
bringing into heat in October; but the subsequent sowings should be
placed directly in the house. Keep the soil moist, and the plants free
from aphides and other insect pests, and give air at every favourable
opportunity. The plants should be as near the light as possible, and
kept from falling about by tying or placing small pieces of Birch wood
round them. In dull weather, it will be found that the blooms will
not set so freely as when the sun shines brightly; therefore, every
care should be taken to secure both heat and ventilation when sunshine
prevails. When the pots get full of roots, and the plants are bearing
fruit freely, a little liquid manure is of great assistance; at no
time must the plants get dry enough to flag. Allow plenty of room for
the full development of foliage, and maintain a minimum temperature of
60deg., with plenty of moisture.

_Sorts._ These are very numerous, among the best being Black Negro,
Canadian Wonder, Canterbury, Fulmer's Forcing, Golden Dun, Newington
Wonder, Osborn's Early Forcing, Sion House, and Sir Joseph Paxton.

RUNNERS OR CLIMBING KIDNEY BEANS (_Phaseolus multiflorus_).
_Cultivation_: Being tall growers, these need a greater space than the
Dwarf French varieties, and they also require support. Rich soil is
indispensable for them, and liberal supplies of water on light soils
and in dry weather. A good overhead syringing from time to time is also
advantageous. Trench and heavily manure a piece of ground in autumn,
leaving it in ridges for the winter. In March, level the ridges down,
and well work the ground, to render it friable and in good condition.
The plants being extremely tender, it is not safe to sow before the end
of April or the first week in May. It is preferable to sow in rows,
which should be from 6ft. to 12ft. apart, and crop the ground between
with other vegetables. Earth up and stake them as soon as ready, to
prevent injury from rough wind. A good plan, which may be adopted to
obtain early produce, is to raise the seeds in boxes in a cold frame,
getting them ready for planting out in the middle of May. Plant at the
same distances, and treat afterwards as recommended for those sown out
of doors.

If preferred, they can be grown on the ground without stakes. Under
this treatment, they must have their tops pinched off when about 18in.
high, continuing this pinching from time to time as necessary. If this
plan is adopted, the rows need only be 3ft. apart, the ground not
being otherwise cropped. In dry seasons and on light soils, there is
an advantage attached to this method, namely, that those on sticks are
liable to injury from drought, while the foliage of those pinched back
keeps the soil moist underneath.

[Illustration: FIG. 213. RUNNER OR CLIMBING KIDNEY BEAN (PHASEOLUS
MULTIFLORUS).]

Runner Beans may also be planted to cover arches or fences, and in
various places of a like description. See Fig. 213.

_Sorts._ Common Scarlet Runner, Champion, Painted Lady, and Giant
White. The first two are those generally grown.

=BEATONIA.= _See_ =Tigridia=.

=BEAUCARNEA= (a commemorative name). ORD. _LiliaceA|_. A small genus of
curious greenhouse plants, natives of Mexico. Leaves narrow, gracefully
depending. Stems slender, and woody, with a peculiar swollen, somewhat
napiform base. Mr. B. S. Williams recommends that these plants be
potted in rich fibrous loam and sand, with ample drainage, and,
during the growing season, liberally supplied with water. Propagated
by cuttings, when obtainable; but chiefly by seeds, which have to be
imported from their native country. Beaucarneas are principally grown
for the beauty of their foliage, and are grotesque, graceful, and
extremely curious in habit and form.

    =B. glauca= (grey).* _l._ pendent, glaucous, 2ft. to 3ft. long.
    Stem slender, the swollen base becoming woody with age.

    =B. g. latifolia= (broad-leaved) differs from the type only in its
    stouter and more robust stem and broader leaves.

    =B. longifolia= (long-leaved).* _l._ 6ft. to 10ft. long, narrow,
    pendent, dark green, forming a beautiful vase-like centre. _h._
    10ft. Mexico, 1868. Very distinct. (G. C. 1877, vii., 493.)

    =B. recurvata= (recurved-leaved).* _l._ very long, linear,
    gracefully pendulous, bright green. Mexico, about 1845. This is an
    excellent subject for open-air culture during the summer, as well
    as for the conservatory. SYN. _Pincenictitia tuberculata_. (G. C.
    1870, 1445.)

    =B. r. rubra= (red). _l._ red at base.

    =B. stricta= (upright). _l._ 3ft. or more long, less than 1in.
    broad, very glaucous. Stem stout. Mexico, 1870.

=BEAUFORTIA= (commemorative of Mary, Duchess of Beaufort, a botanical
patroness). Including _Schizopleura_. ORD. _MyrtaceA|_. Elegant
free-flowering greenhouse Australian shrubs. Flowers scarlet; calyx
with a turbinate tube; stamens in bundles opposite the petals. Leaves
sessile, opposite or scattered. Beaufortias require a compost of peat,
leaf soil, and loam, lightened, if necessary, by the addition of sand.
Cuttings of half-ripened shoots root freely in sandy soil, under a
glass, with very little heat.

    =B. decussata= (decussate). _fl._ scarlet; bundles of stamens
    on very long claws; filaments radiating. May. _l._ opposite,
    decussate, ovate, or oval, many-nerved. _h._ 3ft. to 10ft. New
    Holland, 1803. (B. M. 1733.)

    =B. purpurea= (purple).* _fl._ purplish-red, in dense globular
    heads. _l._ three to five-nerved, erect or spreading,
    ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate-linear. New Holland.

    =B. sparsa= (few-leaved). _fl._ bright scarlet. _l._ many-nerved,
    scattered, ovate-elliptical, obtuse. West Australia. SYN. _B.
    splendens_. (P. F. G. xiii., 145.)

    =B. splendens= (splendid). Synonymous with _B. sparsa_.

=BEAUMONTIA= (in honour of Mrs. Beaumont, formerly of Bretton Hall,
Yorkshire). ORD. _ApocynaceA|_. A very ornamental stove twiner,
remarkable for its handsome flowers. It succeeds best when planted
out in the borders of a temperate house, in rich lumpy loam and peat.
Propagated by cuttings, placed in sand, with bottom heat.

    =B. grandiflora= (large-flowered).* _fl._, corolla large, white,
    greenish outside near the base, and dark throat, with a short tube,
    and a large campanulate five-lobed limb; corymbs axillary and
    terminal, many-flowered. June. _l._ opposite, broad, oblong-ovate,
    with a little point, tapering towards the base, smooth and shining
    above, but rather downy beneath; young leaves and branches rusty.
    Chittagong and Sylhet, 1820. (B. M. 3213.)

=BED.= A term usually applied to pieces of ground laid out in gardens
for sowing small seeds, or for the isolation and better protection of
small collections of plants in the reserve ground. The oblong is the
best shape for this purpose, about 4ft. or 5ft. wide, somewhat raised,
and having a narrow path on each side, so that the workman may attend
to the plants or seeds without having to tread on the bed. Any one part
of a flower-garden design, cut out in grass, or otherwise formed, is
also generally termed a Bed. When required to be planted for effect,
as in this case, the Bed should be proportionate in size to the plants
that are to be put in it, always planting the highest in the centre and
gradually sloping, with other sizes, to the edges, which should be the
lowest. Circular Beds are best with one centre plant; and oblong or
other shapes should have the height of the centre plants carried nearly
the whole length, not, however, placing them in too formal a manner.

=BEDDING-IN.= A method of seed-sowing, now almost obsolete, and
chiefly employed in nurseries. "In this method, the ground being dug
and formed by alleys into Beds, 4ft. or 5ft. wide, each alley being a
spade's width or more between Bed and Bed, and the earth being drawn
off the top of the Bed with a rake or spade, 1/2in. or 1in. deep into
the alleys, the seed is then sown all over the surface of the Bed;
which being done, the earth in the alleys is immediately cast over the
Bed, again covering the seeds the same depth, and the surface is raked
smooth" (Johnson). In the case of small seeds, a very light covering is
needed, and that only of very fine soil.

=BEDDING-OUT.= The temporary placing out of doors of greenhouse and
other tender plants during the summer months. It is considered by some
to be the showiest, most expensive, and most unnatural of any style.
The geometrical arrangement of gaudy colours is not at all times
satisfactory, and under the most favourable conditions the design
is rarely retained more than two or three months, say, from July to
September. The method is, however, so extensively adopted as to demand
due notice in this work. Bedding usually commences in May. An important
consideration is the proper preparation of the soil for the reception
of the plants. It will be found to materially assist the growth if
the soil is well dug over a fortnight before the plants are put in.
By this means, it will acquire a certain amount of solidity, a point
of great importance with fibrous-rooted plants that are subject to
injury from the fine roots not taking a firm hold of the soil. Having
decided upon the arrangement of the plants, proceed to work with the
planting. With round, oval, or, indeed, almost any shaped bed, begin
in the centre and work towards the edge; in borders, commence at the
back and finish with the front row. Plant with a trowel, disturbing
the balls as little as possible, and when in the holes press the soil
moderately firm. After the Bed is finished, give a good soaking of
water to settle the soil at the roots. Manure for Flower-beds should
always be perfectly rotten, such as that from a spent hotbed. When the
plants are thoroughly established, water must only be given if they
show signs of distress; and then a good soaking should be applied. A
careful hoeing of the surface after planting will be most beneficial,
leaving it smooth and tidy. A Dutch hoe will be the best to use.
Injudicious use of manure and water will only cause a foliaceous
growth. The proper treatment of the various Bedding Plants will be
found under their respective headings. For spring decoration, the
Beds may be filled with Dutch bulbs, and spring-flowering annuals and
perennials _ad infinitum_; or, after the plants are removed in autumn,
the Beds may be filled with evergreens plunged in pots, such as Aucuba,
Arbor vitA|, Euonymus, and various little Conifers, which have a bright
appearance through the winter, and can be removed at any time. With the
relative value, or advisability of adoption, of either or any system of
gardening, it scarcely comes within the province of this work to deal.
No hard-and-fast rules can be laid down as regards "style," and each
individual may follow his own taste and inclination.

[Illustration: FIG. 214. DESIGN FOR CARPET BEDDING.]

[Illustration: FIG. 215. DESIGN FOR CARPET BEDDING.]

_Carpet Bedding._ This mode of gardening, although not so generally
employed as it was some few years ago, has many admirers, and small
plots, geometrically arranged in multi-coloured beds on lawns, are
frequently seen. In our large public parks, the system is largely
adopted, and evidently proves very gratifying to the multitudes who
visit these places; but probably no system is more unnatural or
expensive, as such a large number of plants are necessary in order
to produce a desirable effect. The illustrations (Figs. 214 and 215)
represent two designs for Carpet Beds. The numbers placed in the
various compartments indicate the way the different colours should be
arranged, repeats being marked by the same cypher. A very varied and
large selection of plants can be used for Carpet Bedding, some of which
are quite hardy, such as _Herniaria glabra_ and _Veronica repens_, two
of the best dwarf green plants; _Sempervivum californicum_, _Sedum
lydium_, _S. glaucum_, _Antennaria tomentosa_, &c. These may be
planted early in the season, with Golden Feather, and are especially
valuable, as they are generally employed to a great extent. Other
plants, not quite so hardy, are _Mentha Pulegium gibraltarica_ and
_Echeveria secunda glauca_, both of which are extensively used; while
the tenderest subjects are Alternantheras of various kinds, _Coleus
Verschaffeltii_ and _Mesembryanthemum cordifolium variegatum_. These
latter should not be planted till the first or second week in June.
As the plants are usually small, and require to be planted thickly,
the work is best accomplished with the fingers, pressing the soil
moderately firm. First of all, work out the design, and plant the
leading lines; afterwards fill in the "panels."

[Illustration: FIG. 216. DESIGN FOR BEDDING.]

_Sub-Tropical Bedding._ This term is applied to the arrangement of
tropical plants in Beds or groups outside for the summer months, and
if discriminately adopted a very attractive and unique display may be
made, depending greatly upon position, and mainly upon the material at
command. If a sheltered and partially shady situation is enjoyed, a
grand effect may be produced by the grouping of tree and other large
ferns with palms, Cannas, Aralias, DracA|nas, &c., avoiding, of course,
formal arrangement, and yet, when finished, a symmetrical appearance
should be produced. In more open positions, palms, Castor Oil Plants,
Cannas, _Humea elegans_, Aralias, Phormiums, Wigandias, Nicotianas,
&c., may be employed, the result being, if properly arranged, most
gratifying. Sub-Tropical Bedding should not be done till the middle or
end of June, and the Beds should be well dug and freely manured for
those that are to be planted out.

[Illustration: FIG 217. DESIGN FOR BEDDING.]

Fig. 216 represents a Border or long piece of ground, which may be
either marked out permanently with Box edging, dwarf-growing silver or
golden leaved plants, tiles, stones, or pebbles, and filled in with
silver sand or bright-coloured stones or gravel; or the lines may be
widened out into walks. The whole of the small circles not numbered
are intended for specimen foliage and other plants, such as Fuchsias,
Yuccas, Aloes, Cannas, Solanums, variegated or plain Reeds, Grasses,
Maize (_Zea_), &c. No. 1, tall plants of _Echeveria metallica_, edged
with _E. glauca_; 2, 2, yellow or orange Calceolaria; 3, 3, Mrs.
Leavers Pelargonium; 4, 4, Triomphe de Stella ditto; 5, 5, purple or
blue Verbena; 6, 6, white ditto. The narrow border round the side may
then be filled in with Golden-feather Pyrethrum, blue Lobelia, or
_Alternanthera amabilis_. This same plan may also be treated in quite a
different manner, according to the taste of those adopting it, or the
stock of plants at command.

[Illustration: FIG. 218. DESIGN FOR BEDDING OR CARPET BEDDING.]

Fig. 217 illustrates a design admirably adapted for a rosery or small
flower garden. Its only fault is the number of sharp angles at the
corners of some of the Beds; but this can be counteracted by the
predominance of curved lines. It is easily formed, and the effect is
good if furnished in the following manner: The circle in the centre,
1, _Centaurea ragusina compacta_, edged with a double line of _Coleus
Verschaffeltii_; the four figures 2, 2, 2, 2, scarlet Pelargoniums,
such as Vesuvius, Bonfire, Triomphe de Stella, or others; 3, 3, Mrs.
Pollock, golden-zoned Pelargoniums, edged with _Alternanthera amA"na_;
4, 4, Lady Cullum, ditto, ditto, edged with ditto; 5, 5, _Lobelia
speciosa_, Imperial Dwarf Ageratum, or Purple King Verbena; 6, 6, white
Verbena or white Ivy-leaved Pelargonium.

[Illustration: FIG. 219. ARRANGEMENT OF NURSERY FOR ROSE TREES AND
SHRUBS.]

[Illustration: FIG. 220. ARRANGEMENT OF NURSERY FOR ROSE TREES AND
SHRUBS.]

The group of Beds illustrated in Fig. 218 is effective on grass or
gravel. If on the latter, the lines should be defined with Box, Golden
Thyme, Cerastium, or Santolinas. The design is pretty on level, but is
still more effective on sloping ground; in the latter case, it should
rise from the straight walk (dotted line). Thus each Bed may be seen
to the best advantage, and the group may be extended to any length.
The circular Beds should be planted with two distinct colours, such
as good pink and scarlet Pelargoniums of similar habits of growth,
placing the colours in alternate Beds. The Beds, _a_, _a_, _a_, Flower
of Spring, or another silver-leaved Pelargonium; _b_, _b_, _b_, Purple
King Verbena, or Imperial Dwarf Ageratum; _c_, _c_, White Perfection
Verbena, and silver-leaved or white-flowered Ivy-leaved Pelargonium;
_d_, _d_, _Alternanthera magnifica_; _e_, _e_, Blue Lobelia. The
long border, _Alternanthera paronychioides_, edged with _Antennaria
tomentosa_; or _Iresine Lindenii_, edged with Pyrethrum, Golden Fleece
or Crystal Palace Gem Pelargonium. The two sides may also be planted
alike. The colours are reversed above to produce a greater variety and
a more striking effect. This design is also well adapted for Carpet
Bedding.

FIG. 221. BEDDING-OUT DESIGNS.]

_Nursery Bed._ This is merely a reserve ground or nursery for a large
stock of plants of various sorts, such as Roses, &c. One of the first
requirements is an easy access to the individual plants, and with the
least possible waste of space. This may be obtained by arranging the
Beds in regular geometric figures, as shown in Figs. 219 and 220, and,
by exercising a little care and taste, the whole can be so contrived as
to present an ornamental appearance.

We are indebted to Messrs. Cannell and Sons for the diagrams of
Bedding-out designs shown at Fig. 221, which may be made very effective:

Bed A. This Bed may be planted with the following: Summer-flowering: 1,
Gain's Yellow Calceolaria or Ageratum Lady Jane; 2, Geranium Vesuvius
or another scarlet; 3 and 4, Viola Blue-bell or Purple King Verbena;
5, edged with _Gnaphalium lanatum_, or _Antennaria tomentosa_, white
foliaged plants. Summer Foliage: 1, _Coleus Verschaffeltii_; 2,
_Centaurea ragusina compacta_; 3 and 4, Mrs. Pollock Geranium; 5, band
of any of the Echeverias, or _Kleinia repens_.

Bed B. Plants mentioned for A will do for this.

Bed C. This is really intended for a Carpet Bed. 1, _Alternanthera
amabilis_, with a narrow line of _amA"na_ for the edge; 2, _Mentha_,
or _Herniaria glabra_; 3, band of _Mesembryanthemum cordifolium
variegatum_. Flowering: 1, Any kind of Scarlet Geranium; 2,
Golden-leaved ditto; 3, Blue Lobelia (edge). Spring: 1, White Arabis;
2, _Myosotis dissitiflora_; 3, Golden Feather.

Bed D. Summer: 1, Pink Geranium; 2, _Iresine Lindenii_; 3,
Golden Feather. Carpet: 1, _Alternanthera versicolor grandis_;
2, _Mesembryanthemum cordifolium variegatum_; 3, _Alternanthera
magnifica_, edged with _Sempervivum montanum_.

Bed E. 1, Scarlet Geranium; 2, Pink ditto; 3, _Lobelia speciosa_; or,
1, _Alternanthera amA"na_; 2, _Mesembryanthemum cordifolium variegatum_;
3, _Echeveria secunda glauca_.

Bed F. 1, _DracA|na_, _ChamA|peuce_, or any other graceful foliage plant
for the centre; 2 and 4, _Alternanthera amabilis_, the divided lines,
6, being filled with Mentha or Echeverias; 3 and 5, _Alternanthera
amA"na_; and the outer edge, 7, with _Sempervivum californicum_.
This bed would look well if planted with any of the above-mentioned
spring flowers. Spring: Bed might be raised to a mound, and lined
out with hardy Sedums, or Sempervivums, placing a larger growing one
in the centre; and 2, 3, 4, and 5 divisions may be filled with any
spring-flowering dwarf-growing plants.

Bed G. 1, Small plant of Yucca; 2, _Coleus Verschaffeltii_; 3, _Alyssum
variegatum_; 4, _Lobelia pumila magnifica_.

Bed H. 1, Golden Feather; Mesembryanthemum; 3, Mentha; 4,
_Alternanthera amabilis_; or 1, _Coleus Verschaffeltii_; 2, _Centaurea
ragusina_; 3, Calceolaria Golden Gem; 4, Ageratum Lady Jane.

=BEDDING PLANTS.= This term applies to many half-hardy subjects
which are planted out in beds for summer display, such as Ageratums,
Calceolarias, Geraniums, Heliotropes, Lobelias, Verbenas, &c., all of
which will be treated under their respective headings. They are mostly
soft-wooded plants and are easily cultivated with proper means, in
spring and autumn.

=BEDFORDIA= (named in honour of a former Duke of Bedford). ORD.
_CompositA|_. Greenhouse evergreen shrubs, allied to _Cacalia_. They
thrive in a mixture of sand, peat, loam, and brick rubbish, in equal
proportions. Propagated by cuttings, which should be dried a little
before inserting them in rough, sandy soil.

    =B. salicina= (willow-like). _fl.-heads_ yellow, axillary and
    solitary, or few together. April. _l._ alternate, lanceolate,
    linear, glossy above, covered with white tomentum underneath. _h._
    3ft. Victoria and Tasmania, 1820. SYN. _Cacalia salicina_. (B. R.
    923.)

=BEDSTRAW.= _See_ =Galium=.

=BEECH.= _See_ =Fagus=.

=BEES.= _See_ =Honey Bees=, =Humble Bees=, and =Wasps=.

=BEET= (_Beta_, which _see_). The present varieties of Beetroot are
the offspring of _Beta vulgaris_, a plant of biennial duration, and a
native of the sea coasts of Southern Europe. It was cultivated in this
country about 1656, but was probably long previously introduced by the
ancient Romans. Beetroot is largely used as salad, more extensively on
the Continent than with us, also pickled; medium sized, deeply coloured
roots being the chief desideratum. Some varieties are largely grown for
their highly-coloured foliage, being planted in bedding-out designs,
and generally proving extremely effective.

[Illustration: FIG. 222. LONG YELLOW BEETROOT.]

Cultivation: For obtaining the best results, an open situation should
be chosen, free from the shade of trees. The ground should be light
and sandy, and, if possible, that which has been previously manured
for some other crop, French beans, for instance. Trench the soil to a
depth of 2ft. in the autumn, and ridge it up for the winter. As soon
as dry enough to allow of working in spring, dig over the whole bed
with a steel digging fork, and break the soil tolerably fine. Sow any
time from the last week in April to the end of May. Prepare the drills
about a foot or 15in. apart, and from 1in. to 2in. deep. The seeds grow
quicker if steeped in water previous to sowing, afterwards allowing
them to get dry enough to separate from each other. Sow thinly, and
fill in the drills with a rake. As soon as the plants are up, hoe
between the rows, and keep free from weeds. In a fortnight or three
weeks after this hoeing, if the weather has been favourable, the plants
will be large enough for thinning. Thin out to about 9in. apart,
and carefully fill up, in dull weather, any blanks that may occur.
Transplanting is, however, not generally a very satisfactory method.
Carefully lift the roots in autumn, before frost comes, and wring off
the leaves about an inch from the crowns. Place the roots in a cool
shed or house, and allow the soil on them to get quite dry, when they
may be stored for winter use in dry sand, or soil, in a shed free from
frost. It is preferable to keep the crowns free from soil, to prevent
decay from the ends of the leaves left on them. If this be carefully
done, the roots will keep till the next season's early crop is ready.
In all processes connected with the growing, storing, or cooking of
this vegetable, the greatest care must be taken to avoid bruising or
otherwise injuring the roots, as deficiency of colour would be the
result, especially in the case of the red-fleshed kinds, in some cases
rendering them valueless for table use. Seed Saving: When lifting the
crop in autumn, select as many of the best formed and coloured roots as
required, and store them separately from the rest. In April, plant them
in a spot by themselves, where there is no danger of impregnation from
other varieties, and in due time good seed will ripen. If good foliaged
varieties are required, the best should be selected when growing in the
summer, and either be marked by some means, or have the inferior ones
removed from them.

_Sorts._ These are somewhat numerous--almost every seedsman having a
so-called "improved strain." Nutting's Dwarf Red, Chelsea, Pine Apple,
Dell's Crimson and Red Castelnaudary, are the best of the crimson or
red-fleshed kinds. The Egyptian Turnip-rooted is a distinct variety,
with flesh of a good colour, and fine flavour; excellent for summer
salads. Betterave de Bretagne is a Continental variety; the roots grow
to a good size, with a distinct outer skin of a dark colour; flesh
rich purple. The best of the yellow-fleshed kinds are Small Yellow and
Long Yellow (see Fig. 222); but these are not grown nearly so much as
the deep-coloured section; in fact, they are almost useless for garden
purposes.

[Illustration: FIG. 223. WHITE LEAF BEETROOT.]

_Beetroot for Bedding Purposes_: In this case, where the foliage is
the main object, the seed may be sown in a reserve bed, and the plants
transferred to their positions in the flower garden. If, however, a
line is required in a ribbon or other border, the best plan is to sow
there, and thin out the plants to equal distances. Dell's Crimson is
one of the best varieties for this purpose, being very compact and of
a good dark colour.

Varieties of the Leaf Beet (_Beta Cicla_), and Sea or Perennial
Beet (_Beta maritima_), are sometimes, but very seldom, cultivated
for the use of the leafstalks and leaves, the roots being hard and
unfit for cooking purposes. They are at the best but substitutes for
other vegetables--namely, the midrib for Sea-kale and the leaves
for Spinach. If desired, seeds may be sown in the way described for
Beetroot, in April for using in autumn and winter, and in August for
spring use, plants of the latter sowing being protected in severe
weather. The best sorts are Red-stalked, Yellow-stalked, and White (see
Fig. 223) or Silver Leaf.

=BEET CARRION BEETLE= (_Silpha opaca_). This destructive insect is
frequently found in dead animals, but often its grub almost destroys
the leaves of Beet and Mangold Wurzel crops. The grubs, which are black
and shining, when full grown are from 1/3in. to 1/2in. long; the three
segments next the head are rounded at the sides, but the other segments
are sharp, and the tail segment has a sharp spine on each side. "When
full-fed, the grubs bury themselves, and form cells at the depth of
3in. or 4in. below the surface of the earth, in which they turn to
pupA|, and from these the Beetle has been seen to come up in about
the space of a fortnight or three weeks" (Ormerod). The Beetles are
flattish, and about five lines long, brown-black, with a tawny down;
eyes large and oval; horns club-shaped; body somewhat oval; wing-cases
very flat, turned up at the outer edge, each case having three sharp
ridges running along it; tip of abdomen dull red. Any manures or
methods of cultivation that would stimulate growth in the plants, so as
to permit renovation of injuries, would be found useful. If farmyard
manure were applied to the soil intended for Beet _in the autumn_
instead of in spring, it would lessen the risk of attack to the Beets.

[Illustration: FIG. 224. COMMON GARDEN BEETLE.]

[Illustration: FIG. 225. DEVIL'S COACH HORSE.]

=BEETLES= (_Coleoptera_). Beetles form one of the most extensive
orders of insects, there being upwards of 3000 known British species.
They vary much in appearance, but a Beetle is readily recognised by
its front wings, or elytra; these form a tough horny sheath or case,
which lies over the real wings, and protects them when the insect is
not flying. Sometimes, the elytra are very short (see Fig. 225); the
mouth is fitted with jaws for cutting. The metamorphosis is complete,
_i.e._, the larva or grub is very unlike either the quiescent pupa or
the perfect insect. The period that elapses before Beetles arrive at
their perfect state varies from a few weeks to two or three years, but
is usually rather longer than in Butterflies or Bees. Various Beetles
attack growing plants and roots. Thus, _Otiorhynchus sulcatus_ and
_O. picipes_ attack Vines, Roses, and other plants, gnawing off the
bark. Some species of Beetles attack Mushrooms, while others bore into
the wood of old trees, or eat leaves (_e.g._ Turnip Fly), or burrow
in the leaves, or form galls on roots (Cabbage-gall Weevil). Of some
kinds, the beetles are hurtful; of others, the larvA|. Many kinds,
however, are beneficial, such, for instance, as the common Ground
Beetle (_Carabus_, Fig. 224), and the Devil's Coach Horse (_Ocypus
olens_, Fig. 225). These live upon other insects and snails. One kind
of Beetle--the Ladybird (see Figs. 226 and 227)--is very beneficial in
a garden, as it preys upon the aphides, or plant lice. For instructions
in dealing with the noxious kinds, _see_ =Asparagus Beetle=, =Bean
Beetle=, =Beet Carrion Beetle=, =Click Beetle=, =Cockchafer=, =Lily
Beetle=, =Rosechafer=, and =Turnip Fly=.

[Illustration: FIG. 227. GRUB OF LADYBIRD. (Enlarged).]

=BEET= or =MANGOLD FLY= (_Anthomyia betA|_). The maggots of this fly
do considerable damage by feeding on the pulp of the Beet or Mangold
leaves. The eggs are small, white, and oval, and are laid in small
patches beneath the leaves; the maggots are about 1/3in. long, legless,
cylindrical, and yellowish-white. As it is of such recent appearance in
this country, specifics for its eradication are by no means numerous;
but, according to Miss Ormerod, "the best treatment appears to be to
nip it in the bud, where such treatment is possible, by destroying the
infested plants, but generally by all means of good cultivation, or by
special applications of artificial manure, to ensure a hearty growth,
which may run the plants on past the power of average attacks to weaken
the leafage to a serious extent."

=BEFARIA= (named in honour of Bejar, a Spanish botanist). ORD.
_EricareA|_. SYN. _Bejaria_. An elegant genus of greenhouse evergreen
shrubs, closely allied to _Rhododendron_. Flowers bracteate; corolla
very deeply seven-cleft, spreading. Leaves racemose or corymbose,
crowded, quite entire, coriaceous. They thrive in a compost of peat and
loam. Propagated by cuttings, made of the young wood, and placed in
sandy soil, in gentle heat.

    =B. A|stuans= (glowing).* _fl._ purple; corymbs terminal, simple;
    peduncles, pedicels, rachi, calyces, and branchlets clothed with
    clammy glandular hairs. _l._ elliptic, rather glabrous above,
    but downy and glaucous beneath, while young clothed with rusty
    tomentum. Plant much branched; branchlets sub-verticillate. _h._
    10ft. to 15ft. Peru, 1846. SYN. _Acunna oblonga_. (G. C. 1848, 119.)

    =B. cinnamomea= (cinnamon-coloured). _fl._ purple; panicles close,
    terminal; peduncles woolly, hispid. _l._ slightly downy above,
    rusty tomentose beneath. Branches downy, hispid. _h._ 4ft. Peru,
    1847.

    =B. coarctata= (close-headed). _fl._ purple; corymbs terminal,
    simple; peduncles, pedicels, rachi, and calyces clothed with rusty
    tomentum. _l._ oblong, glabrous, glaucous beneath. Shrub much
    branched. _h._ 4ft. to 5ft. Peru, 1847. (G. C. 1848, 175.)

    =B. glauca= (glaucous).* _fl._ flesh-coloured; racemes terminal and
    axillary; pedicels somewhat fastigiate. June. _l._ oblong, obtuse,
    glaucous beneath. Shrub much branched; branchlets angular. _h._
    3ft. to 6ft. South America, 1826.

    =B. ledifolia= (Ledum-leaved).* _fl._ purple; racemes terminal;
    peduncles, pedicels, rachi, branchlets, and calyces clothed with
    clammy glandular hairs. _l._ oblong, somewhat mucronate, with
    revolute edges, glaucous beneath, glandular. Shrub much branched;
    branches purplish. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. South America, 1847. (F. d. S.
    3, 195.)

    =B. racemosa= (racemed). _fl._ purple, disposed in racemose
    terminal panicles. July. _l._ ovate-lanceolate, glabrous;
    branchlets smooth or hispid. _h._ 3ft. to 5ft. Georgia, 1810.

=BEGONIA= (named after M. Begon, a French patron of botany). ORD.
_BegoniaceA|_. A large genus of succulent herbs or undershrubs (a
few climbers), in many of which the stem is reduced to a tuberous
rhizome, whilst some are distinctly tuberous. Flowers usually showy and
large, white, rose, scarlet, or yellow, unisexual; perianth segments
petaloid, four to five divisions, rarely two. Stamens numerous,
filaments free or united at the base. Ovary inferior, styles two to
four, free, sometimes connate, stigmas brandied or twisted. Fruit
capsular, rarely succulent, often winged. Seeds numerous, minute.
Leaves alternate, more or less unequal-sided, entire, or lobed,
or toothed. Flower-stalks axillary, cymose. Distribution: Species
about 350, in all tropical moist countries, especially South America
and India; not known in Australia. Cultivated species (exclusive of
garden hybrids and varieties) about 150. A large number of genera,
or what were considered as such are now merged in Begonia--viz.,
_Barya_, _Baryandra_, _Casparya_, _Pritzelia_, &c. The rich colours
and beautiful form of the flowers of Begonias, their prettily-marked
foliage, and free-growing, free-blooming nature, have long marked
them out as favourite garden plants. Within the last twenty years a
new race, characterised by a tuberous root-stock, annual herbaceous
stem, and large handsome flowers, has been introduced from the Andes
of South America, from which, by means of careful cross-fertilisation
and selection, a large number of beautiful and almost hardy kinds have
been raised. The size, substance, and rich colours of the flowers of
the majority of the plants of this race of Begonias are witness to
what may be done by skilful cultivation and careful cross-breeding
among plants. In the same way the large-leaved, stemless section, of
which _B. Rex_ may be taken as the type and principal progenitor, have
been improved both in the size and the coloration of their foliage,
and countless forms are now in cultivation, both as garden plants and
for the decoration of rooms, &c. The propagation of Begonias may be
accomplished by means of seeds, which are freely produced by almost all
the cultivated kinds, by cuttings, by division of the rhizomes, and--in
the case of the large-leaved kinds--by leaf-cuttings. For the first of
these methods it is necessary that the seeds should be well ripened
before they are gathered, and kept dry until sown. Where it is desired
to increase any particular kind of garden origin, seeds are useless,
none of the hybrid or seedling forms perpetuating themselves through
their seeds, although equally beautiful sorts may be raised from them.
The characters of all true species are, however, reproduced in their
seedlings. For the successful raising of Begonia seeds it is necessary
to sow them on pans or pots of well-drained, light, sandy soil, which
should be well watered before the seeds are sown. The seeds should not
be covered with soil, or they will fail to germinate. Over the pans a
pane of glass should be placed, and they should then be stood in warm
house or a frame where a temperature of about 65deg. can be maintained,
and shaded from sunshine. As soon as the plantlets are large enough to
be safely manipulated, they should be pricked off into pans of light
leaf-mould soil, in which they may remain until large enough to be
placed singly in pots. Cuttings: These strike freely if planted in
small pots, in sand and leaf mould, and placed on a bottom heat of
70deg. Where large quantities are required, a bed of cocoa nut-fibre
in a stove or propagating frame may be used, and in this the cuttings
may be planted and remain until well rooted. Leaf cuttings succeed best
when laid on sand or cocoa-nut fibre, and shaded from bright sunlight.
In preparing the leaves, old, well-matured ones should be selected, and
incisions made with a sharp knife across the principal nerves on the
underside. They should then be placed on the sand or fibre and held
down by means of a few pieces of crock. Under this treatment, bulbils
will form on the lower ends of the nerves of each section of the leaf,
and these, when large enough, may be removed from the bed and potted.
With the exception of _B. Evansiana_ (_discolor_), an almost hardy
species from North China, all the shrubby species require a warm or
intermediate house for their cultivation, although during the summer
months a frame or sheltered bed answers for most of them, provided they
are removed into their warm winter quarters on the approach of cold
weather. Some of the species, such as _B. Dregei_, _B. semperflorens_,
_B. nitida_, _B. fuchsioides_, _B. Lindleyana_, _B. Richardsiana_,
along with the hybrids _Ascotensis_, _Knowsleyana_, _Weltoniensis_,
and _Ingramii_, are grown in pots out of doors all the summer, and
under liberal treatment they form large handsome specimens, which are
of great value as flowering plants for the conservatory in winter. The
tuberous-rooted herbaceous kinds should be started in heat in February,
and, when vigorous growth has commenced, be gradually hardened off,
for use either as bedding plants or as pot specimens for flowering in
the greenhouse. A mixture of loam and leaf mould with a little sand
and rotten cow-dung is suitable for the cultivation of these plants
in pots. Liberal supplies of water should be given during the growing
season. As the growth decays, water should be withheld until finally
the tubers may be shaken out of the soil and placed in dry sand or
cocoa-nut fibre, in a house or shed where a temperature above freezing
can be maintained. _B. gracilis_ and its varieties, _diversifolia_
and _Martiana_, are beautiful greenhouse plants, which thrive well
if treated as advised for the other tuberous-rooted kinds, with the
addition of a few more degrees of heat.

The _Rex_ section requires a light rich soil, plenty of moisture, and
a shaded position in a warm greenhouse. These kinds are often employed
with good effect for clothing peat-covered walls in ferneries, or as
an undergrowth in large tropical houses. Large specimens have been
grown under the stage in a warm house, the shade and moisture of such
a position being exactly what they best delight in.

_B. socotrana_, an interesting species from the island of Socotra,
is somewhat singular in its requirements. The stem is herbaceous and
annual, and about its base a cluster of bulbils are formed, from every
one of which a plant will be developed the following year. The growing
season for this species is from September to March, after which it goes
to rest for the whole summer. A tropical temperature and all the light
possible, are essential to the well-doing of this plant.

It is interesting to note the apparent impossibility to cross any of
the shrubby Begonias with the distinctly tuberous-rooted species; and
even the species of the shrubby section, whose stems are semi-tuberous,
have hitherto refused to commingle with the South American tuberous
kinds, of which _B. Veitchii_, _B. rosA|flora_, and _B. boliviensis_
may be said to be typical. The infusion of the blood of these large,
handsome-flowered kinds into the tall, shrubby species, would
almost certainly result in the production of a race of splendid
winter-flowering greenhouse plants, and it is therefore in every way
desirable that no pains should be spared to break through the obstacle
to the union of the two races.

yet in cultivation). Flowers apetalous; perianth single; pistillate
flowers having the perianth two to eight-cleft, staminate ones two to
four-cleft; stamens numerous, collected into a head. Leaves alternate,
stipulate. _See_ =Begonia=.

=BEJARIA.= _See_ =Befaria=.

=BELLADONNA.= _See_ =Atropa=.

=BELLADONNA LILY.= _See_ =Amaryllis Belladonna=.

=BELLEVALIA= (named in honour of P. R. Belleval, a French botanist).
ORD. _LiliaceA|_. This genus is now usually placed under _Hyacinthus_.
Hardy, bulbous-rooted plants, admirably adapted for spring bedding or
forcing, and invaluable as cut flowers. Flowers small, whitish, or
violet, tinged with green. Leaves few, radical, broadly linear. They
are of extremely easy culture in ordinary garden soil. Propagated by
offsets; also by seeds, which should be sown as soon as ripe.

    =B. operculata= (lid-covered). Synonymous with _B. romana_.

    =B. romana= (Roman).* Roman Hyacinth. _fl._ white, racemose;
    perianth campanulate; pedicels longer than the flowers. April. _l._
    from 4in. to 5in. long. _h._ 6in. Italy, 1596. A most desirable
    plant, and the best of the genus for forcing purposes. SYNS. _B.
    operculata_ and _Hyacinthus romanus_. (B. M. 939, under the name of
    _Scilla romana_.) _See_ =Hyacinthus=.

    =B. syriaca= (Syrian).* _fl._ white; peduncles spreading, racemose.
    May. _l._ glaucous, 1ft. long, channelled, rather scarious on the
    margins. _h._ 1ft. Syria, 1840.

=BELL-FLOWER.= _See_ =Campanula=.

[Illustration: FIG. 237. FRENCH BELL GLASS, OR CLOCHE.]

[Illustration: FIG. 238. ENGLISH BELL GLASS.]

=BELL GLASSES=, or =CLOCHES=. These are used for the purpose of
protecting or accelerating the growth of a plant or plants. The French
Cloche (see Fig. 237) is largely employed for this purpose. Ordinary
Bell Glasses (see Fig. 238) are exceedingly useful for propagating
purposes, especially for hard-wooded plants; or for placing over
subjects which require a very moist atmosphere, such as Filmy ferns,
Cephalotus, &c.; or for covering half-hardy plants or rare alpines,
and thus protecting them from excessive moisture. Large Bell Glasses,
inverted, serve as miniature aquaria, and many small aquatics are
easily grown in them.

=BELLIDIASTRUM= (from _bellis_, a daisy, and _astrum_, a star;
flower-heads being star-like). ORD. _CompositA|_. A pretty dwarf, hardy,
herbaceous perennial, allied to _Aster_. It thrives in a compost of
loam, leaf soil, and peat. Increased by divisions in early spring, or
directly after blooming.

    =B. Michelii= (Michel's).* _fl.-heads_ white; scape one-headed,
    naked; involucre with equal leaves; pappus simple. June. _l._ in a
    rosette, shortly stalked, obovate, repand. _h._ 1ft. Austria, 1570.

=BELLIS= (from _bellus_, pretty, in reference to the flowers). Daisy.
ORD. _CompositA|_. A genus of hardy herbaceous perennials, distinguished
from allied genera in having conical receptacles and an absence of
pappus. They grow well in all loamy soils. The garden varieties are
increased by division after flowering, each crown making a separate
plant. The soil must be pressed about them moderately firm. Seeds may
also be sown in March, but the plants thus obtained are seldom of
sufficient floricultural merit to perpetuate.

[Illustration: FIG. 239. BELLIS PERENNIS FLORE-PLENO.]

[Illustration: FIG. 240. HEN AND CHICKENS DAISY (BELLIS PERENNIS
PROLIFERA).]

    =B. perennis= (perennial).* Common Daisy. _fl.-heads_ white. June.
    _l._ numerous, lying flat on the ground, obovate, crenate, slightly
    hairy, tapering at the base. _h._ 3in. England. The varieties are
    very numerous, the double ones being particularly fine. See Fig.
    239. The handsome variegated form, _aucubA|folia_, has its leaves
    richly stained and veined with yellow. There are both red and
    white-flowered forms of this variety. The Hen and Chickens Daisy is
    a proliferous form, rather more quaint than pretty. See Fig. 240.
    Good garden kinds are _B. p. conspicua_, red; CROWN, pink; ELIZA,
    purple; RUBENS, red; SNOWFLAKE, white.

[Illustration: FIG. 241. BELLIS ROTUNDIFOLIA CA'RULESCENS.]

    =B. rotundifolia cA"rulescens= (round-leaved, bluish).* _fl.-heads_
    from 3/4in. to 1-1/4in. in diameter, resembling those of the common
    Daisy, but with fewer, often broader, ray-flowers, which vary from
    white to pale blue. _l._ more or less hairy, with slender stalks,
    1in. to 3in. long; blade ovate or sub-cordate, sinuate toothed,
    three-nerved. Morocco, 1872. A very beautiful perennial, requiring
    the shelter of a cold frame during severe winters. See Fig. 241.

=BELLIUM= (from _bellis_, a Daisy; the flowers resembling those of that
plant). ORD. _CompositA|_. A genus of pretty little, free-flowering
plants, differing from the common Daisy only in having a pappus of six
to eight broad scales, torn at the apex, alternating with a like number
of long scabrous bristles. They thrive best in a mixture of sandy
loam and peat. Propagation is readily effected by means of seeds or
divisions; the latter should be made in spring.

[Illustration: FIG. 242. BELLIUM BELLIDIOIDES.]

    =B. bellidioides= (Daisy-like).* _fl.-heads_ white, solitary. June
    to September. _l._ spathulate, radical. Stolons creeping. _h._ 4in.

    =B. crassifolium= (thick-leaved). _fl.-heads_ whitish-yellow;
    scapes much exceeding the leaves, downy. June. _l._ sub-radical,
    thick, obovate, entire, attenuate at base, rather downy. Stems
    many, ascending. _h._ 6in. Sardinia, 1831. Hardy perennial. (S. B.
    F. G. 2, 278.)

    across, on slender stalks, longer than the foliage. June to
    September. _l._ narrow spathulate, attenuated at the base, slightly
    hairy. _h._ 3in. Levant, 1772. A rare little species, requiring a
    warm, well-drained position on the rockery.

=BELLOWS.= These were formerly employed for fumigating, but are now
entirely superseded by the ordinary fumigators. The Sulphur Bellows is
a very useful instrument for the uniform distribution of flowers of
sulphur on vines and other subjects infested with mildew. In form it is
very like those in common domestic use, but has a rose of small holes
at the end of its nozzle, through which the sulphur is ejected.

=BELL-PEPPER.= _See_ =Capsicum grossum=.

=BELOPERONE= (from _belos_, an arrow, and _peronne_, a band; in
reference to the arrow-shaped connectivum). SYN. _Dianthera_. ORD.
_AcanthaceA|_. Very pretty stove evergreen shrubs, allied to _Justicia_.
Flowers blue or purple, borne in secund, axillary, or terminal spikes,
frequently subtended with coloured bracts; corolla gaping, the upper
lip concave, the lower trifid. They are easily cultivated in a compost
of loam, leaf soil, peat, and sand. Propagated by young cuttings,
taken in spring. Beloperones may also be treated like _Justicias_
(which _see_), and will succeed admirably. There are a large number of
species, but few of which have been introduced.

    =B. oblongata= (oblong). _fl._ rosy-purple; spikes axillary;
    anthers calcarate at base; bracts bracteolate. Summer. _l._
    oblong-lanceolate, opposite. _h._ 3ft. Brazil, 1832. (B. H. 9, 9.)

    =B. violacea= (violet-coloured).* _fl._ violet. _l._ lanceolate,
    acuminate, entire. _h._ 3ft. New Grenada, 1859. (B. M. 5244.)

=BENDING-DOWN= the branches of fruit trees, by means of weights or
string attached to pegs driven into the ground, is sometimes resorted
to for the purpose of acquiring a particular shape, or fruitfulness;
but authorities differ as to the usefulness of the plan for the latter
purpose. Young trees that are inclined to grow strong in the middle
may be more evenly balanced by adopting the plan of Bending the strong
branches, and so diverting the sap to the weaker ones.

=BENJAMIN-TREE.= _See_ =Ficus Benjamina=.

=BENT GRASS.= _See_ =Agrostis=.

=BENTHAMIA= (in honour of George Bentham, a distinguished English
botanist). ORD. _CornaceA|_. Hardy evergreen shrubs or low trees,
now referred to the genus _Cornus_. The first-named species is
rather tender in the neighbourhood of London, and can only be grown
successfully against a wall, for which purpose it is very suitable. In
Cornwall and other mild places, it attains a height of 20ft. in the
open. Loudon thinks it might be rendered hardier by grafting it on
_Cornus sanguinea_. Flowers disposed in heads, each head attended by
an involucre, which consists of four petal-like parts, and resembles a
corolla; calyx with a minute four-toothed limb; petals four, fleshy,
wedge-shaped; stamens four; style one. Leaves opposite, exstipulate,
sub-evergreen, entire. Fruit constituted of many pomes grown together.
They thrive in rather moist, loamy soil, in a sheltered spot.
Propagated by seeds, sown when ripe, in a cool-house; or by layering,
in autumn.

    =B. fragifera= (Strawberry-flowered).* _fl._ large, white, sessile,
    densely aggregate, forming a round head. June to October. _fr._
    large, about the size of that of the common Arbutus, reddish. _l._
    lanceolate, acuminated at both ends, on short petioles, rather
    rough, with small, adpressed down. Branches spreading, smooth. _h._
    10ft. to 15ft. Nepaul, 1825. (G. C. xiv., 728.)

    =B. japonica= (Japanese). _fl._ yellowish-red. Spring. _h._ 8ft.
    Japan, 1847. (S. Z. F. J. 16.)

=BERARDIA= (named after M. Berard, a Professor of Chemistry at
Montpelier). ORD. _CompositA|_. A genus containing a single species,
confined to the high mountains of Western Europe. It makes a pretty
rock plant, and grows best in thoroughly well-drained spots amongst
rocky _dA(C)bris_. Propagated by seeds, sown in spring.

    =B. subacaulis= (almost stemless). _fl.-heads_ whitish, solitary,
    very large. _l._ rounded oval, nearly heart-shaped at base,
    cottony. _h._ 3in. or 4in. (A. F. P. 3, 38.)

=BERBERIDACEA†.= An order of shrubs or herbaceous perennials. Flowers
terminal or axillary, usually racemose; sepals three, four, or six in a
double row; petals as many or double in number; stamens four to eight,
opposite the petals. Fruit, a berry or capsule. Leaves alternate,
compound. The order contributes a great number of handsome plants
to our gardens. Well-known genera are _Berberis_, _Epimedium_, and
_Nandina_.

=BERBERIDOPSIS= (from _Berberis_, the Barberry, and _opsis_, like;
resembling the Barberry). ORD. _BerberidaceA|_. A handsome evergreen
shrub, with climbing habit. Sepals and petals nine to fifteen;
outer small, spreading; intermediate orbicular, concave; inner
obovate-cuneate, erect, inserted upon the fleshy torus. Stamens eight
to nine, free. With a slight winter protection, or planted at the foot
of a south wall, it will prove quite hardy, being of easy culture in
ordinary garden soil. It is an excellent plant for the cool greenhouse.
Increased by seeds, which should be sown in spring; by layering, in
autumn; or by young cuttings, in spring.

[Illustration: FIG. 243. FLOWERING BRANCHES OF BERBERIDOPSIS CORALLINA.]

    =B. corallina= (coral-red).* _fl._ crimson, in terminal, drooping
    racemes, leafy at the base. _l._ about 3in. long, alternate,
    simple, petiolate, oblong-cordate, obtuse or acute, spiny-toothed.
    Chili, 1862. See Fig. 243. (B. M. 5343.)

=BERBERIS= (_Berberys_ is the Arabic name of the fruit, signifying a
shell; many authors believe this to be the original derivation of the
word, because the leaves are hollow, like a shell). Barberry. ORD.
_BerberidaceA|_. Including _Mahonia_. A genus of hardy erect or trailing
shrubs. Flowers yellow or orange, racemose or fascicled; sepals and
petals similar, in two series. Leaves simple or compound, alternate or
fascicled from the non-development of the branches, often spinose, or
reduced to spines. The common sorts thrive well in any ordinary garden
soil, but the rarer kinds require a compost of loam, peat, and a little
sand. Propagation may be effected by suckers or layers, put down in
the autumn; by ripened cuttings, taken at the same time, and planted
in sandy soil, in a cold frame; or by seeds, sown in the spring, or,
preferably, in the autumn, when, if fresh from the pulp or berry, they
will germinate in the open in the following spring. The last-named is
the method generally adopted.

    =B. Aquifolium= (Holly-leaved).* _fl._ yellow; racemes nearly
    erect, much crowded. Spring. _l._, leaflets two to three pairs,
    with an odd one, the lower part distant from the petiole; ovate,

    a densely-branched, spreading, evergreen bush, thus making an
    excellent covert plant. (B. M. 4590.)

    =B. dulcis= (sweet). Synonymous with _B. buxifolia_.

    with unbranched stems and leaves about 1ft. long. _B. Beali_
    and _B. intermedia_ are mere forms of this species, the latter
    differing from it in having narrower leaves and longer, slender
    racemes. (B. M. 4852.)

=BESLERIA= (named in honour of Basil Besler, an apothecary at
Nuremberg). SYN. _Eriphia_. ORD. _GesneraceA|_. Very pretty stove
sub-shrubs, usually erect, branched. Peduncles axillary, few-flowered.
Leaves opposite, petiolate, thickish; nerves and veins very prominent
beneath. Stems sub-tetragonal. A light rich earth, or a mixture of
sand, loam, and peat, and a moist atmosphere, are necessary for
successful cultivation. Beslerias may be increased by cuttings, which
root readily in heat.

    =B. coccinea= (scarlet-berried).* _fl._ yellow; peduncles axillary
    bearing three to six flowers in an umbel at top; bracts two, at
    the division of the common peduncle, orbicularly cordate, toothed,

    1819. Climbing shrub. (A. G. 255.)

    =B. cristata= (crested). _fl._, corolla yellowish, hairy outside;
    peduncles axillary, solitary, one-flowered; bracts cordate,
    toothed, sessile, scarlet. June. _l._ ovate, serrated. Guiana,
    1739. Climbing shrub.

    =B. grandiflora= (large-flowered).* _fl._ large, campanulate,
    spotted with red; peduncles axillary, elongated, many-flowered.
    _l._ ovate-oblong, acuminated, crenated, densely pilose above,
    villous beneath, as well as on the branches. _h._ 3ft. Brazil.

=BESOM=, or =BROOM=. Birch-brooms are best for garden purposes, and
are generally used. The most suitable for paved yards are those made
of the common Ling (_Calluna vulgaris_). Those made of bass fibres are
frequently used on paths, for which they are very suitable, but their
expensiveness prevents them being generally employed. Whatever material
is used in its composition, a Besom will last much longer if soaked in
water for some time before using.

=BESSERA= (in honour of Dr. Besser, Professor of Botany at Brody). ORD.
_LiliaceA|_. An elegant little half-hardy, Squill-like, bulbous plant,
from Mexico. Perianth bell-shaped, six-parted. Leaves narrow, linear.
It requires a compost of loam, leaf soil, peat, and sand, with good
drainage. If cultivated in pots, a plentiful supply of water must be
given from the commencement of growth until ripening off. When at rest,
however, it should be kept dry and cool, but secure from the effects of
frost. If planted out, a well-drained sunny position must be chosen,
such as close to the wall of a greenhouse with a southern aspect.
Propagation may be effected by offsets.

    =B. elegans= (elegant).* _fl._ scarlet, or scarlet and white. July
    to September. _l._ 1ft. to 2ft. long, narrow, furrowed on the upper
    side. _h._ 2ft. Mexico, 1850. This is the only species. The colour
    of the flowers varies considerably, on which account other names
    have originated. (B. R. 25, 34.)

=BETA= (from _bett_, the Celtic word for red; in reference to the
colour of the Beet). Beetroot. ORD. _ChenopodiaceA|_. Perianth single,
half-inferior, five-cleft, persistent. Seed one, reniform, imbedded
in the fleshy base of the calyx. _B. Cicla_ is largely used as a
decorative plant in sub-tropical and other styles of gardening. They
require the same culture as the ordinary Beet. The other sorts, with
dark blood-red leaves, are largely employed in flower gardens, and the
roots utilised for culinary purposes. _See also_ =Beet=.

[Illustration: FIG. 248. BETA HORTENSIS METALLICA, or VICTORIA BEET.]

    =B. Cicla= (Sicilian). _fl._ greenish, disposed in threes.
    August. _l._ with very thick ribs. Roots scarcely any. _h._ 6ft.
    Portugal, 1570. The variety, _B. c. variegata_, usually known
    as the Chilian Beet, is a very handsome plant, having its leaves
    often more than a yard in length and over 1ft. in diameter, with
    a remarkably handsome variegation. The midribs are usually dark
    orange or scarlet. It is a most desirable and effective plant for
    sub-tropical gardening.

    =B. hortensis metallica= (metallic). Victoria Beet. An ornamental
    variety with glistening deep blood-red leaves. Useful for
    decorative purposes in summer, either as a single specimen or in a
    mass. Roots may also be used for cooking. See Fig. 248.

    =B. maritima= (sea). _fl._ greenish, disposed in hairs. August.
    _l._, lower ones rhomboid-ovoid, acute; upper ones lanceolate. Stem
    diffuse. Root scarcely any. _h._ 1ft. Britain.

    =B. vulgaris= (common). The Common Beetroot. _fl._ greenish,
    clustered. August. _l._, lower ones ovate. Root fleshy. _h._ 4ft.
    South Europe, 1548.

=BETCKEA.= _See_ =Plectritis=.

=BETEL=, or =BETLE=. _See_ =Piper Betle=.

=BETONICA.= This genus now forms a sub-division of _Stachys_ (which
_see_). Betony (_Stachys Betonica_) is a native herb formerly much used
in medicine, but now almost entirely discarded.

=BETONY.= _See_ =Stachys Betonica=.

=BETULA.= (according to some authorities, from _Betu_, its Celtic name;
others give the derivation of the word as from _batuo_, to beat, the
fasces of the Roman lictors, which were made of Birch rods, being used
to drive back the people). Birch. ORD. _CupuliferA|_. TRIBE _BetuleA|_.
Ornamental, hardy (except where otherwise specified), deciduous trees
or shrubs, allied to _Alnus_, having round, slender, often drooping
branches, and the bark in most species in thin membranous layers.
The flowers appear at the same time as the leaves. Male catkins
cylindrical, lax, imbricated all round with ternate concave scales,
the middle one largest, ovate; corolla none; filaments ten to twelve,
shorter than the middle scale, to which they are attached. Female
catkins similar, but more dense; scales horizontal, peltate, dilated
outwards, three-lobed, three-flowered; corolla none. Nut oblong,
deciduous, winged at each side. The Betulas are easily cultivated in
any ordinary soil; but a light sandy loam suits them best. Most of the
species are best increased by seeds, which ripen in September, and need
to be dried, in order to prevent fermentation. They should be sown in
March, in a sandy soil, the surface of which has been previously made
perfectly level. They must be spread on the surface, and not covered
with soil, but pressed down with the feet. When grown in quantities,
beds 4ft. in width are preferred, with an alley of 1ft. between them.
In early summer, if the weather be warm and dry, the beds should be
shaded with branches. The young seedlings must be transplanted when
a year old. The dwarfer kinds may be propagated by layering in the
autumn. The numerous beautiful varieties are best increased by grafting
or budding upon seedling stocks of the common kinds, the former being
done in spring, and the latter in summer when the buds are ready.
Those most useful as forest trees and for protection are quick-growing
and very ornamental. The time of maturity of the Birch depends very
much upon the soil and situation, but it seldom increases in size
after it is thirty years old. The common species (_B. alba_) is one of
the hardiest and most useful trees in cultivation, growing quickly,
and withstanding exposure better than many others; consequently it
is invaluable for skirting and nursing more tender subjects, and is
especially desirable for clothing mountainous and exposed districts.
It is also very beautiful and picturesque. It is the commonest tree
throughout Russia, from the Baltic to the Eastern Sea, frequently
monopolising gigantic forests. In Italy, it forms excellent forests up
to 6000ft. altitude, and in our own Highlands of Scotland it occurs up
to a height of 2500ft. In Greenland, although much reduced in size, it
holds its own as the only arboreal vegetation.

small, hardy, tuberous-rooted perennials, much more curious than
pretty, allied to _Sauromatum_. This genus, according to Dr. Masters,
differs from _Arum_ in its spathe being tubular at the base, with the
limb spreading. The female flowers have a distinct style, and the
fruit contains only one ovule. They will thrive in any light, rich,
well-drained soil, and may otherwise be treated similar to the hardy
_Arums_. There are several other species besides those named, but they
are not yet in general cultivation.

naturalist, author of "Flora Taurico-Caucasica," and other works). ORD.
_RutaceA|_. A genus of half-hardy herbaceous perennials. They thrive in
a compost of loam, peat, and sand. Propagated by cuttings, placed under
a hand glass in early summer; or by seeds, sown in a slight hotbed in
March or April.

    =B. odora= (sweet). _fl._ yellow; racemes terminal, simple; petals
    entire. May. _l._ impari-pinnate; leaflets roundish, deeply
    toothed. Plant beset with glandular hairs. _h._ 1ft. Altaia, 1837.

=BIENNIAL.= A term applied to plants occupying two years in the
development from seed to the maturation of seed: growing one year,
flowering, fruiting, and dying the next. Seeds of Hardy Biennials are,
as a rule, sown from June to August, to flower the succeeding season.
Tender varieties are sown in a frame or cool house, and kept there all
winter, being transferred from the frames or houses to the open border,
in June. Wallflowers, Foxgloves, Canterbury Bells, and Sweet Williams,
may be taken as fair types of Biennials, although they often assume
more than a Biennial character on light sandy soils.

=BIFARIOUS.= Two-ranked; arranged in two opposite rows.

=BIFID.= Divided about half-way down into two parts; two-cleft.

=BIFOLIATE.= Compound leaves with two leaflets.

to a double strap or band, by means of which the pollen masses are
connected with their gland). ORD. _OrchideA|_. A genus of pretty stove
orchids, allied to _Maxillaria_, and distinguished from it by having
two frA|na or caudicles to their pollen masses. For culture, _see_
=Maxillaria=.

    =B. aurantiaca= (orange-coloured).* _fl._ orange; lateral lobes of
    lip semi-cordate, middle one transverse, sub-undulated, callous at

[Illustration: FIG. 250. BRANCH AND FLOWERS OF BIGNONIA MAGNIFICA.]

=BIGNONIA= (so named by Tournefort, in compliment to the AbbA(C) Bignon,
librarian to Louis IV.). ORD. _BignoniaceA|_. A large genus of usually
scandent shrubs, furnished with tendrils; rarely erect trees or shrubs.
Flowers axillary and terminal, usually panicled; corolla with a short
tube, a campanulate throat, and a five-lobed, bilabiate limb. Leaves
opposite, simple, conjugate, ternate, digitate or pinnatifid. These
handsome plants are particularly suited for large houses, where, if
well grown, they give great satisfaction. The primary point in their
culture is to obtain free and, at the same time, sturdy growth, giving
due attention to training, pruning, &c., or the plants soon exceed all
limits. Like all free-growing plants, Bignonias thrive best planted
out in the borders of the stove or greenhouse, or out of doors, as
the case may be; but the space allowed should be limited, in order to
restrict root production. They may either be trained to cover the back
wall, or be planted in a border in front, and trained up the rafters,
or on wires, arranged where most desirable. In summer, allow all the
strongest shoots to grow, training them so as to have as much sunlight
as possible-A--which is absolutely necessary to well ripen the wood, and
make it capable of producing flowersA---without entirely shutting it out
from the plants below. Soil: A compost of two part fibrous loam, one
part peat, one of leaf mould, and a due proportion of sand, will be
found most satisfactory. The loam and peat should be used in a rough
state, unsifted, as this will keep the border open for some years,
and thorough drainage should be effected. Propagation: Seed being
rarely procurable, the most satisfactory method of propagation is by
cuttings, made of good strong shoots, in early spring. Three joints
are sufficient to make a cutting, if short-jointed; if long-jointed,
two are sufficient. Place them in a well-drained pot of sandy soil,
under a bell glass, in bottom heat. As these cuttings are young and
fleshy, they are liable to damp off; hence it is necessary, for the
first two or three weeks, to wipe the moisture from the glasses every
morning, and water sparingly. If well managed, they will root in about
two months, and should then have the glasses left off every night for
a week; they should then be transferred to small pots in the compost
above described, passing it through a coarse sieve, to extract the
stones and rough pieces of soil. After potting, the plants should be
kept close for a short time, till they are able to bear full exposure
to the light. In a year's time, they will be large enough to plant
out in their permanent quarters. Bignonias may also be increased by
layering.

=BILLBERGIA= (named after J. G. Billberg, a Swedish botanist). ORD.
_BromeliaceA|_. A genus of handsome stove plants. Flowers borne on light
panicles; calyx three-parted; corolla of three convolute petals, scaly
at the base; stamens inserted into the base of the perianth. Leaves
harsh, rigid. These require much the same treatment as recommended
for _A†chmea_. The most suitable soil is a mixture of peat, leaf soil,
and loam in about equal parts, to which is added some sharp sand,
to keep it open and porous. Free and perfect drainage is absolutely
necessary for the successful culture of this class of plants, and a
layer of moss should be placed over the crocks previous to filling
the pots with soil. Although fond of heat, Billbergias will, when in
flower, bear removal to a cooler house than a stove; and, if they are
kept a little dry at the same time, the change will greatly prolong
their blooming period. The stronger growing kinds thrive well in rich,
well-drained loam and leaf mould. Propagation is effected by carefully
taking off the suckers which form at the base, after the plants have
done flowering; but, before doing this, they should be allowed to
attain a good size. The suckers grow quickly when attached to the
parent stem, from which they derive their strength, and feel the check
less when severed; besides which, they become more mature, and are in
better condition for rooting. The best method to adopt is as follows:
Take the sucker in the hand and gently twist it off the stem; next
trim the base by the removal of a few of the lower leaves, and then
insert each sucker separately in a small pot, in sharp soil. A bottom
heat of about 80deg. will greatly facilitate new root-growth; failing
this, they will root freely in the temperature of a stove if placed in
a shaded position for two or three weeks, after which they will bear
increased light and sunshine during the later part of the day. _See
also_ =A†chmea= and =Androlepis=.

    _h._ 1-1/2ft. Brazil, 1843. (B. H. 1871, 14, 15.)

    =B. Wioti= (Wiot's). Synonymous with _B. pallescens_

    =B. zebrina= (zebra-streaked).* _fl._ greenish; scape clothed with
    large, pale, salmon-coloured bracts; inflorescence gracefully
    curved downwards. Early spring. _l._ sheathing for about half their
    length, forming thus a sort of tube, deep green, with zones of
    grey, the whole deepening with age. _h._ 1-1/2ft. South America,
    1826. SYN. _Helicodea zebrina_. (L. B. C. 1912.)

=BILOBATE.= Two-lobed.

=BINATE.= In pairs.

=BINDING.= The process of securing a graft or bud in its place by means
of Raffia or Bast. The same term is applied to hard clay or other soil
impervious to water, in summer.

=BINDWEED.= _See_ =Convolvulus=.

=BIOPHYTUM= (from _bios_, life, and _phyton_, a plant; the leaves of
one species being sensitive to the touch). TRIBE _OxalideA|_ of order
_GeraniaceA|_. A genus of pretty and interesting perennials, differing
from _Oxalis_, in which genus it has been included, in the valves of
the capsule being patent and separate to the base. They will thrive in
a mixture of loam and peat. Propagated by seeds, which should be sown
in spring, on a hotbed. Probably the only species in cultivation is the
following:

    =B. sensitivum= (sensitive). _fl._ yellow, small. July. _l._,
    leaflets oblong, obtuse, mucronate. _h._ 6in. India and China,
    1823. The leaves of this plant contract on the slightest touch.
    SYN. _Oxalis sensitiva_. (B. R. 31, 68.)

=BIOTA.= _See_ =Thuja=.

=BIOTIA.= _See_ =Aster corymbosus=.

=BIPARTITE.= Divided into two nearly to the base.

=BIPINNATE.= Twice pinnate.

=BIPINNATIFID=, or =BIPINNATIPARTED=. Having both primary and secondary
segments of a leaf divided, but not to the base.

=BIPLICATE.= Having two folds or plaits.

=BIRCH.= _See_ =Betula=.

=BIRD-CHERRY.= _See_ =Cerasus Padus=.

=BIRDLIME.= A preparation made from Mistletoe berries and Holly bark.
It is used for catching birds.

=BIRD-PEPPER.= _See_ =Capsicum baccatum=.

=BIRDS.= As a class, Birds are very much more useful than hurtful in
gardens. Owls are of great use in catching mice, and Night-jars in
catching night-flying insects. Rooks are very useful in lessening the
numbers of wire-worms, and of hurtful insects in general; but, if very
numerous, they may be driven to eat potatoes and other vegetable food,
and may then do harm. The same may be said of Starlings. Blackbirds
and Thrushes feed much on snails and worms, but they also feed on the
ripe fruits in gardens. As a rule, slender-billed birds feed almost
wholly on insects or other animals, and are to be encouraged in gardens
at all seasons. Among these may be enumerated the Tree-creeper,
Wryneck, Warblers, and Wrens of various kinds, Chats, Hedge-sparrow,
Larks, Redstart, Robin, Titmice, and Wagtails. Swifts, Swallows, and
Martins, are also great destroyers of insects. The Finches feed, in
part, on insects, but also eat large quantities of seeds, and often do
considerable damage among plants grown for seed, _e.g._, Cabbages, and
in the seed-beds. Sparrows are about the most troublesome, though they
are often assisted by Buntings, Chaffinches, Linnets, and others. When
seed-beds or fruits have to be protected, this may be done by nets; or,
more simply, by threads tied to sticks a few inches above the surface
of the ground, or in front of the trees.

=BISCUTELLA= (from _bis_, double, and _scutella_, a saucer; in allusion
to the form of the silicles). Buckler Mustard. ORD. _CruciferA|_.
Perennial or annual herbaceous plants, usually hispid, but sometimes
downy or smoothish. Flowers yellow, scentless; pedicels filiform,
bractless. Leaves oblong, entire, toothed or pinnatifid, somewhat
radical or cauline. Stems round, erect, usually corymbosely branched at
the top by racemes, which, when in flower, are short, but elongated at
the time of fruiting. All the species produce seeds freely. The annuals
should be sown in the open borders. Some of the perennial kinds are
well adapted for ornamenting rockwork, in a dry, sunny situation. Of
the annuals, _columnA|_, _lyrata_, _maritima_, and _obovata_, are best.
Of the perennials, _coronopifolia_, _lA|vigata_, and _sempervirens_ are
the most desirable, but none are worth cultivation outside botanical
collections.

=BITUMINOUS.= Clammy, adhesive.

=BIVONA†A= (named after Antonio Bivona-Bernardi, a Sicilian botanist,
author of "Sicularum Plantarum Centuria I. et II.," Palermo, 1806).
ORD. _CruciferA|_. A pretty little monotypic genus, well adapted for
ornamenting rockwork or the front of flower borders. A dry sandy soil
is most suitable for its culture. Propagated by seeds, sown in spring
where the plants are intended to remain, thinning-out being necessary
to ensure full growth.

    =B. lutea= (yellow).* _fl._ yellow, small; racemes terminal,
    elongated as they grow; pedicels filiform, bractless. April.
    _l._ alternate, lower ones stalked, the rest sessile, cordate,
    stem-clasping at the base, ovate, toothed, bluntish. Stem filiform,
    sparingly branched. _h._ 3in. to 6in. Sicily, 1823. An annual.

=BIXA= (its South American name). Arnatto. ORD. _BixineA|_. Stove
evergreen trees, with dichotomous panicles of large reddish flowers,
broad cordate leaves, and prickly capsules. A compost of loam and peat
is well adapted to their culture. Propagated by seed, sown when ripe in
bottom heat; or by cuttings, which root freely in sand, under a hand
glass, in heat; the latter is the better method. If grown from seed,
the trees attain a large size before they flower; whereas cuttings,
taken from a flowering plant and struck, may be brought to flower when
small plants.

    =B. Orellana= (Orellana). _fl._ pale peach-coloured; corymbs
    terminal, panicled; peduncles two, three, and four-flowered. May to
    August. _l._ cordate, ovate, acuminated, entire or angular, smooth
    on both surfaces. The drug called Arnatto is prepared from the
    red pulp which covers the seed of this species. It is used in the
    preparation of chocolate, and by farmers for colouring cheese, and
    also as an orange or yellow dye for silks. _h._ 30ft. West Indian
    Islands, 1690. See Fig. 253. (B. M. 1456.)

=BIXINEA†.= An order of smoothish tropical trees or shrubs, not
remarkable for any particular beauty. Flowers with or without petals,
when present five and sepal-like; stamens indefinite in number,
inserted in the receptacle or at the bottom of the calyx; peduncle
axillary or terminal, bracteate, one or many-flowered, usually forming
terminal panicles. Fruit fleshy or dry. Leaves alternate, simple,
entire, or slightly lobed, generally full of pellucid dots. The genera
best known are _Azara_, _Bixa_, and _Flacourtia_.

=BLACK FLY or BEAN FLY= (_Aphis rumicis_), also called Collier and
Black Dolphin. This Fly (see Fig. 254) is found on many herbaceous
plants. It is very injurious to Beans; hence, immediate means of
destruction must be employed directly the insect appears. Its
extermination is an extremely difficult matter; but the following
remedies are very effectual:

_Tobacco Water._ This, made and applied as recommended for Aphides
(which _see_) is a good remedy; but it is rendered more certain by the
employment of soapsuds, instead of clear water, in its manufacture.

[Illustration: FIG. 254. THE BEAN FLY. _a_, Female, magnified; _b_,
Male, natural size, and magnified.]

_Paris Green_ (Arseniate of Copper). Owing to its poisonous nature,
this should not be used where there is fruit on the trees or vegetables
under them; but there is no better destroyer of hard-dying insects.
Its application is very simple. Mix 1lb. of the green with 30gals. of
water, and well wet the infested parts of the trees, using a fine-rosed
watercan or garden engine for the purpose. The operator's hands should
be free from sores and scratches, or dangerous ulcerations may ensue.

_Gas Liquor._ If this can be obtained from a gas-house, it should be
diluted with twice its bulk of water, and applied in the same manner
as Paris Green, being washed off with clean water in a few hours. If
the process be repeated on two or three consecutive nights, it will
be found certain in its effects; moreover, it is not very poisonous.
The finger or thumb, or the Aphis brush, applied early, will often
exterminate these obnoxious insects at once. The first of the methods
above described is perhaps the most accessible and the safest to
use. Poisonous insecticides are more or less dangerous, especially
in the hands of the inexperienced. Black Fly is, however, one of
the most difficult insects to eradicate, especially if allowed to
multiply. A syringing of clean water should follow either of the above
applications. _See also_ =Aphides=.

=BLA†RIA= (named after Patrick Blair, M.D., F.R.S., who practised
medicine at Boston, in Lincolnshire, and was author of "Miscellaneous
Observations," 1718; "Botanic Essays," 1820, &c.). ORD. _EricaceA|_.
Pretty little greenhouse evergreen shrubs, natives of Southern and
Tropical Africa. Flowers terminal, glomerate; corolla short-tubular,
with a four-cleft limb, very freely branched. Leaves verticillate, with
revolute margins. For culture, _see_ =Erica=.

    =B. articulata= (jointed).* _fl._ reddish; heads drooping. May.
    _l._ four in a whorl, ovate or linear, glabrous, and shining;
    bracts solitary. _h._ 1ft. 1795.

    =B. ericoides= (Heath-like). _fl._ purplish-red. August. _l._ four
    in a whorl, oblong, obtuse, ringed; bracts three, length of the
    calyx. _h._ 2ft. 1774. SYN. _Erica orbicularis_. (L. B. C. 153.)

    =B. purpurea= (purple). _fl._ purple; heads drooping. June. _l._
    four in a whorl, ovate, sub-ciliated. Stem flexuous, erect. _h._
    2ft. 1791.

=BLAKEA= (named after Martin Blake, of Antigua, a great promoter of
useful knowledge). ORD. _MelastomaceA|_. Handsome stove evergreen shrubs
or trees. Flowers red, large, showy; peduncles axillary, terete,
one-flowered, naked, opposite or solitary, shorter than the leaves,
usually with brown tomentum. Leaves petiolate, three to five-nerved,
coriaceous, glabrous above and shining, but usually densely clothed
with rusty tomentum beneath. They thrive well in peat, or a mixture
of loam and peat, and require to be liberally supplied with water,
particularly in spring and summer. Cuttings root freely if taken from
shoots that are quite ripe (otherwise they are apt to rot), planted in
a pot of sand, and plunged in a moist heat, under a hand glass.

    =B. quinquenervia= (five-nerved). _fl._ flesh-coloured, large,
    with white disks; peduncles twin, shorter than the petioles. June.
    _l._ elliptic, acuminated, naked, and shining on both surfaces,
    five-nerved. _h._ 10ft. to 16ft. Guiana, 1820. (A. G. 210.)

    =B. trinervia= (three-nerved). _fl._ rose colour, large; peduncles
    solitary, longer than the petioles. June. _l._ oval-oblong,
    three-nerved, glabrous and shining on both surfaces in the adult
    state, and when young serrulated; petioles and branchlets clothed
    with rusty tomentum. Roots issuing from the branches and stems.
    _h._ 4ft. to 8ft. Jamaica, 1789. (B. M. 451.)

=BLANCHING.= This process is effected for the purpose of obtaining
crispness, and for converting what would, under ordinary circumstances,
be a dangerous plant--in the case of Celery especially so--into a
highly popular delicacy. Blanching can only be accomplished by entirely
excluding the light from the plants, thus depriving the colouring
matters of their power to decompose water and carbonic acid gas. It is
also termed Etiolation.

=BLANDFORDIA= (named after George, Marquis of Blandford). ORD.
_LiliaceA|_. A very beautiful genus of greenhouse bulbous plants,
natives of Australia. Flowers solitary, on recurved pedicels; perianth
funnel-shaped, six-cleft; stamens six. Leaves linear, elongate,
striate; radical ones dilated, and somewhat sheathing at the base;
others shorter and more distant, appearing on the flower-stem. The best
soil in which to grow them is loam and peat in equal proportions, with
a little rough silver sand added. They should be repotted moderately
firm in the autumn, allowing good drainage, and should then be placed
under the greenhouse stage, or in any other position where they will
be free from water drippings. Water must only be given when dry, until
they commence to grow, when it may be gradually increased, and they
may be introduced into a higher temperature, if necessary, there to
remain till after flowering. When the foliage is ripened off, they may
be stored away until the time for repotting. Propagated by seeds and
offsets, or by division of the old plants, which must be done when
repotting.

    =B. aurea= (golden).* _fl._ 1-1/2in. to 2in. long; scape bearing
    an umbellate cluster of three to five pure golden-yellow drooping
    bell-shaped flowers. Summer. _l._ narrow, linear, keeled or

    twelve to twenty, terminating in a stout scape 3ft. high. June.
    _l._ linear, slightly keeled at the back, about 1/3in. broad. New
    South Wales. This magnificent species should have a little charcoal
    mixed with the soil already mentioned. (B. M. 5734.)

    and bright yellow within, about 3in. long, tubular, borne on a
    scape about 1ft. high, slightly pendulous, and arranged near the
    summit. Summer. _l._ stiff, sub-erect, long, bright green, disposed
    in a distichous manner. This is a very splendid greenhouse plant,
    and should be in every collection. Australia, 1873. SYN. _B.
    princeps_. See Fig. 255. (B. M. 6209.)

    =B. grandiflora= (large-flowered).* _fl._ crimson, very large;

    funnel-shaped, in sixteen to twenty-flowered racemes; bracts
    leaf-formed. September. _l._ channelled, acutely keeled, scabrous
    on the margins. _h._ 1-1/2ft. Australia.

    pendulous racemes; bracts narrow, foliaceous, about equalling in
    length the pedicels. July. _l._ stiff, sub-erect, with scabrous
    margins. _h._ 2ft. Tasmania, 1842. (B. R. 31, 18.)

    =B. nobilis= (noble).* _fl._ orange with yellow margins, on long
    pedicels, drooping, disposed in a terminal raceme; bracts twice as

    towards the point, finely toothed or undulated, connected at the
    base. Brazil and Peru, 1820. See Fig. 256. (H. S. F. 3, 157.) There
    is a very pretty variety met with in gardens under the name of
    _Corcovadense crispum_, which is not quite so strong-growing as the
    type, with wavy, crispy edges. They will all thrive in the cool of
    a stove fernery.

    to the midrib; texture coriaceous. Tropical America, 1820. _B. l.
    fraxineum_ is a variety found in gardens under the name of _B.
    fraxiniifolium_, with a habit more close than the type; pinnA|
    six to eight on a side, sometimes 1in. broad. _B. intermedium_
    (Link.) and _B. gracile_ (Kaulf.), often seen in gardens, are
    slender-growing varieties of this rather variable stove species.

    =B. nitidum= (shining).* _sti._ stout, erect, naked, 3in. to 4in.
    long. _fronds_ oblong-lanceolate, 1ft. or more long, 4in. to 6in.

=BLEPHILIA= (from _blepharis_, the eyelash; in allusion to the ciliated
bracts). ORD. _LabiatA|_. Ornamental hardy perennials, closely allied
to _Monarda_, but differing from it in the calyx tube having thirteen
instead of fifteen nerves, and being naked in the throat, while the
corollas are much smaller and more dilated. They are of easy culture in
ordinary soil. Increased readily by dividing the roots in early spring.

=BLESSED THISTLE.= _See_ =Cnicus benedictus=, properly =Carbenia
benedicta=.

=BLETIA= (in honour of Don Louis Blet, a Spanish botanist). ORD.
_OrchideA|_. A large genus of, for the most part, stove terrestrial
orchids. Flowers purple or whitish, in terminal racemes. Leaves narrow,
grass-like. Pseudo-bulbs round, flattened. The flowers are freely
produced when the plants are thoroughly established, and are valuable
for bouquets, as well for their pleasing colour as for the time they
last in perfection. Bletias thrive best in a compost of loam and leaf
mould. About 2in. of crocks, covered with a layer of moss, should be
placed in the bottom of the pot, which should be filled to within
1in. of the top with soil. The bulbs should then be inserted, and just
covered. A good supply of water during the growing season is necessary,
and only a moderate amount of heat. After growth has ceased, a period
of rest is required, during which time very little water should be
given. Propagation is effected by divisions, which should be made after
the plants have finished flowering, or previous to their starting into
growth.

    =B. campanulata= (bell-shaped). _fl._ deep purple, with a white
    centre, lasting a considerable time in perfection. Mexico.

    petals nearly equal, lanceolate, acuminate; lip red and yellow;
    scape simple. _l._ oblong, lanceolate, plicate. _h._ 1-1/2in.
    Mexico, 1830. (B. R. 1681.)

    =B. hyacinthina= (Hyacinth-like).* _fl._ purple, racemose; lip not
    spurred, beardless; scape about as long as the leaves. March to
    June. _l._ lanceolate. _h._ 1ft. China, 1802. This pretty species
    has proved to be quite hardy. (Garden, Nov., 1879.)

    =B. patula= (spreading-flowered). _fl._ purple, spreading; scape
    tall, branched. March. _l._ lanceolate. _h._ 2ft. Hayti, 1830. (B.

    =B. Shepherdii= (Shepherd's).* _fl._ on branching spikes, purple,
    marked down the centre of the lip with yellow. Winter. _l._ long,
    lanceolate, dark green. Jamaica, 1825. (B. M. 3319.)

    =B. Sherrattiana= (Sherratt's).* _fl._ about a dozen on a spike,
    rich rosy purple; petals very broad, twice the breadth of the
    sepals; lip deep purple in front, marked with white and yellow down
    the centre. _l._ three to four-plicate. Pseudo-bulbs depressed. New
    Grenada, 1867. (B. M. 5646.)

    =B. verecunda= (modest). _fl._ purple; lip not spurred. January.
    _h._ 3ft. West Indies, Mexico, &c., 1733. (B. M. 930.)

=BLIGHIA SAPIDA.= The Akee Tree. This is now included under the genus
=Cupania= (which _see_).

=BLIGHT=, or =BLAST=. Applied to various diseases of plants which are
caused or accelerated either by the presence of parasitic fungi or
insects, or by atmospheric influence. Blight generally proves fatal to
the whole or part of the subject attacked.

=BLIND.= A term applied to plants which fail to produce central buds.
The defect is frequently noticeable in the Cabbage, and other plants
of the _Brassica_ tribe; and is, perhaps, mainly due to the attacks of
insects in a very early stage. Great care should therefore be exercised
in keeping the seed beds clear of insect pests, by the application of
ashes, lime, and soot, or spent hops.

=BLOOD FLOWER.= _See_ =HA|manthus=.

=BLOODROOT.= _See_ =Sanguinaria canadensis=.

=BLOOM.= A fine powder-like substance found on Grapes, Cucumbers,
Plums, &c., and varying in colour in the different subjects. It should
be carefully protected, as it improves the appearance of the fruit. The
term is also generally used-A--although incorrectly-A--as the plural of
blossom.

=BLOSSOM.= The flower of a plant, or the essential organs of
reproduction, with their appendages.

=BLUE-BELLS.= _See_ =Campanula rotundifolia= and =Scilla nutans=.

=BLUE-BOTTLE.= _See_ =Centaurea Cyanus=.

cA"rulea= and =Vaccinium angustifolium=.

=BLUMENBACHIA= (in honour of John Frederick Blumenbach, M.D.,
Professor of Medicine at GA¶ttingen, and distinguished as a comparative
anatomist). ORD. _LoasaceA|_. Elegant branched, climbing or trailing,
annual, biennial, or perennial herbs, generally covered with stinging
hairs, which are very objectionable. Flowers axillary, solitary,
bracteate, very pretty and interesting. Leaves opposite, lobed. They
are of easy culture in ordinary garden soil. Propagated by seeds, which
should be sown in pots, in spring, and placed in a gentle heat, where
they will germinate in about a fortnight. When the seedlings are large
enough, and after having been previously hardened off, they may be
planted out in their blooming quarters, or potted on and trained to a
trellis.

[Illustration: FIG. 257. BLUMENBACHIA CHUQUITENSIS.]

    =B. chuquitensis= (Chuquitan).* _fl._ solitary, axillary, with five
    to ten boat-shaped red petals, which are yellow within. September.
    _l._ oblong-lanceolate, pinnate; segments pinnatifidly lobed. Peru,
    1863. Half-hardy climbing perennial. See Fig. 257. (B. M. 6143.)

[Illustration: FIG. 258. FLOWER OF BLUMENBACHIA CORONATA.]

    =B. coronata= (crowned).* _fl._ of pure glossy whiteness,
    quadrangular, crown-shaped, 2in. in diameter each way. June. _l._
    narrow, bipinnatifid, cut into small segments. _h._ 1-1/2ft. Chili,
    1872. This is an elegant dwarf, tufted, erect biennial, with the
    pure white blooms imbedded in the metallic lustrous foliage. SYN.
    _Caiophora coronata_. See Fig. 258.

    =B. insignis= (remarkable).* _fl._ with whitish petals and
    reddish-yellow scales, axillary, on long peduncles, about 1in. in
    diameter. July. _l._, lower ones five to seven-lobed; upper ones
    deeply bipinnatifid. _h._ 1ft. Chili, 1826. Hardy annual trailer.
    SYN. _Loasa palmata_. (B. M. 2865.)

=BOBARTIA= (named after Jacob Bobart, Professor of Botany at Oxford in
the seventeenth century). ORD. _IrideA|_. A small genus of greenhouse or
hardy bulbous plants, closely allied to _Sisyrinchium_. The species in
cultivation are very pretty hardy plants, but require protection from
severe frosts and excessive rains. They thrive best in a warm, light
soil, and make pretty plants for rockwork. Propagated by separating
the offsets during autumn. This genus has been much misunderstood.
Among the plants which have been referred to it are some which now find
places in the genera _Aristea_, _Sisyrinchium_, _Homeria_, _Marica_,
_MorA|a_, &c., &c.

    =B. aurantiaca.= _See_ =Homeria aurantiaca=.

    =B. gladiata= (sword-shaped). _fl._ yellow, thinly sprinkled with
    purple dots near the centre, handsome, nearly 2in. across. _l._
    linear, ensiform, narrow, slightly glaucous, 1ft. or more in
    length. 1817. SYN. _Marica gladiata_. (B. R. 229.)

    =B. spathacea= (rush-like). _l._ rush-like, several feet in length;
    flower-stem as long as leaves, bearing near extremity a cluster of
    pale yellow flowers, with narrow segments. Each flower lasts but
    one day; as a good many, however, are developed in each spathe,
    there is a succession which lasts some time. 1832. SYN. _Xyris
    altissima_. (L. B. C. 1900.)

[Illustration: FIG. 259. BOCCONIA CORDATA, showing Habit and Flower.]

=BOCCONIA= (named after Paolo Bocconi, M.D., a Sicilian botanist,
author of the "Museum des Plantes," and "Histoire Naturelle de l'Ile
de Corse," &c.). ORD. _PapaveraceA|_. Two of the species are greenhouse
or half-hardy shrubs. Flowers inconspicuous, in terminal panicles,
with the branches and branchlets each furnished with one bract. Leaves
stalked, glaucous, large, lobed. This genus does not well agree with
the rest of _PapaveraceA|_, from its having one-seeded capsules and
apetalous flowers. _B. cordata_ is a handsome, hardy, herbaceous plant,
with a stately habit and finely-cut foliage, and, where bold subjects
are desired, few will be found superior to it. As an isolated specimen
on the lawn, or by frequented walks, where it will not be too closely
surrounded by tall plants, it may be grown with marked effect. It
also forms a good subject for pot culture, and is largely used for
sub-tropical bedding. The soil most suitable for its culture is a good
fat loam, of considerable depth. Propagated by cuttings, taken from the
axils of the larger leaves, during early summer; or by young suckers,
taken from established plants, during summer, as they will then flower
the following season. If the former method is employed, the cuttings
should be pushed on, so that there are plenty of roots before the
winter sets in. The other two species require greenhouse culture; but
both are eminently suited for sub-tropical gardening, in any light rich
soil, or well-drained and airy situation. They are best propagated by
seeds, sown in a hotbed in spring, the seedlings being placed out from
June to September.

    =B. cordata= (cordate).* _fl._ buff-coloured, very numerous,
    borne in very large terminal panicles; individually they are not
    showy, but the fully grown inflorescence has a very distinct and
    pleasing appearance. Summer. _l._ large, reflexed, deeply-veined,
    roundish-cordate; margins lobed or sinuated. Stems growing rather
    close together, thickly set with leaves. _h._ 5ft. to 8ft. China,
    1795, and 1866. Mr. Robinson recommends its being grown in the
    angle of two walls which shelter it from the north and east. It
    runs quickly at the roots, and the suckers may be cut off to the
    benefit of the parent plant; each sucker will form a strong plant
    in a year's time. SYNS. _B. japonica_ and _Macleaya yedoA"nsis_. See
    Fig. 259. (B. M. 1905.)

    =B. frutescens= (shrubby).* _fl._ greenish. October. _l._ large,
    sea-green, oval-oblong, cuneated at the base, pinnatifid. _h._ 3ft.
    to 6ft. Mexico, 1739. (L. B. C. 83.)

    =B. integrifolia= (entire-leaved). _fl._ greenish; panicle crowded.
    _l._ flat, oblong, tapering towards each end, entire, or scarcely
    crenated. _h._ 9ft. Peru, 1822.

    =B. japonica= (Japanese). Synonymous with _B. cordata_.

=BA"BERA= (named after BA"ber, a Russian botanist). ORD. _CompositA|_.
A genus of evergreen greenhouse shrubs, now generally referred to
_Dysodia_. They are of easy culture, thriving in ordinary garden soil.
Propagated by cuttings, made of young, rather firm, shoots, and placed
in sand, under a glass. There are several other species besides the one
given below, but they are not of much horticultural value.

    =B. incana= (hoary).* _fl.-heads_ golden; peduncles one-headed.
    November. _l._ pinnate, rather hairy; leaflets linear acute,
    channelled, some entire, and some trifid. Stem hairy. _h._ 1-1/2ft.
    Mexico, 1828. (B. R. 1602.)

=BA"HMERIA= (named after George Rudolph BA"hmer, a German botanist).
ORD. _UrticaceA|_. A genus of shrubs or herbaceous plants, allied to
_Urtica_, from which it is distinguished in not having stinging hairs.
_B. nivea_ is the only species having any horticultural value. This
thrives best in a warm, sandy soil; and is increased by divisions.

    =B. nivea= (snowy). _fl._ greenish, disposed in spikes. _l._
    broadly cordate, about 6in. long by 4in. broad, terminating in a
    long slender point; edges serrate, covered on the under side with a
    dense coating of white down. _h._ 3ft. to 4ft. China. A shrub-like
    perennial, rather more curious than beautiful.

=BOILERS.= These are very important articles in all gardens where there
are glass houses, and the best should always be selected. They are made
in cast and wrought iron, both of which have their special advantages
and disadvantages. The former are less liable to burn through when
encrusted with any deposit from the water, but will crack with sudden
changes of temperature, by reason of the granular form of the metal
not allowing gradual contraction; the latter may burn through where
there is any deposit of mud or other matter, but they will not crack,
and will stand a greater pressure than those made of cast metal. It
is, however, the better plan to use Boilers of wrought iron, as, with
careful usage, they are less liable to break down in hard frosts than
are the others. As the value of the plants, as well as that of the
Boiler, has to be considered, should such a contingency occur, it
is certainly advisable to reduce all risks to a minimum; and as the
average life of a Boiler is from ten to fifteen years, a slightly
larger first cost is not of very serious moment. The forms of Boilers
are very diverse, and, in some of the patented forms, complicated. But,
whatever the shape, the following points are essential: A clear and
unrestricted waterway of not less than 2in. in thickness; the greatest
exposure of surface to the direct action of the fire; a sufficient
fire space; and a fire-bar area calculated to supply enough fresh air
to the fire to support thorough combustion. The forms generally used
for horticultural work are the following, or some modifications of
them; and, however grand the name, their chief value consists in the
attested heating capacity at a given cost: The Saddle Boiler, which
is made of various sizes, with or without check ends, cross tubes,
and other devices for increasing the heating surface, and also of
a tubular form; the Upright Cylinder (a vertical section of which
is shown in Fig. 260); the Upright Tubular Cylinder; the Horizontal
Tubular; and the Cornish or Horizontal Cylinder. Combinations of the
various forms, and complicated patterns of different kinds, are made
for particular purposes; but in no case should large Boilers be used,
unless they are recommended, by one competent to judge, as suitable for
the purpose they are needed to fulfil. In every case, it is necessary
that the Boiler should be fixed in a proper manner. It is also good
policy to have Boilers about 30, or even 50 per cent., more powerful
than is actually required, when they are new, as, from various causes,
their heating power falls off in a year or two in many places; and,
under ordinary work, it is not desirable to stimulate the action in
order to command sufficient heat. There is no doubt that, for general
purposes, some modification of the Saddle or Cylinder Boiler is by far
the best, all things duly considered; but it is impossible to give any
practical advice without a thorough knowledge of the requirements of
any particular place. Gas Boilers are also useful for small places.
These are made in many forms, and are, as a rule, in the shape of a
cylinder, with a coned inside, against which the flames play. Some Gas
Boilers have also a superheater attached; this exhausts the heat from
the air which has passed through the Boiler. Another good form is made
of horizontal tubes, which contain the water, the flames playing over
and amongst them. An atmospheric burner of approved construction should
be used where gas is the heating power. A sufficient supply of gas
should be assured by using supply pipes of a good size. Care should be
taken to keep these pipes free from water, and protected from frost by
silicate cotton lagging, or some other good non-conductor. Except for
very small places, however, gas apparatus is almost useless, and will
never supersede fuel Boilers. For other particulars regarding Boilers,
_see_ =Heating= and =Stoking=.

=BOIS-PERDRIX.= _See_ =Heisteria=.

=BOLBOPHYLLUM.= _See_ =Bulbophyllum=.

=BOLETUS= (from _bolos_, a mass; in reference to its massy or globular
form). ORD. _Fungi_. The only species of this rather large genus
demanding mention is _B. edulis_ (see Fig. 261), which is considered
an excellent article of food. It is easily distinguished, and is often
of large size and somewhat unshapely; the pileus is usually of a dusky
yellow or brownish hue, but sometimes brighter and more of a chestnut
colour; the flesh is white, and does not change to a blue colour when
cut (this is a very important characteristic, and should always be
noticed). It is a species common in most districts, usually growing in
woods, and appearing chiefly in the autumn.

[Illustration: FIG. 261. COMMON BOLETUS (BOLETUS EDULIS).]

=BOLEUM= (from _bolos_, a ball; in reference to the shape of the
seed-pods). ORD. _CruciferA|_. An ornamental, hardy, evergreen shrub,
well adapted for rockwork, in ordinary soil. It requires slight
protection in winter if planted in very exposed situations. Propagated
by seed, sown in a pot, in spring, and placed in a frame, or in the
open border during summer.

    =B. asperum= (rough).* _fl._ cream-coloured; racemes erect,
    elongated; pedicels very short, the lower ones bracteate. April.
    _l._ alternate, oblong, linear; lower ones somewhat divided. A
    suffruticose, erect, branched plant, hispid from stiff hairs. _h._
    6in. to 1ft. France. 1818.

=BOLLEA.= _See_ =Zygopetalum=.

=BOLTED.= A term used in reference to plants that have prematurely run
to seed.

=BOLTONIA= (named after J. B. Bolton, an English professor of botany).
ORD. _CompositA|_. A genus of rather pretty hardy herbaceous perennials.
Flower-heads with white or purplish rays. Leaves pale green,
lanceolate, sessile. They thrive in common garden soil. Propagated by
divisions of the roots, in March.

    =B. asteroides= (Aster-like).* _fl.-heads_ flesh-coloured,
    stellate, disposed in a rather large terminal panicle. August. _l._
    all entire, somewhat broadly lanceolate, narrowed at both ends.
    _h._ 2ft. North America, 1758. (B. M. 2554.)

    =B. glastifolia= (woad-leaved).* _fl.-heads_ pink. September. _l._,
    lower ones serrated. _h._ 1-1/2ft. North America, 1758. (B. M.
    2381.)

[Illustration: FIG. 262. FLOWERS OF BOMAREA CARDERI.]

=BOMAREA= (derivation of name doubtful). ORD. _AmaryllidaceA|_. A genus
of handsome half-hardy twiners, closely allied to _AlstrA¶meria_,
from which it is chiefly distinguished by its twining habit and some
difference in the capsule. They are of comparatively easy culture,
thriving in a compost of peat, leaf mould, loam, and sand, with good
drainage. Manure water should be given during the season of growth.
Although they make fine pot plants, their full beauty is only developed
when planted out in the conservatory or greenhouse border. Propagated
by seeds, or by careful divisions of the underground stem. In making
a division, it is necessary to observe that the part taken has some
roots by which to live till new ones are formed. It should be potted at
first, and may, when established, be planted out or shifted on. Seeds
may be raised in a warm house without difficulty. They germinate in a
few weeks; and when the young plants are 2in. or 3in. high, they should
be placed separately in small pots, shifting them on as necessary,
or planting them out. In favoured southern localities, several
species have proved hardy, but they are much the best when grown in a
greenhouse.

    =B. acutifolia Ehrenbergiana= (Ehrenberg's acute-leaved). _fl._
    undulate, outer segments deep orange, the inner ones paler and

thriving in any common soil. Propagated by divisions, in spring, or by
striking the young cuttings in a cold frame. They may also be raised
from seed, which should be sown from March to May, in any good garden
soil, and the plants, when large enough, thinned out to 1ft. or more
apart. In hot weather, Borage is generally in demand for claret cup and
other drinks.

=BORASSUS= (a name applied by LinnA|us to the spathe of the Date Palm).
ORD. _PalmaceA|_. A very small genus of stove trees, containing two
noble species, which are distinguished by unisexual flowers, produced
upon distinct plants, the males being borne in dense branching catkins,
and the females on simple, or, more rarely, slightly branched spikes.
Fruit very large, brown, three-seeded. Leaves fan-shaped, with spiny
petioles. Trunks unarmed, often 70ft. high. They may be grown in good
fibrous loam, leaf mould, and sand, mainly the former. Increased by
seeds only, which require to be sown in strong bottom heat. Rarely seen
in cultivation.

    =B. A|thiopicum= (African). _l._ nearly circular, and plaited,
    supported upon stout petioles, 6ft. to 7ft. long. Western Tropical

    =B. ruscifolia= (Ruscus-leaved). _fl._ sparingly villous. July.
    _l._ cordate, many-nerved, minutely ciliated, but are otherwise
    glabrous as well as the branches. _h._ 2ft. to 4ft. 1790. (B. M.
    2128.)

=BORDERS, FLOWER.= Small beds, or a continuous bed, of greater length
than width, skirting a wall or shrubbery, and containing plants of
a heterogeneous character. They should be slightly raised above the
surrounding level, and thoroughly drained. In the first preparation of
the Border, it is most essential to deeply dig or trench the ground,
thoroughly incorporating a large amount of well-bodied manure; and if
the soil is very stiff, wood ashes or coarse sand should be well worked
in with the manure. The best time to plant such Borders is in early
autumn or in March.

Where, as is frequently the case, the Borders are only 2ft. or 3ft.
wide, not more than two rows of plants, either in groups or singly,
will be allowable. The tall plants or shrubs should constitute the
background, with dwarfer subjects in front; but formal arrangements
must be avoided. The object should be to secure a continuous succession
of flowers. This would entail some little trouble at first, which,
however, would be amply repaid by results.

No hard-and-fast rules can be laid down as to the arrangement of
the plants, which depends on individual taste and means; but the
best results are obtained when the border is mainly made up of hardy
herbaceous perennials, as permanent occupants, assisted by liberal
quantities of summer bedding plants, such as Dahlias, Fuchsias,
Geraniums, Heliotrope, TropA|olums, &c., as well as many hardy annuals
and biennials. By this means, a very varied and beautiful display may
be maintained, especially if bulbs are used for early spring effect,
such as Narcissi, Scillas, Snowdrops, Tulips, &c. Of course, the
herbaceous perennials should be selected with much care, all weedy
subjects being avoided, and variety in colour and time of flowering
secured. Anything like a full list of these would occupy too much
space for repetition here, but the following will be found very showy
and useful: Achilleas, Aconitums, Anemones, Aquilegias, Armerias,
Asters, Campanulas, Carnations and Picotees, Delphiniums, Dodecatheons,
Doronicums, Fritillarias, Funkias, Gaillardias, Geraniums, Geums,
Hollyhocks, Iberises, Irises, Liliums, PA|onies, Papavers, Pyrethrums,
double and single, Ranunculus, Trolliuses, &c.

=BORDERS, FRUIT.= These should be well drained, and if not naturally
so, the soil should be excavated from 3ft. to 5ft. deep, in order
to form a bottom of stones, pieces of brick, clinkers, &c. Where it
is convenient, draining pipes should be added, if an outfall in the
vicinity can be secured. The base of the Border should be sloped to
the front, where the pipes should be laid, and the bottom covered with
draining material, thereby effectually preventing the fruit trees
rooting deep, which is detrimental to healthy growth. Gross-feeding
vegetables or flowers should not be grown on the surface, but
shallow-rooting crops will generally do no harm. Many advocate the
surface being kept free from crops of any sort, simply letting it be
freely exposed; whilst others equally as strenuously condemn this plan.
Where necessary, chalk or some other mineral constituent of good soil
which is naturally absent, may be added; but much animal manure is
rarely required. The depth and width of Border may vary for different
fruit trees, but efficient drainage is in all cases important.

=BORECOLE= (_Brassica oleracea fimbriata_). An important division of
the Brassica tribe, often cultivated in gardens under the name of
Kale. It comes in very useful when hard weather has rendered cabbages,
&c., unfit for use, as it endures cold better than most other green
vegetables. Some are also grown as ornamental foliaged plants. Like all
other plants of a similar description, they require rich soil, and they
should be put out in June or early in July, as it is almost useless
to plant this kind of vegetable after the middle of the latter month.
To obtain the best results, the ground should be deeply dug and well
manured; but it must not be full of crude manure at planting time, or
it will make the plants too tender and succulent in wet seasons, with
the result that the first sharp frost would cause them to rot. Good
hard-stemmed plants are the kinds most needed, especially for crops
required in spring, when green vegetables are scarce. Cultivation:
Early in April, and again a month later for succession, the seeds
should be sown thinly in nursery beds, not covering them too deeply.
The soil should be in a friable condition, and it is an advantage if
the first beds be made under a south wall. As soon as the seedlings
appear, if they are too thick, they should be thinned, as those
which are drawn up weak and spindly are useless. When large enough,
they should be carefully planted out, choosing showery weather, if
possible, for the operation. If it is necessary to plant them in dry
weather, they must be well watered-in. The rows should be from 2ft.
to 3ft. apart, according to the variety, and the plants 2ft. apart in
the rows; or, if potatoes are planted wide apart, the Borecole may be
arranged between them. Dead leaves must be cleared away from time to
time, but no green ones should be broken off. When the tops are cut
for use, the stems should not be denuded of foliage, as they will soon
break again and form successional crops. The plants must be kept free
from weeds. After April, the Kales are of little use; the stems may
therefore be pulled up, and the ground planted with some other crop.
They all require the same treatment, and at their various seasons come
in equally useful.

_Sorts._ The distinct forms are somewhat limited, but being largely
cultivated on the Continent as well as all parts of Britain on account
of its hardy nature, the varieties of Borecole receive a large number
of names that are either synonymous with, or indistinct from, a few
well-known types. Dwarf Green Curled or Scotch is probably the best and
most grown; other good hardy sorts are Asparagus Kale (this name is
applied to several different kinds, the best one being in use very late
in spring), Buda, Cottagers', Dwarf Purple, Imperial Hearting, Ragged
Jack, and Tall Green Curled. Melville's Variegated and Variegated
Borecole, amongst others, have fine ornamental foliage.

=BORONIA= (named after Francis Boroni, an Italian servant of Dr.
Sibthorp, who perished from an accident at Athens; he collected
specimens of many of those plants which are figured in the "Flora
GrA|ca"). ORD. _RutaceA|_. Very elegant and useful shrubs, requiring
similar treatment to ordinary greenhouse hard-wooded subjects, and
much aided with a little extra heat in spring, when breaking into
growth. Flowers pretty, pink-purplish, or white; peduncles terminal,
but usually axillary on the extreme branches, one to many-flowered;
pedicels furnished at the base and middle with two opposite, short
bracts, jointed, commonly dilated under the calyx. Leaves opposite,
simple, or impari-pinnate, entire, or a little serrulated, full of
pellucid dots. They should be placed out of doors from July to the
middle of September; the most convenient place for them is in pits,
as there are then greater facilities for protecting them from heavy
rains and thunderstorms. When first put out, Boronias should not be
fully exposed, but in the course of a week they may remain open to the
full influence of both sun and air. Potting should be performed once
a year, as soon as the top growth ceases, as the roots then extend
themselves in preparation for their next year's functions. The best
compost for them is one of peat and maiden loam in equal parts, and
about one-sixth sharp silver sand. Many cultivators, however, prefer a
compost consisting of good fibry peat and silver sand, together with
some pieces of charcoal, smaller or larger, according to the size of
the pots used. The soil should be rammed firmly in the pots, which
must be well drained. The leading shoots should be pinched, to ensure
good bushy specimens. Propagation may be effected by young cuttings,
or those made from the half-ripened wood; these should be put into a
thoroughly drained pot of sandy soil, with 1in. of sand on the surface,
and covered with a bell glass, which must be frequently taken off and
wiped dry. When in the cutting state, water must be very carefully
given around the rim of the pot, without taking off the glass. If
placed in a temperature of about 50deg., and shaded from bright noonday
sun, they soon root, when they may be potted off singly into small
pots, and plunged in sawdust, or cocoa-nut fibre refuse, in which
situation but little water is needed. Pinching repeatedly, when young,
is the only means to secure good ultimate growth. Air must be given on
all possible opportunities.

=BORRERIA= (named after William Borrer, F.L.S., a profound botanist
and cryptogamist). ORD. _RubiaceA|_. A large genus of stove herbs or
sub-shrubs, now referred to _Spermacoce_. Flowers small, white, rarely
blue, disposed in verticillate heads, in the axils of the leaves, or on
the tops of the branches, rarely cymose or corymbose. Leaves opposite,
or the young ones disposed in fascicles in the axils of the old ones,
and therefore appearing verticillate; stipules joining with the
petioles, more or less sheathing, fringed by many bristles. Stems and
branches usually tetragonal. The species are of easy culture, thriving

=BOTHY.= A residence for under-gardeners, usually built behind the
hothouses, or some high wall, in what is called a back shed. The
place is too frequently a cramped, ill-ventilated hovel. A Bothy
proper should be an independent structure, and fitted with modern
conveniences; for, of all people, gardeners are the most susceptible
to colds, &c. A library of standard horticultural and botanical works,
as well as a few on other scientific subjects, and a moderate number
of high-class books of fiction, one or more weekly gardening and other
papers, should be supplied by the employer. During the winter months,
for mutual improvement, lectures should be delivered, or papers read,
by each gardener, on various subjects, after which a free discussion
should take place upon the paper or lecture, by which means a great
amount of good would be accomplished.

=BOTRYCHIUM= (from _botrys_, a bunch; in reference to the bunch-like
disposition of the indusia). Moonwort. ORD. _Filices_. A genus of very

=BOTTLE-TREE.= _See_ =Sterculia rupestris=.

=BOTTOM HEAT.= This is usually secured by passing hot-water pipes
through an air chamber, or a water tank, beneath a bed of plunging
material. The covering of the tank or chamber is best made of slate.
The heat must be regulated according to the requirements of the
subjects grown; this is easily accomplished by using the valve.
A thermometer should be placed in the tank or bed. Bottom-heat
is indispensable for propagating plants from seeds and cuttings,
especially in spring. _See_ =Heating= and =Hotbeds=.

=BOUCEROSIA= (from _boukeros_, furnished with buffaloes' horns; in
reference to the curved lobes of the corona) ORD. _AsclepiadaceA|_. A
genus of greenhouse succulent perennials, allied to _Stapelia_, and
requiring the same culture. Flowers numerous, terminal, umbellate;
corolla sub-campanulate, five-cleft; segments broadly triangular, with
acute recesses; stramineous corona fifteen-lobed; lobes disposed in a
double series; the five inner ones opposite the stamens and lying upon
the anthers; the rest exterior, erect, or a little incurved at apex,
adhering to the back of the inner ones. Branches and stems tetragonal,

    tetragonous. _h._ 2ft. to 5ft. Brazil, 1874. A stove perennial. (B.
    M. 6221).

=BOUGAINVILLEA= (named after De Bougainville, a French navigator).
ORD. _NyctagineA|_. Gorgeous warm greenhouse or conservatory plants,
comprising some of the most showy climbers in cultivation. Their
beauty lies in the bracts, which envelop the small greenish flowers.
_B. glabra_ may be grown in pots, or planted out in the greenhouse
borders; the others are best planted out, as they root very freely, and
plenty of space would be occupied if allowed, but it is best to limit
it, as they bloom much better. Strict training and pinching are not
desirable, being prejudicial to the free production of bloom; indeed,
the best plan is to allow the plants to ramble freely over the roof of
a moderately high house, or along the upper portion of a back wall;
they will then bloom profusely for several months in the year, provided
proper attention be paid to watering, and that the plants are in a
well-drained situation. In preparing a border for their reception, the
first point to be considered is the drainage, which must be perfect.
This is best effected by placing a layer of brick rubbish, 6in. to 9in.
in thickness, communicating with the drain, by which means all sourness
and stagnancy of the soil will be obviated. The bed should be excavated
to a depth of 18in. or 2ft. Three parts turfy loam, and one part
leaf soil, with the admixture of a liberal quantity of sharp gritty
sand, will form a suitable compost for the culture of Bougainvilleas.
The amount of sand incorporated must depend upon the quality of the
other components, heavy loam requiring more than that which is more
friable. The occasional incorporation of manure in the compost is not
to be recommended; but a liberal application of liquid manure will be
of material advantage, especially if the root space is limited. When
the plants cease blooming each yearA---about November or DecemberA---they
should be dried off and rested; and in February they should be closely
spurred in, the same as with vines, and all weak leaders removed, so
that strong wood only is left. When grown in pots, they must be started
in brisk heat. They are easily increased by cuttings prepared from the
half-ripened wood; these should be placed in sandy soil, in a brisk
bottom heat, when they will soon root. Scale, red spider, and mealy bug
are the only insects likely to infest the plants, and recipes for their
destruction will be found under each individual name.

[Illustration: FIG. 269. FLOWERING BRANCH OF BOUGAINVILLEA SPECTABILIS.]

    =B. glabra= (smooth).* _fl._, inflorescence panicled, smaller than
    that of _B. speciosa_, each branchlet producing cordate-ovate acute
    rosy bracts, in threes. Summer. _l._ bright green, smooth. Brazil,
    1861. This is by far the best species for pot culture, and forms a
    very showy plant when well grown.

    =B. speciosa= (beautiful).* _fl._, bracts large, cordate, delicate
    lilac rose, produced in immense panicles, which, in well grown
    specimens, are so freely produced as to entirely shroud the whole
    plant. March to June. _l._ ovate, very dark green, covered on
    the upper surface with small hairs. Stems branched, abundantly
    furnished with large recurved spines. Brazil, 1861. (F. M. i., 62.)

    =B. spectabilis= (showy). _fl._, bracts of a dull brick-red, shaded
    with scarlet. South America, 1829. It is very difficult to obtain
    bloom on this plant; and when flowers are produced, they are
    extremely ephemeral. The species is, for all practical purposes,
    much inferior to either of the foregoing. SYN. _Josepha augusta_.
    See Fig. 269.

=BOURBON PALM.= _See_ =Latania=.

=BOUSSINGAULTIA= (named after Boussingault, a celebrated chemist).
ORD. _ChenopodiaceA|_. Very pretty half-hardy, tuberous-rooted plants,
requiring a rich vegetable sandy soil, and a well-drained sunny aspect,
under which conditions the first-mentioned species develops into a
very luxuriant trailing plant, attaining a length of 20in. or more.
Propagated freely by means of the tubercles of the stem; these are,
however, extremely brittle.

    =B. baselloides= (Basella-like).* _fl._ white, ultimately becoming
    black, fragrant, small, disposed in clusters, 2in. to 4in. long,
    which are axillary at the ends of the branches. Late autumn. _l._
    alternate, cordate, smooth, shining, fleshy, slightly wavy. Stems
    very twining, tinged red, very quick-growing, producing tubercles.
    South America, 1835. (B. M. 3620.)

    =B. Lachaumei= (Lachaume's). _fl._ rose, constantly in perfection.
    Cuba, 1872. A stove species.

[Illustration: FIG. 270. FLOWERING BRANCH OF BOUVARDIA.]

=BOUVARDIA= (named after Dr. Charles Bouvard, formerly superintendent
of the Jardin du Roi, at Paris). ORD. _RubiaceA|_. Handsome greenhouse
evergreen shrubs. Peduncles terminal, three-flowered, or trichotomous
and corymbose; corolla funnel-shaped, tubular, elongated, beset with
velvety papillA| outside, and a four-parted, spreading, short limb.
Leaves opposite, or in whorls; stipules narrow, acute, adnate to the
petioles on both sides. These extensively cultivated plants are among
the most useful for conservatory or greenhouse decoration (see Fig.
270. for which we are indebted to Messrs. Cannell and Sons), and
the flowers are largely employed in a cut state. Perhaps only two
are fragrant, viz., _jasminiflora_ and _Humboldtii_. Cultivation:
Presuming the grower to be commencing with young rooted cuttings, these
should be potted off into a mixture of good fibrous loam, leaf soil,
and sand, in equal proportions, to which may be added a small quantity
of peat; they should then be placed in a temperature of from 70deg.
to 80deg. until fully established in the small pots. It is necessary
at this stage to stop the young plants back to the first joint, and
as they continue to make fresh breaks, to keep on pinching them back
during the whole period of cultivation, or until sufficiently bushy
plants are produced. Many growers neglect stopping far too much, the
result being ill-shaped and almost flowerless plants. The pinching, of
course, can be regulated by the time the plants are required to flower;
and it is unwise, in most cases, to stop them after the end of August.
When the small pots are well filled with roots, the plants should be
shifted into the flowering pots, viz., large 48-sized, which are quite
commodious enough to grow very fine plants, a similar compost as in the
first potting, with a little Standen's manure added, being used, and
good drainage provided. A cool greenhouse, with a damp bottom for the
pots to rest upon, and with a moist atmosphere, is the most suitable
place in which to grow them during late spring and early summer, the
moist air being very desirable as an effectual check to red spider,
a pest very fond of the foliage, which it permanently disfigures.
A cold pit or close frame is better during the summer months, as a
moist atmosphere and cool bottom are then certain. Ventilation may
be effected during the greater part of the day by tilting the lights
below, and on fine nights they may be removed altogether. During
bright sunshine, shading will be beneficial. All through the period
of active growth, it is absolutely necessary that the plants should
receive plenty of water, or they will surely suffer; and when the
pots are filled with roots, occasional doses of manure water will be
beneficial. Many cultivators plant them out about the end of June, in
favoured situations, or in spent hotbeds, when they make very vigorous
growth; and, if carefully pinched and watered, fine specimens are
obtained. These are lifted in early autumn, with a good ball, potted,
and kept shaded for a few days until the roots are again active, when
they are taken to the house in which they are intended to bloom, and
an enormous supply of flowers is secured. We have also seen Bouvardias
planted out permanently in beds, in prepared pits, in which the winter
temperature was not less than 55deg., with very satisfactory results;
the quantity of bloom being very great. Of course, with the last-named
treatment, it is essential to give the plants a rest and hardening-off
after flowering, and when they are started into fresh growth to keep
them well pinched and watered. Bouvardias are liable to the attacks of
red spider and green fly. The former stands little chance of existence
if the plants are kept well supplied with moisture; the latter may be
destroyed by fumigating with tobacco. Mealy bug are also troublesome,
and should be sponged off with a solution of Gishurst's Compound.
Propagation: After flowering, and a slight rest and hardening-off, the
old plants should be cut back, placed in heat, in a stove or cucumber
pit, and freely syringed, which will cause them to break freely, and
produce a good supply of cuttings. When the young shoots are from
1-1/2in. to 2in. long., they are in the best condition for striking. It
is not necessary that they should be cut off at a joint, as they will
root from any surface of the stem; and, working economically, it is
wiser to cut them off just above the first joint, as other shoots will
speedily break out, which may, in their turn, be taken. Pots about 5in.
across should have previously been prepared for the cuttings, by being
well drained and filled with a mixture of good fibrous loam, leaf soil,
and coarse sand, in equal parts, with a copious supply of sand upon
the surface, into which the cuttings should be dibbled pretty thickly.
A good watering must be given without wetting, and thereby injuring,
the foliage. The pots should be plunged in the cutting case, or in any
bottom heat of about 70deg. or 80deg., and covered with a bell glass.
All that is then necessary is to keep them moist and shady during
sunshine, until they are rooted, which, as a rule, is effected in three
weeks' time. When well established, they may be removed from the case,
gradually hardened off, and finally potted singly into small thumb pots.

half-ripened shoots in summer, placed in sandy soil, under a bell
glass, in a gentle bottom heat; or by layers. Seeds may be sown in
March, in heat. Brachysemas require thorough drainage, whether grown
in pots or planted out. _B. latifolium_ does best under the latter
treatment, when it forms a magnificent climber for pillars or the roof.

=BRASSAVOLA= (named in honour of A. M. Brassavola, a Venetian
botanist). ORD. _OrchideA|_. A genus of epiphytal orchids, requiring
the heat of an intermediate house. Flowers large, usually with narrow
acuminate greenish petals and sepals, and a white lip, which is
sometimes broad; column having a pair of great falcate ears on each
side of the front, and eight pollen masses. Leaves solitary, succulent.
They are of easy culture on blocks of wood, with a little moss,
suspended from the roof. Water should be plentifully given during the
growing season; at other times, a very small quantity will suffice.
About seventeen or eighteen species have been introduced, of which the
following only are worth growing:

    =B. acaulis= (stemless). _fl._ large; sepals and petals long,
    narrow, greenish and creamy-white; lip large, heart-shaped, and
    pure white; base of tube spotted with dull rose. September. _l._
    very narrow, rush-like. _h._ 4in. Central America, 1852. (P. F. G.
    ii., 152.)

    =B. Digbyana= (Digby's).* _fl._ solitary, 4in. across, produced

    colour, streaked with purple down the centre, and beautifully
    fringed. Winter. _h._ 9in. Honduras, 1844. A compact-growing
    evergreen. (B. M. 4474.)

    =B. Gibbsiana= (Gibbs's).* _fl._ white, spotted with chocolate,

    rare, erect-growing species must be potted in peat and sphagnum.

    =B. glauca= (glaucous).* _fl._ solitary, produced from a sheath at
    the top of the bulb; sepals and petals yellow; lip orange, with a
    white throat. Early spring. _l._ of a milky-green. _h._ 1ft. Vera
    Cruz, 1837. A very handsome fragrant species, somewhat difficult
    to flower, but this obstacle may be overcome by liberally growing
    during the proper season, and giving it a severe dry rest. (B. M.
    4033.)

    =B. lineata= (lined).* _fl._ large, very fragrant; sepals and
    petals creamy-white; lip large, pure white. _l._ long, terete,
    channelled above, tapering to a point, very deep green. South
    America, 1850. (B. M. 4734.)

    cream-coloured; lip white, strongly veined. A pretty free flowering
    species. Honduras, 1839. (B. R. 26, 39.)

=BRASSIA= (named after Mr. William Brass, who was sent by Sir Joseph
Banks to Cape Coast and the neighbouring districts as a botanical
collector, at the end of the last century). ORD. _OrchideA|_. A genus
of tropical American orchids, very nearly allied to _Oncidium_, with
which, indeed, Reichenbach unites it. From this genus, however,
_Brassia_ may be distinguished by its simple inflorescence, elongated
tail-like sepals, and short column, which is quite destitute of the
side lobes or ears that form a marked feature in the species of
_Oncidium_. There are about seventeen species, of which many are not
sufficiently attractive to deserve the cultivator's attention. They
will succeed either in pots or in baskets, the drainage of which must
be perfect. They require to be potted in good fibrous peat, broken in
pieces not less in size than a walnut, placed in the warm end of a
Cattleya or Brazilian house, and supplied liberally with water during
summer. In winter, they must still be kept in a tolerably warm place,
and given sufficient water to keep the pseudo-bulbs from shrivelling.
It is useless to dry off until shrivelling takes place, for experience
assures us that when a plant shrivels it is generally safe to assume
that it has been tried beyond its powers of endurance, and that its
constitution has given way. Propagated by dividing the plants, when
growth has commenced.

    =B. antherotes= (brilliant).* _fl._ 7in. in diameter from tip to
    tip of the sepals; sepals and petals yellow, brownish-black at the
    base, narrow, 1/8in. broad, tapering; petals 1-1/2in. long; lip
    triangular, yellow, barred with brown; spike strong, about 2ft. in
    length. Tropical America, 1879.

    =B. caudata= (tailed).* _fl._, sepals and petals yellow, barred
    with brown, from 4in. to 6in. long; lip broad and yellow, spotted
    with greenish-brown. When the plant is large and healthy, it
    produces numerous drooping spikes, 18in. long, and many-flowered.
    _h._ 1ft. West Indies, 1823 (B. R. 832.)

    =B. Gireoudiana= (Gireoud's). _fl._, sepals and petals bright
    yellow, spotted and blotched with deep red, produced in
    many-flowered scapes of singular and beautiful flowers during
    spring and early summer. This species much resembles _B. Lanceana_,
    but has larger flowers. Costa Rica. (R. X. O. 1, 32.)

    =B. Lawrenceana= (Lawrence's).* _fl._ large, sweet-scented; sepals
    and petals bright yellow, spotted with cinnamon and green; lip
    yellow, tinged with green. June to August. _h._ 1ft. Brazil, 1839.
    (B. R. 27, 18.)

    =B. L. longissima= (long-sepaled).* _fl._, sepals deep
    orange-yellow, blotched and spotted, especially towards the base,

    2-1/2in. long and 1/4in. broad at the base, marked in the same
    manner as the sepals; lip about 3in. long, pale yellow, dotted and
    spotted towards the base with purple. August and September. Costa

    summer. Jamaica, 1806. See Fig. 276. (B. M. 1691.)

    =B. m. guttata= (spotted).* _fl._ on spikes 2ft. or 3ft. long;
    sepals and petals yellowish-green, blotched with brown; lip broad,
    yellow, spotted with brown. May to August. Guatemala, 1842. SYN.
    _B. WrayA|_. (B. M. 4003.)

    =B. verrucosa= (warty-lipped).* _fl._ large; sepals and petals
    greenish, blotched with blackish-purple; lip white, ornamented with
    numerous little green protuberances or warts, hence the specific
    name; scape many-flowered. May and June. Guatemala.

    =B. v. grandiflora= (large-flowered).* _fl._ twice the size of, and
    a lighter colour than, the type. This variety is very rare, and is
    said to be the best of the genus.

=BREAD NUT.= _See_ =Brosimum=.

=BREDIA= (named in honour of Professor J. G. S. van Bred). ORD.
_MelastomaceA|_. An ornamental greenhouse shrub, thriving in rich light
loam, leaf soil, and peat. Propagated by cuttings of the ripened
shoots, inserted in sandy loam, under a hand glass, in heat; or by
seeds.

    =B. hirsuta= (hairy).* _fl._ rose-pink, about 1/2in. across,
    disposed in loose, terminal, many-flowered cymes. Autumn. _l._
    ovate acuminate, hairy. Japan, 1870. (B. M. 6647.)

=BREEZE.= The small particles or refuse of gas coke. It constitutes a
very cheap fuel, but, unless mixed with good coke, is only suitable for
boilers of the saddle type, having a good draught. Breeze must not,
however, be confounded with coke-dust.

=BREVOORTIA COCCINEA.= _See_ =BrodiA|a coccinea=.

[Illustration: FIG. 277. FLOWERING BRANCH OF BREXIA MADAGASCARIENSIS.]

=BREXIA= (from _brexis_, rain; the large leaves afford protection
against rain). ORD. _SaxifrageA|_. Excellent stove trees. Flowers
green, in axillary umbels, surrounded by bracts on the outside. Leaves
alternate, simple, dotless, and furnished with minute stipules. Stems
nearly simple. They require a compost of two parts loam and one of
peat, with the addition of a little sand, to keep the whole open.
A liberal supply of water must be given at all seasons. Cuttings,
with their leaves not shortened, strike readily in sand under a hand
glass, in heat; or a leaf taken off with a bud attached will grow.
Leaves as in accompanying illustration (Fig. 277), and long, narrow,
spiny-toothed ones, are often produced on the same plant. Probably the
two species enumerated below are simply forms of one. Well hardened
off, strong growing plants of _B. madagascariensis_ are very suitable
for sub-tropical gardening.

    =B. madagascariensis= (Madagascar).* _l._ obovate or oblong,
    entire, while young minutely gland-toothed. _h._ 20ft. Madagascar,
    1812. See Fig. 277.

    =B. spinosa= (spiny). _l._ lanceolate, 20in. long, 2in. broad,
    spiny-toothed. _h._ 20ft. Madagascar, 1820.

=BREXIACEA†.= A section of _SaxifrageA|_.

=BRIAR.= _See_ =Rosa=.

=BRICKS.= In England, the standard thickness of brick walls is a
Brick and a-half, that is, the length of one brick and the breadth of
another. Thirty-two paving bricks, laid flat, will form one square yard
of flooring; if set on edge, eighty-four will be required for the same
space. The best Bricks for walls are those termed Stocks, which are
well burnt. Grizzells and Place Bricks, being only partially burnt,
are soft and not durable. In various parts of the kingdom, different
clays and methods of manufacture cause a disparity in the weight and
appearance of the finished article. Several forms are made to suit
various purposes, but the standard size is 9in. long by 4-1/2in. wide,
by 2-1/2in. thick, although, since the remission of the duty, some
slight variations occur, owing to shrinkage and other causes. Fire
Bricks are made of a particular kind of clay, which will stand intense
heat when once burnt, and are used in furnaces and other places where
durability under great heat is a desideratum. Fire-clay should always
be used in place of mortar in building with these.

=BRILLANTAISIA= (named after M. Brillant). ORD. _AcanthaceA|_. A very
small genus of erect, branching, stove evergreen shrubs. Flowers
large, in terminal panicles; corolla ringent; upper lip falcate and
overarching, with a trifid apex, the lower one large, spreading,
shortly trifid. Leaves ovate-cordate, on long petioles. For culture,
_see_ =Barleria=.

    =B. owariensis= (Owarian).* _fl._ violet-blue; cymes sub-sessile,
    loose; panicles terminal. March. _l._ large, opposite, petiolate.
    _h._ 3ft. Western Africa, 1853. This plant, in its habit of growth,
    resembles some of the largest species of _Salvia_. (B. M. 4717.)

=BRISTLES.= Stiff hairs.

=BRISTLY.= Covered with stiff hairs.

=BRISTLY-TOOTHED.= Furnished with teeth like bristles, or with the
teeth ending each in a bristle.

=BRIZA= (from _briza_, to nod). Quaking Grass. ORD. _GramineA|_. A genus
of ornamental hardy grasses. Panicle loose; calyx two-valved; corolla
two-valved, awnless; exterior one ventricose, interior small and flat.
Fruit adnate with the corolla. These extremely graceful plants delight
in a soil composed of loam, leaf soil, and peat. Seeds may be sown
in spring or autumn. For decorative purposes, the branches should be
gathered as soon as full grown, and loosely placed in flower-stands,
to dry. Tufts of these plants look extremely pretty on the rockery, or
amongst hardy ferns.

    =B. gracilis= (graceful). Synonymous with _B. minor_.

    =B. maxima= (greatest).* _fl._, spikelets oblong-cordate, thirteen
    to seventeen-flowered; panicle nodding at the end. June and July.
    _l._ long, linear-acuminate. _h._ 1-1/2ft. South Europe, 1633. See
    Fig. 278.

[Illustration: FIG. 278. BRIZA MAXIMA, showing Habit and single Flower.]

    =B. media= (middle).* Common Quaking Grass. _fl._, spikelets
    broadly ovate, of about seven florets (calyx shorter than the
    florets), tremulous with the slightest breeze, very smooth, shining
    purple. Branches of the panicle thread-shaped, divaricating,
    purple. June. _l._ short, linear acuminate. _h._ 1ft. Britain. (S.
    E. B. 1774.)

    =B. minima= (least). Synonymous with _B. minor_.

[Illustration: FIG. 279. BRIZA MINOR, showing Habit and small Panicle
of Flowers.]

    =B. minor= (small).* Little Quaking Grass. _fl._, spikelets
    triangular, seven-flowered; glumes longer than the flowers; panicle
    with hair-like branches. June and July. _l._ pale green, short,
    narrow. _h._ 8in. England (but very rare). An exceedingly pretty
    little annual or perennial grass. SYNS. _B. gracilis_ and _B.
    minima_. See FIG. 279. (S. E. B. 1775.)

    =B. spicata= (spiked). A recent introduction from Brazil, described
    as being very graceful and quite distinct, having erect spikes
    about 8in. in height.

=BROADCAST.= A method of sowing seeds by means of the hand, scattering
them over the surface of the ground as equally as possible. It is now
superseded, for the majority of garden and field crops, by drilling,
which not only economises the quantity of seed used, but greatly
facilitates subsequent weeding and thinning out.

=BROCCOLI= (_Brassica oleracea botrytis asparagoides_). A cultivated
variety of the Cabbage, having the young inflorescence condensed into
a fleshy, edible head (see Fig. 280). To grow this popular vegetable
successfully, it is necessary to have rich soil of a good depth, in an
open situation, where the plants can have plenty of sun and air to keep
them sturdy. They succeed the autumn Cauliflower, and are in season
from November till May.

_Soil._ In preparing ground for Broccoli, trench, in the autumn, to
the depth of from 1-1/2ft. to 2ft., and during the process work in a
liberal dressing of rotten farmyard manure. Ground which has carried a
crop of Celery is very suitable for the strong-growing kinds, as, by
planting where the Celery rows have been, the necessity of trenching
is, to a great extent, obviated. Smaller kinds, however, need to be
planted closer in order to obtain a profitable crop.

_Cultivation._ At the beginning of May, prepare seed beds on a south
border, and sow the earlier and sprouting kinds. The later varieties
would, perhaps, be best sown in April, but they must not be put in
early and allowed to remain too long in the seed bed. Sow thinly, to
get the plants as sturdy as possible; and, to prevent clubbing, work
in a little soot or wood ashes on the surface of the beds. Care must
also be taken to pick off the club excrescences at planting time,
should there be any, and to destroy the grub inside. Clubbing is not
so frequent in ground which has been well trenched, and where the
plants are not allowed to suffer from drought. Showery weather should
be selected for transferring them to their permanent quarters. If it
is desired that they should succeed potatoes, they may be planted
between every two alternate rows, and the latter crop can be removed
when ready. Broccoli succeed best where the ground is firm, and not
recently dug or manured. Planting with a crowbar is preferable to
digging the ground afresh. If grown by themselves, a distance of from
2ft. to 3ft. should be allowed between the rows, and an equal distance
from plant to plant. Some of the early varieties will, in favourable
seasons, follow the later Cauliflowers, while the latest will not be
fit for use until the following spring. The heads should be cut as soon
as they are large enough; they will keep good for a week in a cold
place, while a day or two might open them too much if allowed to remain
on the plants. Broccoli which have to stand the winter are liable to
injury from severe frosts, and some method of protection is necessary.
Two plans are recommended for both large and small gardens, and either
or both may be adopted, as found convenient. The first is to apply a
covering of fern or other dry protective material, not using too much,
but giving sufficient to break the rays of the sun, which, perhaps,
do as much harm as the actual frost. The other plan is to take up the
plants as soon as the flowers can be seen, and lay them in under a
hedge or wall until required for use. In sheltered positions, or where
there are trees to break the force of the wind, the covering with dry
litter during severe weather will generally be found sufficient; still,
a little precaution in lifting will frequently save a valuable crop.
Broccoli should never follow a crop of any other kind of cruciferous
plants, particularly Cabbage.

[Illustration: FIG. 280. BROCCOLI.]

_Sorts._ Veitch's Self-protecting Autumn, Purple and White Cape,
Grange's Early White, and Snow's Winter White. These are the best for
autumn and mid-winter supplies. A good selection for spring and late
purposes is Mitchinson's Penzance, Knight's Protecting, Cooling's
Matchless, Purple Sprouting, Model, Willcove, Leamington, and
Cattell's Eclipse.

=BRODIA†A= (named after J. J. Brodie, a Scotch cryptogamist). SYN.
_Hookera_. ORD. _LiliaceA|_. Pretty, slender, hardy, or in some
positions only half-hardy, bulbs. The flowers are usually borne in
large clusters or umbels; the prevailing colour is blue; _coccinea_ is,
however, an exception, the flowers being scarlet. The scape is usually
straight and slender, but strong. Leaves from two to four in number,
enveloping the part of the scape beneath the surface, and procumbent
thereon. Most of them are of easy culture in rich sandy loam; if grown
in pots, a mixture of loam, leaf soil, and sand, suits them well.
Increased freely by offsets, which should be left undisturbed with
the parent bulbs till they reach a flowering state, when they may be
divided and replanted in autumn.

    =B. capitata= (headed).* _fl._ deep violet-blue, funnel-shaped,
    disposed in a compact, many-flowered umbel; valves of the spathe
    also deep violet. May. _l._ narrow, linear. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft.
    California, 1871.

    flowers. June. _l._ linear, loose, shorter than the scape. _h._
    1-1/2ft. California, 1870. Very handsome, distinct from all other
    species, requiring a warm, well-drained, and sunny position, and to
    remain undisturbed. SYN. _Brevoortia coccinea_. See Fig. 281. (B.
    M. 5857.)

    =B. congesta= (close-headed).* _fl._ blue, with the crown paler;

    24in. California, 1880.

    =B. ixioides= (Ixia-like). _See_ =Calliprora lutea=.

    =B. lactea= (milky-white).* _fl._ white, usually with green
    midribs, 1/2in. to 3/4in. across, saucer-shaped, in many-flowered
    umbels. June and July. _l._ linear, acute, nearly as long as the
    scape. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. California, 1833. SYNS. _Hesperoscordum

    synanthous. California, 1874. Half-hardy bulb. (B. M. 6123.)

=BROMELIA= (named after Bromel, a Swedish botanist). ORD.
_BromeliaceA|_. A genus of stove herbaceous perennials, allied to
the Pineapple. Flowers, corolla three-petaled, convolute, erect,
or spreading at the top. Leaves densely packed, rigid, lanceolate,
with spiny margins. Stems short. These plants require much the same
treatment as _Billbergia_. Allied genera are _A†chmea_, _Ananassa_,
_Billbergia_, _Disteganthus_, _Greigia_, _Karatas_, _Ruckia_ (which
_see_).

    =B. Karatas.= _See_ =Karatas Plumieri=.

    =B. pitcairniA|folia= (Pitcairnia-leaved). A synonym of _B. bicolor_.

    =B. sceptrum= (sceptre-like). A synonym of _B. antiacantha_ and
    _Karatas Plumieri_.

=BROMELIACEA†.= An extensive order of stemless or short-stemmed plants,
having rigid, channelled, and usually spiny leaves. Flowers very showy;
outer perianth three-cleft, persistent, inner one of three withering
segments; stamens six, inserted in the tube of the perianth. To this
order belongs the Pineapple. The genera best known in gardens are
_Ananassa_, _A†chmea_, _Billbergia_, _Bromelia_, and _Tillandsia_.

=BROMHEADIA= (in honour of Sir Edward Finch Bromhead). ORD. _OrchideA|_.
A small genus of stove orchids, comprising a couple of species, with
erect stems, large flowers, and cucullate lip, which is parallel with
the column. For culture, _see_ =Ansellia=.

[Illustration: FIG. 282. BROMUS BRIZA†FORMIS.]

=BROMUS= (from _bromos_, the Greek name for a wild oat). _Ord._
_GramineA|_. _B. brizA|formis_ (see Fig. 282) is an elegant biennial
grass, with drooping panicles of spikelets, about as large as those of
_Briza maxima_. It grows about 2ft. high, and is of very easy culture
in common garden soil. Sow seeds outside in patches, in July, thinning
out the plants when necessary. There are numerous other species
belonging to this genus, but the above-mentioned is the only one worth
growing in gardens. It forms a beautiful object in the mixed border, or
among ferns.

=BRONGNIARTIA= (in honour of Adolphe Brongniart, a distinguished
botanist, and one of the editors of "Annales des Sciences Naturelles").
ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Handsome greenhouse evergreen sub-shrubs, clothed
with silky villi. Flowers large, purple; pedicels twin, axillary,
one-flowered. Leaves impari-pinnate, with many pairs of leaflets, the
terminal one not remote from the rest. They require a compost of sandy
loam, leaf soil, and fibry peat, with perfect drainage. Cuttings of the
young shoots, if firm at the base, will root if dibbled in sand, under
a bell glass, in a cool house.

    =B. podalyrioides= (Podalyria-like).* _fl._ purple, large.
    September. _l._ with two to five pairs of leaflets; leaflets

=BROOM, SPANISH.= _See_ =Spartium junceum=.

=BROSIMUM= (from _brosimos_, edible; fruit edible). Bread Nut. ORD.
_UrticaceA|_. A genus of stove evergreen shrubs or trees, principally
of economic value in their native countries. Male and female flowers
generally in a globular head, but sometimes borne on separate trees;
calyx and corolla wanting. Leaves entire. They generally thrive in a
rich fibry loam. Cuttings of ripe wood, with their leaves on, root if
placed in sand, in moist heat.

    =B. Alicastrum.= _fl._, catkins globose, stalked, twin, axillary.
    _fr._ coated. _l._ ovate-lanceolate. _h._ 6ft. Jamaica, 1776.

=BROUGHTONIA= (named after Mr. Arthur Broughton, an English botanist).
ORD. _OrchideA|_. A very compact-growing stove evergreen, allied to
_LA|lia_, succeeding best if suspended from the roof on a block of wood,
with a little moss; it requires a free supply of heat and water when in
a growing state. Propagated by dividing the plant. The colour of the
flowers is very distinct.

    =B. sanguinea= (blood-coloured).* _fl._ blood-coloured, rather
    large, disposed in a terminal panicle; scape divided; column
    distinct, or at the very base united with the unguiculate lip,
    which is lengthened at the base into a tube, connate with the
    ovarium. Summer. _l._ twin, oblong, seated on a pseudo-bulb. _h._
    1-1/2ft. Jamaica, 1793. (B. M. 3076.)

=BROUSSONETIA= (named after P. N. V. Broussonet, a French naturalist,
who wrote numerous works on Natural History). ORD. _UrticaceA|_.
Ornamental fast-growing, deciduous, Mulberry-like trees. They require
rather good open garden soil, and prove hardy in situations which are
not very exposed. Propagated by suckers and cuttings of ripened wood,
inserted in autumn, in a cool house; and by seeds, sown when ripe, or
kept till the following April.

    =B. papyrifera= (paper-bearing).* The Paper Mulberry. _fl._
    greenish, diA"cious; males in pendulous, cylindrical catkins, each
    flower in the axil of a bract; females in peduncled, axillary,
    upright globular heads. May. _l._ simple, alternate, exstipulate,
    variously lobed or entire, hairy, large. _h._ 10ft. to 20ft. China,
    1751. There are several varieties, differing in the shape and
    character of the leaves. (B. M. 2358).

=BROWALLIA= (named in honour of John Browall, Bishop of Abo, who
defended the sexual system of LinnA|us against Siegesbeck, in a book
entitled "Examen epicriseos," &c., 1739). ORD. _ScrophularineA|_. A
genus of handsome shrubs or herbs. Flowers blue or white, axillary and
terminal; corolla salver-shaped, resupinate from the contortion of the
peduncle; tube fifteen-nerved, ventricose at top. Leaves alternate,
stalked, ovate in outline. They thrive best in a rich, open, sandy
soil. To have strong plants in bloom by Christmas and after, seeds
should be sown in July, in pans or pots of light rich sandy soil, and
kept in a close frame, or hand light, where they can be shaded till
germination takes place. When large enough to handle, the seedlings may
either be pricked out, three in a pot, or potted singly, according to
the size of the specimens required. In the former way, they form fine
masses for conservatory or greenhouse decoration, or to cut from; and
in the latter, they are very suitable for window recesses, &c. After
potting, they should be stood in a pit or frame, and syringed every
morning and evening, to ward off attacks of insect pests. An abundance
of well-diluted liquid manure is required as soon as the flower-buds
appear. To keep the plants dwarf and bushy, it will be needful to stop
them about three times during the remainder of the summer and autumn,
keeping as near the glass as possible; they should be housed by the end
of September. These elegant little greenhouse annuals are unrivalled
for affording choice, neat sprays for bouquets during the winter and
early spring months, or for growing as pot plants, to furnish warm
greenhouses or sitting-room windows. Many of the species and varieties
are largely employed for summer decoration of the flower garden, with
highly satisfactory results; for this purpose, seeds should be sown
in gentle heat early in spring, and the plants transferred to the
flower borders late in June, or early in July, having been previously
encouraged in pots, and well hardened off.

    =B. abbreviata= (shortened). _fl._ light red; pedicels shorter than

    attenuated into the petioles at the base. _h._ 1ft. to 3ft. Peru,
    1829. (B. M. 3069.)

    =B. Jamesoni= (Jameson's).* _fl._ bright orange, with
    lighter-coloured throat, tubular. June. _h._ 4ft. New Grenada,
    1850. This species has been recently re-introduced, after having
    been lost to cultivation for over thirty years. (B. M. 4605.)

    =B. Roezli= (Roezl's). _fl._ large, either of a delicate azure
    blue, or white, with a yellow tube. Spring to autumn. _l._ shining
    green. An exceedingly pretty species, having flowers double the
    size of any other, and forming a dense compact bush, 1-1/2ft. to
    2ft. in height. Rocky Mountains.

=BROWNEA= (named after Patrick Browne, M.D., author of a History of
Jamaica). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. Very handsome stove evergreen trees or
shrubs, allied to _Amherstia_. Flowers of a rose-scarlet colour, rising
in fascicled heads from the axillary buds. Leaves abruptly-pinnate,
when young flaccid, and with the leaflets revolute at the edges;
leaf-bud long and stipulaceous. All the species are well worthy of
the most extensive cultivation. A mixture of loam, peat, and sand, is
a soil well adapted for them, and great care should be taken not to
over-water the plants in winter, as too great a supply will be sure to
kill them. Propagated by cuttings, taken from ripened wood, planted in
a pot of sand, and placed under a hand glass, in a moist heat.

    =B. Ariza= (Ariza).* _fl._ richest scarlet, produced in a
    large, globular, drooping head of immense size. Summer. _l._
    pinnate, usually with six or eight pairs of pinnA|, which are
    oblong-lanceolate, and sharply tapered to a point. _h._ 20ft. to
    40ft. Columbia, 1843. This noble tree requires a large house to
    fully perfect its beauty. SYN. _B. princeps_. (B. M. 6459.)

    =B. princeps= (chief). A synonym of _B. Ariza_.

    =B. racemosa= (clustered).* _fl._ rose-coloured, racemose;
    involucre and calyx clothed with fine tomentum. _l._ with
    four pairs of unequal-sided, oblong, or oblong-lanceolate,
    cuspidately-acuminated leaflets, which are glanduliferous at the
    base. _h._ 4ft. Caraccas, 1826.

    =B. Rosa del Monte.= _fl._ scarlet, in dense heads; leaflets of
    the involucre roundish, imbricated, and, when in a young state,
    rather velvety. June. _l._ with two to three pairs of oval-oblong
    acuminated leaflets; branches and petioles glabrous. _h._ 8ft.
    South America, 1820. (B. R. 1472.)

=BROWNLOWIA= (named in honour of Lady Brownlow, daughter of Sir Abraham
Hume, and a great patroness of botany). ORD. _TiliaceA|_. Very handsome
greenhouse evergreen trees, thriving well in a mixture of loam and
peat. Cuttings of ripe shoots will root if placed in sand, under a hand
glass, in heat.

=BRUCHUS GRANARIUS.= _See_ =Bean Beetle=.

=BRUCHUS PISI.= _See_ =Pea Weevil=.

=BRUGMANSIA.= _See_ =Datura=.

=BRUNFELSIA= (named after Otto Brunfels, of Mentz, first a Carthusian
monk, and afterwards a physician; he published the first good figures
of plants in 1530). SYN. _Franciscea_. ORD. _ScrophularineA|_. Elegant
free-flowering stove evergreens. Flowers sweet-scented; corolla large,
funnel or salver-shaped, with a long tube, and a flat, five-lobed,
obtuse, nearly equal limb. A light rich soil, or a compost of loam,
leaf soil, and peat, is necessary to grow these plants successfully.
Propagated by cuttings, planted in sand, and placed under bell glasses,
in a moderate heat. When rooted, they should be placed in small pots,
in a compost somewhat more sandy than that already mentioned. While
growing, they require to be kept in a moist stove temperature, and
should be hardened by placing them in a drier, and somewhat cooler,
temperature after each growth is completed; the pots should be changed
as often as the roots become thick around the ball of earth. The larger
plants flower freely, and should be slightly pruned in annually, before
commencing their new growth, thus securing neat and compact specimens.
Repotting should be effected directly they have done flowering. The
plants should then be placed in a temperature ranging from 60deg.
to 68deg., and both the roots and foliage liberally supplied with
water. When flowers appear--about October or November--the syringing
must be less frequently performed. At this period, if it be desirable
to prolong the flowering season, the plants should be removed to a
temperature of about 48deg. A few administrations of weak liquid manure
during the growing season are of great value.

    =B. acuminata= (taper-pointed-leaved).* _fl._ bluish-violet, few,
    sub-cymose, terminal. April. _l._ oblong, acuminated, attenuated
    a little at the base, glabrous; bracts lanceolate, acuminated,
    glabrous. _h._ 1ft. to 2ft. Rio Janeiro, 1840. (B. M. 4189.)

    =B. americana= (American).* _fl._ first yellow, then white, very
    sweet-scented; axillary flowers solitary, terminal ones numerous.
    June. _l._ obovate, elliptic, acuminated, longer than the petioles.
    _h._ 4ft. to 6ft. West Indies, 1735. There are narrow and
    broad-leaved varieties of this species. (B. M. 393.)

[Illustration: FIG. 284. FLOWER OF BRUNIA NODIFLORA.]

    =B. Lindeniana= (Linden's).* _fl._ rich purple, with a light eye.
    _l._ ovate-acuminate, dark green. Brazil, 1865. (B. H. 1865, 226.)

    =B. uniflora= (one-flowered). _fl._ solitary; corolla with a
    whitish tube, and a bluish-violet or purple limb. Winter. _l._
    elliptic, acute; branches greenish, hoary, diffuse, spreading. _h._
    1ft. to 3ft. Brazil, 1826. (L. B. C. 1332.)

=BRUNIA= (named after Corneille de Bruin, better known under the name
of Le Brun, a Dutchman, a traveller in the Levant). ORD. _BruniaceA|_.
Elegant little greenhouse evergreen Heath-like shrubs, more or less
branched, with the branches in whorls, erect or spreading. Flowers
capitate, furnished with three bracts each, or sometimes deficient of
the two lateral ones. Leaves small, closely imbricate. They require a
compost of peat and sand, with a little leaf soil added, firm potting
and good drainage. Cuttings of young shoots root freely in sand, under
a hand light, in summer.

    =B. nodiflora= (knot-flowered).* _fl._ white; heads globose, size
    of a cherry, on the tops of the branches. July. _l._ lanceolate,
    awl-shaped, trigonal, acute, smooth, closely imbricate, not
    ustulate at the apex. _h._ 1ft. to 3ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1786.
    See Fig. 284.

=BRUNIACEA†.= An order of much-branched Heath-like shrubs, usually
having small leaves, which are crowded and entire. Flowers in terminal
heads; petals five, alternating with the lobes of the calyx. The
typical genus is _Brunia_.

=BRUNONIA= (named after Robert Brown, the most eminent botanist of his
time). ORD. _GoodenoviA|_. A stemless greenhouse perennial herb, with
the habit of _Scabiosa_, downy from glandless simple hairs. Flowers
distinct, with a whorl of five membranous bracts; corolla blue,
marcescent. Radical leaves quite entire, spathulate; scapes undivided,
each bearing one head; head hemispherical, lobate; lobes involucrated
by foliaceous bracts. It thrives in a compost of decayed manure, or
leaf soil and peat, with a little loam added; thorough drainage is
necessary. Propagated by divisions, in early spring, previous to
repotting.

    =B. australis= (southern)* is the only species known to be in
    cultivation. _h._ 1ft. New Holland, 1834. (B. R. 1833.)

=BRUNSVIGIA= (named after the noble House of Brunswick). ORD.
_AmaryllideA|_. Very showy greenhouse bulbous plants, from the Cape of
Good Hope. Flowers red, on very long pedicels. Bulbs large. Leaves
broad, horizontal; perianth with an evident longer or shorter tube,
curving upwards, funnel-shaped, deeply six-parted, deciduous; segments
sub-equal, many-nerved, flat, and recurved at the apex; stamens on the
tube much curved upwards; scape appearing in summer without the leaves;
umbels many-flowered. Propagation is effected by offsets, of which the
large bulbs produce but few. These, when secured, may be removed after
reaching some considerable size, carefully potted in a mixture of sandy
loam and peat, with good drainage, and kept tolerably warm and close
until established; water must be given but sparingly until root-action
has commenced. The best place for growing the offsets into a flowering
size is on a shelf near the glass, in a temperature of from 50deg. to
55deg. With an abundance of water while growing, and kept dry while
semi-dormant, thus allowing them a rest, the bulbs will speedily
increase in size; but it may be years before flowers are produced.
Culture: This may be divided into two periodsA---one of growth, and one
of rest. After the latter period, they should be allowed to start into
fresh growth, without stimulation, and, as soon as started, liberal
supplies of water should be given, and a genial temperature of from
60deg. to 65deg. maintained, to make them grow vigorously. Good-sized
pots are also necessary, with a mixture of loam, peat, and sand, in
equal parts. They are usually confined to the greenhouse, or warm
conservatory, but are sometimes successfully grown in a south border
at the base of a wall, planted out in a pit, upon which the lights may
be placed in winter, and matted if necessary, as they cannot endure
frost. A good depth of soil, consisting of fibrous loam, peat, and
sand, in equal proportions, with good drainage, should be prepared. In
all cases, the bulbs should be planted somewhat deeply. One of the most
satisfactory methods of ensuring the flowering of these plants consists
in subjecting the bulbs, when at rest, to a hot dry heat of 70deg. or
more, which thoroughly ripens them; but, after this treatment, it will
be necessary to encourage the after-growth to the fullest possible
extent.

    =B. ciliaris= (hair-fringed). _fl._ dull purple. _l._ strongly
    fringed with white hairs. _h._ 1ft. 1752. (B. R. 1153.)

[Illustration: FIG. 285. BRUSSELS SPROUTS.]

=BRUSSELS SPROUTS= (_Brassica oleracea bullata gemmifera_). A
cultivated variety of the Cabbage (Fig. 285). Leaves blistered. Stems
covered with small, close heads. To secure this vegetable in its best
form, it must be grown on deeply-worked and rich ground. In addition,
the seeds should be obtained from a good source, as there are many
spurious stocks in cultivation. Plenty of room must be allowed the
plants to develop, and the tops and leaves should not be removed till
after the sprouts are gathered; dead leaves, of course, excepted. It is
a bad plan to plant Brussels Sprouts amongst potatoes or other crops,
as they become unduly weakened, and never give such good returns as
when grown by themselves.

[Illustration: FIG. 286. BRYONIA LACINIOSA.]

_Soil and Cultivation._ In February, and early in March, sow thinly in
a cold frame, or carefully prepare seed beds on a warm south border.
As soon as the plants are large enough, prick them off into prepared
soil, to grow on; about the end of April, transplant into a piece of
rich ground, which has been previously prepared for them, setting in
rows from 2ft. to 3ft. asunder, and 2ft. apart in the rows. The earlier
the plants are put out, the better; and they should be watered-in when
planted, so that they receive as little a check as possible. They must
be kept clear of weeds, and earthed up as soon an they get a good size.
During severe frost, some light dry litter may with advantage be
thrown over them for protection; and the less they are interfered with
when frozen, the better.

_Sorts._ The Imported is the best strain for general use; other good
sorts are: Sutton's Matchless, The Aigburth, and Scrymger's Giant.

=BRYA= (from _bryo_, to sprout; the seeds germinate before falling from
the tree). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A small genus of stove shrubs or small

=BRYONIA= (from _bryo_, to sprout; in allusion to the annual growth
from the tuber). Bryony. ORD. _CucurbitaceA|_. Tuberous-rooted perennial
herbaceous plants, producing annual climbing stems. The native species
is well worth growing over unsightly hedges, fences, &c., and in the
wild garden; it is a rapid grower, and of extremely easy culture.
The stove perennial species should be grown in pots, and the stems
trained up the rafters. Rich loam is the soil most suitable for their
cultivation. Propagated by seeds, or by divisions of the tuber.

    =B. dioica= (diA"cious). _fl._ greenish-white, racemose, diA"cious.

spring from the notches on the edges of the leaves when taken off the
plant, and placed in a moist situation). ORD. _CrassulaceA|_. This very
curious stove succulent thrives in pots of rich loamy soil; perfect
drainage is essential, and but little water is at any time needed.

    =B. calycinum= (large-cupped). _fl._ yellowish-red; cymes
    panicled, terminal. April. _l._ opposite, thick, petiolate; some
    impari-pinnate, with one or two pairs of segments, the terminal

=BUDDING.= This process consists of taking an eye or bud attached to
a portion of the bark, and transferring it to another and different
plant; it is an operation almost confined to woody plants, but has been
practised with more or less success upon herbaceous perennials. The
stock should not be budded unless the sap is in circulation, which is
assured if the bark will detach itself easily, when gently lifted, from
the wood.

There are many ways of performing the different systems, in preparing
and inserting the Buds, &c., and all may prove more or less successful
if undertaken when the Buds and stock are both in a suitable condition.
The principal methods are Shield or T-budding, including the Circular,
Square, and Inverted forms; Flute or Tube-budding, and Annular or
Ring-budding.

The first-named method, which is fully described below, is very
extensively practised for propagating Roses and stone fruits. It is
also coming more in use for the propagation of many other fruit trees,
including Apples and Pears, especially new or scarce varieties, as
the great advantage of making use of many more of the eyes, to form
separate trees, is thereby attained. In large nurseries, where skilful
propagators are employed, thousands of trees are annually budded, the
majority of them with very successful results. It is, in most cases,
preferable to purchase established fruit trees, as cultivators require
the produce much quicker than they could get it by propagating trees
themselves. The same system of Budding is, however, applicable for
increasing Roses; and this may be adopted with every chance of success
by even a cottager, if he takes the necessary care in performing the
work.

Rare varieties of ornamental deciduous trees are largely propagated in
this way; for instance, many of the Acers, Elms, Horse Chestnuts, &c.
Evergreen shrubs, such as Rhododendrons and Hollies, are also rapidly
increased in some establishments by this means.

In the case of fruit-frees, plump wood Buds must be selected, from
medium-sized branches. On some sorts these are scarce, the majority
being Flower-buds, and it is rather difficult to distinguish between
them at the Budding season. The best time for the operation is from
June to the end of August; but surrounding influences, condition of
Buds, stocks, &c., must be taken into account. Clean cuts, with gentle
and skilful handling, are even more important in the Budding of stone
fruits than of Roses or other plants, and the ties should be lightly
but firmly made. In all cases, the operation must be performed as
quickly as possible, as both Bud and bark are injured if exposed to the
air for any length of time.

[Illustration: FIG. 287.]

[Illustration: FIG. 288.]

To proceed with the ordinary system of Shield-budding, the stock (see
Fig. 287 _a_) should first have a longitudinal and a transverse
incision made in the bark, the former about 1in. long. Next, the Bud
should be prepared, removing half the leaf (see Fig. 288). Hold the
branch with the left hand, and pass the knife from about 1/2in. below,
gradually upwards and inwards under the Bud, bringing it out in a
similar way at a somewhat shorter distance above. A portion of wood
will also be taken out, and this is generally removed the opposite
way to that in which the Bud has been cut. By skilful Budders, it is
removed by a sort of twitch from either end. Great care must be taken
not to pull out the base or root of the Bud at the same time, as this
would render it useless. Should the whole come out together, leaving
a hollow place under the eye of the Bud, it must be thrown away, and
another prepared. The Bud being ready, loosen the bark at the point
where the incisions meet, with the ivory knife handle, and insert it by
means of the piece of leaf attached. It must then be tied in with soft
matting or bast, to exclude air, but not tight enough to injure the
bark. Shading from bright sun is advisable for a few days afterwards,
and, as soon as the union takes place, the ties must be frequently
examined, and loosened if necessary. Some prefer Budding late in the
season, in order that the Bud may remain dormant during the winter,
and breaking stronger the following spring. Occasionally, they are
inserted in spring, just at the commencement of growth. The stocks of
the Summer-budded trees should only be allowed a moderate amount of
foliage during the autumn, and should be cut back to the established
Bud before growth commences in spring.

_Square and Circular Shield-budding_ consists in cutting out a piece
of bark of either shape from the stock, and inserting another piece of
exactly the same size, containing a Bud, and covering with a bandage,
or piece of sticking plaster, all except the eye. This mode is seldom
made use of. Inverted T or Shield-budding is preferred in the south of
France for propagating Orange-trees, but is not otherwise much used.
The only difference is that the transverse incision is made below,
instead of above, the other, and the Bud inserted upwards, making it
fit with the bark at the point where the stock is cut across.

[Illustration: FIG. 289.]

_Flute-budding_ is sometimes used, and answers well for some trees
(see Fig. 289). A cylinder of bark is removed from the stock, and one
of a similar size from the scion. containing Buds, is fitted in its
place, being carefully made air-tight by means of a bandage or grafting
wax. Some prefer splitting the hark, as shown in the illustration. and
laying it over the tube or cylinder; but the parts cannot be fitted so
well as when it is removed.

_Ring Budding._ By this mode, it is not necessary to cut off the top of
the stock. A ring of bark may be removed from any convenient part (see
Fig. 290 _b_) and replaced with one containing eyes (see Fig. 290 _a_).
The latter should be taken from a little larger branch than the stock,
as the bark could then be made to fit better. As in Flute-budding, air
must be excluded by means of adhesive paper and bandages or grafting
wax.

Budding operations may be performed at any time during the season; but
dull cloudy weather, and morning or evening, are most suitable. If the
branch, containing Buds, cannot be obtained as required for use, the
ends may be placed in water, to keep them fresh; but unnecessary delay
should be avoided.

[Illustration: FIG. 290.]

[Illustration: FIG. 291.]

_Stocks for Budding upon._ For the Cherry, the Wild Gean, and
seedlings from the Morello. make capital stocks for tall trees and
those of moderate growth; and the Mahaleb, or Perfumed Cherry, for
small trees for pots, bushes, pyramids, or cordons. For the Plum, the
Mussel, Mirabelle, Magnum Bonum, St. Julian, &c., are mostly used
for stocks, the Mirabelle being best for small trees. Peaches and
Nectarines are generally budded on the Mussel, St. Julian, or Mirabelle
Plums; the last are best for dwarfs. The Apricot is budded on the
Mussel or Mirabelle Plums, for small plants; and the St. Julian Plum
for standards. In France, the Damas Noir, or Black Damask, and the
Cerisette, are also used. They should all be raised from seeds, and
not from suckers. Seeds for raising plants for stocks may be sown as
soon as ripe; but where quantities are used, the stones are thrown into
heaps, so as to slightly ferment during winter. In the spring, they
are sown in drills or beds, and transplanted the next year in rows
2ft. or 3ft. apart. and 10in. or 12in. from plant to plant. The dwarfs
are generally budded the second year, and the standards the third
or fourth. Dwarf trees are budded from within a few inches of the
ground to 1ft. above; standards and riders from 3ft. to 9ft.; cordons,
pyramids, &c., can hardly be budded too low.

_Rose Budding._ Propagation of Roses by Budding is very extensively
practised both with standard trees and dwarf plants. It is perhaps
easier and more certain to succeed with these than with fruit trees;
but the mode adopted is precisely the same--that of the shield-shaped
Bud with the core, or root, and the bark attached. For standards,
the common briar of the Dog Rose is the best. The earlier these are
obtained and planted in November, the better, as roots are then formed
at once. For dwarf plants, the Manetti stock is mostly used, being
easily obtained and had in proper condition almost at any time when
Buds are ready. Plants on this stock do not succeed in all soils, and
suckers are also very liable to be produced. Budding on the seedling
briar is attended with good results, and is practised more than
hitherto. The De la Grifferaie stock is also used, more for Tea Roses
than others, and is considered by some to produce better plants than
the Manetti. The shoots on standard briars should be reduced to about
three of the strongest, selected as close together as possible, and
near the top, the briars having been previously cut back the desired
height at planting time. Two Buds are sufficient for a good head; but,
for certainty, three may be inserted. Fig. 291 represents a tall briar
with three shoots; _a_ shows the shoot slit for the Bud; _b_, the Bud
inserted; _c_, the Bud tied in. Fig. 292 is a branch showing Buds, the
lowest ones of which are most suitable, being in firmer wood. Those at
the top are often useless. Fig. 293 represents a Bud taken from Fig.
292, _a_, _b_, and Fig. 294 gives an idea of how the wood is removed.
As previously remarked when describing the system, experienced Budders
remove the wood from either end. Fig. 294 shows its removal from the
lower end.

[Illustration: FIG. 292.]

[Illustration: FIG. 293. FIG. 294.]

Budding as close as possible to the main stem is most desirable. Raffia
grass is superior in every way for tying, which should be performed
as soon after the Bud is inserted as possible. It requires much care,
and, of course, the Bud itself must be entirely free. As soon as the
Buds swell, the tying material should be loosened, and the top of the
stock cut back to the level of the budded shoot. By Budding late, the
Buds lie dormant till the next spring, and the necessity of tying the
young shoots is dispensed with for that season. The shoots of the briar
in advance of the Rose Buds must be cut back, as shown in Fig. 295, so
soon as the Buds are safely established. The Manetti and other dwarf
stocks are budded on the main shoot nearly close to, or underneath the
ground, and if low enough to cover part of the rose stem when grown,
the latter often roots as well and assists the stock. Being small, they
may be grown in pots and removed to the required position at any time.

[Illustration: FIG. 295.]

Dog Roses, used for standards, are usually collected from hedgerows,
and sold at about 8s. per hundred. Manetti stocks are increased by
cuttings, which, after making one season's good growth, will be fit for
use. Briars are raised from seed, which may be collected from hedges,
and sown in the autumn, in drills. The seedlings should be transplanted
the first year after sowing, and the following season they will be
ready for working.

=BUDDING KNIVES.= The best Budding Knives are those manufactured by
Messrs. Saynor and Co., and Messrs. G. Hall and Son. They are made with
handles of ivory, shaped in different ways at the end, for the purpose
of opening the bark, in order to insert the Bud. Some of the blades are
made with the edge rounded at the point, so as to cut the bark without
the knife entering the wood underneath (see Figs. 296 and 297). Others,
which may be used for Budding, and are much better for ordinary use for
cutting flowers, &c., are made with the edge of the blade carried to a
point, as in ordinary knives (see Figs. 298 and 299). Another form has
the handle made of some other material, and a piece of ivory inserted
for opening the bark; this is represented in Fig. 300. The first-named
is the best, if required for Budding only; the second is the most
useful for ordinary purposes, and answers admirably for Budding as
well. None of the other shapes have any material advantages over these.

=BUDDING KNIVES.=]

=BUDDLEIA= (named after Adam Buddle, who is so often mentioned in Ray's
"Synopsis"; his collection of dried British plants is preserved in the
British Museum). ORD. _LoganiaceA|_. A large genus of stove, greenhouse,
or half-hardy shrubs. Flowers small, often tomentose, axillary,
spicate, capitate, or thyrsoid; calyx equally four-toothed; corolla
tubular-campanulate, regular; limb spreading, four-toothed. Leaves
opposite, reticulately veined. Branches quadrangular.

The species most extensively grown is _B. globosa_, which, among all
our other shrubs, is quite unique; but it is only in the southern or
favoured counties of England where it can be fairly termed hardy. It
is readily propagated by cuttings or by seeds. The latter should be
sown in a gentle heat the spring following the ripening, when they
will vegetate pretty freely. With careful treatment and nurturing in
pots for the first winter, in a frost-proof pit or house, they may
soon be grown into elegant plants. Cuttings of the ripened wood, put
in under bell glasses or hand lights, in a cool but frost-proof pit,
will root slowly during the winter. They will root all the surer and
quicker if each cutting has a heel of older wood attached to that of
the current year's growth. They are best inserted in fine sand or in
very sandy soil, and require but little water until rooted. As soon as
fairly calloused over or rooted, their further progress may be much
advanced by potting them off, and plunging them in a bottom-heat of
60deg. or 65deg. This is by no means an essential to secure success,
but it hastens it, and promotes growth in an extraordinary manner. The
surface temperature should range about the same as the bottom-heat.
Under such treatment, the plants will be quite fit to place out about
the middle of July. A warm, sheltered situation should be chosen, and
a light, rich soil prepared for them; and if dry weather ensues, they
only require water. South or west walls are, without doubt, the best
situations for them. In all cool or unfavourable localities, much may
be done to ensure success by planting on a dry bottom, and on poorish
soil. A loose, free-and-easy style of training suits the plants best.
This enables them to yield a great number of their peculiarly formed,
distinct, and beautiful flowers; whereas, anything like a close, trim
course of pruning or of training reduces the flowers to the lowest
number.

Throughout the southern parts of England, and, indeed, in many places
in the north, _B. globosa_ makes an excellent bush for the shrubbery.
It is only during severe winters that it gets badly cut.

For the other presumably hardy species much the same plan as the
foregoing may be adopted. The greenhouse and stove kinds may have the
same routine of culture usually employed with plants requiring similar
temperatures.

Stove species, except where specified otherwise.

    =B. americana= (American). _fl._ yellow; spikes disposed in a
    terminal panicle, nearly 1ft. long; glomerules nearly globose, size
    of a sloe, on short peduncles. August. _l._ ovate, acuminated,
    narrowed at the base, serrately crenated. _h._ 8ft. to 12ft. Peru,

    produced in long terminal branching spikes, forming a pyramidal
    head about 5in. long. March. _l._ ovate-lanceolate, crenately
    curled; lower ones cordate at the base; superior ones rounded, all
    thick and wrinkled, clothed with soft tomentum on both surfaces.
    _h._ 13ft. Western Himalayas. Half-hardy. (B. M. 4793.)

    =B. Neemda= (Neemda). A synonym of _B. asiatica_.

=BUDS, FLOWER.= These are developed like Leaf-buds, from which they
differ chiefly in containing one or more incipient flowers within the
leaves--the flowers being wrapped up in their own floral-leaves, within
the ordinary leaves, which have their outer covering of scales. If a
Bud be gathered from a Lilac or Horse-chestnut very early in spring,
all the rudiments of the future flowers and leaves will be found within
it, though the Bud itself may not be more than half-an-inch long, and
the flowers not larger than the points of the smallest pins.

=BUDS, LEAF.= These consist of rudimentary leaves, surrounding a
growing vital point, and appear like a collection of scales arranged
symmetrically one above the other. Leaf-buds universally originate in
the horizontal or cellular system, and are formed under the bark at the
extremity of the medullary rays, and at the margin or on the surface
of leaves, whether perfect or rudimentary. Deciduous trees lose their
leaves, but in the axil of each a little Bud previously forms, from
which fresh leaves expand the following spring. In some cases, as in
the Horse-chestnut, the Buds are covered with a gummy exudation. In
Privet-trees, Leaf-buds are generally smaller and more elongated than
Flower-buds.

=BUETTNERIA= (named after David Sigismund Augustus Byttner, once
a Professor of Botany in the University of GA¶ttingen). ORD.
_SterculiaceA|_. Erect or scandent stove or greenhouse shrubs. Flowers
small, usually dark purple; calyx and corolla valvate; umbels simple,
disposed in something like racemes or panicles, rarely in corymbs.
Leaves simple. All are of easy culture in a compost of loam and peat.
_B. dasyphylla_, _hermanniA|-folia_, _microphylla_, and _scabra_, are
occasionally met with, but they are hardly worth growing.

=BUETTNERIEA†.= A section of _SterculiaceA|_.

=BUFF-TIP MOTH= (_PygA|ra bucephala_). This large and beautiful Moth
is very common in many districts; it is easily recognised by the
buff-coloured tips of the fore-wings--whence its common name; the
head, and body between the wings and abdomen, are ochreous. According
to Newman's "British Moths," "the caterpillars, when full grown, are
about an inch and three-quarters long, and sprinkled with silky hairs;
the general colour yellow, with black head, black lines running from
the head to the tail, interrupted by a transverse orange band on each
ring, and a black horny plate above the tail segment." They feed on the
leaves of the Lime, Elm, and Oak, among other trees, and apparently the
only remedy is that generally adopted in exterminating caterpillars,
viz., to shake the branches which are infested, when the pest will be
quickly dislodged, and fall to the ground. Miss Ormerod is of opinion
that "as the caterpillars come down the tree to the ground for their
change to chrysalids, it might be worth while to throw a few spadefuls
of gas-lime, or of anything they would not cross, in a circle at about
a yard from the tree; or a rough band of any material soaked in tar,
or tar and oil, which would keep wet longer, would stop them from
straying off ... and they might be cleared in sufficient numbers so as
to considerably lessen future attack." This plan of prevention deserves
a trial in any place where the destructive caterpillars of these Moths
abound. It is almost a hopeless task to destroy them altogether when
once established on the trees, such specimens as large Oaks being often
almost or wholly denuded of foliage.

=BUGLE.= _See_ =Ajuga=.

=BUGLOSSUM BARRELIERI.= _See_ =Anchusa Barrelieri=.

=BUGWORT.= _See_ =Cimicifuga=.

=BULBIFEROUS.= Bearing bulbs.

=BULBINE= (from _bolbos_, a bulb). ORD. _LiliaceA|_. A genus of rather
pretty hardy, or nearly hardy, herbaceous or bulbous plants, allied
to _Anthericum_. Flowers showy, fragrant; perianth with spreading
segments. Leaves somewhat fleshy, narrow. Stems short. They are all of
easy culture in a compost of sandy loam. The bulbous-rooted species
are increased by offsets, and the herbaceous sorts by suckers and
divisions. The only species which can be grown satisfactorily in
the open air is _B. annua._ All the others should be grown in the
greenhouse, but may be placed in the open during the summer months.

    =B. alooides= (Aloe-like).* _fl._ yellow, disposed in a terminal
    panicle. April. _l._ fleshy, tongue-shaped, lanceolate, flat on
    both sides. _h._ 1ft. Cape of Good Hope, 1732. SYN. _Anthericum
    alooides_. (B. M. 1317.)

    =B. annua= (annual). _fl._ yellow; scape racemose. May, June. _l._
    fleshy, subulate, rounded. _h._ 9in. Cape of Good Hope, 1731. An
    annual species, the seeds of which should be sown in a gentle heat
    during spring, and the seedlings may be transplanted to the open
    when large enough to handle. SYN. _Anthericum annuum_. (B. M. 1451.)

    =B. caulescens= (caulescent).* _fl._ yellow. March. _l._ fleshy,
    rounded. Stem shrubby, erect, branched. _h._ 2ft. Cape of Good
    Hope. 1702. A shrubby species, which should be propagated by
    cuttings, placed under a hand glass. SYN. _B. frutescens_. (B. M.
    816.)

    =B. frutescens= (shrubby). Synonymous with _B. caulescens_.

=BULBOCODIUM= (from _bolbos_, a bulb, and _kodion_, wool; referring to
the woolly covering of the bulbs). ORD. _LiliaceA|_. TRIBE _ColchiceA|_.
A very pretty little bulbous plant, much resembling the _Crocus_,
from which it differs principally in having a superior ovary and
six stamens. It is amongst the earliest of spring-flowering plants,
the flowers preceding the foliage; and, like the majority of bulbs,
delights in rich sandy loam. In such positions, they multiply rapidly
from offsets. It is a good plan to take up the bulbs, divide, and
replant them every second year, selecting in autumn, and renewing the
soil or planting in new positions. Few plants prove more welcome in
the garden, in February, than _B. vernum_, either in beds, patches, or
masses.

    =B. Aitchisoni= (Aitchison's). A synonym of _Merendera Aitchisoni_.

    =B. Eichleri= (Eichler's). A synonym of _Merendera caucasica_.

    =B. trigynum.= A synonym of _Merendera caucasica_.

[Illustration: FIG. 301. BULBOCODIUM VERNUM.]

    =B. vernum= (spring).* _fl._ violet-purple, with a white spot on
    the claw; long, tubular, funnel-shaped, two to three from each
    bulb; preceding the appearance of the leaves. Very early spring.
    _l._ usually three in number, broadly strap-shaped, concave, and
    surrounded at the base by well-developed sheaths. Bulb black,
    oblong. _h._ 4in. to 6in. Spain, 1649. See Fig. 301. There is a
    variety with the leaves striped white, which is also desirable.

=BULBOPHYLLUM= (from _bulbos_, a bulb, and _phyllon_, a leaf; referring
to the leaves issuing from the apex of the pseudo-bulbs). SYNS.
_Anisopetalum_, _Bolbophyllum_, _Tri-brachium_. ORD. _OrchideA|_. Of
this rather large genus of orchids but few are worth cultivating except
as curiosities. Racemes long or spike-like, very rarely one-flowered or
sub-umbellate; sepals usually nearly equal and free; lip jointed to the
foot of the column. They are of easy culture when grown on small blocks
of wood with a little moss, and suspended in a warm part of the house;
the roots require a good supply of water. Propagated by dividing the
pseudo-bulbs.

The following comparative few of the aggregate number of species
already introduced are really all that are worth the cultivator's
attention; what the botanist often regards as being very pretty, &c.,
does not always appear such in the eyes of the grower.

    =B. barbigerum= (bearded).* _fl._, sepals and petals
    greenish-brown; lip covered with dark-coloured hair, and so loosely
    attached at the base as to be moved with the slightest breath.
    Sierra Leone, 1835. A curious dwarf-growing plant, with dark green
    leaves and pseudo-bulbs. (B. R. 1942.)

    =B. Beccarii= (Beccari's). _fl._ light brownish and painted with
    violet; lip brown, with a violet hue, proceeding from a rhizome at
    the base of the leaf (just below the small pseudo-bulb), and at
    once turning downwards; racemes dense, cylindrical, nodding. _l._
    three, 25in. long, 18in, across, very thick. Rhizome 20in. long.
    Brazil, 1879. A remarkable and gigantic climbing species; the odour
    of this plant is intolerably fA"tid and the leaves are larger than
    those of any other known orchid. This species requires plenty of
    heat. (B. M. 6517.)

    =B. Lobbi= (Lobb's).* _fl._ large; sepals and petals yellow, the
    upper part spotted with purple; solitary, on radical scapes.
    Summer. Java, 1845. (B. M. 4532.)

    =B. maculatum= (spotted). _fl._ prettily spotted, _l._ long,
    obtuse, bright green. India.

    =B. reticulatum= (netted-leaved).* _fl._ in pairs, white, striped
    inside with purple; lip spotted with the same colour. _l._ somewhat
    heart-shaped, with the nerves of a deeper green than the rest of
    the leaf, giving it a beautifully reticulated appearance. Brazil,
    1866. Perhaps the handsomest of the genus. (B. M. 5605.)

    =B. saltatorum= (dancing). _fl._ greenish-brown, lasting some time
    in perfection. Winter. _h._ 6in. Sierra Leone, 1835. (B. R. 1970.)

    =B. siamense= (Siamese).* _fl._ pale yellow, striped with purple;
    lip yellow, streaked with purplish lines. A very pretty species,
    closely allied to _B. Lobbi_, but with longer and stouter leaves.
    Pseudo-bulbs ovate. Siam, 1867. Should be grown in a pot of peat
    and sphagnum.

=BULBOSTYLES= (from _bolbos_, a bulb, and _stylos_, the style). ORD.
_CompositA|_. A. small genus of stove evergreen plants, now referred to
_Eupatorium_.

=BULBS.= A Bulb is formed upon or beneath the ground, and is a swollen
stock, consisting, in the first place, of a more or less fleshy disk,
which below gives rise to the roots; secondly, of more or less fleshy
coats, or scales, borne on the disk; thirdly, of a more or less central
shoot, equally borne by the disk, protected by the coats or scales
already mentioned, and formed of rudimentary leaves and flowers. In
some instances, small Bulbs, called Cloves, are formed at the base
of the scales of the original Bulb; these are destined to reproduce
the plant. Shallot and Garlic are good examples. Bulbs are, in fact,
storehouses, husbanding the strength and energy acquired by the plant
during one season, for the exigencies of the next. They are classified
under two sections--Scaly and Tunicated. In the former, the scales
of the Bulb are imbricated, as in the Lily; in the latter, they form
continuous coatings, one within the other, as in the Hyacinth, &c.
In several Lilies, young Bulbs are found growing in the axils of the
leaves, when they are known as Bulbils. Bulbs is also a popular term
given to Dutch Flower Roots, mostly arriving here in the autumn for
spring flowering. Crocus, Colchicum, Cyclamen, Gladiolus, and several
others, are not Bulbs, but Corms. The flowering season varies according
to the different sorts of Bulbs. The majority may be lifted and kept
tolerably dry during the resting period; but they wither and become
exhausted if not replanted at the proper time, thereby causing many
failures. Dutch Bulbs generally arrive in September, and the best
results are obtained from those potted or planted at once, although
some for succession may be kept in reserve up till the beginning of
November. The failure in cultivating imported Liliums and other Bulbs
may be often caused by their long-continued confinement in a dry
atmosphere, whereby their vitality is often almost lost. The roots
of some Bulbs are nearly always, more or less, in action, and these,
especially, should not be kept out of the ground for any length of
time.

=BULLACE.= _See_ =Prunus insititia=.

=BULLACE=, or =MUSCADINE=. _See_ =Vitis vulpina=.

=BULLATE.= Blistered or puckered.

=BULRUSH=, or =CLUB-RUSH=. _See_ =Typha=.

=BUNCHOSIA= (from _bunchos_, the Arabic name for Coffee; in allusion to
the similarity between the seeds of this genus and those of Coffee).
ORD. _MalpighiaceA|_. Ornamental greenhouse evergreen shrubs, nearly
allied to _Malpighia_, but having the racemes of flowers axillary.
Fruit fleshy, indehiscent, externally smooth, and containing two or
three seeds. They thrive best in a compost of loam, peat, leaf soil,
and sand, in about equal proportions. Cuttings of ripened shoots will
root in sand under a bell glass, in moist bottom heat, taking several
weeks to do so. Good drainage is essential, both in striking cuttings
and in the cultivation of the plants.

_UmbelliferA|_. A somewhat extensive genus of quite glabrous shrubs or
herbaceous plants. Flowers yellowish; umbels compound. Leaves mostly
quite entire. But few of this genus are worth growing, and all are of
the easiest culture in common garden soil. Seeds of the annuals may
be sown out of doors in March or April; divisions of the herbaceous
perennials made in autumn or spring; and cutting or divisions of the
greenhouse species, in March or April.

    =B. fruticescens= (shrubby).* _fl._, umbels small, three to

=BUR.= _See_ =Centotheca lappacea=.

=BURBIDGEA= (named after F. W. Burbidge, the discoverer of the genus,
a traveller in Borneo, and author of several horticultural works).
ORD. _ScitamineA|_. A very large, brilliant-flowered stove herbaceous
perennial, allied to _Hedychium_. For culture, _see_ =Alpinia=.

    =B. nitida= (shining).* _fl._, perianth-tube 1in. to 1-1/2in.
    long, slender; outer segments 1-1/2in. to 2in. in diameter,

    Fig. 302, for which we are indebted to Messrs. Veitch and Sons. (B.
    M. 6403.)

=BURCHARDIA= (named after H. Burchard, M.D., a botanical author). ORD.
_LiliaceA|_. An ornamental greenhouse herbaceous perennial, allied to
_Androcymbium_. It thrives best in sandy peat, or peat mixed with a
little loam. Propagated by offsets or divisions, made just previous to
potting, in spring. It is best to repot annually. Good drainage should
be allowed, and the plant must not be potted too firmly.

    =B. umbellata= (umbelled). _fl._ white, green. August. _h._ 2ft.
    New Holland, 1820.

=BURCHCHELLIA= (named after W. Burchell, a botanical traveller in the
Cape of Good Hope, and in Brazil). ORD. _RubiaceA|_. A stove evergreen
shrub from the Cape of Good Hope. Flowers scarlet, disposed in heads
at the tops of the branches, sessile upon a villous receptacle,
intermixed with small distinct bracteoles; and each head is propped
up by the ultimate pair of leaves; corolla of a clavate-funnel-shape.
Leaves ovate, acute, a little cordate at the base, petiolate; stipules
interpetiolar, broad, cuspidate at the apex, deciduous. It grows well
in a rich light soil, or a mixture of turfy loam, turfy peat, and sand.
Cuttings, not too ripe, root readily if planted in sand, and placed
under a hand glass, in a gentle heat.

    =B. bubalina= (buffalo). A synonym of _B. capensis_.

    _l._ ovate, acute, clothed with hispid pubescence; stipules very
    broad, and very short. _h._ 3ft. to 5ft.; 12ft. to 14ft. in a wild
    state. SYN. _B. bubalina_. (B. M. 2339.)

=BURLINGTONIA= (named after the "amiable and accomplished" Countess of
Burlington). ORD. _OrchideA|_. A small genus of epiphytal orchids, all
of which are beautiful and eminently well worth growing. They may be
grown upon small blocks of wood, or in rustic baskets, suspended from
the roof of the plant stove, where, if liberally treated with water,
and a genial moisture in the air during the growing season, very little
else will be required to ensure health and vigour. In the dull days
of winter, they should be watered less frequently, but the plants must
not be allowed to exhibit the slightest signs of distress from drought,
or the consequences may be fatal to their health. When fastening
these plants to blocks of wood, a little sphagnum should be used, for
experience proves that they thrive best when their thin white roots
can escape and hang exposed to the air. If growing them in baskets, it
is preferable first to fasten them securely upon small pieces of bare
cork, then to fill the basket, and finally to cover the whole thinly
with a layer of sphagnum.

[Illustration: FIG. 303. FLOWER-SPIKE, PSEUDO-BULB, AND LEAF OF
BURLINGTONIA DECORA.]

Generally speaking, this genus is not a difficult one to cultivate;
its great enemy is a small white scale, which secretes itself in the
sheathing bases of the leaves. Here it rapidly multiplies, to the great
detriment of the plants; the leaves soon turn yellow at the base, and
drop off; the whole plant looks sickly, and soon dies, or else requires
a very long time and much trouble to achieve its recovery to health.
To prevent this, the bases of the leaves must be carefully looked into
every time the plants are taken down to be dipped in water; and, should
the slightest sign of this pest appear, a thorough washing with soft
soap and tepid water must be given, repeating the operation every day
until all traces of the insect are removed. Red thrip are also apt to
work much mischief with these plants. They take up their abode in the
same way as the white scale, and if not speedily removed or destroyed,
soon make sad havoc. To put a stop to the ravages of this pest, a wash
should be given, as before recommended, and after the soap has been
rinsed out of the base of the leaf, a little tobacco powder should be
sprinkled into the hollows, and allowed to remain for a day or two
before brushing it off. This process will, however, cause a somewhat
dirty appearance, but it will ensure ultimate health and vigour.
Propagated by dividing the plants.

    =B. Batemanni= (Bateman's).* _fl._ white, deliciously-scented; lip
    beautiful mauve. A very pretty South American species, resembling
    _B. candida_.

    =B. candida= (white).* _fl._ snowy-white, with a slight stain of
    yellow on the upper part of the lip, in substance and appearance
    like white satin, trimmed with gold; large, sweet-scented, in
    gracefully drooping three to four-blossomed racemes, produced from
    the axils of the leaves. April and May, lasting about three weeks
    in perfection, and sometimes having a second flowering season.
    _l._ one or two in number, dark green, and firm in texture. _h._
    1ft. Demerara, 1834. A very compact species, well suited for
    basket culture; it should never be allowed to get dry. It may
    be distinguished from other species by having a single row of
    tubercles, forming a ridge upon each side of the slightly hastate
    lip. (B. R. 1927.)

    =B. decora= (comely).* _fl._ white or rose-coloured, spotted
    with red; lip pure white; scapes erect, five to ten-flowered.
    Winter. Brazil, 1852. This species differs entirely from _B.
    candida_, inasmuch as it possesses a long slender-rooting stem,
    from different parts of which arise small oval pseudo-bulbs, each
    bearing a leaf; a lesser leaf appears at the base of a bulb, and
    from the axil of this the scape springs. It is a rather straggling
    but nevertheless beautiful species, and is best grown fastened upon
    long strips of cork, a little sphagnum being used in the operation;
    whilst, to prevent the plant getting too much "away from home,"
    the young growths should be twisted back as they advance, and the
    practice continued until the pseudo-bulb is ultimately left near
    the centre, or in any spot which may appear bare. It likes strong
    heat and a very moist atmosphere, when growing; but during the
    period of rest, it should be kept cool and dry. See Fig. 303. (B.
    M. 4834.)

    =B. d. picta= (painted).* A beautiful variety, differing from the
    type in having shorter and more acute leaves; flowers produced in
    greater profusion, rose-coloured, beautifully mottled and blotched
    with dark purple. October. Brazil. (B. M. 5419.)

    =B. fragrans= (fragrant).* _fl._ very gratefully fragrant, disposed
    in erect racemes. April, remaining in perfection about three weeks.
    _l._ long, rigid, dark green. Habit compact. Brazil, 1850.

    =B. pubescens= (downy). _fl._, sepals and petals snow-white;
    distinguished by the somewhat hastate lip, which has three yellow
    ridges on each side, and also by the downy column. November. _h._
    6in. Brazil, 1850.

    =B. rigida= (rigid).* _fl._ purplish-white, spotted with pink on
    the lip; produced in heads. _h._ 1ft. Brazil, 1838. A handsome
    plant, but difficult to flower. (L. S. O. 36.)

    =B. venusta= (charming).* _fl._ white, slightly tinted with pink;
    produced in heavy pendulous clusters at various seasons of the
    year; lip stained with yellow. _l._ rigid, dark green. Brazil,
    1840. It forms a compact mass, and requires less heat than the
    kinds previously described. It is often confounded with _B.
    pubescens_, from which it may be distinguished by its larger and
    more loosely arranged flowers, by its smooth column, by the lip not
    being hastate in shape, and by the numerous shallow ridges borne
    near the base upon each side. (L. S. O. 2.)

=BUR MARIGOLD.= _See_ =Bidens=.

=BURNET= (_Poterium Sanguisorba_; from _poterion_, a cup; being used
in cooling drinks). ORD. _RosaceA|_. A native perennial. The leaves
are sometimes used in soups, and with Borage in cooling drinks; they
are also put in salads. The foliage only being useful, keep the
flower-spikes removed, as this tends to increase the luxuriance of the
plants. It thrives in any light soil. Propagated by division.

=BURNET SAXIFRAGE.= _See_ =Pimpinella=.

=BURNING BUSH.= _See_ =Euonymus atropurpureus= and =E. americanus=.

=BURN ONION.= _See_ =Potato Onion=.

=BURSARIA= (from _bursa_, a pouch; the capsules very much resemble
those of the Shepherd's Purse). ORD. _PittosporaceA|_. A handsome,
much-branched, greenhouse evergreen shrub, forming a very pretty object
when covered all over with its elegant white blossoms. It thrives
well in a compost of sandy loam and peat, in equal proportions. Young
cuttings will root freely in sand, under a bell glass, with a little
bottom heat.

    =B. spinosa= (thorny).* _fl._ white, small, disposed either in
    lateral or terminal panicles. July to December. _l._ small,
    oblong-cuneated, entire. _h._ 10ft. New Holland, 1793. (B. M. 1767.)

=BURSERA= (named after Joachim Burser, a disciple of Caspar Bauhin).
ORD. _BurseraceA|_. Stove balsam-bearing trees. Flowers polygamous, or
hermaphrodite; calyx small, four to six-toothed; petals four to six,
spreading, generally valvate in A|stivation; stamens eight to twelve;
disk annular, with usually six to ten teeth; drupe oblong, covered by a
three-valved succulent rind, containing three to five nuts. They thrive
in a compost of loam and peat. Propagated by cuttings, placed under a
glass, with bottom heat.

    =B. gummifera= (gum-bearing). _fl._ whitish, hexandrous; racemes
    terminal and axillary. _l._ deciduous, usually impari-pinnate;
    leaflets ovate, acute, membranous. _h._ 60ft. West Indies, 1690.

    =B. serrata= (serrate).* _fl._ whitish, decandrous; panicles
    axillary, shorter than the leaves. _l._ impari-pinnate, with three
    to five pairs of broad-lanceolate, bluntly-acuminated, serrulated
    leaflets; petioles and pedicels pubescent. _h._ 25ft. India, 1818.

=BURSERACEA†.= An order of shrubs or trees, abounding in resinous juice;
with opposite compound leaves, full of pellucid dots, and axillary and
terminal fascicles of flowers. Fruit indehiscent, somewhat drupaceous.
The genera best known are _Amyris_, _Balsamodendron_, _Boswellia_,
_Bursera_, and _Canarium_.

=BURTONIA= (named after D. Burton, a plant collector for Kew Gardens).
ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A genus of handsome greenhouse dwarf Heath-like
shrubs, natives of West Australia. Flowers axillary, often thickly
gathered at the ends of the branches; corollas rich purple; keel
generally of a deeper colour, and the standard having sometimes a
yellow blotch at its base. Leaves simple or trifoliolate, sessile,
usually awl-shaped. They thrive well in a mixture of loam, peat, leaf
soil, and sand, in equal proportions, with thorough drainage; but care
must be taken not to give them too much water, as they require to be
kept moderately dry, and are difficult to preserve in a living state.
Young cuttings root freely in a pot of sandy soil, in a cool house,
with a bell glass placed over them; but some of the species produce
seed in abundance, which are the best means of increasing them.

    =B. conferta= (cluster-flowered).* _fl._ violet. July. _l._ simple,
    very much crowded, six to eight lines long, linear-subulate, with
    revolute margins, and are, as well as the branches, smooth. _h._
    2ft. 1830. (B. R. 1600.)

    =B. minor= (smaller). A synonym of _Gompholobium minus_.

    =B. pulchella= (beautiful). A synonym of _B. scabra_.

of botany). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A genus of very ornamental stove
evergreen unarmed trees. Racemes many-flowered; flowers three together,
on short pedicels, and furnished with two bracteoles each, under the
calyx; corolla deep scarlet; down on the calyces usually black and
velvety. Leaves pinnately-trifoliate; leaflets large, ovate, roundish,
stipellate. For culture, &c., _see_ =Erythrina=.

    =B. superba= (superb).* _l._, leaflets roundish, obtuse, velvety
    beneath. Branches glabrous. Coromandel, 1798. This approaches the
    preceding species, from which it differs mainly by its scandent
    habit, and not by any botanical characters. (B. F. F. 143.)

=BUTOMACEA†.= An order of aquatic plants, now usually included under
_AlismaceA|_.

=BUTOMUS= (from _bous_, an ox, and _temno_, to cut; in reference to the
sharp leaves, which injure the mouths of cattle that browze upon them).
Flowering Rush. ORD. _AlismaceA|_. A very handsome hardy perennial
aquatic, of extremely easy culture on the margins of ponds or muddy
banks. Propagated by divisions of the roots, in spring.

[Illustration: FIG. 304. BUTOMUS UMBELLATUS, showing Habit and single
Flower.]

    =B. umbellatus= (umbelled).* _fl._ rose-coloured, umbellate;
    pedicels with scariose sheathing bracts at the base; scape naked,
    terete, longer than the leaves. Summer. _l._ all radical, 2ft.
    to 3ft. long, linear, acuminate, triquetrous. Ditches and ponds;
    frequent in England, and rare in Ireland. See Fig. 304.

=BUXUS= (from _pyknos_, dense; referring to the hardness of the wood).
Box Tree. ORD. _EuphorbiaceA|_. A genus of hardy evergreen shrubs or
small trees. Flowers unisexual, monA"cious; male flowers, calyx of four
minute segments, stamens four, inserted under the rudiment of a pistil;
female flowers singly, at the tips of groups of male ones. Fruit, a
regma, leathery, beaked with the styles. Leaves simple, opposite,
exstipulate, evergreen. These well-known plants thrive in any light,
well-drained soil. Seeds should be sown in similar situations as
soon as ripe. Cuttings, made of the young shoots, from 4in. to 6in.
in length, inserted in a shady place, in August or September, root
readily. Layers of either young or old wood, made in autumn or early
spring, will make good plants. They can also be increased by suckers
and division.

    =B. balearica= (Balearic).* _l._ yellowish-green,
    oblong-elliptical, emarginate, coriaceous, about 2in. long, with
    a cartilaginous margin. _h._ 15ft. to 20ft. South Europe, 1780.
    This is a handsome species. The cuttings will require a shelter in
    winter, and in exposed situations it will be better to afford the
    plants protection.

    =B. sempervirens= (evergreen).* Common Box. _l._ oval-oblong,
    retuse, convex, coriaceous, shining; stalks slightly hairy.
    _h._ various. England. There are numerous forms of this popular
    shrub: _argentea_, silver-variegated; _aurea_ has its leaves
    variegated with a golden colour; _marginata_ has leaves with a
    golden margin; _myrtifolia_ has small, oblong, narrowish leaves;
    _obcordate-variegata_ is a variegated variety, with obcordate
    leaves, from Japan; _suffruticosa_ is the form usually cultivated
    for edgings, its leaves are small, obovate, this is readily
    increased by divisions, and requires to be planted firmly, in order
    to keep it dwarf.

=BYRSONIMA= (from _byrsa_, a hide, and _nimius_, much used; because
the bark of some of the species is used in tanning, in Brazil). ORD.
_MalpighiaceA|_. Ornamental stove evergreen trees or shrubs. Flowers
racemose, terminal, simple or branched. All the species thrive very
well in any light soil, or a mixture of loam and peat. Cuttings made of
half-ripened shoots will root freely in sand, under a hand glass, in a
moist bottom heat.

    =B. altissima= (tallest).* _fl._ white; racemes clothed with rufous
    hairs. July. _l._ ovate-oblong, covered with rufous down beneath,
    but beset with bristles above, which are fixed by the centre. _h._

    shining. _h._ 8ft. Caribbee Islands, 1759. Described as "a
    beautiful shrub."

    =B. verbascifolia= (Verbascum-leaved). _fl._ yellow; racemes
    terminal. July. _l._ lanceolate-obovate, quite entire, downy on
    both surfaces. _h._ 6ft. Guiana, 1810.

to the throat of the flower being closed up with hairs). ORD.
_LabiatA|_. Greenhouse evergreen sub-shrubs, nearly allied to _Mentha_.
Flowers small, in dichotomous, sub-corymbose, or panicled cymes; or
else disposed in dense spicate whorls. Bracts lanceolate or subulate.

=CABARET.= The French name of _Asarum europA|um_.

=CABBAGE.= The common name for _Brassica_; but especially applied to
the plain-leaved hearting garden varieties of _Brassica oleracea_. To
obtain good tender Cabbages in early spring and throughout the summer,
it is necessary that they should be planted on rich, deeply-trenched
ground, in a position free from the shade of fruit or other trees.
Stable dung or good farmyard manure is best for this crop, and should
be applied when trenching is being done, burying the manure a spit
below the surface. Cabbages should not be planted successionally on
the same ground, nor should they follow any of the other species of
_Brassica_, if it can be avoided. A warmer position, not too much
sheltered to make the plants tender, will be found beneficial for the
earliest spring crop. This should not be planted too soon in autumn, as
the plants are more subject to run to seed, especially if the winter
be mild. The several forms of Cabbage are well known, being so much
cultivated by cottagers as well as gardeners. None of those forming
close hearts will bear severe frost, but the Savoys are improved by a
little in the early autumn. The Coleworts are very useful in winter,
being perhaps the hardiest of all; and, as the hearts do not get so
close and hard as the Savoy and other Cabbages, the frost, unless it is
very severe, does not injure them so much.

_Cultivation._ The crop obtained in April and May is usually the most
important one, young Cabbages being then much appreciated by everyone.
The time for seed-sowing varies in different localities, from the third
week in July to the middle of August. The first date would probably
prove suitable for the northern parts of the country; and the latter
would be early enough for the south. The seed should be sown thinly in
beds of rather light, well pulverised soil, afterwards covering these
with netting, to protect the seed from birds. The plants will be ready,
in most cases, for placing out during September, or as soon as the
ground can be cleared of other crops and prepared for their reception.
The Early Battersea, or one of its many allied sorts, is best for
sowing at this season; and, when planting out, an allowance of 2ft.
apart each way will be sufficient. Seed should again be sown on a mild
hotbed in February, and occasionally afterwards, for succession; and a
second crop may be obtained from the plants put out in autumn if they
are allowed to remain. Drumhead and other strong-growing sorts, sown
in spring, will require from 6in. to 1ft. more space when planted out.
These are not, however, of such good quality as the smaller-growing
varieties.

_Savoys._ The seed of these should be sown in March or April, according
to the locality, in the same way as described above, in seed beds; and
the after treatment is also very similar. The young plants must not
be allowed to starve in the seed bed, but should be kept watered, and
planted out in June and July, choosing dull weather for the operation.
The ground should occasionally be hoed between the plants, to keep
the surface open and destroy weeds. Distances of from 15in. to 30in.
between the plants, according to the variety, must be allowed. See Fig.
305.

[Illustration: FIG. 305. SAVOY CABBAGE.]

_Coleworts._ Seed of these should be sown about the end of June, and
planted out 1ft. apart on a sheltered border, when large enough.
Rosette is one of the best varieties; but the early Cabbages are often
grown and used as Coleworts before they have had time to form close
hearts.

[Illustration: FIG. 306. EARLY YORK CABBAGE.]

_Pickling Cabbage._ The Red Dutch is the variety generally grown for
pickling, and is probably the best to keep its colour when so treated.
Seed should be sown in August, to stand the winter, and again in
February for a succession; only a few plants will, in the majority of
cases, be required, as, if liberally treated, they grow to a good size.

[Illustration: FIG. 307. OXHEART CABBAGE.]

_Sorts of White Cabbage._ These are extremely numerous, and selections
or improved forms are of annual appearance. Some of the old types are,
however, still much cultivated. The following are a selection of the
best sorts for general purposes: Atkins' Matchless, Carter's Heartwell,
Early Battersea, Early York (see Fig. 306), Ellam's Early Dwarf,
Enfield Market, Little Pixie, Oxheart (see Fig. 307), St. John's Day
(see Fig. 308), Sugarloaf, Wheeler's Imperial, and Portugal or Couve
Tronchuda. The last-named variety was introduced from Portugal some
years ago, where it is much grown. It has a large midrib, and does
not form very close hearts. It is very tender when cooked, and is only
suitable for culture in summer. Under the name of Gilbert's Cabbage
Broccoli, or Chou de Burghley, a variety of Cabbage was recently
distributed which produces, if left long enough, hearts resembling
Broccoli. Although there are different opinions as to its merits, it
is said to be very tender when cooked, and is considered a decided
acquisition.

Of Savoys, the best are: Drumhead, Dwarf Green Curled, Early Ulm, Large
Late Green, and Tom Thumb.

[Illustration: FIG. 308. ST. JOHN'S DAY CABBAGE.]

_Insects, &c._ The majority of the Cabbage tribe is attacked by a very
large number of different caterpillars and other pests, both above and
below ground. The plants in their young stages are always a prey for
snails and slugs, and often require a dusting of soot and lime as a
protection. When planting out, many of the plants are often found with
a protuberance at the root, caused by an insect, and termed "clubbing."
Those so injured should be thrown away if they can possibly be spared,
and the others dipped in a thick solution of soot water. This is the
worst kind of disease the Cabbage tribe is subject to. The caterpillars
of several moths and butterflies are very destructive in summer,
often eating through the hearts of Cabbages and Cauliflowers, and so
rendering them totally unfit for use. Hand-picking, or dusting with
lime, is apparently the only means of diminishing the numbers of these
pests.

=CABBAGE CATERPILLARS.= _Large Cabbage White_ (_Pieris brassicA|_).
From May to July, and again in September and October, this, the most
common of our butterflies, may be seen in great numbers, frequenting
gardens, lanes, and fields, being especially numerous where Cabbages
are growing. Their beautiful yellow eggs are laid singly on the under
surface of the leaves, and securely fastened by a natural glue;
from these, in due time, issue the small, but destructive, "green
caterpillars." Shortly after birth, they become quite green in front
and yellow behind. They then get hairy and dotted over with black; they
have eight pairs of feet, of which the three front ones only are "true"
legs, or those which ultimately develop into the legs of the butterfly.
They change their skin several times, and at each moult become larger
in size. When full grown, they are about 1-1/2in. long, of a light
green or bluish hue above, and yellow beneath; along the back of the
adult caterpillar is a conspicuous yellow line, edged on each side with
black dots.

[Illustration: FIG. 309. CATERPILLAR AND CHRYSALIS OF LARGE CABBAGE
BUTTERFLY.]

The chrysalis, or pupa, is commonly found on window-ledges, palings,
walls, and similar places; but is sometimes attached to the plant (see
Fig. 309). It is a rather curious object, of the colour of stone, and
prettily chiselled. It is fastened to the plant by the tail and by a
belt of silk round the middle.

[Illustration: FIG. 310. LARGE WHITE CABBAGE BUTTERFLY.]

[Illustration: FIG. 311. SMALL WHITE CABBAGE BUTTERFLY AND CATERPILLAR.]

The perfect male insect has the body black and wings white on the
upper side, except the tips of the fore-wings, which are black and
crescent-shaped; and on the upper edge of the hinder wings there is a
black spot. On the under side, the fore wings are white with yellow
tips, and two black patches on each; the hind wings are yellow, with
small black markings. The antennA| are alternately black and yellow,
with the club black above and yellow beneath. The female (see Fig. 310)
differs from the male in having two large black spots on each of the
fore or upper wings, and a spot on the inner margin.

_The Small White_ (_Pieris rapA|_, see Fig. 311) has two broods in the
year, the first batch about April, and the second in July. The eggs
are always placed on the upper side of the leaf, and are hatched in
from ten to thirteen days, the caterpillars becoming full grown in
about three weeks after emerging. The colour of the caterpillar is
dark green, with a fine line of yellow, and a row of yellow spots down
the sides. The chrysalis is attached by the tail and a band of silk to
the place selected by the caterpillar, and varies greatly in colour,
although generally it is of a whitish-brown.

_Cabbage Moth_ (_Mamestra brassicA|_). Newman, in his "British Moths,"
thus describes the Cabbage Moth: "The antennA| are rather long and
slender, and scarcely ciliated in either sex; the fore-wings are dark,
smoky, grey brown, mottled and marbled with confused markings, both
darker and paler; the orbicular spot is inconspicuous, but decidedly
to be traced; the reniform stigma is delicately outlined with white or
whitish-grey, and has a pale anterior disc, in which the same pale grey
colour predominates; the hind wings are dark, smoky brown with rather
pale base, and rather darker crescentic discoidal spot and wing-rays;
the head, thorax, and body have the same colour as the fore and hind
wings." The eggs are laid on Cabbages, or similar plants, and are
hatched in a few days. The caterpillars are very voracious, feeding by
day and night, and, what is worse, they spoil with their excrement, in
the case of Cabbages, more than they eat. They are of a dark colour,
with a kind of marbling, more or less distinct, on the back, the effect
being produced by a triangular mark containing two white dots on each
of their segments. On being disturbed, they roll themselves into a
tight ring, and so remain until they suppose that danger is over. They
descend into the earth for change to smooth red-brown chrysalids,
and remain there till the following spring. If the chrysalids were
collected and destroyed during the autumn and winter digging, much
injury would be obviated through the succeeding spring and summer.

The destruction of these pests is a very troublesome matter, as the
grubs of the last-named kind bore into the heart of the cabbage.
Hand-picking is the only sure method. Anything emitting a distasteful
odour will also keep them at bay. Miss Ormerod recommends throwing
gas-lime over the plants, but it must be previously weakened by a few
months' exposure. The following remedy may also be recommended:

_Paraffin_, or _Coal Oil_. Mix one ounce of oil with a gallon of
soapsuds, and water the plants with the mixture before the caterpillars
appear. If any have appeared, an application at the rate of two
ounces to the gallon will generally clear them off. Of course, this
operation must not be performed less than a month previous to cutting
the cabbages, on account of the smell. Soapsuds alone will also clear
caterpillars from most smooth-leaved subjects if frequently applied.

=CABBAGE FLY= (_Anthomyia brassicA|_). Among the injurious insects which
infest Cabbages, none commit greater havoc to both stem and root, than
the maggots of the Cabbage Fly. "They are whitish, cylindrical, and
legless, tapering to the head, and blunt at the tail, which has short
teeth on the lower margin, and two brown tubercles in the middle. When
full grown, they are about 1/3in. long. They then leave the plants, and
turn, in the earth, to pupA|, with a few black spots at the head, and
short teeth at the tail, inside which the flies form, and emerge in
about a fortnight or three weeks. The fly is of an ashen-grey colour,
and smaller than the Onion Fly, which it much resembles. The male is
of a darker grey, and has a short black stripe along the back between
the wings, with a curved one on each side of it, and one black stripe
along the abdomen" (Ormerod). The presence of these maggots may be
easily detected by the flagging and change of colour of the leaves.
The infested plants should be immediately removed and destroyed. The
following remedy will be found beneficial:

_Lime._ Hot lime should be soaked in water for about twenty-four hours.
When clear, the infested Cabbages should be well washed with the
liquid. Superphosphate of lime may also be applied with advantage.

=CABBAGE GALL WEEVIL= (_Ceutorrhynchus sulcicollis_). This is a pretty
little beetle, about three-quarters of a line or one line in length.
Its colour is dark, but the insect is really of a coppery hue; on the
thorax and head are rather large depressions; the wing-cases vary
in colour from green to greenish-blue, or even black, and along the
entire length of the elytra are parallel lines or holes, as may be
seen with the aid of an ordinary lens. This insect, which causes much
damage to plants of the _Brassica_ family, is, in some places, very
difficult to eradicate. It is also very destructive to other crops,
and, therefore, any effectual remedy is valuable. The following methods
may be recommended:

_Carbolic Acid._ Mix 1oz. Calvert's No. 5 carbolic acid with two
gallons of soapsuds, and add sufficient loam or clay to make a thin
paste. Dip the roots of the whole of the plants into this before they
are set out. Well stir the mixture, and put the plants out in a damp
soil, so that watering will not be necessary.

_Paraffin_, or _Coal Oil_. This, applied in the same manner as
recommended for Carbolic Acid, is also very good.

_Guano, Superphosphate of Lime, and Nitrate of Soda._ A good dressing
of either of these, given after the ground is dug, and in wet weather,
about a month before the plants are put out, has been found very
beneficial; but, although preventatives, they do not totally clear the
crop from insects for the season.

_Soot and Lime._ Take equal parts of air-slaked lime and soot, and mix
together. Set the plants with a trowel, and, having placed some soil
over the roots, throw in a little of the mixture, filling up the hole
with soil.

=CABBAGE MOTH.= _See_ =Cabbage Caterpillars=.

=CABBAGE PALM.= _See_ =Euterpe oleracea=.

=CABBAGE POWDERED-WING= (_Aleyrodes brassicA|_). A small four-winged
powdery fly, closely allied to the Aphides. As implied by its
name, this pest infests the various sorts of Cabbages. It is more
particularly prevalent in autumn. Its presence may be readily detected
by the partial discoloration of the leaves attacked. The head and
body between the wings are black, with yellow variegation; abdomen
yellow or rosy; wings white and mealy (whence its common name), the
upper pair each having a darker spot, near the centre. Its destructive
power resides in the rostrum, or sucking-tube, with which its head is
furnished.

_Remedies._ The only effectual means of exterminating this pest is to
destroy the leaves, preferably by burning. If its presence is detected
early, an application of tobacco water, or diluted soft soap, may prove
beneficial.

=CABOMBA= (the native name in Guiana). ORD. _NymphA|aceA|_. SUB. ORD.
_CabombeA|_. Small and very interesting aquatics. They thrive well in a
cistern 1ft. deep, with 2in. of loam in the bottom, for the plants to
root in, then filled up with water, and placed in a warm part of the
greenhouse during summer, being allowed a rest in a cool part of the
stove in winter. Propagation may be effected by root division.

    =C. aquatica= (water-loving). _fl._ yellow, small; peduncles long,

    =C. caroliniana= (Carolina) is somewhat similar to _C. aquatica_.
    It is a native of the Southern United States.

=CACALIA= (from _kakalia_, a name used by Dioscorides). ORD.

as distinct from _Senecio_, of which genus, from a botanical point
of view, it is but a section. Heads five to many-flowered; florets
all tubular and perfect; scales of the involucre in a single row;

    stove climber.

=CACTEA†.= A large order of succulent plants, with remarkable spines
clustered on the cylindrical, angular, two-edged, or leafy stems.
Flowers very variable, showy or minute, usually solitary, sessile,
rarely in fascicles, ephemeral; petals disposed in two or more series,
hardly distinguishable from the inner sepals, and sometimes united with
them; sepals numerous, united and adnate a great length to the ovarium.
Fruit fleshy, one-celled, many-seeded. Well-known genera are _Cereus_,
_Melocactus_, _Mammillaria_, _Opuntia_, _Pereskia_, and _Rhipsalis_.

=CACTUS= (from _kaktos_, a name used by Theophrastus to describe a
spiny plant). This generic term is popularly applied to all members
of the extensive family _CacteA|_, which order may be distinguished by
the following characteristics: Calyx composed of many sepals, usually
indefinite in number, the inner series not readily distinguishable from
the petals, united and adnate a great length to the ovary; with the
tube smooth in the genera _Mammillaria_, _Melocactus_, and _Rhipsalis_;
or with the lobes of the sepals crowning the fruit, and having the
tube scaly, as in the genera _Cereus_, _Opuntia_, and _Pereskia_.
Petals disposed in two or more series, hardly distinguishable from the
inner sepals, and somewhat united to them; sometimes irregular, and
disposed in a long tube at the base, but distinct at the apex, as in
the genera _Mammillaria_, _Melocactus_, and _Cereus_; sometimes equal
and distinct to the very base, forming a rotate corolla, as in the
genera _Opuntia_, _Pereskia_, and _Rhipsalis_. Stamens indefinite,
disposed in many series, more or less cohering with the petals or
inner sepals; filaments slender, filiform; anthers ovate, versatile,
two-celled. Ovarium obovate, fleshy, one-celled. Fruit fleshy,
one-celled, many seeded, either smooth and crowned by the calyx, or
covered with scales, scars, or tubercles, and umbilicate at the apex.
This order contains fleshy or succulent shrubs, very variable in habit
and size. Flowers very variable, showy, or minute, usually solitary,
sessile, rarely in fascicles, ephemeral, expanding by night or day.
Leaves usually wanting, but, when present, small, caducous, and
terete, rarely flat and expanded, sometimes alternate and disposed
in a spiral order, always glabrous and fleshy. Prickles or bristles
disposed in fascicles, rising from the axils of the leaves. In the
leafless genera, the fascicles of spines are disposed on the angles
of the stem, rising from tubercles. Stems usually angular, winged,
or regularly beset with tubercles, rarely terete, usually jointed;
joints compressed. A group of Cacti is shown at Fig. 312, for which we
are indebted to Herr Fr. Ad. Haage, jun., of Erfurt, Germany. _See_
=Cereus=, =Disocactus=, =Echinocactus=, =Epiphyllum=, =Leuchtenbergia=,
=Mammillaria=, =Melocactus=, =Nopalea=, =Opuntia=, =Pelecyphora=,
=Pereskia=, =Phyllocactus=, and =Rhipsalis=.

_Cultivation._ Perhaps no class of plants more easily accommodate
themselves to a general system of treatment, than do these; although
certain genera would undoubtedly thrive better than when subjected to
the lower temperature, suited to the requirements of those coming from
cooler regions. Notwithstanding that nearly all the species are natives
of the western hemisphere, they occur in various geographical and
altitudinal areas, in which the temperature is proportionately lessened
or increased, as the case may be; yet, presuming a special house is set
apart for their culture, the majority of the species may be happily
suited therein. The warmest end of the structure should be selected for
the tropical kinds; while those found in cooler regions may be grown
in the other portions of the house; even those which are hardy in our
climate are really best wintered in a house or frame. Granted that
several species will endure our winter outside, it is yet necessary to
give them the shelter of a friendly ledge of the rockery, or frame, or
to cover them in their permanent position with a hand light, or sheet
of glass, in order to prevent the ill-effects of excessive moisture.
Generally, a winter temperature of from 50deg. to 55deg., and a summer
one of from 70deg. to 80deg. during shade, or in sunshine up to 90deg.,
will be found advantageous. When thus treated, it will be necessary to
keep the tropical species, on the whole, very dry during the winter. As
regards soil, potting, and general treatment, all may be treated alike,
except _Epiphyllum_, _Disocactus_, and _Pereskia_ (which _see_). Some
growers give them the protection of a house in winter, and stand them
outside during the summer, which is not, however, a very commendable
plan, as, in consequence of the very variable character of our climate
being especially prejudicial to several of the tender and more delicate
species, the often excessive amount of moisture they would receive,
will produce a weakly state of health in many, while others will be
lost. It is far better if their culture is attempted at all, to give
them the proper treatment. The numerous species and varieties found
on the Rocky Mountains are a most interesting series, and may be well
managed in a cold frame facing south, arranging them on shelves as
close to the glass as possible, and keeping them very dry through the
winter. If the weather is very severe, the lights should be matted. One
of the best collections of these in the country, is in the possession
of E. G. Loder, Esq., Floore House, Weedon, Northampton, where a great
number are admirably grown in frames, and under a large ledge of the
rockery outside. Amateurs may grow quantities of handsome Cacti either
in dwelling rooms near the window, or in small frames or greenhouses.
As they are slow growing, not much space will be occupied; at the
same time, a great deal of interest will be centred in their culture.
As regards watering and insect pests, they are but little trouble.
Miniature Cacti, of numerous kinds, are now often sold in small pots,
and most attractive little subjects they prove.

FIG. 312. GROUP OF CACTI.]

_Soil, Drainage, and Potting._ Good ordinary fibrous loam should form
about one-half of the compost, the other half should be made up of
sand, broken bricks, and lime rubbish in equal quantities; the whole
to be carefully mixed together, and not used until it is moderately
dry. It is absolutely necessary to ensure perfect drainage; a good
"stopper" should, therefore, be placed over the hole at the bottom
of the pot, and about one-third of its depth filled with draining
material. The best time for potting is during February and March. Turn
out the plants, and remove nearly all the old soil from the roots,
taking away any dead or decaying roots which may be observable. Place
some of the roughest soil next the crocks, and gradually fill the pots
with the finer material, well working the same amongst the roots;
finally press the soil moderately firm. Do not water for a few days
after potting, but syringe every evening, especially if the weather be
fine; a little extra heat may be given after potting, to excite new,
healthy growth. It will not be necessary every year to repot specimens
in large vessels. A good top-dressing, with an occasional dose of weak
liquid manure, is all they will require for several seasons.

_Watering._ This must be discriminately managed, especially during the
winter; for, whatever their treatment as regards temperature during
that season, they must be studiously watered, and anything like a
saturated condition of the soil should be avoided. If the temperature
is brisk, a little water may be given once a week, or perhaps not quite
so often. If the plants are subjected to very cool treatment, water
must be sparingly administered during November, December, and January;
after which, they should be examined weekly, and very carefully
attended to. During the summer months, when in active growth, they
will not suffer if watered twice a week; and, on bright afternoons,
light syringings may be advantageously given.

_Propagation._ Three methods are adopted, viz., by cuttings or offsets,
grafting, and seeds; the former is the plan generally adopted. The
cuttings or offsets should be removed with a sharp cut, and laid upon a
sunny shelf until the wound is healed and roots are emitted, when they
should be potted in sandy soil, and placed with the others. They will
thrive freely if kept syringed. Grafting is resorted to with delicate
kinds, which, from some reason or another, will not grow freely except
upon the stock of a stronger species; and, by this means also, such
delicate kinds can be kept from the damp soil, which frequently causes
incipient decay. The stocks usually employed are those of _Cereus
tortuosus_, _C. peruvianus_, &c., according to the species intended for
working; they readily unite with each other. If the scion and stock are
both slender, wedge-grafting should be adopted; if both are broad, it
is best to make horizontal sections, placing them together and securing
in proper position by tying with matting, but not too tightly, or the
surface may be injured. Propagation by seeds is not often adopted, as
it is a very slow method; they should be sown in very sandy soil, and
placed in a semi-shady position until germination commences, when they
may be exposed, and very carefully watered.

=CALADENIA= (from _kalos_, beautiful, and _aden_, a gland; in reference
to the disk of the labellum being finely beset with glands). ORD.
_OrchideA|_. A genus of pretty greenhouse terrestrial orchids from
New Zealand and Australia. They should be kept in a cool frame or
greenhouse, and carefully watered, when not in a growing state. A
compost of peat, loam, and sand, in equal parts, suits them well.
Over thirty species are enumerated, but probably none are seen out of
botanic gardens.

=CALADIUM= (derivation of name doubtful; probably of Indian origin).
ORD. _AroideA|_. Stove perennials, chiefly grown for the great beauty
and varied hue of their leaves. Spathe hood-like, rolled round at
the base; spadix, upper portion entirely covered with stamens, but
ultimately becoming bare at the extreme top, provided with blunt
glands or sterile stamens in the middle, and ovaries beneath; anthers
shield-shaped and one-celled; ovaries numerous, two-celled, with from
two to four ascending ovules in each cell. Leaves upon long petioles,
more or less sagittate, ovate, and usually very richly coloured.
Fruit a one or two-celled berry, with few seeds. They are all of easy
culture, and grow freely in a humid atmosphere. In March, when the
tubers have been kept dry or rested for some time, they may be started
into growth again, in small pots, placed in a stove or pit, where a
night temperature of from 60deg. to 65deg. is maintained, and syringed
daily once or twice at least. As soon as indications of activity are
presented, they may be shifted into 4in., 5in., or 6in. pots, or
larger ones may be used if good sized specimens are required. If the
tubers should be in large pots, it is best to turn them out, dividing
if necessary, and placing all the crowns in small pots, from which
they can be removed when root action and growth are resumed, and they
require more room. Large tubers, if sound, may be divided, and the
pieces placed in pots of such sizes as it is desired to grow them in.

_Soil._ Turfy loam, leaf mould, turfy peat, and a little well
decomposed manure, in equal parts (not broken up too fine), with a
good sprinkling of sharp sand, form an excellent compost, the whole
being well incorporated together. Thorough drainage must be insured,
as these plants require an abundance of water. After potting, they
should be placed in a stove temperature, and kept well moistened by
syringing two or three times daily. If accommodated with mild bottom
heat at this time, they will make much freer and more vigorous growth
than if otherwise treated. Water sparingly at first, but as soon as
the leaves expand, increase the supply; and, when the pots are well
filled with roots, apply clear liquid manure at every other time of
watering. As the season advances, the temperature and humidity of the
house should be increased. During bright sunshine, Caladiums should be
slightly shaded for a few hours in the middle of the day, with some
thin material, just to break the fierceness of the sun's rays; but the
more they are exposed to the light at other times during growth, the
brighter, richer, and more beautiful will the foliage be. As soon as
the plants have attained a good size, some of them should be placed in
the coolest part of the house, and partially hardened off; they may
then be taken to the conservatory, allowing them a situation free from
currents of cold air, and giving water only when really necessary. They
may remain here for some time, but care must be taken to return them to
the stove before they suffer from cold.

Small neatly grown specimens make beautiful ornaments for table
decoration, and their suitability for exhibition purposes is well
known, and largely taken advantage of. Towards autumn, and as the
foliage begins to fade, the supply of water should be gradually
lessened, until all the leaves die down; the pots should then be placed
under the stage in the stove, where they can be looked to now and then,
and a little water given if required. By no means allow the tubers to
get dried up, as is often done; for, if so, they will frequently rot
away inside; whereas, kept in a semi-moist condition, even the most
delicate can be preserved. In this state, they may remain until the
following season. Caladiums will not endure a very low temperature;
from 55deg. to 60deg. is as low as they can be safely kept. Very few of
those known as "true species" are grown, being superseded, for general
decorative purposes, by the numerous hybrids which have been raised of
late, principally from _C. bicolor_.

Habit.]

=CALANDRINIA= (in honour of L. Calandrini, an Italian botanist, who
lived in the beginning of the eighteenth century). ORD. _PortulaceA|_. A
rather large genus of fleshy, glabrous, annual or perennial, herbaceous
plants, some fourteen or fifteen species growing in Australia, the rest
occurring in the New World. Flowers usually rose or purple, solitary,
or in terminal umbels or racemes. Leaves quite entire, radical or
alternate. Only four or five species are cultivated in this country;
these are treated as half-hardy annuals--with the exception of _C.
umbellata_, which is best treated as a biennial--and as such they are
extensively grown in small gardens, with most satisfactory results.
They should be sown in the spots where they are intended to flower, as
transplantation, unless performed with more than ordinary care, will
considerably check their growth or result in loss. Their flowers only
expand during bright sunshine, and, consequently, they are less grown
than they otherwise would be. The plants thrive in a light sandy soil.
_C. umbellata_ may be sown in a pan, placed in a cold frame, in May or
June; and when the plants are large enough to handle, they should be
potted off, or placed out in colonies where they are to bloom.

    =C. discolor= (two-coloured). _fl._ bright rose, with a yellow
    tuft of stamens in the centre, 1-1/2in. across; raceme long. July,
    August. _l._ fleshy, obovate, attenuated at the base, pale green
    above, purple beneath. _h._ 1ft. to 1-1/2ft. Chili, 1834. (B. M.
    3357.)

    =C. grandiflora= (large.flowered).* _fl._ rosy, about 2in. across;
    calyx spotted; raceme simple, loose. Summer. _l._ fleshy, rhomboid,
    acute, petiolate. Stem suffruticose. _h._ 1ft. Chili, 1826. (B. R.
    1194.)

    =C. Menziesii= (Menzies').* FL. deep purple-crimson, from 1/2in. to
    1in. across, terminal and axillary, solitary. June to September.
    _l._ elongated, spathulate, much attenuated at the base. Stems much
    branched, prostrate. California, 1831. SYN. _C. speciosa_. See Fig.
    315. (B. R. 1598.)

    =C. nitida= (shining). _fl._ rose-coloured, about 2in. across;
    raceme leafy, many-flowered. Summer. _l._ oblong-spathulate,
    sub-acute, glabrous, attenuated at the base, 1in. to 2in. in
    length. _h._ 6in. Chili, 1837. A very pretty hardy annual, forming
    a tuft from 4in. to 6in. across.

    =C. speciosa= (showy). A synonym of _C. Menziesii_.

[Illustration: FIG. 316. CALANDRINIA UMBELLATA, showing Flower and
Habit.]

    =C. umbellata= (umbellate).* _fl._ of a dazzling magenta-crimson,
    about as large as a sixpence; corymb cymose, terminal,
    many-flowered. Summer. _l._ radical, linear, acute, pilose. _h._
    6in. Peru, 1826. A very charming half-hardy biennial. See Fig. 316.
    (P. M. B. 12, 271.)

Other species occasionally met with are: _compressa_, _micrantha_, and
_procumbens_; they are, however, inferior to those described above.

=CALANTHE= (from _kalos_, beautiful, and _anthos_, a flower). ORD.
_OrchideA|_. SEC. _VandA|_. A very handsome genus of stove terrestrial
orchids. They may be characterised as robust-growing plants, producing
large, broad, many-ribbed, or plaited leaves, which are, with one or
two exceptions, evergreen, and long spikes, bearing many flowers,
distinguished by their calcarate lip, which is attached to the column,
and by the eight thick, waxy pollen masses adhering to a separate
gland. Calanthes should be special favourites with amateurs, as, in the
first place, they produce an abundance of showy flowers, which last
a long time in perfection; and, secondly, because they are so easily
managed. In potting these plants, it will be necessary to depart from
the usual style of potting orchids, and, instead of elevating them
above the rim of the pot upon a cone of peat and sphagnum, they must
be kept below the rim, as in potting ordinary plants. In place of the
usual soil and moss, these plants should have a mixture of loam, leaf
mould, and peat, broken up rough, to which may be added some silver
sand and dried cow manure. During the growing season, they require
abundant supply of water, and in winter even this element must be
administered freely to the evergreen kinds; whilst the deciduous ones,
on the contrary, enjoy a thorough rest after blooming. Good drainage
is essential to all. Little more need be said upon the cultivation of
Calanthes during the summer months. When growing, they enjoy strong
heat and plenty of moisture; but, when growth is complete, a cooler
situation is most beneficial. They are subject to the attacks of
various insects, which must be continually searched for, and, when
found, destroyed; for, if neglected in this particular, the bold
and handsome leaves will be much disfigured, and rendered far from
ornamental. Propagated by suckers and divisions. About forty species
are known, of which the following are a selection:

    =C. curculigoides= (Curculigo-like). _fl._ beautiful orange-yellow,
    disposed in an erect spike. Summer and autumn. _l._ large,
    evergreen, plaited. _h._ 2ft. Malacca, 1844. (B. R. 33, 8.)

    =C. Dominyi= (Dominy's).* _fl._, sepals and petals lilac; lip deep
    purple. This fine hybrid is a cross between _C. Masuca_ and _C.
    veratrifolia_. (B. M. 5042.)

    =C. furcata= (forked). _fl._ creamy white, very freely produced;
    spikes erect, 3ft. long. June to August. Luzon Isles, 1836. An
    excellent exhibition plant.

    with an intense violet-purple lip; numerously produced on spikes
    2ft. long. June to August. India, 1838. (B. M. 4541). The variety
    _grandiflora_ differs from the type in its greater size both of
    spike and individual flower; the gigantic spikes are from 3ft. to
    4ft. high, and continue blooming for three months.

    =C. Petri= (Peter Veitch's).* _fl._ whitish-yellow. Said to be very
    like _C. veratrifolia_, but bearing leaves a little narrower, and a
    system of five curious sulcate yellowish calli on the base of the
    lip, without the single lamella and teeth which are proper to that
    species. Polynesia, 1880.

    rosy-pink; middle lobe short, wedge-shaped, and emarginate.
    Pseudo-bulbs jointed, Cochin China. _fausta_ is a fine variety,
    with the base of the tip and column a warm crimson.

    =C. Sieboldii= (Siebold's).* _fl._ yellow, large; spikes erect.
    _l._ broad, dark green, plaited. _h._ 1ft. Japan, 1837. An elegant
    evergreen dwarf-growing species. (R. H. 1855, 20.)

    =C. Textori= (Textor's). _fl._ cream-white, washed with violet on
    the petals and column, as well as on the base of lip, where the
    calli are brick-red, changing later on to ochre-colour, excepting
    the white-lilac base of sepals and petals and the column; lip very
    narrow. Japan, 1877.

[Illustration: FIG. 317. SINGLE FLOWER OF CALANTHE VEITCHII.]

    =C. Veitchii= (Veitch's).* _fl._ rich bright rose, with a white
    throat; spikes often attaining a height of 3ft., and bearing an
    immense quantity of flowers. Winter. _l._ large, plaited, light

    =C. vestita= (clothed).* _fl._, sepals and petals pure white,
    numerously produced in a many-flowered, nodding spike. _l._
    deciduous. Pseudo-bulbs large, whitish, _h._ 2-1/2ft. Burmah. (B.
    M. 4671.) The varieties of this species are very numerous.

    any colour on the lip. Java, 1868.

    =C. v. rubro-oculata= (red-eyed).* _fl._ delicate white, with a
    blotch of rich crimson in the centre; upwards of 2in. across;
    spikes long, drooping, having a white downy covering, and rising
    from the base of the silvery-green pseudo-bulbs, when the latter
    are without leaves. October to February.

    =C. v. Turneri= (Turner's).* _fl._ pure white, with rose-coloured
    eye, larger, and produced on longer flower-spikes than the other
    kinds; form of flowers more compact. Java. This is considered by
    some authorities, to be a distinct species.

=CALATHEA= (from _kalathos_, a basket; in reference to the
basket-shaped stigma, or to the leaves being worked into baskets in
South America). ORD. _ScitamineA|_. This genus of very ornamental-leaved
stove plants is distinguished from _Maranta_ by mere botanical
characters; and the two genera are often confounded. Flowers in
terminal spikes, bracteate; perianth six-cleft, outer segments
lanceolate, inner ones blunt and irregular; stamens three, petal-like.
Leaves large, springing from the contracted stem, near the root. They
delight in a rich, loose, open soil, consisting of peat, loam, and
leaf soil, in about equal proportions, with the addition of a good
sprinkling of sand, to keep it open and porous. The mixture should be
used in a rough, lumpy state, so that the roots, which are of large
size, may be able to travel with freedom. Nearly all the species admit
of easy increase by division. July is a favourable time to set about
it, or it may be carried out any time between that and the spring
months. In order to make the necessary separation without damaging the
roots, the plants should be shaken out from the soil, when they may
be divided into as many pieces as there are separate crowns. Whether
an increased stock be desired or not, Calatheas require fresh soil
annually; and, if not reduced by division, they become much too thickly
foliaged to properly develop, unless they are shifted into larger-sized
pots, which can always be done if large specimens are required. When
making divisions, see that each crown is well furnished with roots, so
that they may at once commence sending up fresh young foliage. Although
Calatheas require an abundant supply of water while growing, a stagnant
moisture is most injurious; good drainage is, therefore, essential.
To have the leaves in fine, healthy condition, plenty of atmospheric
moisture must be maintained during their growth; and, if syringing
is resorted to for the purpose of securing this, clear soft water
should be used, or an unsightly deposit will be the result, by which
the beauty of the plants, unless they are frequently sponged, will
be spoiled. These plants require, in addition to plenty of moisture,
moderate shade during the summer, as they dislike strong sunshine, and
may, therefore, be grown among ferns, under creepers, in situations
that would be of little use for other purposes. Calatheas are not
subject to insects if properly supplied with water while growing, and
a sufficiently moist atmosphere is at all times maintained; but, if
either of these are lacking, red spider soon put in an appearance, and
quickly disfigure the leaves.

=CALATHIAN VIOLET.= _See_ =Gentiana Pneumonanthe=.

=CALCARATE.= Spurred, or having a spur.

=CALCEOLARIA= (from _calceolus_, a little slipper, in allusion to the
form of the corolla; the form _calceolarius_, shoemaker, probably
chosen to include a reference to F. Calceolari, an Italian botanist
of the sixteenth century). Slipperwort. ORD. _ScrophularineA|_. A
genus of hardy or half-hardy shrubs, sub-shrubs or herbs. Peduncles
one or many-flowered, axillary or terminal, corymbose; corolla with a
very short tube; limb bilabiate; upper lip short, truncately rounded,
entire; lower lip large, concave, slipper-shaped. Leaves opposite,
sometimes three in a whorl, rarely alternate.

SHRUBBY SECTION. In addition to the widely-known utility of this class
for bedding purposes, they are fine decorative plants when well grown,
and useful alike in conservatory or dwelling house. It will be found
more convenient to grow these in a pit or frame, as in such places they
are less liable to the attacks of fly, and make sturdier growth. If
large plants are required, cuttings should be taken in August, placed
in a cold frame facing the north, in sandy soil, and, when rooted,
potted off into 3in. pots. They should then be placed in a light sunny
frame, where they may remain until the middle of February. The points
should then be pinched out. When the plants break, they must be shifted
into 48-sized pots. If there are from four to six breaks to each
plant, it will be sufficient; but, should such not be the case, the
plants must be stopped again, when the requisite number will probably
be obtained. Directly the roots touch the pots, the plants should be
transferred to 7in. or 8in. pots, in which they will flower, and the
shoots must be tied out so as to develop fully. Every effort should
be exerted to keep the foliage green to the base of the plants, and
they should be fumigated on the first appearance of green fly. As the
flower-spikes are thrown up, weak liquid manure, applied two or three
times a week, will prove beneficial. For potting, the following compost
is most suitable: One-half good fibrous loam, one-eighth thoroughly
rotted manure, and the remainder leaf soil, with enough sharp sand
to keep the whole open. During frosty weather, of course, it will be
necessary to protect the frames with mats, and to water judiciously, to
avoid damping. Those plants intended for bedding will not require to
be repotted, but should be inserted, about 3in. apart, in sandy soil,
in a cold frame. The tops must be taken off early in March; and from
the middle of April to the middle of May, they may be planted out where
they are to remain. Should frosty weather, accompanied by drying winds,
ensue, the plants will require the protection of inverted flower-pots,
with pieces of slate or crock placed over the holes. A good soil,
abundantly enriched with rotten manure, is most desirable for them.

[Illustration: FIG. 321. HERBACEOUS CALCEOLARIA.]

_Varieties._ These are very numerous. The best of them are the
following: BIJOU, dark red, very free; GAINE'S YELLOW, rich deep
yellow, extremely free; GENERAL HAVELOCK, crimson-scarlet, very fine;
GOLDEN GEM, bright yellow, perhaps the best; SPARKLER, crimson-gold,
dwarf; VICTORIA, dark maroon, very attractive.

HERBACEOUS SECTION. These, like the preceding, are very useful, both
for house and conservatory decoration (see Fig. 321). A packet of
seed from a first-class firm will, if properly managed, produce a
good percentage of excellent flowers. The seed may be sown from June
to August, when large batches are required (when only one sowing is
made, July will be the best month), on pans of light, sandy soil,
which should be soaked with water before sowing. Care must be taken
to make the surface of the soil level, and also to sow the seed as
evenly as possible. It is better not to cover with soil, but a sheet
of glass should be laid over the pan, which must be placed in a shady
part of the greenhouse or cold frame until the young plants show the
first leaf. The glass can then be gradually removed. When large enough
to handle, the seedlings must be pricked out, about 2in. asunder, in
pans or boxes, and placed in a close, shaded situation. As soon as of
sufficient size, they must be placed singly in 3in. pots, returned
to the frame, kept close for a few days, and as near the glass as
possible, to make them sturdy. When necessary, they should be shifted
into 5in. pots, in which they may be kept through the winter; or the
later batches may be placed in small pots. By the end of October or
early in November, the plants will be strong and fit for wintering;
at this stage, the best place for them is in a dry, frost-proof pit,
or on an airy shelf of the greenhouse, giving them sufficient water
to prevent flagging. All dead leaves must be removed. On the first
appearance of green fly, the plants should be fumigated with tobacco.
From the end of January onwards, in order to encourage growth, the
plants should be removed into 7in. or 8in. pots, giving plenty of
drainage, and a compost consisting of one-half good light fibrous loam,
one-fourth thoroughly decayed sheep manure, and one-fourth leaf soil,
to which must be added sufficient coarse sand to keep the whole open.
After potting, the plants must be again placed in the same position,
and, as they require it, plenty of room given. Careful attention to
watering is necessary, as they must not be allowed to get dry. Air
must be given on all suitable occasions. The flower-stems, as they
require it, should be supported with small neat sticks. About May, the
plants will commence to bloom, and continue to do so for a couple of
months. The best flowers should be selected, and cross-fertilised with
a camel-hair pencil, in order to produce a good strain of seed for
future sowing. The attention of horticulturists appears to be almost
wholly confined to the innumerable hybrids raised from _amplexicaulis_,
_arachnoidea_, _corymbosa_, _integrifolia_, _purpurea_, _thyrsiflora_,
and a few others. Very few pure species are seen in cultivation,
although most of them are well worth growing.

allied to _PetrA|a_. Flowers inconspicuous, disposed in axillary cymes;
corolla-tube short, with the limb four-lobed. Fruit a very ornamental
small juicy berry or drupe. The following mode of culture has been
recommended: "After the old plants have been cut back in the spring,
and started into growth, the young shoots will strike as readily as a
Fuchsia, and with exactly the same treatment. In order to make good
plants, short-jointed cuttings should be selected; and, as soon as
these are struck, they should be potted into 2-1/2in. pots, using a
compost of equal parts loam and peat, with a little charcoal and river
sand. When they commence to grow, after being potted, remove to a pit
or house with a temperature ranging from 60deg. to 75deg. Pinch out
the tops of the plants as soon as they have three pairs of leaves, and
whenever each of the laterals has made two pairs of leaves, pinch out
their points, and continue this operation with all the rest of the
shoots till the beginning of August, at the same time keeping off all
the flower-buds. The next shift will be into 4in. or 5in. pots. They
should always have plenty of light and air, but more especially after
they come into flower."

alluding to the handsome flowers). ORD. _AmaryllidaceA|_. Ornamental
greenhouse bulbs; requiring shade, and a compost of rich sandy loam and
leaf mould, with good drainage. Propagated by seeds and offsets. They
should have plenty of water when growing, and, during the winter, be
kept moderately dry, but not dried off, so as to cause them to shrivel.

=CALLIPTERIS= (from _kallos_, beauty, and _pteris_, a fern). ORD.
_Filices_. A genus of stove ferns, founded upon the sub-genus
_Diplazium_, which is now included under _Asplenium_.

=CALLIRHOE= (of mythological origin, from Callirhoe, a daughter of
the river-god Achelous). Poppy-Mallow. Allied to _Malva_. Species
belonging to this genus have been erroneously referred to _Malva_
and _Nuttallia_. ORD. _MalvaceA|_. A genus of elegant annual or
perennial herbs, natives of North America. They are of extremely
easy cultivation, thriving in a compost of light, rich, sandy loam.
Propagation of the perennial species may be effected by means of both
seeds and cuttings; of the annuals, by seeds only. Seeds should be sown
in spring, either outside, or in pans in a cold frame. Young cuttings
should be taken and dibbled in sandy soil in a frame.

    =C. digitata= (fingered).* _fl._ reddish-purple; peduncles

=CALLISTACHYS.= _See_ =Oxylobium=.

=CALLISTEMMA.= _See_ =Callistephus=.

=CALLISTEMON= (from _kallos_, beauty, and _stemon_, a stamen; in most
of the species, the stamens are of a beautiful scarlet colour). ORD.
_MyrtaceA|_. Handsome greenhouse evergreen shrubs or trees, having
the inflorescence rising from the old branches in crowded spikes,
as in the species of _Melaleuca_, but with the stamens free, as in
_Metrosideros_. Leaves elongated, stiff, alternate, usually lanceolate.
All the species of this genus are very ornamental and neat in habit.
They are well adapted for a conservatory. The soil best suited for them
is a mixture of loam, peat, and sand. Ripened cuttings strike root
in sand, under a hand glass; seeds are frequently produced on large
plants, and these may also be used to increase the stock, but they do
not produce flowering plants for a considerable time; whereas plants
raised from cuttings, taken from flowering plants, come into flower
when small.

    =C. linearis= (linear-leaved).* _fl._ scarlet; calyces clothed

referring to the whole plant). ORD. _ConiferA|_. SYN. _Frenela_.
Half-hardy evergreen shrubs or small trees, with long, very
slender-jointed branches, and often very minute, scale-like, persistent
leaves. Flowers monA"cious. Fruit globular, composed of four to
six--rarely eightA---unequal, woody, valvate scales, with one or two
seeds at the base of each. All the species are somewhat tender, in
England, except in the more southern districts. They require a sandy
loam compost. Propagated by cuttings, inserted under a handlight in
autumn, and protected by a cold pit; or by seeds.

    =C. quadrivalvis= (four valved). Arar-tree; Sandarach Gum-tree.
    _fl._, female catkin tetragonal, with four oval valves, each
    furnished with a point, and two of which bear seeds. February to

shrub, very common throughout Northern and Central Europe. Corolla
campanulate, four-lobed, shorter than the calyx. For culture, _see_
=Erica=.

    =C. vulgaris= (common).* _fl._ disposed in long, terminal, spicate
    racemes. July to September. _l._ trigonal, obtuse, very short,
    imbricating in four rows, having the margins revolute and the
    base sagittate. _h._ 1ft. to 3ft. Britain. There are numerous
    very ornamental varieties of this species, which are admirably
    adapted for planting in borders and clumps. The white-flowered
    (_alba_, _Serlii_, and _Hammondi_), flesh-coloured (_carnea_), and
    double-flowered varieties (_fl.-pl._) are all well worth growing in
    shrubberies; _aurea_ and _argentea_, with gold and silver coloured
    shoots, are also very ornamental. The value of the common form can
    scarcely be over-estimated for planting on barren hill sides or
    spaces; it affords excellent shelter for game, and food for bees.

=CALLUS.= The new formation at the end of a cutting before it puts
forth roots; when the Callus is formed, it shows that the cutting is in

=CALOCHILUS= (from _kalos_, beautiful, and _cheilos_, a lip; referring
to the beauty of the labellum or lip). ORD. _OrchideA|_. Interesting
greenhouse terrestrial tuberous-rooted orchids, allied to _Epipactis_.
Sepals yellowish-green; lip purple, covered with rich brown hairs. For
culture, _see_ =Bletia=.

    =C. paludosus= (marsh).* _fl._ very similar in colour to those
    of _C. campestris_, but rather larger. May and June. _l._ rather
    broader. _h._ 9in. Australia, 1823. (F. A. O., part 4.)

=CALOCHORTUS= (from _kalos_, beautiful, and _chortos_, grass; referring
to the leaves). Mariposa Lily. ORD. _LiliaceA|_. Handsome bulbous
plants. Flowers showy, on erect scapes; perianth deciduous; three
outer segments sepaloid, three inner ones much larger and broader, and
bearded on the inside. Leaves ensiform. Bulbs tunicated. These have
not, hitherto, been generally grown in the open air with much success;
but in warm localities and sheltered positions, they may be flowered
outside. A frame, in a sunny situation, is the best possible place for
their cultivation. Here they may be fully exposed to the sun and air,
during mild weather, through the winter; and, when expedient, they may
be protected from excessive moisture, as that is the primary cause of
failure, rather than cold, for they are perfectly hardy, and capable
of enduring all the frost we are likely to get. From May onwards, the
lights might be wholly removed. From the end of June to August, the
bulbs will be in bloom, when, if necessary, the flowers should be
fertilised to secure seed; and when the capsules are forming, material
assistance would be given by placing the lights on again, allowing
plenty of air. Assuming that fresh bulbs are being planted, they should
be in the soil early in the autumn, as nothing is more prejudicial
than keeping them dry through the winter. A good depth of soil should
be provided, composed of fibrous loam, leaf soil, and sand, in equal
proportions, in a well-drained position. The bulbs must be planted 3in.
deep, and some sand placed about them; they may be left undisturbed for
years. Of course, where no frame can be provided, they may be planted
in a well-drained, sunny position in the same soil. They are also
easily managed in pots, but it is necessary to pot in the autumn, and
keep in a frame. Through the winter, they must never be allowed to get
dry, until the leaves are withering in the autumn, when water may be
withheld.

_Propagation._ This may be effected by seeds or offsets, and by the
tiny bulbs frequently produced on the upper portion of the stem. Sow
seeds in pans, in a cool house or frame, as soon as ripe, or in the
early part of the year, and keep the plants close to the glass during
their early stages, as they are very liable to damp off. Sow thinly,
so as to enable the young plants to pass a second season in the seed
pots or pans. Early in the third season, pot off and plant out singly,
encouraging them to grow freely. Propagation by offsets is the most
usual method. With liberal treatment, most of the species increase
pretty freely. The offsets are best removed when the plants are in a
dormant state. They may be either grown in pots or pans, or planted out
in pits or frames, until they reach flowering size. During the season
of rest, it is the safest plan, with those in pots, to keep them in the
earth in which they were grown.

    Trinidad, 1823. SYN. _Cymbidium ochroleucum_. (B. M. 4141.)

=CAMAROTIS.= _See_ =Sarcochilus=.

[Illustration: FIG. 335. CAMASSIA ESCULENTA.]

=CAMASSIA= (from _Quamash_, so called by the North American Indians,
who eat the bulbs). SYN. _Sitocodium_. ORD. _LiliaceA|_. A small genus
(two species) of handsome bulbous plants. Perianth of six segments,
slightly connected at base, and spreading out horizontally, but not
equally. Leaves narrow, about 1ft. long, grooved down the inside.
They thrive best in a sheltered, partially-shaded situation, but will
do fairly well in almost any ordinary good garden soil. A compost of
loam and leaf mould, with a liberal mixture of sharp sand, suits them
best. They need not be disturbed for several years; but a top-dressing
of rich soil or well-rotted manure may be given yearly. Propagated by
offsets and seeds. The plants are so hardy that they ripen seeds in
warm situations. These may be sown as soon as ripe, or the following
spring, either in a warm situation out of doors, or in pots or boxes,
under glass. The young plants make rapid progress, and should remain
for at least two years in the seed beds. The best time for final
transplanting is in February. Offsets are produced very freely,
and should be removed either when in a dormant condition, or just
previously to starting into fresh growth, and arranged in clumps or
lines, placing a little sand about them.

    =C. esculenta= (edible).* Camash or Quamash. _fl._ blue, about
    2in. across; racemes loose, ten to twenty-flowered, borne on
    stout scapes; perianth six-cleft, the five upper segments close
    together, the sixth standing by itself. Summer. _l._ linear, about
    1ft. high. Columbia, &c., 1837. The colour of the flowers varies
    from a deep blue to nearly white. See Fig. 335. (B. R. 1486.) The
    white-flowered form is figured in B. M. 2774, under the name of
    _Scilla esculenta flore albo_.

    =C. e. Leichtlini= (Leichtlin's).* _fl._ creamy-white, larger than
    those of the type, with more numerous nerves in the keel of the
    segments of the perianth; racemes longer, and sometimes compound.
    Spring. _h._ 2ft. Columbia, 1853. This also differs from the type
    in its more robust habit and broader leaves. SYN. _Chlorogalum
    Leichtlini_. (B. M. 6287.)

    =C. Fraseri= (Fraser's).* _fl._ pale blue, smaller than those of
    _C. esculenta_; pedicels and scape much more slender. _l._ narrow,
    acute; capsule more acutely angled. _h._ 1ft. Eastern States of
    North America. A smaller and more slender plant. (B. M. 1574, as
    _Scilla esculenta_.)

=CAMBESSEDESIA= (named after James Cambessedes, coadjutor of Auguste
St. Hilaire, in his "Flora BrasiliA| Meridionalis," and author of
several botanical memoirs). ORD. _MelastomaceA|_. A genus of elegant,
erect, or ascending, dichotomously branched stove shrubs or herbaceous
plants. Flowers terminal and axillary, in paniculate cymes; petals
five, obovate; calyx bell-shaped. Leaves sessile, opposite or
verticillate, obovate, oblong or linear. They thrive best in a compost
of peat and sand. Propagated by half-ripened cuttings, which root
freely in a similar mixture, if placed in heat and under a hand glass.
There are about eight species known to science, but probably that
mentioned below is the only one in cultivation.

    =C. paraguayensis= (Paraguay). _fl._ rose-red, 2/3in. in diameter,
    in terminal corymbose, glandular, hairy panicles. July. _l._ nearly
    1in. long, sessile, ovate, acute, three-nerved, pale green, with
    entire ciliate margins. Stem annual, herbaceous, leafy. _h._ 10in.
    to 18in. 1880. (B. M. 6604.)

=CAMBIUM.= The formative fluid found between the bark and wood of
Exogens, in spring.

=CAMBUY FRUIT.= _See_ =Eugenia=.

=CAMELLIA= (named in honour of George Joseph Camellus or Kamel, a
Moravian Jesuit and traveller in Asia, who wrote a history of the
plants of the Isle of Luzon, which is inserted in the third vol. of
John Ray's "Historia Plantarum"). Japanese Rose. Including _Thea._
ORD. _TernstrA"miaceA|_. A genus of elegant hardy or nearly hardy
evergreen shrubs or trees. Flowers large; sepals five or six, gradually
passing from bracts into petals, the latter slightly cohering at the
base; stamens numerous. Leaves coriaceous. By close attention to a
few particulars in the management of these beautiful plants, much
disappointment may be avoided, and a succession of flowers obtained
from October till the following July. The fact of the buds frequently
dropping off, deters many would-be growers from attempting the culture
of the Camellia. Dryness of the atmosphere, and want of water at the
roots, are generally the primary causes of failure; the remedy for
these evils rests with the cultivator. The roots are apt to get
matted together, compressing the earth around them into a hard ball,
impervious to water; hence attention is necessary to see that the
water poured into the pot thoroughly moistens all the soil. In order
to form handsome plants, they should be trained with single stems to
rods, and pruned, so as to make them throw out side branches from
every part of the stem; they must not be placed too close to each
other on the stage, or when planted out. A liberal supply of water
is always necessary, but especially so during the flowering period.
Plants that are required to flower early may remain in the warm house
till they commence to blossom, when they should be removed to a cold
place, such as the back of a greenhouse, giving them plenty of light.
Those kept in a hothouse or vinery during summer, will flower in the
beginning or middle of October; and a large plant, having from fifty to
one hundred buds, will continue in flower till the month of January.
Those that are removed early, will blossom in January, and so succeed
the others. The plants that have finished flowering should be brought
back to the hothouse, where they will begin to make new wood, and be
ready to come in succession next season. By thus shifting the plants
from a warm to a cold situation, a regular succession will be secured
from October to July. The soil should be kept constantly moist, and in
the summer months the leaves occasionally syringed. Camellias flower
best when kept in small pots or tubs. In order to raise and exhibit
these handsome plants to the best advantage, they should be grown in
a separate house, of ample height, as they never look so well as when
6ft. or 8ft. high, trained in a conical form, with branches from the
root upwards; and the plants should be raised near to the glass on a
movable stage, which should be lowered as they grow. In summer, they
may either be placed in the open air in a sheltered spot, or the glass
roof of the house can be taken off. The hardier sorts, such as the
Double-red, Blush, and PA|ony-flowered, succeed in the bed or border of
a conservatory, if the roof can be taken off in summer, so as to admit
air. If this cannot be managed, they are better grown in portable pots
or boxes. The most suitable time for shifting Camellias is directly
after flowering; they should then be put into a vinery or hothouse,
where there is a little heat; or the warmest part of a greenhouse.
They will soon begin to make new wood, where they should be allowed to
remain, amply supplied with water, till they form their flower buds,
at the extremity and sides of the young growth. A few should then be
removed to a cold place, and shaded during strong sunshine. In a few
weeks afterwards, others may also be transferred, so as to have a
regular succession of flowering plants.

_Propagation._ The red Camellias are generally propagated by layers,
but cuttings will also succeed; the single red Camellia being raised by
either cuttings, layers, or seeds. This latter forms suitable stocks
on which to inarch or graft the rarer kinds. The ripened shoots of the
preceding summer should be taken off in August, cutting them smoothly
at a joint or bud. Two or three of the lower leaves should be taken
off, and the cuttings planted firmly in the soil with a dibble. Some
growers use peat earth and sand to strike in, while others prefer a
loam mixed with sand and peat. The pans containing the cuttings should
be kept in a plant or cold frame, without being covered with glasses,
but shaded during powerful sunshine. In the following spring, such as
have struck will begin to push, when they need to be placed in a gentle
heat. The following September or October, the rooted plants will be
fit to pot off, and in the second or third spring they may be used
as stocks. Inarching or grafting is done in early spring, as soon as
growth commences. When this process is completed, care must be taken
to fix the pot containing the stock so that it may not be disturbed
during the connection of the scion with the parent plant. The grafting
being clayed over, is then covered with moss, to prevent its cracking.
When independent grafting is resorted to, the mode called "side
grafting" is generally employed, as in the case of Orange-trees; but
the operation of tongueing is generally omitted, as tending to weaken
the stock. Liquid or other manure is not required; nor is it desirable
to apply it, as it often, sooner or later, causes the destruction of
the plants. As a rule, insects do not trouble this class of plants; but
scale will sometimes appear, and can easily be removed by hand. Thrips
occasionally put in an appearance, but a little smoke will quickly get
rid of them.

    one-flowered, scaly. May to July. _l._ ovate-lanceolate, acuminate,
    serrated, silky beneath. Branches hairy. _h._ 4ft. China, 1822. (B.
    R. 983.)

[Illustration: FIG. 337. FLOWER OF CAMELLIA JAPONICA ANEMONA†FLORA.]

    =C. j. anemonA|flora= (Anemone-flowered). All, or nearly all, the
    stamens, &c., in this variety are transformed into small petaloid
    bodies, and the flower has the general aspect of a double Anemone.
    See Fig. 337. (B. M. 1654.)

[Illustration: FIG. 338. FLOWER OF CAMELLIA OLEIFERA.]

    fragrant, solitary. November. _l._ elliptic-oblong, acute,
    serrated, coriaceous, shining. _h._ 6ft. to 8ft. China, 1820. See
    Fig. 338. (B. R. 942.)

    =C. reticulata= (netted-leaved). _fl._ bright rose, large,
    semi-double. l. oblong, acuminated, serrated, flat, reticulated.
    _h._ 10ft. China, 1824. There is a form of this species with full

    This species varies very considerably. In different countries,
    it has become modified by cultivation. The Green and Black Teas,
    formerly supposed to be produced by different species, are obtained
    from the same bushes, but subjected to different processes.

Less-known species are: _drupifera_, _lanceolata_, _rosA|flora_, and
_Sasanqua_.

FIG. 339. GROUP OF CAMPANULAS.]

=CAMOENSIA= (named in honour of Luis Camoens, a celebrated Portuguese
poet). ORD. _LeguminosA|_. A genus containing a couple of handsome
species. _C. maxima_ is the largest-flowered leguminous plant known. It
thrives well in rich loam and leaf mould. Cuttings root in sandy loam,
in bottom heat, if placed under a bell glass. It has not yet flowered
in this country. The other species has not been introduced.

    =C. maxima= (greatest).* _fl._ cream-colour, yellow, 1ft. long, in
    short axillary racemes. Angola, 1878. (T. L. S. 25, 36.)

=CAMOMILE.= _See_ =Chamomile=.

=CAMPANEA= (from _campana_, a bell; alluding to the shape of the
flowers). ORD. _GesneraceA|_. Stove herbaceous climbing perennials, the
only one at present introduced being _C. grandiflora_. For cultivation,
_see_ =Gesnera=.

    =C. grandiflora= (large-flowered).* _fl._ in axillary tufts,
    at ends of long, axillary, and terminal peduncles; corolla
    white, lined and dotted with crimson. June. _l._ opposite, oval,
    acuminated, oblique, soft, crenated, stalked. Plant hairy. _h._
    2ft. Santa FA(C), 1848. (R. H. 1849, 241.)

=CAMPANULA= (diminutive of _campana_, a bell; in reference to the shape
of the flowers). Bell-flower; Slipperwort. ORD. _CampanulaceA|_. A genus
of mostly perennial--rarely annual or biennial--herbs. Flowers blue or
white, for the most part pedunculate, usually racemose, rarely spicate
or glomerate. Radical leaves usually different in form from the cauline
ones, especially in size. All the species of this genus are elegant
when in flower (see Fig. 339), and are very largely grown. The dwarf
varieties make excellent subjects for pot culture, rockeries, or the
fronts of borders. A rather rich sandy loam, with plenty of drainage,
suits these plants. The forms of _C. pyramidalis_ may be kept in cold
frames during the winter, and firmly repotted in summer, the crown
of the plant being kept just a trifle raised above the soil, or they
are at times liable to damp off, through the water lodging around the
necks. During hot weather, the pots should be plunged in a bed of
ashes. Campanulas are easily raised from seeds, which should be sown in
spring.

_General Culture._ As a rule, few plants are so easily cultivated as
these. The strong-growing kinds may be grown with the greatest success
in ordinary garden soil, well enriched with manure, while the alpine
kinds are easily managed on the rockery. Sow seeds of the annuals
in April, and of the biennials in June, in the open, or in a cold
frame. The perennials are chiefly propagated by dividing the roots,
or by young cuttings, in spring--the latter is by far the best method
of propagation with many of the species--or by seeds. Those kinds
requiring special treatment are particularised, and those suitable
to the rockery are so designated. Perennials, except where otherwise
mentioned.

=CANKER.= This is a disease presenting very serious difficulties,
principally in the cultivation of Apples and Pears. Both the trees
and fruits, especially of some varieties, are, in many localities,
so far injured as not to be worth cultivating. What causes the
disease is not at all times known; indeed, it is, in most cases, but
imperfectly understood. Were the causes better known, the remedy might
generally be much easier found. Some of the primary causes are cold
and undrained soil, severe and careless pruning, extreme variations
of temperature, and excessive growth, made late in the season, when
it has not sufficient time to get well ripened. Trees that are badly
Cankered may often be improved by lifting, and replanting in improved
or better-drained soil. Immediately the disease is detected in young
trees, by the cracking of the bark or the skin of the fruits, measures
should be taken to find the cause, if possible, and avert its progress.
Some Pear-trees, in various localities, will not produce fruit without
Canker in the open garden, but they will do so when planted against
a wall; and as such may be the very best varieties, trees should be
placed in the latter position. The removal of large branches, late in
spring, will sometimes produce Canker, at the point where mutilation
has taken place; and it may be caused by severe late pruning, which
induces the growth of soft shoots that are almost certain to be injured
by severe frosts. The difference in the seasons, as regards the amount
of moisture, is one that can scarcely be provided against. One spring
may be favourable to rapid growth, and the following may be most
unfavourable, thereby arresting the natural flow of the sap until the
latter part of the summer, when excessive growth will probably take
place. Such checks invariably produce Canker. At times, the disease
seems caused by the punctures of insects, in an early stage, on the
stems or branches. In such instances, a thorough cleansing, and a
smearing of quicklime, made into a wash, often proves successful.
Strong tobacco water will destroy insects, and a weak solution of
sulphuric acid is also fatal to lichens and mosses, which should never
be allowed to obtain a footing. The chief preventatives, therefore,
are: Planting in well-drained soil; avoiding the use of any rank
manure, to cause excessive growth; changing the old, or adding new,
soil to injured trees; careful pruning, and the encouragement of early
growth in spring, and subsequent well ripening in autumn.

[Illustration: FIG. 359. CANNA INDICA, showing Habit, Flowers, and
Leaves.]

=CANNA= (derivation uncertain; according to some, from _cana_, the
Celtic name for cane, or reed). Indian Shot. ORD. _ScitamineA|_. A
large genus of stove herbaceous perennials, very extensively employed
in sub-tropical and other methods of summer gardening. Flowers
spathaceous; anther attached to the edge of the petal-like filament.
Leaves very ornamental. Few plants are more easily grown, or more
quickly propagated. Seeds of many of the finer sorts may be bought
cheaply from respectable seedsmen. These should be sown in heat, in
February or March. A warm house or cucumber pit is the best place for
sowing the seeds, which are very hard. If soaked in tepid water for
twenty-four hours, germination will be materially stimulated. A mixture
of sand and leaf mould is best for them, and a covering of 1-1/2in. or
2in. of earth is not excessive. They should be sown thinly, in pans.
As Cannas are gross, and have somewhat brittle roots in a young state,
it is a good plan to sow the seed singly in small pots. This method
preserves all the roots intact, and prevents any check in potting
off or dividing the plants out of seed pans or boxes. When this is
not done, the plants must be potted off singly, as soon as they have
formed two leaves, 3in. pots being used for the first shift. The soil
can hardly be too rich and porous. Equal parts rotted dung, loam, and
sand, with a little peat, form a capital mixture for them. The plants
must be kept in a growing temperature of 60deg. or so, during their
earlier stages, and shifted as required into larger pots. Under proper
management, the roots will fill 6in. pots by the middle or end of May.
They ought not to be planted out till the end of May or the first week
in June. Should fairly rich soil and a sheltered place be selected for
them, they will not only grow, but flower freely during the late summer
and autumn months. Cannas are also very effective indoors, either for
greenhouse or room decoration. For these purposes they may be grown
on in 8in., 10in., or even 12in., pots, with rich soil, and placed
either in a stove, intermediate house, warm or cool conservatory,
window, or room. Liberal supplies of manure water will be of very great
benefit. Propagation is also effected by means of divisions; they form
a root-stock very like some of the commoner and more free-growing
Irises, each portion of which, with bud and roots attached, may be
converted into an independent plant. The best mode of procedure is to
divide the root-stock in early spring, when the pieces may be placed in
4in. pots at once; and, if plunged in a bottom heat of 60deg. or so,
they will quickly resume root action and grow rapidly. They may also
be propagated by division without bottom heat. Those who grow large
quantities seldom put their plants in pots at all. Stored in pots or
boxes for the winter, they are divided and placed singly in similar
positions in the spring, and transferred from such vessels into the
open air. The best open site for Cannas is in a sheltered spot, with a
good depth of rich soil, and plenty of moisture. In such a position,
their noble leaves are not so much injured by rough winds. After
flowering, or at the end of the season, they may be lifted and stored
away in boxes, or in pots of earth, in dry, frost-proof sheds, or under
greenhouse stages during winter. In warm, sheltered situations, with
dry bottoms, they winter safely in the open, provided their crowns are
covered with 1ft. of litter or cocoa fibre refuse. But where the soil
is wet and cold, or the situation bleak and unprotected, they should be
lifted and stored away, as already described.

of the branches, rarely solitary and axillary. Leaves entire or
almost pinnatifid, alternate, petiolate, elliptic, acuminated, or
cuneate-oblong, glabrous, or downy on both surfaces when young. They
are of easy culture in a compost of turfy loam, leaf-mould, and
sand, if good drainage is allowed. Propagated by cuttings, placed

rarely absent. Leaves alternate, very rarely opposite, stipulate or
exstipulate. The order is distributed throughout the tropical and
warm temperate regions of both hemispheres, the frutescent species
being largely represented in America. There are about twenty-three
genera--the best-known being _Capparis_, _Cleome_, and _CratA|va_--and
about 300 species.

=CAPPARIS= (_kapparis_, old Greek name used by Dioscorides, from
Persian _kabar_, Capers). Caper-tree. ORD. _CapparideA|_. Greenhouse
or stove evergreen shrubs, of considerable beauty. Calyx four-parted;
petals four; stamens numerous; succeeded by a berry. They thrive best
in a compost of well-drained sandy loam. Cuttings of ripe shoots will
root in sand, under a hand glass, in moist heat. This genus contains
about 120 species, but it is very doubtful if more than six are to be
found under cultivation in this country.

    =C. amygdalina= (Almond-like).* _fl._ white; peduncles axillary,

    on the outside; pedicels solitary, one-flowered. June. _l._ ovate,
    roundish, deciduous. _h._ 3ft. South Europe, 1596. This is an
    excellent greenhouse shrub, and one which we have found perfectly
    hardy in the southern counties of England. See Fig. 363. (B. M.
    291.)

=CAPRIFOLIACEA†.= A rather large order of shrubs or herbs, often
twining. Flowers terminal, corymbose, or axillary; corolla superior,

are: _LinnA|a_, _Lonicera_, _Sambucus_, and _Viburnum_.

=CAPRIFOLIUM.= _See_ =Lonicera=.

[Illustration: FIG. 364. FRUIT OF LONG AND ROUND CAPSICUMS.]

=CAPSICUM= (from _kapto_, to bite; on account of the biting heat of the
seeds and pericarp). ORD. _SolanaceA|_. Shrubs or sub-shrubs, rarely
herbs. Peduncles extra-axillary, one-flowered. Leaves scattered,
solitary, or twin, and quite entire. Many of the species, although
possessing considerable beauty, are but rarely grown, either for
decoration or for the use of their fruit; consequently, we confine
our specific enumeration to the Common Capsicum, the Bird Pepper or
Chili, and the Bell Pepper. The first two of these have long been in
cultivation, for use either in a green state for pickles and for making
Chili vinegar, or ripened and ground as Cayenne Pepper. Some sorts are
exceedingly ornamental for greenhouse decoration in winter, if plants
are well grown in rather small pots, and the fruit ripened under glass.
The varieties producing small pods are the hottest, and consequently
best suited for making Cayenne Pepper. These are generally called
Chilies. All other varieties of Capsicum have a more or less pungent
flavour, and those bearing larger pods are more profitable for use in
a green state. The fruits of all are either red or yellow when ripe,
and are of various sizes and shapes. Some are produced and stand erect
on the upper side of the branches; others hang underneath. Fig. 364
represents hanging fruits of Long and Round Capsicums, the shapes of
which are produced by both red and yellow varieties.

_Cultivation._ Being natives of tropical countries, Capsicums cannot
always be depended upon to thoroughly ripen in the open air; but a good
crop of green fruits may generally be obtained by preparing the plants
early in the season, and planting out in a warm situation.

Sow the seeds in February or early in March, in pots or pans, placing
them in heat; and so soon as the plants are large enough, pot off
singly into 3in. pots, still keeping them in heat until well rooted.
Place them into 6in. or 7in. pots before they become starved; and
gradually harden off and plant out about 2ft. asunder, in June. The
fruits ripen better if the plants are placed against a south wall and
tacked on to it. The safest plan to obtain a crop of ripe fruits is to
cultivate under glass. Pots of 7in. diameter are large enough. Rich
soil must be used, and any spare frames are suitable in summer. Plenty
of water and frequent syringings should be applied, as the plants are
very liable to injury from red spider and other insects if this is in
any way neglected. The fruits will keep some time after being ripe, but
are never better than when fresh gathered; they may, however, be kept
on the plants for a considerable period.

_Sorts._ Chili, Long Red, Long Yellow, Small Red Cayenne, Round Red,
and Round Yellow. Good ornamental varieties are: Little Gem, a very
dwarf variety, of comparatively recent introduction, covered with
small, erect, red pods; and Prince of Wales, free fruiting, with
hanging bright yellow pods.

deciduous trees or shrubs. Flowers usually yellow, axillary, either
solitary or crowded, but always single on thin stalks. Leaves abruptly
pinnate, the midrib ending in a bristle or spine; leaflets mucronate.
They are well adapted for shrubberies, and are of the easiest culture
in sandy soil. Propagated by cuttings, made of the roots, or by seeds;
the low-growing shrubs by seeds and layers. Caraganas are generally
increased by grafting on _C. arborescens_, which is easily raised from
seed, sown when ripe or in spring.

    =C. Altagana= (Altagana). _fl._ yellow; pedicels solitary. April to
    July. _l._ with six to eight pairs of glabrous, obovate-roundish,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
