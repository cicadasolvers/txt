      "_The work of a clever, cultivated person, wielding a
      practised pen. The characters are drawn with force and

      of the Poems, and the New Poems._ "_Thyrsis is a poem

      "_We can highly recommend it; not only for the valuable
      information it gives on the special subjects to which it is
      dedicated, but also for the interesting episodes of travel
      which are interwoven with, and lighten, the weightier
      matters of judicious and varied criticism on art and
      artists in northern capitals._"--ART JOURNAL.

      Scotch Story--A Man's Story. Crown 8vo. 7_s._ 6_d._

      "_Lady Barker is endowed with a rare and delicate gift
      for narrating stories,--she has the faculty of throwing
      even into her printed narrative a soft and pleasant tone,
      which goes far to make the reader think the subject or the
      matter immaterial, so long as the author will go on telling
      stories for his benefit._"--ATHENAEUM.

    STORIES ABOUT:--With Six Illustrations. Third Edition.
    Extra fcap. 8vo. 4_s._ 6_d._

      _This volume contains several entertaining stories about

    RIBBON STORIES. With Illustrations by C. O. MURRAY.
    Second Edition. Extra fcap. 8vo. cloth gilt. 4_s._ 6_d._

      "_We cannot too highly commend. It is exceedingly happy
      and original in the plan, and the graceful fancies of
      its pages, merry and pathetic turns, will be found
      the best reading by girls of all ages, and by boys
      too._"--TIMES.

    SYBIL'S BOOK. Illustrated by S. E. WALLER. Second Edition.
    Globe 8vo. gilt. 4_s._ 6_d._

      "_Another of Lady Barker's delightful stories, and one of
      the most thoroughly original books for girls that has been
      written for many years. Grown-up readers will like it quite
      as much as young people, and will even better understand
      the rarity of such simple, natural, and unaffected
      writing.... That no one can read the story without interest
      is not its highest praise, for no one ought to be able to
      lay it down without being the better girl or boy, or man or
      woman, for the reading of it. Lady Barker has never turned
      her fertile and fascinating pen to better account, and for
      the sake of all readers we wish 'Sybil's Book's a wide
      success._"--TIMES.

    Crown 8vo. 8_s._ 6_d._

      _The present work aims to afford information and direction
      touching the early efforts of France in poetical
      literature._ "_In one moderately sized volume he has
      contrived to introduce us to the very best, if not to all
      of the early French poets._"--ATHENAEUM.

=Betsy Lee=; A FO'C'S'LE YARN. Extra fcap. 8vo. 3_s._ 6_d._

      "_There is great vigour and much pathos in this
      poem._"--MORNING POST.

      poet._"--ATHENAEUM.

=Black (W.)=--Works by W. BLACK, Author of "A Daughter of Heth."

    THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF A PHAETON. Seventh and Cheaper
    Edition. Crown 8vo. 6_s._ Also, Illustrated by S. E.
    WALLER, 8vo. cloth gilt. 10_s._ 6_d._

      "_The book is a really charming description of a thousand
      English landscapes and of the emergencies and the fun and
      the delight of a picnic journey through them by a party
      determined to enjoy themselves, and as well matched as
      the pair of horses which drew the phaeton they sat in.
      The real charm and purpose of the book is its open-air
      life among hills and dales._"--TIMES. "_The
      great charm of Mr. Black's book is that there is nothing
      hackneyed about it, nothing overdrawn,--all is bright and
      lifelike._"--MORNING POST.

    A PRINCESS OF THULE. Three vols. Sixth and cheaper Edition.
    Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      The SATURDAY REVIEW says:--"_A novel which is
      both romantic and natural, which has much feeling, without
      any touch of mawkishness, which goes deep into character
      without any suggestion of painful analysis--this is a rare
      gem to find amongst the debris of current literature,
      and this, or nearly this, Mr. Black has given us in the
      'Princess of Thule.'_" "_It has, for one thing, the great
      charm of novelty.... There is a picturesqueness in all that
      Mr. Black writes, but scarcely even in the 'Adventures
      of a Phaeton' are there the freshness and sweetness and
      perfect sense of natural beauty we find in this last
      book._"--PALL MALL GAZETTE. "_A beautiful and
      nearly perfect story._"--SPECTATOR.

=Borland Hall.=--By the Author of "Olrig Grange." Crown 8vo. 7_s._

      with consummate beauty._"--LITERARY CHURCHMAN.

      world of wondering minds, and which may well please
      those who have unfortunately passed the years of

    35th Thousand.

      "_Quite as rich in humorous whims of fantasy, quite as
      laughable in its queer incidents, as loveable for its
      pleasant spirit and graceful manner, as the wondrous tale
      of Alice's former adventures._"--ILLUSTRATED LONDON
      NEWS. "_If this had been given to the world first it
      would have enjoyed a success at least equal to 'Alice in

      "_A most exquisitely got up volume. Legend, carol, and text
      are preciously enshrined in its emblazoned pages, and the
      illuminated borders are far and away the best example of
      their art we have seen this Christmas. The pictures and
      borders are harmonious in their colouring, the dyes are
      brilliant without being raw, and the volume is a trophy of
      colour-printing. The binding by Burn is in the very best
      taste._"--TIMES.

    THE POEMS OF ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH, sometime Fellow of Oriel
    College, Oxford. Fourth Edition. Fcap. 8vo. 6_s._

      "_From the higher mind of cultivated, all-questioning,
      but still conservative England, in this our puzzled
      generation, we do not know of any utterance in
      literature so characteristic as the poems of Arthur Hugh
      Clough._"--FRASER'S MAGAZINE.

    Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      days._"

=Culmshire Folk.=--By IGNOTUS. Three vols. Crown 8vo. 31_s._ 6_d._

      "_Its sparkling pleasantness, its drollery, its shrewdness,
      the charming little bits of character which frequently
      come in, its easy liveliness, and a certain chattiness
      which, while it is never vulgar, brings the writer very
      near, and makes one feel as if the story were being told in
      lazy confidence in an hour of idleness by a man who, while
      thoroughly good-natured, is strongly humorous, and has an
      ever-present perception of the absurdities of people and
      things._"--SPECTATOR.

=Dante.=--DANTE'S COMEDY, THE HELL. Translated by W. M. ROSSETTI.
    Fcap. 8vo. cloth. 5_s._

      "_The aim of this translation of Dante may be summed up
      in one word--Literality. To follow Dante sentence for
      sentence, line for line, word for word--neither more nor
      less, has been my strenuous endeavour._"--AUTHOR'S
      PREFACE.

      "_Full of truthful and charming historic pictures, is
      everywhere vital with moral and religious principles, and
      is written with a brightness of description, and with a
      dramatic force in the representation of character, that
      have made, and will always make, it one of the greatest
      favourites with reading boys._"--NONCONFORMIST.

=Deane.=--MARJORY. By MILLY DEANE. Third Edition. With Frontispiece
    and Vignette. Crown 8vo. 4_s._ 6_d._

      _The_ TIMES _of September 11th says it is_ "_A
      very touching story, full of promise for the after career
      of the authoress. It is so tenderly drawn, and so full of
      life and grace, that any attempt to analyse or describe it
      falls sadly short of the original. We will venture to say
      that few readers of any natural feeling or sensibility will
      take up 'Marjory' without reading it through at a sitting,
      and we hope we shall see more stories by the same hand._"
      _The_ MORNING POST _calls it_ "_A deliciously
      fresh and charming little love story._"

=De Vere.=--THE INFANT BRIDAL, and other Poems. By AUBREY DE VERE.
    Fcap. 8vo. 7_s._ 6_d._

      "_Mr. De Vere has taken his place among the poets of the
      day. Pure and tender feeling, and that polished restraint
      of style which is called classical, are the charms of the
      volume._"--SPECTATOR.

=Doyle (Sir F. H.)=--LECTURES ON POETRY, delivered before the
    University of Oxford in 1868. By Sir FRANCIS HASTINGS DOYLE,
    Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford. Crown 8vo.
    3_s._ 6_d._

      "_Full of thoughtful discrimination and fine insight: the
      lecture on 'Provincial Poetry' seems to us singularly true,
      eloquent, and instructive._"--SPECTATOR.

=Estelle Russell.=--By the Author of "The Private Life of Galileo."
    New Edition. Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      _Full of bright pictures of French life. The English
      family, whose fortunes form the main drift of the story,
      reside mostly in France, but there are also many English
      characters and scenes of great interest. It is certainly
      the work of a fresh, vigorous, and most interesting writer,
      with a dash of sarcastic humour which is refreshing and
      not too bitter._ "_We can send our readers to it with
      confidence._"--SPECTATOR.

=Evans.=--BROTHER FABIAN'S MANUSCRIPT, AND OTHER POEMS. By

=Evans.=--THE CURSE OF IMMORTALITY. By A. EUBULE EVANS.
    Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      "_Never, probably, has the legend of the Wandering Jew
      been more ably and poetically handled. The author writes
      as a true poet, and with the skill of a true artist.
      The plot of this remarkable drama is not only well
      contrived, but worked out with a degree of simplicity and
      truthful vigour altogether unusual in modern poetry. In
      fact, since the date of Byron's 'Cain,' we can scarcely
      recall any verse at once so terse, so powerful, and so
      masterly._"--STANDARD.

=Fairy Book.=--The Best Popular Fairy Stories. Selected and Rendered
    anew by the Author of "John Halifax, Gentleman." With Coloured
    Illustrations and Ornamental Borders by J. E. ROGERS, Author of
    "Ridicula Rediviva." Crown 8vo. cloth, extra gilt. 6_s._ (Golden

    Author of "The Ramsgate Life-Boat," in _Macmillan's Magazine_.
    Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      "_The stories, which are said to be literally exact,
      are more thrilling than anything in fiction. Mr.
      Gilmore has done a good work as well as written a good
      book._"--DAILY NEWS.

      threshold and gazing at the ineffable brightness within._"
      _According to the_ WESTMINSTER REVIEW, "_it
      would be difficult to point out a book that contains so
      much fulness of knowledge along with so much freshness of
      perception and clearness of presentation._"

      of brute nature has never received a more robust and
      vigorous interpretation, and the various incidents in which
      particular character is shown are set forth with rare
      dramatic power. For excellence that will endure, we incline
      to place this very near the top of the list of Christmas

MACMILLAN'S GLOBE LIBRARY.

      _Beautifully printed on toned paper and bound in cloth
      extra, gilt edges, price_ 4_s._ 6_d._ _each; in cloth
      plain_, 3_s._ 6_d._ _Also kept in a variety of calf and
      morocco bindings at moderate prices._

BOOKS, Wordsworth says, are

             "the spirit breathed
     By dead men to their kind;"

and the aim of the publishers of the Globe Library has been to make
it possible for the universal kin of English-speaking men to hold
communion with the loftiest "spirits of the mighty dead;" to put
within the reach of all classes _complete_ and _accurate_ editions,
carefully and clearly printed upon the best paper, in a convenient
form, at a moderate price, of the works of the MASTER-MINDS OF
ENGLISH LITERATURE, and occasionally of foreign literature in an
attractive English dress.

The Editors, by their scholarship and special study of their authors,
are competent to afford every assistance to readers of all kinds: this
assistance is rendered by original biographies, glossaries of unusual
or obsolete words, and critical and explanatory notes.

The publishers hope, therefore, that these Globe Editions may prove
worthy of acceptance by all classes wherever the English Language is
spoken, and by their universal circulation justify their distinctive
epithet; while at the same time they spread and nourish a common
sympathy with nature's most "finely touched" spirits, and thus help a
little to "make the whole world kin."

      _The_ SATURDAY REVIEW _says_: "_The Globe
      Editions are admirable for their scholarly editing, their
      typographical excellence, their compendious form, and
      their cheapness._" _The_ BRITISH QUARTERLY REVIEW
      _says_: "_In compendiousness, elegance, and scholarliness,
      the Globe Editions of Messrs. Macmillan surpass any popular
      series of our classics hitherto given to the public. As
      near an approach to miniature perfection as has ever been
      made._"

=Shakespeare's Complete Works.= Edited by W. G, CLARK, M.A., and
    W. ALDIS WRIGHT, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, Editors
    of the "Cambridge Shakespeare." With Glossary, pp. 1,075.

      _The_ ATHENAEUM _says this edition is_ "_a marvel
      of beauty, cheapness, and compactness.... For the busy
      man, above all for the working student, this is the best
      of all existing Shakespeares._" _And the_ PALL MALL
      GAZETTE _observes_: "_To have produced the complete
      works of the world's greatest poet in such a form, and at
      a price within the reach of every one, is of itself almost
      sufficient to give the publishers a claim to be considered
      public benefactors._"

      "_Mr. Benham's edition of Cowper is one of permanent

      full of information, singularly neat and readable and
      modest--indeed too modest in its comments. The notes

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
