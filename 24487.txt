THE STORY OF POCAHONTAS AND CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH

1. POCAHONTAS


Long, long ago, when the Indians owned the land, there lived in
Virginia, near the river afterwards called the James, a little girl, the
Princess Pocahontas, daughter of the great chief Powhatan.

Pocahontas was her father's favorite child, and the pet of the whole
tribe; even the fierce warriors loved her sunny ways.

She was a child of nature, and the birds trusted her and came at her
call. She knew their songs, and where they built their nests. So she
roamed the woods, and learned the ways of all the wild things, and grew
to be a care-free maiden.

2. JOHN SMITH


In far-away England was a doughty youth, John Smith, who dreamed of
battle and adventure. Though but a boy, he had already fought as a
soldier in the wars of France, and later in Flanders.

And these two, the wild little Indian girl and the warrior boy, now so
far apart, in time were to meet and become great friends.

At home again in Lincolnshire after dangerous travels, the youth still
longed for the strife and glory of the fray.

He retired to a quiet spot in the wood, and lived in a camp of his own
making, where he read tales of war and knights-errant, and in his
enthusiasm fought imaginary enemies. At last he could bear dreaming no
longer, and started off again to roam the world in search of adventure.

[Illustration]

3. HOW CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH WON HIS SPURS


He journeyed across France to join the armies fighting the Turks, but
was robbed on the way by false companions, and suffered much hardship.
At last he reached Marseilles, where he took ship with a party of
pilgrims going to the East. A great storm arising, the pilgrims
superstitiously blamed him for it, and threw him overboard. By good
fortune he was able to swim to a small island, whence he was soon
rescued by a Breton ship. He stayed for some time on this ship, taking
part in a sea fight with a Venetian vessel, and received, after the
victory, a share of the spoils.

Now, with money again in his pocket, he wandered through Italy, and then
crossed over to Styria. Here he joined the army of the Emperor Rudolph
and was appointed captain of a company of cavalry, and did good service.

During the siege of the town of Regal, the Turks, who held it,
challenged any captain among the besiegers to come out and fight one of
their champions.

Captain John Smith was chosen to meet the Turk, and on a field before
the town they fought, and the Turk was beaten and lost his head. On the
next day another Turk challenged the victor and was also overthrown. And
then came still a third, who, after a desperate battle, met the same
fate as the other two. For this brave service Prince Sigismund gave the
Captain a coat-of-arms with three Turks' heads as the device. And thus
Captain John Smith won his spurs.

But after this he was less fortunate, for, being wounded, he was taken
prisoner by the Turks and made a slave. In time, however, he escaped and
fled to Russia, and from thence at last found his way home to England
again.

4. STRANGE TALES OF A STRANGE PEOPLE


Meanwhile Pocahontas, now grown to be a girl of some twelve years, often
listened eagerly to the stories of the old men of her tribe, who, on
these warm spring days, sat and smoked together, and told of the things
they had done and seen long ago. Some remembered a white-faced people
who, nearly twenty years before, had come to Roanoke Island from no one
knew where,--men with yellow hair, dressed from head to foot in cumbrous
garments, and bearing wonderful weapons which spat out fire, with much
noise. Many believed them gods, while others thought they were devils.
And Pocahontas listened in wonder, ever curious to hear of this strange
people so unlike her own. The old priest mournfully prophesied that the
strangers, being of some mighty race, would come again from out the
great waters and overrun the whole land.

[Illustration]

5. THE COMING OF THE WHITE MAN


And scarcely had he spoken when it seemed that his warning had come
true, for runners, wildly excited, cried out that a fleet of mighty
winged canoes had been seen afar on the ocean, advancing like great
clouds.

Then Pocahontas, with many of her people, hurried to the hills, and
there, overlooking the sea, they saw in truth three strange craft slowly
sailing up the bay.

These were the ships from England, bringing a new colony, a band of
pioneers, and adventurers in search of gold, to take possession of the
broad lands of America.

[Illustration]

6. THE LANDING OF THE COLONISTS--1607


That night the ships dropped anchor in the bay. On the morrow the
colonists disembarked, and Captain Gosnold, their leader, claimed the
land in the king's name. Among the first, as one of the Council, was
Captain John Smith, who had again left home in quest of adventure and
glory, this time in the new world. To the eyes of the weary travelers,
after their long voyage across the sea, Virginia, on that bright April
day, seemed a land of promise. With great hopes and renewed courage they
set to work to build the town which they called Jamestown, in honor of
their king,--a town which lives to this day.

But after a time they grew dissatisfied, for they failed to find the
gold mines they had hoped for. And they became discouraged, and
quarreled, and things began to go ill with them.

To make matters worse Captain Gosnold after a few months sickened and
died.

[Illustration]

7. THE AMBUSH


Fortunately for the good of the colonists, who had completely lost heart
and were anxious to give up the undertaking, Captain John Smith soon
became their leader. Ever active and enterprising, he inspired the
others by his example. He vigorously put things in order, and set the
idlers to work to complete their half-finished houses, and to build the
forts to protect them from the Indians, who now showed a warlike spirit.

Next he went off to explore the country, and to trade with the natives
for corn, for the settlers began to lack food.

On one of these expeditions, when he had gone ashore with an Indian
guide, a band of hostile braves, who had been on the watch among the
trees, lay in wait to attack him, led by Opekankano, Pocahontas's uncle,
while he, unconscious of their presence, gave orders to his men to stay
by the boat and keep a sharp lookout for danger.

[Illustration]

8. BATTLE WITH THE INDIANS


Suddenly, in the heart of the deep woods, the stealthy redskins sprang
upon him, shrieking like fierce beasts of prey. And in a moment the
arrows flew thick and fast.

Captain John, though taken unawares, made a brave fight, gravely
wounding two of his enemies with his pistols, and protecting himself
from the arrows by holding his Indian guide in front of him, as a
buckler.

But there were too many against him, and as he could not beat them off
he tried to retreat to the boat, always shielding himself with the
guide. Unfortunately, just as escape seemed near, he stumbled into a
swamp and was held fast by the heavy bog, and chilled by the cold water.
Being thus helpless he was forced to surrender, and the triumphant
Indians seized him as their prisoner.

[Illustration]

9. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH A PRISONER


At first they decided to kill him at once, then some thought it better
to lead him to their village, that the whole tribe might rejoice in the
triumph. But, as one of the Indians shot by the Captain had in the
meantime died, the more impatient clamored for speedy vengeance. So they
bound him to a tree to use as a target.

Now, as the arrows began to strike dangerously near, Captain John, ever
quick-witted and resourceful, brought forth his pocket compass and
showed the Indians the dancing needle; and when they found they could
not touch it, because of the glass, they were amazed, for of course they
had never seen glass before, and could not understand it. A feeling of
awe crept over them; they thought him a magician, and were afraid to
kill him. So at last they marched him off in their midst, through the
forest, to consult with the rest of the tribe as to what should be done
with him.

[Illustration]

10. THE DANCE OF VICTORY


They carried their prisoner from village to village, while at every
moment he looked for death, until at last they came to their great town,
Werowacomo, where king Powhatan lived. And here they celebrated their
victory by savage pomps and conjurations. They tied the Captain to the
ceremonial stake, then, all painted and decorated in their fiercest and
most hideous war paint and trappings, they danced their wild dance of
triumph. Shouting and jumping, they brandished their war clubs in his
face, whirling round and round their captive, like so many demons, each
more frightful than the other. But, since they did not kill him at once,
Captain John, nothing daunted, kept them wondering, by telling strange
stories of the sun, the stars, and the world over the sea, and though
the Indians could understand but little they hesitated, one day feasting
him, and the next threatening to kill.

Now Pocahontas felt sorry for the handsome young stranger, and was drawn
to him, and taught him many words of the Indian tongue, and he told her
of his people beyond the sea, as best he could, and so they became good
friends.

[Illustration]

11-12. POCAHONTAS SAVES CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH'S LIFE


At last, after long deliberation, the Indians decided that, since he had
killed one of their tribe, Captain John must die, for this was their
law. So they dragged him, bound, before the great chief Powhatan, who
sat in mighty state surrounded by his warriors. They stretched the
prisoner on the ground with his head on a large stone, to beat out his
brains with their cruel clubs. And it seemed as though at last the
gallant Captain's time had come. But just as the Indian brave was about
to strike, his great war club swinging high in the air, Pocahontas
rushed forward and threw herself between him and his victim. With her
own body she shielded the Captain from harm, for her heart was moved to
pity for the stranger, and she could not bear that he should die. And
now aroused, with flashing eyes she waved the executioner back. Then she
pleaded with her father that the captive's life be spared.

At once there was wild confusion of shouting and threatening, many
crying, "Kill, kill!" while but few were willing to spare his life, for
the Indians feared the white men, and wished to drive them from the
land.

But Pocahontas, as Princess of the tribe, claimed her right, and would
not yield them up their victim. Then Powhatan, who ruled them all,
raised his hand and stopped their clamor. In sullen silence the angry
warriors awaited his decision. For a moment he hesitated, and the fate
of Captain John hung wavering in the balance. Then, to please his
favorite daughter, whom he dearly loved, he decreed that she should have
her will.

"Let Pocahontas keep the stranger as her own, to make her toys," he
said, for Captain John, during the idle days of weary captivity, had
often whittled curious playthings for the little maid.

And thus was Captain John Smith's life saved by the gentle Indian girl,
and with it the Jamestown colony, for without their sturdy and
resourceful leader the settlers would have lost courage and abandoned
the town.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

13. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH AGAIN FREE


Now, after much feasting, and with savage rite and ceremony, Powhatan
adopted the Captain into the tribe, and made him a chief, and told him
that he might come and go in safety, as one of them; then gave him
guides to take him back to Jamestown, that the red man and the white
should henceforth be friends, since Pocahontas willed it so.

And Captain John thanked the maiden for the great service she had done
him, and, like a gallant knight of old, bent his knee and kissed her
hand as he bade her good-by.

Once again in Jamestown, he found the colony in disorder and panic. All
were on the point of sailing for home, completely disheartened, for they
thought him dead, and feared the Indians. But again he put life into the
enterprise, and set the faint-hearted to work, freed from the fear of
Indian attack, since Pocahontas stood his friend.

[Illustration]

14. POCAHONTAS BRINGS FOOD TO THE COLONISTS


Later, when the settlers were in sore straits for food, for they were
improvident, and managed badly, Pocahontas, always generous and
friendly, learning of their needs, came with her brother Nantaquaus and
her Indians bringing corn, and kept them from starving, while their own
was growing. Captain John in return gave her beads and trinkets to deck
herself, and called her his child, and a firm friendship grew between
them. Often she came and went, bringing peace and welcome food, quite at
home in the little streets of Jamestown. And Captain John Smith in his
writings has said that without her help in times of dire need, and
without her influence for peace, the feeble colony must surely have
perished, either by famine or by the hands of her savage kindred. Much
we owe to the Indian maid who helped so greatly in the early struggles
of the founders of this great nation.

[Illustration]

15. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH GOES IN SEARCH OF CORN


This pleasant state, however, did not last, for, as the settlers became
more firmly fixed in the land, the Indians, fickle and changeable, grew
jealous and resented their intrusion, and refused to sell corn, hoping
by this means to force them away.

Once when Captain John Smith was compelled to go to them in search of
food in the dead of winter, and to break his way through the ice of the
frozen river, they received him coldly, with lowering looks, and only
Pocahontas bade him welcome.

Finally Powhatan joined the discontented, and plotted to destroy Captain
John and his friends by treachery.

[Illustration]

16. POCAHONTAS'S WARNING


To carry out his plan the crafty chief proposed to the Captain that, as
now they were all friends, he and his party should leave their weapons
in the boat. He hoped thus to attack the white men while they were
unarmed.

But Captain John was too cautious a soldier to agree to this, and
answered that, since, as Powhatan had well said, they were all friends,
there could be no harm in keeping their guns with them, as the settlers
considered them a part of their dress. Then Powhatan planned to surprise
them by night. But, just as his trap was well laid, Pocahontas, risking
her own life, stole silently through the deep woods in the dark, cold
night, to the Captain's tent, and, with tears in her eyes, warned him of
his danger, urging him to fly.

Thus forewarned he was on his guard, and, with his soldiers, beat back
his enemies when they came, and even forced them to bring the much
needed corn, by threatening to destroy their village.

And so Pocahontas saved Captain John Smith's life for the second time.

[Illustration]

17. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH SAILS FOR ENGLAND


Always watchful and brave, Captain John Smith worked zealously to make
the colony a success. One day, while returning from treating with the
Indians for a new and better site for Jamestown, he was seriously
injured by the accidental explosion of a bag of gunpowder in his boat.
His clothes were set on fire and he had to throw himself into the river
to escape being burned to death.

His wounds were so grievous that he could no longer govern the colony,
and was forced to sail for England, in a ship just leaving, to seek the
help of a surgeon.

On that day Pocahontas, having heard of the accident, came to the town
with Nantaquaus, to see him. They were only in time to watch the ship
bearing Captain John sail away toward the open sea. Pocahontas little
dreamed that years would pass before they should meet again.

[Illustration]

18. POCAHONTAS IS CAPTURED BY ARGALL


From this day, having lost their leader, things went badly with the
Jamestown colonists, for the dissatisfied Indians, no longer fearing the
heavy hand of Captain John Smith, attacked the settlers, and caused them
serious losses.

And Pocahontas came no more, but waited for his coming again, and waited
in vain. So time passed, and at last she heard that he was dead, for
this was the rumor in the land. And she grieved deeply, and sat often
alone thinking of him, for she had grown to love her warrior Captain.
Some two years after Captain John's departure, came Argall, an
unscrupulous man, who plotted to capture Pocahontas and hold her as a
hostage, to keep the fighting savages quiet. With the help of two
treacherous Indians she was induced to come on board his ship, and once
there was seized and held prisoner.

Powhatan mourned his daughter's loss, and tried to ransom her, but the
crafty Argall would not give her up.

[Illustration]

19. THE MARRIAGE OF POCAHONTAS


She was never allowed to go back to her people, though Nantaquaus came
often to see her at Jamestown. And here she grew to be a woman, and
learned the ways of the English women, and dressed as they did.

At last a young Englishman, John Rolfe, captivated by her dark beauty
and gentle ways, wooed the Indian maid, and as years had passed since
Captain John had gone away, and she had long since thought him dead, she
listened to Rolfe, and consented to marry him, that peace might reign
between her people and the white men.

So they were married in the Jamestown church, and Nantaquaus and a body
of chiefs from her tribe, as well as all the settlers, came to the
wedding. There was great joy in the town, for now the colonists felt
that a good understanding with the Indians was at last established. And
Pocahontas, as before, was the tie that bound them.

[Illustration]

20. THE LANDING OF POCAHONTAS IN ENGLAND


After this the colony prospered. Pocahontas became contented with her
life in the town. And in time a son was born to her. Later, Rolfe, with
his wife and child, sailed to visit England. Pocahontas marveled much at
the extent of the great sea, and the many ships upon its waves.

When they arrived at Plymouth the governor of the town came down to bid
the Indian Princess welcome to England.

With her, as attendant, went Uttamatomakkin, a shrewd old chief, who, in
his war feathers and Indian robes, attracted much attention. He had been
sent by Powhatan to count the English, that he might learn their
strength. And he was to cut a notch in a stick for every man he saw. He
worked hard and fast, but a whole bundle of sticks was notched before he
got even to London, where, with a disgusted grunt, he gave up the task.
"Too many," he said.

[Illustration]

21-22. POCAHONTAS AT THE COURT OF JAMES THE FIRST


Pocahontas's stay in England became almost a triumphal march. Everywhere
she was received with great honor as a foreign Princess, and entertained
with banquets and receptions, and taken to the theatres to see the
plays.

Finally she was presented at court by Lord and Lady Delaware, and
formally welcomed with great pomp and ceremony by King James and his
queen, surrounded by their following of lords and ladies, all arrayed in
their rich costumes of state. And none of the haughty ladies was prouder
or more stately than the Indian bride. Throughout London town her
welcome was the same. The people were curious to see this dark Princess
from another world. And even the high bishops, and the great lords and
ladies, came down in their stately coaches to visit her at her house in
Branford.

To compliment her, many taverns and inns were named "La Belle Sauvage,"
a name still to be found on old London signs.

And as she had done so much to help the struggling English colonists
across the sea, all wished to show their gratitude by greetings, and
festivals in her honor. Old Uttamatomakkin received his share of
attention as well. In his wild dress, with his tawny skin and shining
black hair, he was a strange sight to those who had never before seen a
red American. He was not at all impressed by the king and his richly
dressed nobles, and wondered how they could endure so many clothes, and
greatly preferred his own simple dress, made from the skins of the wild
beasts of his forests.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

23. THE MEETING OF POCAHONTAS AND CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH


And now Captain John Smith, who, during all this time, had been on long
voyages of exploration and adventure, hearing that Pocahontas had come
to England, remembered the old times and all that the little Indian maid
had done for him, and so, attended by some friends, he went down to
Branford to greet her. When Pocahontas saw him a flood of recollection
overcame her, and she was greatly moved. She turned from him, hiding her
face in her hand, and for a long time could not speak. At last she said,
"They told me you were dead."

Then she reproached him for calling her the Lady Rebecca, the name given
her since her marriage, and told him that he should call her child, as
he used to do, and said, "You did promise Powhatan what was yours should
be his, and he the like to you: you called him father, being in his land
a stranger, and by the same reason so must I do you."

But Captain John excused himself, saying, "I durst not now allow of that
title, since the King commands that you be treated as a Princess."

Then Pocahontas answered, "You were not afraid to come into my father's
country, and to cause fear in him and all his people but me, and fear
you here I should call you father? I tell you then I will, and you shall
call me child. And so I will be forever and ever your countryman."

And then, when Pocahontas had grown calmer, these two, after years of
separation, again sat together, and talked long of the old days in
Virginia.

Uttamatomakkin, glad to see an old friend in this strange land, told how
he had been commanded by Powhatan to seek out Captain John, to know the
truth, if he still lived, for they could not believe all the rumors they
heard concerning him.

[Illustration]

24. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH GOES TO SEA AGAIN


After this meeting Captain John became more restless than ever, and soon
set sail again. And when alone upon the deck of his ship he thought
often of the Virginia colony for which he had toiled, and risked so
much, and of Pocahontas, and of her help in his time of need. No doubt
he saw again before him the little Indian girl who had saved his life,
and the maid who brought him succor, and, when the time came, saved him
once more by her warning. And his heart was warmed with gratitude, and
he wished her happiness in her new life. But always for him ambition and
action called. So he sailed away to help found new colonies, this time
to that part of America which he named New England, and where he opened
the way for the Pilgrim Fathers, who afterwards built a new Plymouth in
the new world. From Jamestown and Plymouth other colonies spread along
the coast, until in time they joined hands and formed a new nation, the
United States of America.

[Illustration]

25. POCAHONTAS LONGS FOR HOME


When Captain John had gone, the thoughts of Pocahontas more than ever
turned toward home, and she wearied of the crowded English land, and
longed for her native forests again. Daily she gazed from her window
toward the west, where lay Virginia, and her early life. And she pined,
and thought much of the old days in her native wilds, when into her
sunny life came the golden-haired stranger, with his people, and of the
great changes that had befallen her and her race through that coming.

She often talked with old Uttamatomakkin of Virginia, and of Captain
John, and grew more and more homesick, till her husband became alarmed
lest she fall ill from longing, and he tried to hasten their departure.
They journeyed down to Gravesend, where their ship was lying, but were
compelled to wait while it took on supplies for Jamestown.

At last, however, the good news was brought that the ship was ready.
Preparations were quickly made for the long voyage, and the day was
set.

[Illustration]

26. THE END OF THE STORY OF POCAHONTAS


Though the ship lay ready in the offing, and the sailors had come to
convey them on board, and though at last Pocahontas had turned her face
toward home, alas! it was not to be. A sudden weakness overcame her, and
gently, looking toward the setting sun and Virginia, she quietly fell
asleep,--to rest forever in a foreign land.

From her son, who years after returned to the land of his birth, many
proud families still trace their descent. As long as Virginia lives her
name will be dear to that state. And for us all, who have inherited this
great land, this first page of a nation's history, the story of
Pocahontas and Captain John Smith, with its echo of primitive days, its
romance and dangers, its daring courage and perseverance, will always
mean more than simply a tale of adventure of the little Indian girl and
the gallant soldier.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
