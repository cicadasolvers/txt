Book 39 Malachi
001:001 An oracle:  the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.
001:002 "I have loved you," says Yahweh.  Yet you say,
        "How have you loved us?"  "Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?"
        says Yahweh, "Yet I loved Jacob;
001:003 but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation,
        and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness."
001:004 Whereas Edom says, "We are beaten down, but we will return and build
        the waste places;" thus says Yahweh of Armies, "They shall build,
        but I will throw down; and men will call them 'The Wicked Land,'
        even the people against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever."
001:005 Your eyes will see, and you will say, "Yahweh is great--
        even beyond the border of Israel!"
001:006 "A son honors his father, and a servant his master.
        If I am a father, then where is my honor?
        And if I am a master, where is the respect due me?
        Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name.
        You say, 'How have we despised your name?'
001:007 You offer polluted bread on my altar.  You say, 'How have we
        polluted you?'  In that you say, 'Yahweh's table contemptible.'
001:008 When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn't that evil?
        And when you offer the lame and sick, isn't that evil?
        Present it now to your governor!  Will he be pleased with you?
        Or will he accept your person?" says Yahweh of Armies.
001:009 "Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us.
        With this, will he accept any of you?" says Yahweh of Armies.
001:010 "Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors,
        that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain!
        I have no pleasure in you," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
001:011 For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same,
        my name is great among the nations, and in every place
        incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering:
        for my name is great among the nations," says Yahweh of Armies.
001:012 "But you profane it, in that you say, 'Yahweh's table is polluted,
        and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.'
001:013 You say also, 'Behold, what a weariness it is!'
        and you have sniffed at it," says Yahweh of Armies;
        "and you have brought that which was taken by violence,
        the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering.
        Should I accept this at your hand?" says Yahweh.
001:014 "But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male,
        and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing;
        for I am a great King," says Yahweh of Armies, "and my name
        is awesome among the nations."
002:001 "Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.
002:002 If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart,
        to give glory to my name," says Yahweh of Armies, "then will
        I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings.
        Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay
        it to heart.
002:003 Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on
        your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken
        away with it.
002:004 You will know that I have sent this commandment to you,
        that my covenant may be with Levi," says Yahweh of Armies.
002:005 "My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them
        to him who he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent
        toward me, and stood in awe of my name.
002:006 The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not
        found in his lips.  He walked with me in peace and uprightness,
        and turned many away from iniquity.
002:007 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they
        should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger
        of Yahweh of Armies.
002:008 But you have turned aside out of the way.  You have caused many
        to stumble in the law.  You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
002:009 "Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all
        the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways,
        but have had respect for persons in the law.
002:010 Don't we all have one father?  Hasn't one God created us?
        Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother,
        profaning the covenant of our fathers?
002:011 Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed
        in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness
        of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter
        of a foreign god.
002:012 Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes
        and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him
        who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.
002:013 This again you do:  you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears,
        with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn't regard
        the offering any more, neither receives it with good will
        at your hand.
002:014 Yet you say, 'Why?'  Because Yahweh has been witness
        between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you
        have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion,
        and the wife of your covenant.
002:015 Did he not make one, although he had the residue
        of the Spirit?  Why one?  He sought a godly seed.
        Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal
        treacherously against the wife of his youth.
002:016 For I hate divorce," says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        "and him who covers his garment with violence!" says Yahweh
        of Armies.  "Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you
        don't deal treacherously.
002:017 You have wearied Yahweh with your words.  Yet you say,
        'How have we wearied him?'  In that you say, 'Everyone who does
        evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he delights in them;'
        or 'Where is the God of justice?'
003:001 "Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me;
        and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple;
        and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold,
        he comes!" says Yahweh of Armies.
003:002 "But who can endure the day of his coming?  And who will
        stand when he appears?  For he is like a refiner's fire,
        and like launderer's soap;
003:003 and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will
        purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver;
        and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.
003:004 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant
        to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
003:005 I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
        witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers,
        and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress
        the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless,
        and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don't fear me,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
003:006 "For I, Yahweh, don't change; therefore you, sons of Jacob,
        are not consumed.
003:007 From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from
        my ordinances, and have not kept them.  Return to me,
        and I will return to you," says Yahweh of Armies.
        "But you say, 'How shall we return?'
003:008 Will a man rob God?  Yet you rob me!  But you say, 'How have we
        robbed you?'  In tithes and offerings.
003:009 You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me,
        even this whole nation.
003:010 Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food
        in my house, and test me now in this," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you
        out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough for.
003:011 I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall
        not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall
        your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
003:012 "All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a
        delightful land," says Yahweh of Armies.
003:013 "Your words have been stout against me," says Yahweh.
        "Yet you say, 'What have we spoken against you?'
003:014 You have said, 'It is vain to serve God;' and 'What profit
        is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked
        mournfully before Yahweh of Armies?
003:015 Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness
        are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.'
003:016 Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another;
        and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory
        was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh,
        and who honored his name.
003:017 They shall be mine," says Yahweh of Armies, "my own possession
        in the day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares
        his own son who serves him.
003:018 Then you shall return and discern between the righteous
        and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who
        doesn't serve him.
004:001 "For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all
        the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble;
        and the day that comes will burn them up," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
004:002 But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness
        arise with healing in its wings.  You will go out, and leap
        like calves of the stall.
004:003 You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes
        under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
004:004 "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him
        in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
004:005 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great
        and terrible day of Yahweh comes.
004:006 He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
        and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come
        and strike the earth with a curse."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
