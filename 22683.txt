PREFACE


The original conception and working out of an invention is usually a
labor of love on the part of the inventor: having perfected his
invention in every detail, he finds able and skilled counsel waiting to
prepare and prosecute his application for patent before the Patent
Office Examiner. When the patent is allowed or issued, the patentee's
real work begins--that of turning the patent into money. This is the
business end of the inventor's work, which is generally to his interest
financially to undertake himself, or to have under his immediate
supervision.

The object of this little work, based upon the experience and
observation of the author and other successful inventors, is to give the
patentee such information and advice as will enable him to proceed more
intelligently, on the most successful and economical basis, to realize
from his invention.

The American Government issues annually over thirty-five thousand
patents, a large number of which are offered for sale by their
respective patentees, who in many cases have no definite lines to pursue
in negotiating their patents; many realizing little or nothing from
their inventions through careless or bad management, while others,
through incompetency, drift into the hands of unscrupulous
patent-selling agents only to be swindled.

The numerous inquiries from patentees seeking practical, reliable, and
up-to-date information as to the best and most successful methods of
realizing from the product of their ingenuity, has led the author, after
due deliberation, to prepare and present this work to the American
inventor, with a view of supplying a long-felt want, with the hope that
it will save them many expensive experiments in handling their patents,
and advance them on the road to success.

It has been the endeavor of the writer to cover briefly every subject
that is usually encountered by patentees in disposing of their patents,
not only in the matter of selling, but also in the equally important and
perplexing questions of arriving at the value of patents, legal forms,
statistics, etc., etc.

Realizing that the work may be deficient in many respects, the hope that
it will prove instructive, and the belief that it contains many
practical pointers for patentees is still entertained by

THE AUTHOR.

PRACTICAL POINTERS _for_ PATENTEES




CHAPTER I

DEMAND FOR INVENTIONS OF MERIT


That there is a demand for inventions of merit which can be readily
disposed of at a reasonable profit to the inventor, there can be no
doubt. There perhaps never was a time in the history of our country when
the demand for meritorious inventions was so great as the present. The
conveniences of mankind, in all his varied vocations and callings,
require continual changes and improvements in the apparatuses and
implements used in order to save time, labor, and expense, and to keep
pace with the never-ceasing progress of civilization.

At no time in the past has there been so deep an interest manifested by
the public generally in the inventions of our bright-minded men and
women, and at no time has capital been more readily interested and ready
to invest in any practical improvement which can offer a fair chance of
monopoly under the patent laws.

Business men, capitalists, and manufacturers are ever on the alert for
new and desirable inventions, which will supersede in utility those
which are already on the market. By purchasing such inventions, they
secure novelties which will not only enable them to avoid the keen
competition and to a great extent monopolize the trade in their own
respective lines of business, but also to make sales more easily, and
thus make their business more profitable.

[Sidenote: Monopoly in Patents.]

Every well-informed person knows that a monopoly is the desideratum of
business men. The monopoly or protection of an industry afforded by the
patent laws is, perhaps, the one monopoly that directly benefits the
world. Were it not for the protection and monopoly offered inventors by
governments, for a certain number of years, to disclose their
inventions, inventors would simply keep them secret, or if used at all,
would do so only in such a manner as would prevent the world at large
from learning of or utilizing them, thus debarring the public as a whole
from their benefits. This monopoly in patents has had much to do with
the material progress of the world during the century just ended.

Anyone having a monopoly of a good trade article is assured of a
fortune. If capitalists and manufacturers can secure the control of any
new invention of merit for their sole use and purposes, which can be
manufactured and sold more cheaply than those now on the market, and
which will perform its work in a quicker and better manner than the
devices now in use, they will be only too willing to pay patentees
handsomely for patents covering such inventions.

There are numerous staple articles of commerce whose manufacture is open
to all, and which every mercantile house in the country is handling at a
profit, notwithstanding the great number engaged in their manufacture
and sale in every section of the country. Now, if there can be supplied
some better or cheaper article in any line of industry, the firm or
person who secures the monopoly of its manufacture and sale, simply
controls the market, and human endurance and energy are the only limits
to the degree of profits such a firm or person can secure from the
manufacture and sale of such an article, if adequately protected by a
valid patent.

[Sidenote: Industrial Progress Based on the Patent System.]

In an official report the Commissioner of Patents clearly sets forth
that from six to seven eighths of the entire manufacturing capital of
the United States is either directly or indirectly based upon patents.
This vast amount of money, upward of six thousand millions of dollars,
continually employing great armies of people, in industries based upon
patents of every class, supplies the country with improved articles of
every description. It has been well said that, "Patents and trade go
hand in hand."

The largest and most opulent manufacturers in the country will be found
to be the heaviest owners of patents, developers of inventions, and
patrons of the Patent Office. While all inventions are not telegraphs,
telephones, sewing-machines, or electric lights; nor can all business
houses be Westinghouses, Hoes, McCormicks, Bells, or Edisons, yet all
over this country, and others as well, there are springing up a great
number of moderately large growing firms who, ever on the alert for
success, devise or secure control of some valuable patent, by which they
can successfully invade and control to a certain extent particular lines
of industry.

Nearly every leading factory in the world owes its commencement and
success to the prestige and protection afforded by the possession of a
good and valid patent.




CHAPTER II

INCOME FROM INVENTIONS


It has been aptly said that the products of all the gold, silver, and
diamond mines in the world would not equal in value the annual income of
American inventors. It has been carefully estimated that there are at
least fifty patents in the United States which yield over $1,000,000
annually, some 300 that yield over one-half million, from 500 to 800
which bring from $250,000 to $500,000, and between 15,000 and 20,000
that bring over $100,000 annuities. Besides these, there are thousands
upon thousands of patents which yield yearly more profit to their
fortunate possessors than could be accumulated in a lifetime by a
wage-earner.

[Sidenote: Independence through Successful Invention.]

There are thousands of patents sold outright every year by the patentees
of the United States for thousands of dollars; and, to the already long
list of successful inventors, each year adds many more, who have become
independent through the proper handling of the product of their
ingenuity. Indeed there can hardly be conceived a quicker way for the
average person to attain independence and wealth than by inventing
something of real worth and merit that can be quickly turned into money.
The inventive field is large, and each invention opens up a new field
for improvements, and it is the "improver," without question, that reaps
the greatest benefit from any invention. Owing to the ever forward
progress of civilization, there is no limit to the possible improvements
in the sciences, arts, and manufactures.

[Sidenote: Unprofitable Patents.]

It must, however, be borne in mind that all patents are not
remunerative, neither are all gold mines productive of fortunes, and one
may lose money in patents as well as in any other business. There are
thousands of patents, many having merit no doubt, which have never been
sufficiently brought before the public to test their merits, effect
their sale, or manufacture; this in many instances is owing to
incompetency, or bad management on the part of the patentee or his
agents. There are thousands of other patents that do not prove
remunerative because they do not supply a real want, while still others
are such slight improvements upon existing inventions that they
necessitate such narrow claims, which render the patent of little or no
value. One has only to look over the weekly issue of patents to see many
of the last class.

As before stated, while there are many thousands of patents that do not
pay--and many no doubt cause their owners disaster, as is the case in
any other business or investment; on the other hand, the far greater
proportion of patents granted are productive of handsome profits, if
properly managed.

[Sidenote: Money in Patents.]

That the majority of patents taken out prove lucrative is evident from
the fact that upward of seventy thousand applications for patents and
designs are filed each year in the United States Patent Office, and
approximately eight hundred are granted and issued each week. Probably
about one-fifth of these patentees obtain their patents with a definite
view of manufacturing their inventions, and the remainder obtain theirs
with a view of realizing from the sale of the rights to manufacture.

It may be said, as a general thing, there is more money in small
inventions than in larger ones, from the fact that they can be easily
manufactured anywhere with but little outlay of capital; they usually
fill a general need, and the profit derived from their manufacture is
large, besides the patent is more readily disposed of; while with larger
inventions it requires more money and ability in handling the patent,
and the invention must be unusually promising to justify the erection of
a plant costing thousands of dollars for its manufacture. However, when
large and complicated inventions do pay, they usually pay well.

[Sidenote: Business Capacity of the Inventor.]

It must be remembered that the actual cash value of a patent is not in
the patent itself, but in the sale or use of the monopoly it affords,
and the amount realized from any invention frequently depends upon the
business capacity of the inventor or his agents. Owing to his business
ability, one person may make a fortune out of an unpromising
improvement, while another, through bad or careless management, will
realize little or nothing from a brilliant invention.

Speaking along this line in an official report the chief examiner of the
Patent Office says: "A patent, if it is worth anything, when properly
managed, is worth and can easily be sold for from $1,000 to $50,000.
These remarks only apply to patents of ordinary or minor value. They do
not include such as the telegraph, the planing machine, and the rubber
patents, which are worth millions each. A few cases of the first kind
will better illustrate my meaning:

"A man obtained a patent for a slight improvement in straw cutters, took
a model of his invention through the Western States, and after a tour of
eight months returned with $40,000 in cash or its equivalent.

"Another inventor in about fifteen months made sales that brought him
$60,000, his invention being a machine to thrash and clean grain. A
third obtained a patent for a printing ink, and refused $50,000, and
finally sold it for about $60,000.

"These are ordinary cases of minor inventions embracing no very
considerable inventive powers and of which hundreds go out from the
Patent Office every year. Experience shows that the most profitable
patents are those which contain very little real invention, and are to a
superficial observer of little value."

Under the writer's personal observation has come many instances where
inventors have secured patents on improvements which to a casual
observer would appear insignificant, yet through shrewd management they
have been made to yield princely incomes. Among these one case worthy of
note is that of a young man in Pennsylvania who secured a patent on a
toy game which any person could have thought of, but few would have
considered worth protecting by letters patent. He was offered $1,000 for
the patent by one manufacturer at the outset which he refused, and
afterward he placed it on royalty with quite a number of large
manufacturers throughout the country. He receives but one cent on each
one manufactured, yet his income averages over $12,000 a year. Another
borrowed part of the money with which to obtain a patent on a railway
tie plate, which was bought by a corporation for $25,000, after having
manufactured it for two years on royalty. And many others, who have
realized from one to five thousand dollars on such slight improvements
on which few would have thought worth applying for a patent.

Patentees who would realize any considerable amount from their patents
must not sit down and expect the other fellow to make money out of their
inventions for them.

[Sidenote: Inventions as a Poor Man's Opportunity to Advance.]

Invention is sometimes called the "genius of the poor," and it is a
singular fact that there are a greater number of inventions made by men
and women of limited means than by those whose wealth, education, and
other advantages would seem to have especially fitted them for success
in a field dominated so completely by "brains." This may be explained in
a measure by the fact that people of moderate means are brought into
closer contact with the arts and manufactures, and are thus the first to
discover and improve their defects.

A self-made millionaire, recently speaking to the writer about patents,
said: "I know of no business or vocation requiring so small amount of
capital, and yielding such immense profits as that of invention.
Certainly no person of inventive genius can employ his time and
ingenuity to better or more profitable advantage than to invent
something that is really needed. Many poor men, through the art of
invention, have risen from poverty to reputation, fame, and honor, and
taken high places among noted men of all times.

Our moneyed kings may have enriched themselves by stock jobbing, but
this precarious procedure requires large capital, and the few enormous
fortunes accumulated are merely the monuments marking the graves of
thousands of foolhardy unfortunates caught in the vortex of
speculation."




CHAPTER III

SECURING CAPITAL


It is a curious but well demonstrated fact that people who have
inventive genius often lack the means to carry out their ideas. An
inventor who has ample means can secure his patent and proceed to turn
it into money without the necessity of being compelled to solicit
financial aid from anyone. This, unfortunately, is not generally the
case with inventors; indeed, many are often barely able to stand the
expense incident to taking out the patent. Patentees laboring under this
disadvantage are frequently tempted to part with a small interest in
their patents for the sake of securing sufficient funds to carry on the
promotion of their inventions and sale of the patent; and in doing this
the inexperienced patentee is apt to make the fatal mistake of assigning
to another an undivided interest in his invention.

[Sidenote: Danger in an Undivided Interest.]

Such an assignment may appear well enough on the face of it, and many
patentees have been misled, supposing that under the assignment the
proceeds from the patent should be divided _pro rata_, according to the
several interests. This, however, is not the case in such assignments,
and joint-ownership of a patent, or interest therein, does not of
itself, without an express agreement to that effect, make the parties
partners. They are merely tenants in common, each having the right to
separately make, use, or sell the invention so assigned without
liability to account to their co-owners for any part of the profits
derived from the invention through their own efforts.

In an assignment of an undivided interest, the assignee is afforded an
opportunity of manufacturing, using, and selling to others to be used
the article covered by the patent; also, to grant territorial grants,
such rights being unlimited by the terms of the assignment, and it is
actually of little consequence how small an interest is thus conveyed,
the assignee can proceed with the patent in much the same way as if he
were the sole owner; therefore, whenever it is intended that the
relation of co-partnership shall exist between the patentee and the
assignee of an undivided interest, and that the profits arising from the
invention shall be equitable, for their joint benefit, there must be an
express agreement between them to that effect, otherwise the assignee
will have a decided advantage over the inventor, if he is inclined to be
dishonorable, and there are numerous cases on record where patentees
have virtually lost their patents by such assignments. Patentees should
especially guard against strangers who offer to purchase an undivided
interest in their patents.

[Sidenote: A Better Plan.]

A better procedure to secure means necessary for the development,
introduction, and sale of an invention is to borrow the money from a
friend contingent on the sale of the patent, sell a State or county
right, or enter into a contract with a party willing to furnish the
means for a certain proportion of the proceeds derived from the
invention. Generally speaking, it will not be hard to find a party
willing to advance sufficient means to promote an invention which is
protected by a patent for a certain percentage of the net receipts
arising from its manufacture, sale, or territorial grants, and the
patentee will probably find a person among his own acquaintances who
will not only be glad to furnish the means necessary, but also be of
value to the patentee in realizing from his invention. In any case,
whatever is agreed upon should be put in the form of a contract, or an
agreement, couched in such terms as will leave no doubt as to the
understanding between the parties. The following form secures both
parties, and will be suggestive of others:

  [Sidenote: Form of Agreement.]

  _Whereas_ I, Richard Doe, of Philadelphia, County of
  Philadelphia, and State of Pennsylvania, have invented
  certain new and useful improvements in Telegraph Keys, for
  which I have obtained Letters Patent of the United States,
  bearing date January 1, 1901, and number 000,000, and
  whereas John Roe, of Camden, County of Camden, and State of
  New Jersey, is desirous of obtaining an interest in the net
  profits arising from the sale or working of the said
  invention covered by the said Letters Patent.

  Now, therefore, this indenture witnesseth, that for and in
  consideration of one dollar by each of the parties hereto
  paid to the other, the receipt of which is hereby
  acknowledged, it is stipulated and agreed as follows:

  First, That the said John Roe shall pay all moneys necessary
  to the construction of a suitable model to represent the
  said invention; that he shall pay all necessary expense in
  advertising and bringing said invention before interested
  parties (and such other clauses as may be deemed necessary
  and agreed upon, such as the expense of constructing a
  working model, or carrying out a process, etc.); that he
  shall make diligent effort to promote the said invention,
  its manufacture, and sale.

  Second, That the said Richard Doe, sole owner of said
  invention and Letters Patent, in consideration of the
  payment of the moneys above mentioned, agrees to pay the
  said John Roe twenty-five per cent. (or other amount agreed
  upon) of all the net receipts in any manner arising from
  the sale or working of the said Letters Patent, during the
  term for which said patent is granted.

  Witness our hands and seals this tenth day of January, A.D.
  1901.

                      RICHARD DOE,
                      JOHN ROE.

In the presence of:
  JOHN SMITH,
  THOS. JONES.



[Sidenote: Perfecting Inventions.]

Should an inventor defer the filing of his application until his
invention is fully developed as regards the detail construction and
arrangement of the parts? The best opinion seems to be in favor of the
prompt filing of the application. The final form of the details can best
be determined by the manufacturer and expert machinists and designers,
who appreciate the matter of economical manufacture, which is quite as
essential as the efficiency of the device or machine. Clearly,
therefore, the inventor cannot decide as to all the details; why then
should he delay his application?

The safest course for an inventor is to file his application for a
patent as soon as his invention is complete in its principal features,
so as to conform to the requirement of the Patent Law that an invention
be sufficiently complete to be theoretically operative. The mechanical
details are rarely of great importance as far as the patentable
features of the invention are concerned. Still, it is well to give the
attorney full particulars of whatever details the inventor has in mind.

[Sidenote: Exhibit of the Invention.]

Under the security thus afforded for the main features involved in his
idea, the inventor can proceed more deliberately in perfecting and
improving his invention, and can then file an additional application if
necessary, to secure special protection on particular improvements or
the improved invention as a whole. The early filing of an application
may turn out to be important in securing to the inventor his right of
priority. When the inventor comes to exhibit his invention, with the
idea of bringing it to the attention of the public in general, there is
no question that he should then have his invention in the best form he
can, and in as attractive shape as possible.

[Sidenote: To Avoid being "Squeezed."]

The patentee who proposes to realize from his invention should never let
it be known that he is in want; of course, in some cases he cannot help
himself, but he should endeavor to obtain the necessary assistance from
his acquaintances, and under no circumstances let those with whom he is
trying to deal get an insight into his financial condition, as
capitalists and others will very often take the advantage of an inventor
when known to be in straitened circumstances, and the patentee probably
would not realize as much from his patent as he otherwise could.
Therefore, it is advisable in all cases for the patentee to manifest no
impatience, remain silent as to his financial condition, and strive to
impress those with whom he is dealing that he is in no condition to be
"squeezed."

[Sidenote: Value of Record of Invention.]

Inventors, while working on a complicated machine, should not overlook
the value and importance of keeping a record of the progress of the
development, illustrating it with sketches, signing and dating them with
each new addition, and, when practical, having it witnessed by one or
more persons. This plan is preferred by many inventors to filing a
caveat. Such a record will be found very valuable in case of an
infringement, as it enables the inventor to ascertain the various steps
of his invention, and is a sort of evidence that cannot be impeached.
Such a record of a complicated invention, when the inventor has put much
time and study upon the subject in perfecting it, will also be found
valuable in effecting sales, and in fixing the price of the patent.

[Sidenote: Prejudice against Patents.]

It cannot be denied that at the present time there seems to be in many
sections of the country a strong prejudice against patents, which
sometimes makes it difficult to get people sufficiently interested to
take hold of any patent; especially is this true when the patentee
endeavors to sell his patent piecemeal; that is, by county, township,
shop, or farm rights. No matter how important or valuable the invention
may be, there seems to be a disposition on the part of the public to
look upon such rights as a fraud, and to be very cautious how they
invest in them.

The public is not wholly to blame for this, as in recent years there has
been a class of men who have canvassed the country with patent rights,
not caring what representations they made so long as they were able to
effect a sale; consequently, many people have been lured into purchasing
patent rights for a small territory which in many instances were
worthless or not as represented, causing them to be more or less
skeptical of all patents, as well as to bring this manner of selling
patents generally into ill repute. With manufacturers and capitalists,
this prejudice does not exist to any great extent, as with them the
patent rests solely upon its own merits.

[Sidenote: Newspaper Notoriety.]

Many inventors overlook the importance of interesting newspaper men in
their inventions. This is a matter of great consequence to the inventor
in exploiting his invention, and should be given some attention.
Newspapers desire items of interest of every description, and readers
are usually interested in brief accounts of any new invention
possessing novelty or merit; so that when the inventor once gets his
invention into the newspapers it is generally copied by other papers,
with the result that the invention gets a large amount of free
advertising and publicity. These items frequently attract the attention
of capitalists, manufacturers, and others, and at once put the invention
in a favorable position before the public as could be done possibly in
no other way--certainly in no cheaper way.

Many of the trade journals and other periodicals are also open to
receive technical descriptions of inventions of merit concerning
industrial improvements. Such articles should be written in good form,
containing not over five hundred or a thousand words, and if admitted to
this class of publications will be of the utmost value and importance in
creating favorable public opinion, and in advancing the inventor's
interests.

With hardly an exception, if an invention strikes editors favorably and
is adjudged to be of sufficient interest to form an article of news in
newspapers, or of sufficient merit to warrant a description in the trade
papers, it is pretty certain to prove a success and bring the inventor
large returns.

If the invention is of such a character as to strike newspaper men
unfavorably, the inventor can resort to the advertisement columns;
using the large daily papers, or such publications which in some way
relate to the industry to which the patent appertains, and such as have
the largest circulation among the class of people it is desired to
reach. See about advertising on page 46.




CHAPTER IV

HOW TO ARRIVE AT THE VALUE OF A PATENT


Most inventors are not concerned so much about the fame or honor their
inventions will bring them, or how much their inventions will advance
civilization, or build up a nation, or administer to the conveniences
and pleasures of mankind generally, as they are about how much it will
net them in dollars and cents; but the patentee should not lose sight of
the fact that the profits are in the exact proportion to the actual
usefulness of the invention, and its general adaptability. It is
immaterial whether the inventor himself intends to deal with the public,
or to deal with a man or set of men who are afterward to deal with the
public, the conditions are the same, and the profits must ultimately
come from the sale of the manufactured article.

[Sidenote: Pecuniary Value.]

It may seem superfluous to say that mere Letters Patent aside from an
invention is of no value, though many inventors are under the erroneous
impression that if an invention possesses patentability, it must also
necessarily have pecuniary value. To be of any pecuniary value
whatever, the invention must cover something for which there is a
demand, or for which there can be a demand created, for it cannot be
disputed, that if an invention will not bring in money by manufacturing
it, it is, in a financial sense, worthless; and the patent thereon is
therefore worth some seventy or eighty dollars less than nothing.

[Sidenote: Commercial Value.]

An invention, to have commercial value, as previously stated, must cover
something for which there is a demand, or for which there can be a
demand created. It may be an entirely new device, or it may be an
improvement upon an existing invention, but in any event it must contain
a certain degree of utility. In rare cases inventors are able to hit
upon an invention in an entirely new field; for these a demand has to be
created. For improvements, however, as a general thing, the demand
already exists; then the important question arises in determining the
commercial value of the patent. "Does the invention in question possess
sufficient merit to successfully compete with existing devices of the
same class?" In order to do this, it must be of a simpler or cheaper
construction, so that it can be manufactured and put on the market at a
lower figure; or, it must yield better results, work quicker and at less
expense, or economize power, labor, or time. A patented improvement
upon an article that can be sold more cheaply, or one which will yield
better results than those now selling well on the market, has a decided
commercial value and can easily be disposed of at a good price. If the
inventor be fortunate enough to combine both of these features in his
invention, the value is doubled and success certain.

[Sidenote: Basis for Estimation.]

Perhaps one of the hardest questions that confronts the patentee is how
to arrive at a just valuation of his patent, and to know just exactly
what he should receive for it. This is a very important question, and
one which should be looked into before undertaking negotiations.
Patentees should not, of course, undervalue their patents, or accept the
first small offer made for fear of not receiving another; at the same
time, they should not fall into the common error of asking a price that
cannot be obtained, which too frequently precludes all chances of a
sale. Many business men would rather lose the patent than waste their
time constantly dickering about an unreasonable price.

Inventors should be reasonable in their demands, and consider that the
purchaser must have a fair share of the profits. He cannot expect to
realize all there is in the patent himself. Indeed, patentees usually
find that men willing to establish a business on the basis of their
untried patents will require the greater bulk of the profits to be
derived from it.

[Sidenote: General Rules for Valuation.]

It is evident that only the most general rules for valuation can be
given, as each invention must be studied and valued strictly upon its
own merits. Undoubtedly, the best and most practical method of
ascertaining the value of any invention which is susceptible of being
manufactured on a small scale is to have a limited quantity of the
articles manufactured--say five hundred or a thousand--and try the
experiment of introducing them in a small territory; that is, in a
certain county, city, or town, taking great precaution in selecting a
person who is capable of carrying forward the business in a
business-like manner. This method demonstrates conclusively whether or
not the invention will meet with success, and with these figures at hand
the patentee will be prepared to prove, to the satisfaction of
interested parties, just what the patent is really worth.

This method of procedure not only enables the patentee to get a just
valuation of his patent, but also puts it in a more favorable position
to be sold; since the commercial value is known and established, it no
longer remains an experiment. Interested parties can take their
calculations from these figures, and the patentee can exact a price in
proportion to the success of the trial experiment.

In order to thus demonstrate the value of a patent, the patentee must
possess and advance the necessary means to carry it forward, though, if
the experiment prove at all successful, the profits derived from the
articles sold will in nearly all cases more than offset the expense
incurred. This is a very popular course with inventors, especially in
handling small inventions, known as novelty or specialty patents.

If the patentee have not the means to successfully demonstrate the value
of his patent by actual trial, as above outlined, then the next best
course would be to inquire among reliable manufacturers and ascertain
the lowest price for which the invention can be manufactured in large
quantities, and the highest price at which it will retail; and then, by
carefully studying the market, the patentee should be able to estimate
the amount of competition, cost of selling, probable number of sales,
interest on the investment, etc., and on these figures base the price he
should receive for the patent, being careful to allow the purchaser a
liberally fair profit.

While there are at present about ninety-five million inhabitants in the
United States, it is scarcely probable that any invention has yet or
ever will be made that will reach half this number of people. With an
article of the most general adaptability, including both sexes, the
inventor can hardly hope to reach more than a fourth of the entire
population, though, of course, the invention may be subject to regular
consumption, so that the people reached would naturally purchase the
article again a number of times during the course of a year.

The statistics in the last chapter are given with the view of assisting
patentees in determining what proportion of the population will likely
want their inventions, and to enable them to estimate prices. In
estimating the price to ask for a patent, patentees should not conceive
and hang their hopes upon fabulous prices and immediate wealth, which
too often dooms ambitious inventors to bitter disappointment; they
should rather endeavor to look at their inventions from the purchaser's
stand-point, and try to see it in the light in which others view it. It
may be well to remember that the million mark of patents issued in the
United States, including re-issues and designs, was passed in 1911, and
it is quite probable that any one inventor may not have the only good
thing in the line of patents.

[Sidenote: How Rating for Royalty Is Figured.]

Many patents are more profitable by being placed upon royalty than by
any other means, and quite often the patent can be placed this way when
it is not possible to sell outright at a satisfactory price. In
determining what royalty the patentee should receive, he should
carefully estimate, in connection with the probable number of sales,
what profit the manufacturer can probably make on each, or a number of
the articles containing the patented improvements, and should require
about twenty-five per cent. of the profits as royalty. Another method
used by some inventors is to ascertain the price at which the article
can be retailed, and figure the royalty at between one-twentieth and
one-tenth of the retail price. Either of the above should give the
approximate figure to ask for exclusive royalty contracts. For
non-exclusive rights the patentee should ask about one-half of that for
exclusive rights.

[Sidenote: Stock in Stock Companies.]

There is another class of patents that can be best realized from by
organizing the proper kind of joint stock companies, and manufacturing
the invention, the inventor taking a certain amount of the stock and
assigning the patent to the company. The patentee should receive between
one-fourth and one-half of the capital stock in consideration of his
assigning his patent and rights to the company.

The inventor should see that a good portion of the stock is subscribed
for and the amount actually paid into the treasury of the company before
making the assignment. As a rule, inventors' stock is full paid and
non-assessable.

[Sidenote: Prices for Territorial Rights.]

In calculating the prices for territorial rights, the application of the
invention to that section must be taken into consideration, as well as
the advancement in manufacturing, etc. If the invention belongs to that
class of inventions which may be generally adapted in all States alike,
such as domestic articles and articles of wearing apparel, then the
population will form a very satisfactory basis for valuation.

There are other inventions, however, that apply almost wholly to a
certain section of the country, while still others apply more to one
section than to another; thus, for instance, mechanical contrivances of
the higher order, such as writing machines, mathematical instruments,
etc., the North and East are the most valuable; for mining and
agricultural implements, etc., the West; while such as the cotton-gin,
seeders, and presses apply almost wholly to the South. States and
counties having large cities and large towns are also usually more
valuable than other States and counties of same population.

[Sidenote: Valuation Tables.]

The following tables are given as a general estimate of the relative
value of the different States and divisions in the majority of cases;
however, these tables are only arbitrary at best, and cannot be applied
to all classes of inventions satisfactorily, though they may serve to
materially aid the patentee in determining what price to put upon each
State in his own case. Having determined the value of the patent as a
whole, the aggregate of the State prices should be about two-thirds
more, as there are always some States that cannot be sold separately,
while others may have to be sold at a discount.

CHAPTER V

HOW TO CONDUCT THE SALE OF PATENTS


While the inventor may put much hard study upon his invention and make
many costly experiments, this part of his work is usually a pleasure;
and in securing the patent he invariably has able counsel in his
attorney with no anxiety on his part; but with the commercial proceeding
of selling his patent, which involves the greatest prudence and care in
managing, it is different, and here is where the inventor's real work
begins if he expects to reap the benefit of his invention.

[Sidenote: Patent-selling Agencies.]

For the benefit of unexperienced patentees it is deemed expedient to
give a word of warning here regarding the host of so-called
patent-selling agencies, which under various imposing titles, coupled
with an apparently honest and straightforward method of business, tempt
each patentee, upon the issue of his patent, to place the same in their
hands and authorize them to negotiate the sale thereof. Their
propositions are very attractive and temptingly prepared; their offers
appear to be "gilt edge"; their circulars are high-sounding and
rose-colored; their contracts are formal looking, and drawn up in an
impressive way, highly advantageous to the patentee; but it will be
noted in all cases that they will require the patentee to pay down a
certain sum under some pretence,--such as to cover the cost of
advertising the patent, to have circulars printed, to secure copies of
the patent for distribution, to have a cut made illustrating the
invention, or for membership fee, and so on, it matters not what, so
long as it is an advance fee. Many will also agree to sell both the
United States and Canadian patents, if the patentee will file the
Canadian application through them; it is evident, however, that this is
only a scheme to get the patentee to take out the Canadian patent
through them--they having no facilities for disposing of either of the
patents.

The writer is not prepared to say that there are no honestly conducted
patent-selling agencies, but from long experience and observation, has
never known where a patentee was ever materially benefited by placing
his interests in the hands of these concerns, and has yet to learn of
them ever making a sale solely through their own efforts. Very few of
these concerns have any facilities whatever for selling patents; all of
their time being taken up in mailing their weekly circulars to inventors
immediately upon the publication of the _Official Gazette_, and working
inventors up to the remitting point which usually ends the matter so
far as they are concerned, unless they believe they can get another fee
out of the patentee.

There may be exceptions, but patentees should fully satisfy themselves
as to the integrity of these firms before placing business in their
hands, as the Assistant Commissioner of Patents in his report in the
Webberburn case, 81 O. G., 191 K, clearly pointed out that the methods
of these concerns were such as to sell the patentees rather than their
patents.

[Sidenote: The Patentee the Best Selling Agent.]

That the patentee himself is the best selling agent there can be no
doubt, for he is familiar with the construction and operation of his
invention in every detail, and knows its merits and superior points far
better than anyone else, besides manufacturers and others wishing to
purchase patents invariably desire to deal with the patentee himself.
Business men, it may be said as a rule, do not think very much of an
invention which the inventor has abandoned to others to negotiate,
moreover the personal push of the inventor is, in nearly all cases,
essential to the successful termination of a sale.

Subtract the personal energy and presence of the inventor from the
successful inventions of the past and of to-day, and the chances are
that they would not have succeeded as they did. It is not only a
question of material interest, but also of enthusiasm and confidence,
and each patentee, having but one patent or a set of patents to push,
can lend thereto that individual attention which insures good work and
success.

[Sidenote: In Case the Patentee Cannot Undertake the Selling.]

However, if from any reason the patentee is unable to handle his own
invention and must engage the services of an agent or salesman, he
should select one from among his own acquaintances, in whom he has
confidence. He should if possible get a person who has had experience in
the line of the invention, as such a person would likely understand it
and the trade better than others. It is not really necessary that he
should have had experience in selling patents; if he is a good talker,
knows how to approach business men, and thoroughly understands the
invention, he will probably make money for the inventor and himself. The
patentee should have him submit all offers of value for his
consideration, and should not give the agent power to sign or collect.
The patentee should name a reasonable price for the patent, allowing the
agent a liberal commission upon the price, and encouraging the agent by
allowing him a certain percentage of all he may be able to get over and
above the price named. This will encourage the agent to work for the
highest price obtainable. The inventor should make every effort to be
able to personally attend to the details of selling, and keep the
business under his personal supervision.

[Sidenote: Methods of Selling Patents.]

There are a number of plausible methods to which the patentee may resort
in disposing of his patent without the aid of questionable selling
agents, and it is the purpose of the following pages and succeeding
chapter to set forth such methods as have in the past proved beneficial
to patentees; those along which success have been achieved, and such as
are employed by the most successful inventors of the present time in
handling their patents.

It is true that no definite method or system can be given that will
apply to all patents alike, as the method in each case will depend more
or less upon the character of the invention, and to the particular art
to which it belongs; however, from the following pages the patentee
should be able to judge what particular methods will best apply to his
individual case, and proceed along these lines.

There are many patents issued which the patentees thereof can as
successfully dispose of from the smallest hamlet in the United States as
from New York, Chicago, or any of our larger cities, while, of course,
there are others which only those directly connected with the largest
and wealthiest corporations can hope to dispose of successfully. The
main thing is not to become discouraged or give up until one succeeds
in making a sale.

[Sidenote: About Advertising.]

To make the merits and importance of an invention publicly known is, in
many cases, one of the best ways of bringing about the introduction and
sale of a patent. If the inventor has a patent on an invention that
manufacturers or others want, and can make its merits and superior
qualities known to them, negotiations will soon follow. There is no way
for patentees to place themselves in communication with prospective
investors quite equal to an advertisement in the proper medium. Here it
may be well to state that patentees who decide to advertise their
patents for sale or otherwise should place their advertisements in
publications of known standing, such as the leading daily newspapers. A
brief, well-worded advertisement in the "Business Opportunities" column
of these papers bring quick and good results, though, perhaps a better
class of inquiries may be obtained by advertising in the trade journals
of the class to which the invention relates, and while the trade
journals may not bring about as many inquiries as the dailies, those
that answer will be more apt to be interested and talk business. Either
of the above are good mediums, but in advertising patents for sale
patentees should carefully avoid those publications that are published
at uncertain intervals, and usually for the express purpose of
circulating among inventors for various purposes. They do not reach the
class of people that invest in patents. Inventors should know the class
of people that would be likely to become interested in their inventions,
and advertise in such mediums as have the largest circulation among that
class.

[Sidenote: How to Write an Advertisement.]

In the construction of an advertisement there is often too much waste by
using too much verbiage, too many unnecessary words or sentences,
sometimes too much display. Prudence in the arrangement, and care in
editing an advertisement, will save much expense. The size of an
advertisement of this class has really little to do with its pulling
qualities.

The statements should be assuming, and at the same time truthful, as any
deception in an advertisement is sure to work an injury. There should
not be more claimed in the advertisement than sounds reasonable, even
though it be stating facts; if an advertisement sounds unreasonable it
will not have the desired result. Inventors sometimes become so
enthusiastic over their inventions that they exaggerate unintentionally.
A good rule is for the inventor to read over the advertisement, and ask
himself, "If this statement was read by me, would I believe it; would it
convince me?" etc.

Putting one's self in the purchaser's place is always one of the best
factors in writing good advertisements. The inventor should put himself
in the place of the purchaser of the patent, and reason what would
induce him to investigate its merits; what would likely cause him to
take it up, and so on; he should think and write fully along these
general lines, incorporate these reasons into an advertisement; then
boil it down by cutting out the unnecessary words and sentences; prune,
remodel, and rewrite until he has a brief advertisement, clear, concise,
and to the point.

[Sidenote: Correspondence as a Means of Bringing Patents before
Interested Parties.]

While to advertise, as suggested in the foregoing pages, would require a
very moderate outlay, and be, perhaps, the better course to pursue:
however, in connection with it, or if the patentee does not feel that he
can afford the expense of advertising, a very good plan is for him to
secure copies of a number of the trade journals of the class to which
his invention relates, and carefully look over the advertisements
therein, and select a list of such manufacturers as would seem likely to
be induced to purchase the patent in question, or manufacture the
article on royalty. In this manner the patentee will probably get the
best up-to-date list obtainable, and it may be set down as a fact, with
very few exceptions, that if manufacturers and dealers who make and
handle just such articles as the patent calls for cannot be interested,
it is very hard to interest others not engaged in such line, except when
the invention is large, and requires a great deal of capital to work the
same.

[Sidenote: How to Correspond with Manufacturers.]

To each of the parties of the list thus selected, or to a number of
them, the inventor should write a well-composed and convincing letter
setting forth the invention in its best light, and stating just why it
would be to the interest of the parties solicited to investigate the
same. Some time should be spent on this letter before attempting to
write it, and the writer should weigh well in his own mind what would be
best to say, and the proper way of expressing it. He should be as brief
as possible, consistent with legibility. The statements should be
assuming, yet in every respect true. He should state in brief terms just
what the invention is, what it will do, the points and advantages it
has, and at the same time endeavoring to get the parties interested so
that they will inquire into the invention, rather than attempt to come
to terms in the first letter.

The letter should be brief and pointed, and plainly written upon
business-size paper; and if the inventor has a typewriter, or access to
one, he should use it. If he has printed circulars he should send one
with his first letter, which will enable him to make the letter briefer
and more business-like.

In correspondence it is well not to name a price until the parties are
interested, and first endeavor to get them to make an offer. The
patentee should be patient and should not expect to jump right into a
bargain at once. If the invention is a meritorious one there will be
more than one of the manufacturers to whom the patentee may write, who
will become interested, and when such a state exists, the patentee can
begin to be more exacting as to his demands since competition has been
created between the manufacturers.

[Sidenote: Circulars.]

A few dollars invested in circulars will frequently be found of great
value to the patentee if he intends to negotiate the sale of his patent
mainly by advertising and correspondence, as they will save a great deal
of writing and explaining as well as appear more business-like and
attractive, and may be the means of more readily effecting a sale.

[Sidenote: Illustrations.]

If the patentee can afford the additional expense of an illustration, it
will greatly increase the appearance of the circular, and make it more
readily understood and interesting. The cut should be neat and set forth
the invention in its best light. It would be better to entrust the
procuring of the cut to the printer, for he will know just what is
wanted and can secure the same at a better price. A sufficient number
of well printed circulars, with illustration, can be obtained of any
printer for a few dollars.

[Sidenote: About Getting up Circulars.]

The circulars should be attractive, convincing, and logical; nicely
arranged, and neatly printed upon good paper. A mistake is often made in
sending out trashy-looking circulars, poorly printed upon cheap paper;
they repel rather than attract, and do not have the desired effect.

The circular should have good head-lines so as to attract the attention
of its recipient at a glance, and his interest should be held by having
the uses and advantages of the invention well written.

Many of the pointers suggested in advertising and letter-writing will
equally apply to the writing and getting up of the circulars, and need
not be treated further here, except that the patentee should dwell
especially upon the merits of the invention, its uses, and advantages
over like articles. This should be done in the most interesting manner
possible, describing it so that its value will be fully understood.

[Sidenote: Uses of Printed Copies.]

It will be well for the patentee to order some printed copies of his
patent, as manufacturers and others usually ask for them if interested,
in order that they may examine the patent, or have an expert to examine
it, to ascertain its validity, novelty, and what protection is really
afforded by the patent. It cannot be denied that in either case the
invention will suffer a cold-blooded rigid examination, and must stand
or fall solely upon its merits. If, however, the invention is adjudged
to have real merit and properly protected by the Letters Patent,
business negotiations will likely begin, and the patentee will perhaps
speedily make a satisfactory deal.

[Sidenote: First Impressions All-Important.]

Some inventors use printed copies of their patents instead of circulars,
but, while they fully set forth the invention in a technical way, it
cannot be said that in all cases it is advisable to send copies of the
patent until called for. Many parties who become interested in patents
are not familiar with mechanical drawings and technical specifications,
and very often do not get a very favorable impression from a copy of the
patent; and it is very important that the first impressions should be
favorably created, for upon this much will depend. If parties become
sufficiently interested to fully investigate an invention, they are very
apt to form a favorable opinion of it.

[Sidenote: Value of Models.]

There is no way of so easily creating a favorable impression and gaining
the interest in an invention as by a neat and perfect working model of
the invention. Man never loses the child-love for toys, and a perfect
miniature machine of any description will attract more attention than
one of full size. With a model the inventor has the full and immediate
attention of his prospective purchasers at once. If the patentee, or his
agent, intends visiting manufacturers, or to sell the patent by
territorial rights, he will find a model of his invention almost
indispensable.

Inventors should be very careful about sending models to unknown
parties, and should mark the number of the patent and their name and
address upon the model. It should invariably be understood in advance
who is to pay the transportation charges, before sending a model with
any charges to collect.

While models are very helpful in setting forth an invention and making
sales, high prices exclude many inventors from their use. Model-makers
usually charge fifty cents per hour for each man working upon the model,
and market price for the material used; from these figures the inventor
may make a rough estimate of what a model of his invention will cost.

[Sidenote: Working Drawings.]

Working drawings are different from those forming a part of the patent
in that they are more detailed, giving the size of each piece and the
material of which it is constructed. While working drawings are not
quite as expensive as models, they do not show the invention to the
advantage that models do, and are of little value to those who do not
understand them. On the other hand, working drawings have the advantage
of being easily sent through the mails, and can be duplicated at small
cost. Manufacturers prefer working drawings to models in quoting prices
on manufacturing the invention in quantities.




CHAPTER VI

HOW TO CONDUCT THE SALE OF PATENTS--_Continued_


In conducting the sale of patents, the greatest difficulty is most
frequently experienced in getting manufacturers or others sufficiently
interested to look into the merits and possibilities of the invention.
If the inventor can get the parties to actually consent in their own
minds to the proposition of taking up the invention, the question of
terms and conditions can soon be arranged. Until the parties solicited
can see beyond a doubt that there is large profits in it for them, the
price of the patent is out of the question; therefore, the first step is
to demonstrate its merits and commercial value, and get the parties
thoroughly interested.

Patentees should not labor under the impression that because a patent is
offered at a very low price that it will be quickly snapped up as a
bargain; as before stated, if a patent will not bring in money by
manufacturing and selling the article, it is worthless; and its real
value is in exact proportion to the amount of profits that can be made
from its manufacture.

Should the patentee find that his patent has no commercial value, it is
almost useless to spend more time and money in trying to realize
anything from it; he had better start again, and endeavor to invent
something that has value and can be sold.

[Sidenote: Value of Personal Influence.]

Inventors should use the full extent of their personal influence to
spread particulars of their inventions as far as possible, for this
indirect work is often a leading factor in creating a favorable
impression that frequently results in the adaption of an invention.

However unacquainted he may be in a business way, every patentee can,
more or less, in his immediate neighborhood, consult with merchants,
friends, and others in the line of his invention, who can post him upon
the right parties to submit the patent to, and the best way to see them
about it, and perhaps go with him to visit such as might be interested
in the invention.

[Sidenote: Personal Solicitation Advisable.]

In nearly every case it is more satisfactory for the patentee to call on
the manufacturers or interested parties personally whenever it is
possible for him to do so. This brings about a more satisfactory
understanding between them. Many inventors, however, prefer opening up
communication by correspondence, and after the parties manifest a
willingness or desire to look into the invention more closely, then
arrange to visit them personally.

Having determined upon a visit, the patentee should endeavor to get a
friend known by the parties to go with him to make their acquaintance.
If the friend cannot go with the patentee, he will probably give him a
note of introduction. It may happen that his friend does not know the
parties whom the patentee wishes to see, in that event he may know of
someone who does, to whom he can introduce the patentee and who in turn
may either go with him or arrange to make him known to the parties
solicited. An introduction, of course, is not absolutely necessary, but
it invariably has a good effect and is generally worth the effort.

The patentee should be prepared to make a straightforward, business-like
presentation of his invention by means of a suitable model or drawings;
carefully explaining its merits and advantages, showing as clearly as
possible just what the value of the invention is and what can be made
out of it, and giving tangible reasons why it would be to the interest
of the parties solicited to invest in the patent. If the patentee is
dealing with a manufacturer it is well to point out not only the
possible advantage he may have by securing the control of the patent,
but also the possible loss that his business may suffer by allowing one
of his competitors to obtain its control. Many businesses have been
hopelessly crippled by an enterprising firm securing control of a good
patent and introducing a like article that can be sold cheaper, or one
that will do its work in a better and more satisfactory manner.

[Sidenote: Selling Outright.]

Many inventors prefer to sell their patents outright; that is, in
consideration of a specified sum of money the patentee assigns his
entire interest in the patent, in the same manner that a person would
sell a piece of real estate. This is a very good method and one of the
quickest ways for the patentee to turn his invention into money, though
it must be remembered that to sell a patent outright is usually for a
very much smaller sum than could be realized if handled by other
methods.

The day for obtaining enormous sums or fortunes from the sale of a
patent outright is past; at present to realize any considerable amount,
the patentee generally has to share in the risks as well as the profits,
unless the invention is very highly developed, and even then he cannot
expect to get as much out of an outright assignment as he could by
sharing in the success of the invention commercially. If, however, the
patentee is content to take the utmost cash his patent will bring him
outright, he is assured of a principal or lump sum, free from any
chances of the article not selling well when placed upon the market.

Before signing and delivering the assignment, the patentee will, of
course, see that he has the consideration, or its equivalent, for which
the assignment is made. If the transaction is made through
correspondence he should send the assignment duly executed to the
purchaser through the bank or express C. O. D. for the amount.

[Sidenote: Assigning an Undivided Interest.]

In a preceding chapter, the dangers and disadvantages of an undivided
interest are set forth, and it cannot be considered a wise course under
any consideration to part with any undivided interest in the
proprietorship of the patent, unless unusually well paid, or there
exists an agreement of copartnership between the patentee and the
assignee. By such an assignment, no matter how small, the patentee loses
control of his patent.

[Sidenote: Dividing a Patent into Different Classes of Rights.]

Many patents, from the nature of the invention, can be subdivided into
different classes of rights, and each class sold or granted separately
as the patentee may choose. Thus, the patentee of a tire, or other
appliances for a bicycle, could license one party to make the same for
bicycles and another for automobiles. In like manner a car-coupler could
be divided between those who build railway equipments and those who
build street-cars, and so on.

Goodyear, the inventor of the process of vulcanizing rubber, divided
his patent up into many different rights, licensing one company for
manufacturing rubber combs, licensing another for hose pipes, another
for shoes, another for clothing, and a number of other different rights,
for which each company or partner paid a tariff. Lyall, inventor of the
continuous loom, also divided his patent into many different rights; one
company weaving carpets, another corsets, another bags, another
sheeting, etc.

In every case where the invention covers articles not in the same line
of manufacture, the patentee should not fail to divide the rights into
different classes, granting each party only such rights as they may be
interested in. In this way the patentee can quite often double or treble
the receipts from his invention.

The patentee may, if he desires, have his machines built and require the
purchasers to pay him a regular annual rental on each machine, or a
tariff upon the goods produced, in addition to the price of the machine.
Companies are sometimes organized to manufacture an invention, and
employ travelling men to place the article on annual rental instead of
selling.

[Sidenote: Selling by Territorial Rights.]

Another method is to sell State and county rights. This consists of a
license whereby the patentee, in consideration of a certain sum of money
paid him, grants unto another person or persons the exclusive right to
make and sell the invention, and to authorize others to make and sell
the same, within a specified territory, during the life of the patent.
This plan of disposing of a patent has often been highly profitable, but
it must be said that these territorial sales have been conducted in such
a manner in the past, as to bring the whole system of selling patent
rights into disrepute, and in recent years patentees have found some
difficulty in making sales in this way, unless the device is of unusual
great novelty and attraction to householders or the general public.

Occasionally, however, there are patents issued for meritorious
inventions that are susceptible of this mode of procedure, and which can
be disposed of to the greatest advantage by territorial grants. Such
inventions as household novelties possessing great merit and utility
have been most successfully placed upon this plan, but it must be
remembered that the value of the system rests upon its capabilities of
effecting sales of the manufactured article to a vast proportion of the
people.

In selling territorial rights it is a mistake to begin with the small
places with the idea of working the business up and effecting larger
sales on the basis of the smaller ones; it is better to shove the sales,
as much as possible in the start, and after the more valuable portion
of the territory is disposed of, proceed with the balance until it
ceases to be profitable.

Experience teaches that it is usually advisable to accept any reasonable
offer made for a small right, even if it does not come up to the
patentee's estimate of its value, as he has plenty of other territory
left, and may lose much time and money in finding another in the same
territory willing to pay more; besides, the purchaser of such a right
may, by his energy and good judgment, advertise the invention in such a
way as to greatly benefit the patentee in making further sales.

Some patentees employ good and reliable special agents to travel and
dispose of the patent rights; others advertise for and appoint State
agents to sell their respective county rights. In either case these
agents expect to make money by the operation, and require a liberal
proportion of the proceeds for their remuneration; generally speaking,
they will require about one-third the selling price, unless the patentee
can show that the rights will sell readily, in which case the rating can
be made lower.

[Sidenote: Granting Licenses.]

The patentee may also sell licenses under his patent; that is, in
consideration of a certain sum, the patentee licenses a manufacturer to
make the invention at his own place of business; it being a personal
privilege and is not transferable unless its terms so state.

Unless there are a great many manufacturers in the line of industry to
which the patent relates, and unless the invention has real merit so
that it will be readily adapted by the manufacturers, the patentee
cannot hope to realize any considerable amount from selling shop-rights
alone. As a general thing, patents for mechanical inventions can be
disposed of to better advantage by other means, or by selling
shop-rights in connection with other methods; for example, if the
patentee was selling his patent by territorial grants, he might grant
shop-rights in such territory as he has not sold; or if he is placing
the patent upon non-exclusive royalty contracts, he could grant
shop-rights in such portions of the territory as he does not contemplate
using otherwise.

Some inventions, such as methods or processes, as a general rule, have
to ultimately be sold by licenses. Such patents can be employed most
profitably by selling licenses, county and State rights; thus, in the
case of a method of constructing fences, the patentee could sell State
and county rights to parties, who in turn could grant farm rights, etc.

[Sidenote: Placing upon Royalty.]

The license and royalty plan is perhaps the best and most popular method
with inventors for realizing from their inventions. This, in effect,
involves a contract between the patentee and the manufacturer, by which
the latter in consideration of a license to manufacture the article
covered by the patent, agrees to pay the patentee a certain specified
sum as royalty for each article manufactured or sold bearing the
patented improvement.

Placing a patent on royalty is ordinarily taking chances, but if the
patentee has full confidence in his article selling well, he should by
all means take royalty in preference to selling the patent in its
entirety. Many valuable patents are sold by their owners for from $1,000
to $10,000, which yield the purchasers, when the article is on the
market and selling well, as much as $25,000 annually in profits. This
calls to the author's mind a patent for which at the outset was
doubtfully offered $3,000, but before the negotiations terminated, the
patentee succeeded in placing it upon an exclusive royalty basis. The
royalties paid to the patentee during the first four years amounted to
over $50,000, and the manufacturers subsequently made an offer of
$100,000, for the patent.

In making royalty contracts with parties, the patentee should
investigate the standing, rating, and capabilities of the manufacturer,
and, above all, should be certain that the parties have the right motive
in view, and that the contract is so drawn that it will fully protect
his own interests. Many patentees have been caught by manufacturers
offering large royalties for the sole purpose of gaining possession of
the patent, that they might pigeon-hole it, in order to keep the article
out of the market, so that the sale of some similar article in which
they are interested would not be interfered with by the introduction of
a similar or better article, such as the patent anticipates.

There are others who propose and make royalty contracts with patentees
with no other object than that of making the special tools, patterns,
dies, etc., for which they charge the patentee an extortionate price.

The best and safest way for the patentee to guard against having his
patent tied up is to bind the parties to do certain things in the way of
pushing the sales, making the necessary tools at their own expense, and
commencing its manufacture within a reasonable time, paying an advance
royalty, or annexing some such condition to the agreement by which they
will be the loser should they fail to push the inventor's interests.

Unless it cannot be otherwise arranged, the patentee should not transfer
his rights merely in consideration of receiving a certain sum on each
article sold, as however sterling the character of the manufacturer,
there would be no certainty of the sales being pushed. The patentee
should endeavor to get the manufacturer to guarantee that the royalties
shall amount to at least a certain pre-stipulated sum each year, or
within a period of time, and that such sum shall absolutely be paid to
him by the manufacturer, irrespective of sales. This insures that the
manufacturer will be obliged to push the sales of the article, and do it
justice, since if he neglects his duty purposely, or from lack of
energy, he is out of pocket, and the patentee is sure of a certain
income, with the addition of a possible fortune that unprecedented sales
may yield him. However, manufacturers are not always willing to agree to
this condition, unless the guaranteed amount is exceedingly reasonable;
they will usually simply agree to do their best, and if the sales do not
reach a certain figure each year, the patentee shall have the option of
cancelling the agreement, and receiving back the patent free and clear.

Royalty licenses can either be exclusive or non-exclusive; that is, with
an exclusive contract the manufacturer has the exclusive right to
manufacture the article, excluding all others; non-exclusive is simply a
shop-right, in consideration of which the manufacturer agrees to pay the
patentee or owner of the patent a stipulated price or percentage upon
each article made or sold. The license can also be exclusive in a
certain section, county, State, or a number of States, as may be agreed
upon.

Any number of conditions that may be agreed upon may be annexed to and
form a part of the contract, and such an agreement should be drawn up in
compliance with the terms and conditions agreed upon by a competent
attorney, or one skilled in matters of this kind.

[Sidenote: Manufacturing and Forming Companies.]

If the patentee has a really good invention, often he cannot do better
than to retain the patent and work it himself, in case he has the
ability to do so. If he cannot conduct the manufacturing alone, he may
be able to secure a partner with just sufficient funds, and equal common
sense and business acumen, to add the necessary elements to the firm to
achieve success.

In some cases, if the patentee does not wish to retain the whole patent
for his own use, an excellent plan is to commence the manufacture of the
invention in a suitable locality, and after the business is so far under
way as to show progress and profit, then sell out the business with
license under the patent. To illustrate: a gentleman in Illinois, having
obtained a patent on a farming implement, succeeded in interesting a
party in his own neighborhood to join with him in its manufacture, which
soon proved successful and remunerative, and in a short time he was able
to sell out his interest in the business to his partner, with license
under the patent, after which the patentee started its manufacture in a
number of places elsewhere, and, at the same time, granting licenses and
selling territory in still other sections, where he was unable to work
the invention. In this way he made a fair fortune from his invention,
realizing about as much from each business established as he could have
probably obtained for the entire patent if sold outright at first.

In this manner the patentee, with a valuable patent on an article of
general usefulness, could go on and establish its manufacture in any
number of places, and sell out with license under the patent. If the
first experiment is successful, it is an easy matter to carry the method
out in other places, and the business can be readily disposed of
anywhere, if it can be shown to be on a paying basis.

[Sidenote: To Organize Stock Companies]

In recent years many inventors have been quite successful in organizing
stock companies on the basis of their patents. This is considered one of
the best ways for handling patents for large and promising inventions,
and it is a method that any patentee, with ordinary business ability,
should be able to carry out successfully, providing his invention is of
sufficient merit and importance to form a suitable basis for a
successful stock company.

Many stock companies are incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, but
it is believed the State of West Virginia is also very favorable to
corporations. The entire expense for incorporating a company under the
laws of the latter State should not exceed $150. The company can be
incorporated for any amount; large or small, one hundred dollars or five
millions, cost and fees being the same. The incorporators need not be
residents of the State. No annual statements required. The meetings of
the directors can be held at any place, and need not be held in the
State where the charter is granted.

Before applying for a charter for a corporation or stock company, the
patentee should mention his plan to some of his friends and get five
persons who will promise to subscribe for one or more shares of the
stock and act as incorporators of the company.

Next he should secure the services of a reliable attorney, familiar with
corporation laws, to prepare the necessary articles of incorporation and
legal papers. The attorney will advise the patentee how to proceed
properly in organizing his company, and as to the securing of the stock
certificates, subscription blanks, seal, etc. These, including the
attorney's fee, should not cost the patentee more than $50.

It is well to have some stationery printed with the proposed name of the
company and business displayed thereon; and also a prospectus
published, setting forth the invention and the plans of the company for
introducing it, etc.

Quite often the patentee can find enough idle capital in his immediate
neighborhood to float a good portion of the stock. Capital is more
easily secured by the formation of a stock company than by any other
means, as people can subscribe for small or large amounts, and they
often prove good investments.

In soliciting subscriptions for stock, it is desirable to get as many
prominent and influential men to buy one or more shares at first to head
the list--their names will be a great aid in making further sales.
Ordinarily the promoter only collects ten per cent, of the amount
subscribed, the balance being subject to the call of the board of
directors.

After it is ascertained that the shares or stock are being rapidly
subscribed for and selling fully up to expectation, the patentee can
have the incorporators sign the charter application and have the
attorney file it with the proper State authorities. This will cost the
patentee about $100 more, for State tax, attorney fees, etc.

When sufficient stock has been subscribed for, a meeting of the
stockholders should be called to elect directors, and to transact such
other business as may be deemed necessary in regard to locating and
building the plant and getting the company in shape.

The patentee should receive about one-half the capital stock in
consideration of his transferring his rights and franchises to the
corporation, the remainder of the stock is sold for the benefit of the
company to create a working capital. The patentee may sell a portion of
his stock, if he desires, but should also retain a good portion of it to
show his own confidence in the business.

After the meeting of the stockholders, the direction of the business
will probably be taken out of the hands of the inventor, and the control
will lie in the board of directors of the company. As a rule it is
better that the inventor does not take an active part in the management
of the company's affairs, unless he is specially fitted for the
position.

If the company is provided with ample capital, and if the business
manager is a competent man, there is little chance of failure if the
invention has real merit.

[Sidenote: Trading as a Last Resort.]

Patentees are sometimes offered securities or other property in trade
for a patent. It is not deemed a wise course by most inventors to
consider any proposition for a trade, especially in the early life of a
patent. Only as a last resort, after failing to realize from a patent by
any other means, is it advisable to trade a patent; and, before finally
agreeing upon a trade, the patentee should have a reputable attorney to
look fully into the value and title of the property offered. He should
also insist upon receiving an abstract of title, or a title guarantee
from a reliable title insurance company.

Unless known to himself, the patentee should never engage the services
of an attorney or broker recommended by the parties offering the trade
to look into the value and title of the property. Inventors should be on
the lookout for a set of sharpers who make a business of offering
worthless securities and property in exchange for patents.




CHAPTER VII

ABOUT CANADIAN PATENTS


The geographical nearness of Canada to the United States, and the
intimate commercial relations existing between the two countries, render
Canada, in one sense, a part of the industrial market of America; and
owing to its liberal patent laws, which are based closely upon our own,
inventors generally find it advantageous to protect their interests in
this country, which can be done from time to time by a very small
outlay, and thus giving the inventor the advantage of disposing of his
patent or dropping it if not found remunerative, before expending the
total cost of the patent.

The commercial and manufacturing interests of Canada are extensive,
increasing yearly, and are closely knit with our own. If the invention
is not protected in Canada, it is sometimes manufactured there and sent
here without paying royalty to the inventor.

Copies of the "Rules and Forms of the Canadian Patent Office" and "The
Patent Act" can be obtained upon application to the Hon. Commissioner of
Patents, Ottawa, Canada. Section 8 of the Patent Act, revised May, 1898,
provides:

"Any inventor who elects to obtain a patent for his invention in a
foreign country before obtaining a patent for the same invention in
Canada, may obtain a patent in Canada, if the same be applied for
within one year from the date of the issue of the first foreign patent
for such invention; and,

"If within three months after the date of the issue of a foreign patent,
the inventor give notice to the Commissioner of his intention to apply
for a patent in Canada for such invention, then no other person having
commenced to manufacture the same device in Canada during such period of
one year, shall be entitled to continue the manufacture of the same
after the inventor has obtained a patent therefor in Canada, without the
consent or allowance of the inventor."

The Patent Act as amended does not now require a Canadian patent to
expire at the earliest date at which a foreign patent for the same
invention expires.

Under the section just cited the patentee has three months, after the
issue of his patent, within which to protect his interests in Canada. If
within these three months he has not sufficiently demonstrated the
commercial value of his home patent, and the advisability of taking out
a Canadian patent, he is advised to give notice to the Commissioner of
Patents, Ottawa, of his intention of doing so, which will fully protect
his interests for one year, as under the above provision; and if the
patentee fail to give this formal notice, he cannot obtain redress from
any person who has commenced to manufacture his invention in Canada
during the year.

There is also an advantage sometimes in giving this formal notice within
three months and delaying the grant of the patent for one year, as the
patentee is allowed to import the patented article into Canada during
one year only, after the grant of the Canadian patent.

The construction or manufacturing of the invention in Canada must be
commenced within two years from the date of the patent, and continuously
carried on from that time, though the extension of this time may be
secured upon timely application to the Commissioner, giving any good and
proper reason. The time for importation is also sometimes extended upon
proper application.

Canadian patents are granted originally for a term of eighteen years,
the Government fee being $60 for the eighteen years, but at the election
of the patentee this fee may be divided into three payments of $20 each,
as follows: $20 at the time of the grant, $20 at the expiration of the
sixth year, if the owner desires to keep the patent alive, if not he can
allow the patent to become forfeited; and at the end of the twelfth
year, if it is still desired to maintain the patent, the remaining fee
of $20 may be paid. If the patentee in the meantime assigns his patent,
the assignee will pay the required government fees at the end of the
sixth and twelfth years, if it is desired to maintain its validity.

The Canadian patent covers and affords full protection in the following
provinces:

[Sidenote: Selling Canadian Patents.]

In selling Canadian patents, the patentee will proceed in much the same
way as in the United States, though he cannot expect, nor should he ask,
more than about one-third as much for the Canadian patent as he
receives, or expects, from the United States patent. Patents are not as
readily sold in Canada as here, but if the inventor has a useful
invention of merit, which is being manufactured profitably in the United
States, he will have no trouble in disposing of his Canadian patent at a
satisfactory price.

It is in nearly all cases advisable for the inventor to first put his
invention upon the market in the United States before trying to realize
from his Canadian interests, as it will be found difficult to interest
Canadian capital in a patent that has not been first put into practice
here; and if the patentee be able to dispose of his Canadian patent at
all, it is usually for a very insignificant sum; whereas, on the other
hand, if the patentee fully protects his interests there, and proceeds
to put the invention upon the home market, he will not only be able to
present his Canadian patent in a more favorable and forcible way by
proving its commercial value, but he will undoubtedly get better offers,
and realize full value for his Canadian interests, in exact proportion
to the success of his invention in the United States.

CHAPTER VIII

DECISIONS AND NOTES


The following digest will be found to contain much useful information
for the patentee, it being a carefully selected list of decisions
affecting assignments, territorial grants, licenses, State laws, etc.;
including those rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States, the
Circuit Court of Appeals, State Courts, and of various Commissioners of
Patents, all of which decisions enunciate well-settled and controlling
principles of Patent Law.

[Sidenote: Assignments.]

Assignments of patents are not required to be under seal. The statutes
simply provide that "every patent, or any interest therein shall be
assignable in law by an instrument in writing." (_Gottfried_ vs.
_Miller, U. S. S. C. Decided Jan. 23, 1882._)

A contract assigning a patent and all future improvements thereon is
enforceable against assignees of such improvements who take notice of
the contract. (_Westinghouse Air Brake Co._ vs. _Chicago Brake and Mfg.
Co., 85 F. R., 786._)

Each co-owner of a patent may use his right without the concurrence of
the others and license at will. (_Washburn & Moen Co._ vs. _Chicago Wire
Fence Co., 109 Ill., 71._)

Owners of a patent are tenants in common, and each, as an incident of
his ownership, has the right to use the patent or manufacture under it.
But neither can be compelled by his co-owner to join in such use or
work, or be liable for the losses which may occur, or to account for the
profits which may arise from such use. (_De Witt_ vs. _Elmira Nobles
Mfg. Co., 12 N. Y. Spur., 301._)

Joint owners of a patent, right are not copartners, and in the absence
of any express contract each is at liberty to use his moiety as he may
think fit, without any liability to or accounting to the other for
profits or losses. (_Vose_ vs. _Singer, 4 Allen (Mass.), 226; vide Pitt
vs. Hall, 3 Blatch., 201._)

Although an assignment of patent is not recorded within three months, it
is binding on the assignor, and he cannot sell the patent again. (_Ex
parte Waters, Com. Dec., 1899, p. 42._)

A verbal license or interest in an invention has no effect as against a
subsequent assignee without notice of such verbal license or interest.
(_U. S. S. C., Gates Iron Works_ vs. _Fraser et al., 1894, C. D., 304._)

An assignment to assign future patents, in consideration of the
assignee's paying the expense of taking them out, is broken by his
refusal to pay for and take out a particular patent when requested, and
a subsequent assignment to another conveys a perfect title. (_Buck_ vs.
_Timony, 78 Fed. Rep., 487._)

Any assignment which does not convey to the assignee the entire and
unqualified monopoly which the patentee holds in the territory
specified, or an undivided interest in the entire _monopoly,_ is a mere
license. (_Sanford_ vs. _Messer, 2 O. G., 470._)

When a party does license, grant, and convey any invention which he may
hereafter make, this gives only an equitable right to have an assignment
made, and this right may be defeated by assignment of the patent to a
purchaser for value without notice of this equity. (_Regan Vapor Engine
Co._ vs. _Pacific Gas Engine Co. (Nineth Cir.), 7 U. S., App., 73._)

[Sidenote: Territorial Grants.]

A territorial grantee cannot be restrained from advertising and selling
within his territory, even though the purchasers may take the patented
article outside the vendor's territory. (_Hatch_ vs. _Hall, 22 Fed.
Rep., 483._)

One who buys patented articles of manufacture from an assignee for a
specified territory becomes possessed of an absolute property in such
articles, unrestricted in time or place. (_U. S. S. C., Keller et al._
vs. _Standard Folding Bed Co., 71 O. G., 451._)

The sale of a patented machine by one authorized to sell, conveys the
whole ownership to the purchaser, who may sell it again to another.
(_Morgan Envelope Co._ vs. _Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Co., 152 U.
S. 425._)

[Sidenote: Licenses.]

Every person who pays the patentee for a license to use his process
becomes the owner of the product, and may sell it to whom he pleases, or
apply it to any purpose, unless he binds himself by covenants to
restrict his rights of making and vending certain articles that may
interfere with the special business of some other licensee. (_Met.
Washing Machine Co._ vs. _Earl, 2 Fish., 203; 2 Wall., Jr., 230._)

A license is not forfeitable for non-payment of royalties in the absence
of express provisions to that effect. (_Wagner Typewriter Co._ vs.
_Watkins, 84 Fed. Rep., 57; 1898._)

A shop right is a personal license and is not assignable. (_Gibbs_ vs.
_Hoefner, 19 Fed. Rep., 323; 22 Blatch., 36._)

A license to a person to use an invention only "at his own
establishment" does not authorize a use at an establishment owned by him
and others. (_Rubber Co._ vs. _Goodyear, 9 Wallace, 788._)

A license is not transferable unless its terms so state. (_Olmer_ vs.
_Rumford Chemical Co., 109 U. S., 75._)

A license merely to make and not to sell does not impair the patent
owner's right to sue for infringement outside of the license; and the
purchaser of the licensee's tools and materials would not carry the
right to sell the product made thereon. (_American Graphophone Co._ vs.
_Walcut, 87 Fed. Rep., 556; 1898._)

A license to use a machine carries with it the right to repair the
machine, and replace worn parts until the essential original parts of
the machine have disappeared. (_Robinson on Patents, Sec. 827._)

A lawful sale of a patented article by a patentee or grantee, within his
own territory, carries with it the right to use such article throughout
the whole United States. (_Adams_ vs. _Burke, 5 O.G., 118_; _Hobbie_ vs.
_Smith. 27 Fed. Rep., 636._)

When an applicant in certain instruments assigned his right, title, and
interest in an invention, retaining for himself the exclusive right to
employ the invention in the manufacture of a certain class of machines,
Held, that such instruments do not convey the entire interest in the
invention or any undivided part thereof, and they are construed to be
nothing more than licenses. (_Ex parte Rosback, 89 O. G., 705. Decided
Oct. 5, 1899._)

An implied license to use a patented improvement without payment of any
royalties during the continuance of employment of the inventor, and
thereafter, on the same terms and royalties fixed for other parties, is
shown where the inventor applies the patent to his employer's work
without any agreement for compensation for its use further than a notice
that he would require pay after his employment terminated. (_Keys_ vs.
_Eureka Consol. Min. Co., U. S. S. C., 158 U. S., 150._)

A breach of a covenant in a license does not work a forfeiture of the
license unless it is so expressly agreed. (_Consol. Middlings Purifier
Co._ vs. _Wolf, 37 O. G., 567._)

[Sidenote: Patent Title.]

A patent right, like any other personal property, is understood by
Congress to vest in the executors and administrators of the patentee, if
he dies without having assigned it. (_Shaw Relief Valve Co._ vs. _City
of New Bedford, 19th Fed. Rep., 758._)

A patent to a dead man at the time of its grant is not void for the want
of a grantee, but vests in his heirs or assigns. (_U. S. S. C, De La
Vergne Ref. Machine Co._ vs. _Featherstone, 1893, C. D., 181._)

A court of equity may direct a sale of an inventor's interest in his
patent to satisfy a judgment against him, and will require the patentee
to assign as provided in Rev. Stat., Sec. 4898, and if he refuses, will
appoint a trustee to make the assignment. (_Murray_ vs. _Ager, 20 O. G.,
1311._)

A patent right cannot be seized and sold on execution. (_Carver_ vs.
_Peck, 131 Mass., 291._)

A receiver cannot, under his general powers, convey the legal title to a
patent (_Adams_ vs. _Howard, 23 Blatch., 27_), but a court may compel an
insolvent to assign his patent to a trustee or receiver. (_Pacific Bank_
vs. _Robinson, 20 O. G., 1314_; _Murray_ vs. _Ager, 20 O. G., 1311._)

A patentee who assigns his patent cannot, when sued for infringement,
contest the validity thereof. (_Griffith_ vs. _Shaw, 89 Fed. Rep.,
313._)


RULES OF PRACTICE

The following from the "Rules of Practice in the United States Patent
Office" may be perused with interest to the patentee; a copy of which,
together with a copy of the "Patent Laws," will be mailed free to any
person upon addressing the Hon. Commissioner of Patents, Washington,
D. C., requesting the same; these being the only books or pamphlets
published by the Office for gratuitous distribution.

[Sidenote: Assignments.]

Every patent or any interest therein shall be assignable in law by an
instrument in writing; and the patentee or his assigns or legal
representatives may, in like manner, grant and convey an exclusive right
under the patent to the whole or any specified part of the United
States. Interests in patents may be vested in assignees, in grantees of
exclusive sectional rights, in mortgagees, and in licensees.

[Sidenote: Assignees.]

An assignee is a transferee of the whole interest of the original patent
or of an undivided part of such whole interest, extending to every
portion of the United States. The assignment must be written or printed
and duly signed.

[Sidenote: Grantees.]

A grantee acquires by the grant the exclusive right under the patent to
make and use and to grant to others the right to make and use, the thing
patented within and throughout some specified part of the United States,
excluding the patentee therefrom. The grant must be written or printed
and be duly signed.

[Sidenote: Mortgages.]

A mortgage must be written or printed and duly signed.

[Sidenote: Licensees.]

A licensee takes an interest less than or different from either of the
others. A license may be oral, written, or printed, and if written or
printed, must be duly signed.

[Sidenote: Must be Recorded.]

An assignment, grant, or conveyance of a patent will be void as against
any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration
without notice unless recorded in the Patent Office within three months
from the date thereof. If any such assignment, grant, or conveyance of
any patent shall be acknowledged before any notary public of the several
States or territories, or the District of Columbia, or any commissioner
of the United States Circuit Court, or before any secretary of legation,
or consular officer authorized to administer oaths or perform notarial
acts under Section 1750 of the Revised Statutes, the certificate of such
acknowledgment, under the hand and official seal of such notary or other
officer, shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the execution of such
assignment, grant, or conveyance.

No instrument will be recorded which does not, in the judgment of the
Commissioner, amount to an assignment, grant, mortgage, lien,
encumbrance, or license, or which does not affect the title of the
patent or invention to which it relates. Such instruments should
identify the patent by date and number; or, if the invention is
unpatented, the name of the inventor, the serial number, and date of the
application should be stated.

[Sidenote: Conditional Assignments.]

Assignments which are made conditional on the performance of certain
stipulations, as the conditional payment of money, if recorded in the
office are regarded as absolute assignments until cancelled with the
written consent of both parties, or by the decree of a competent court.
The office has no means for determining whether such conditions have
been filled. (_Rev. Stat., Sec. 4898._)

STATE LAWS ON SELLING PATENTS

In some States, laws have been passed by which attempts have been made
to regulate or prevent the sale of patent rights within their borders,
by imposing upon patentees or their agents certain State restrictions,
such as requiring the filing of copies of patents, making and filing
proofs, taking out licenses, procuring certificates, complying with
forms, or prescribing the terms of a note to be given for a patent.

While it has never been squarely brought before the United States
Supreme Court, with the result that much conflicting legislation has
been enacted by the different States, it may be said, as a general
proposition, that a State or municipality, through the medium of its
Legislature or officials, has no constitutional right to make or enforce
laws which in any way affect or control the transfer, sale, or other
disposition of United States Letters Patent; or to interfere in any
manner with the patentee going into the open market anywhere to sell his
rights conferred by the patent.

It is a well-established principle of law that Congress has exclusive
right and power to legislate on the subjects specially assigned to it by
the Constitution, while power is delegated to the several States to
legislate on those subjects not thus expressly placed within the
control of Congress. It would seem clear that there can be no State
interference with the rights which are incident to the grant of Letters
Patent and expressly conferred thereby.

Ohio was the first State attempting to place restrictions upon the
handling of patent rights, which, in 1868, passed an act requiring any
person, before offering for sale a patent right in any county, to submit
the patent to the Probate Judge of the county, and make affidavit before
said judge that the patent was in force, and that the applicant had the
right to sell, and also requiring that any written obligation taken on
the sale of such right should bear on its face the words, "Given for a
Patent Right."

The portion of the Ohio statute relating to the making and filing proofs
was subsequently made the law in Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana, Nebraska,
and Kansas, while the requirement that written obligations given for a
patent right should bear such statement written upon its face was made
the law in Vermont, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York,
Connecticut, and Arkansas.

In view of the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court of the United
States in the cases of _ex parte_ Robinson, 2 Bissel, 309, and Webber
_vs._ Virginia, 103 U. S., 347; 20 O. G., 136, some of the States
repealed their statutes relating to the filing of proofs, while others
did not--notably Indiana and Kansas, where the statute still remains in
force.

While the Supreme Court in the above cases did not decide the
constitutionality of the State statutes, it was clearly indicated that
property in inventions existed by virtue of the laws of Congress, and
that no State had any right to interfere with its enjoyment, or to annex
conditions to the grant, and that the patentee had a right to go into
the open market anywhere in the United States and sell his property. It
also established the proposition that a State may require the taking out
of a license for the sale of the manufactured article covered by the
patent; and the patentee should keep in mind the distinction between
selling patents, or patent privileges, and the selling of goods or
manufactured articles, as all who sell goods, whether patented or not,
must conform with the local and State laws relating to same.

The statute requiring the insertion in written obligations of the words,
"Given for a Patent Right," has been declared unconstitutional by the
higher State Courts in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nebraska, and
by the Circuit Courts in the southern district of Ohio, and in the
district of Indiana; while its validity has been sustained by the courts
of last resort in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Kansas.
Therefore, the validity of the State statutes on the point referred to
may be regarded as finally established in the last-named States until
brought before the Supreme Court of the United States.




CHAPTER IX


THE TRANSFER OF PATENT RIGHTS


It frequently occurs to the patentee that a knowledge of the legal
requirements of the transfer of patent rights would save him much time
and trouble. Patentees should carefully scrutinize all papers offered by
the parties in whose favor they are drawn, and, if possible, he should
have his attorney to examine them.

There are three classes of persons in whom the patentee can vest an
interest of some kind. They are an assignee, a grantee of an exclusive
sectional right, and a licensee.

[Sidenote: Assignee, Grantee, and Licensee Defined.]

"An _assignee_ is one who has transferred to him in writing the whole
interest in the original patent, or any undivided part of such whole
interest in every portion of the United States. And no one, unless he
has such an interest transferred to him, is an assignee.

"A _grantee_ is one who has transferred in writing the exclusive right
under the patent, to make and use, and to grant to others to make and
use, the thing patented, within and throughout some specified part or
portion of the United States. Such right must be an exclusive sectional
right, excluding the patentee therefrom.

"A _licensee_ is one who has transferred to him in writing, or orally, a
less or different interest than either the interest in the whole patent,
or an undivided part of such whole interest, or an exclusive sectional
interest." (_Potter_ vs. _Holland, 1 Fish, 327._)

[Sidenote: The Language of Law.]

If a man were to give another an orange he would simply say, "I give you
this orange"; but if the transaction be intrusted to a lawyer to draw up
according to the requirements of law, says the _Observer_, he would most
probably put it in the following language: "I hereby give, grant, and
convey to you all my interest, right, title, and advantage of and in
said orange, together with its rind, skin, juice, pulp, and pits, and
all right and advantage therein with full power to bite, suck, cut, or
otherwise eat the same or to give the same away, as fully and
effectually as I, the said A. B., am now entitled to cut, bite, or
otherwise eat the same, or give away the same with or without the rind,
skin, juice, pulp, or pits; anything hereinbefore or hereafter or in any
other deed or deeds, instruments of nature or kind whatsoever to the
contrary in anywise notwithstanding."

It is always better and more satisfactory to have assignments, royalty
contracts, agreements, etc., drawn up specially to accord with the
facts, details, and covenants of each particular case; and there is no
one probably better able to do this than the attorney who secured the
patent. However, if in the case the parties to the transaction cannot
well delay proceedings to have the papers prepared by an attorney, by
adhering to the following forms in any such transactions, both the
purchaser and seller may rest assured that their rights are protected.


ASSIGNMENT OF ENTIRE INTEREST IN LETTERS PATENT

  _Whereas_, I, Richard Doe, of Columbus, County of Franklin,
  State of Ohio, did obtain Letters Patent of the United
  States for an improvement in Typewriting Machines, which
  Letters Patent are numbered 000,000, and bear date January
  1, 1901; and whereas I am now sole owner of said patent, and
  of all rights under the same; and whereas the Ohio
  Typewriter Company, a corporation, of Cincinnati, County of
  Hamilton, and State of Ohio, is desirous of acquiring an
  interest in the same:

  _Now, therefore_, to all whom it may concern, be it known,
  that for and in consideration of the sum of five thousand
  dollars to me in hand paid by the aforesaid corporation, the
  receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I, the said
  Richard Doe have sold, assigned, and transferred, and by
  these presents do sell, assign, and transfer unto the said
  Ohio Typewriter Company, its successors and assigns, the
  entire right, title and interest in and to said Letters
  Patent and the invention therein patented; the same to be
  held and enjoyed by the said corporation for its own use and
  behoof, and for the use and behoof of its successors and
  assigns, to the full end of the term for which said Letters
  Patent are or may be granted, as fully and entirely as the
  same would have been held and enjoyed by me had this
  assignment and sale not been made.

  _In testimony whereof_, I have hereto set my hand and
  affixed my seal, at Columbus, County and State aforesaid,
  this tenth day of January, A.D. 1901.

                                RICHARD DOE. (_Seal._)

    January, A.D. 1901.

  _Seal._                     JOHN RICE, _Notary Public_.



If it is the intention of the assignor to convey to the assignee the
right to recover for past infringement of the patent, a clause like the
following should be added:

And for the same consideration, I do hereby sell, assign and transfer
unto the aforesaid corporation, all claims and demands, both at law and
in equity, which may have accrued to me by reason of the infringement of
the aforesaid Letters Patent with the right to sue and recover therefor
in its own name and for its own use and behoof.


ASSIGNMENT OF AN UNDIVIDED INTEREST

  _Whereas_, I, Richard Doe, of Philadelphia, County of
  Philadelphia, State of Pennsylvania, did obtain Letters
  Patent of the United States for improvements in Locomotive
  Headlights, which Letters Patent are numbered 000,000, and
  bear the date of June 26, 1900; and whereas, John Roe, of
  Philadelphia, County of Philadelphia and State of
  Pennsylvania, is desirous of acquiring an interest in the
  same: _Now, therefore_, this indenture witnesseth, that for
  and in consideration of the sum of one thousand dollars to
  me in hand paid by said John Roe, the receipt of which is
  hereby acknowledged, I do hereby sell, assign, and transfer
  unto the said John Roe, his heirs and assigns, one undivided
  one-half interest in and to the aforesaid Letters Patent
  and the invention therein patented; the same to be held and
  enjoyed by the said John Roe, his heirs and assigns to the
  full end of the term for which said Letters Patent are or
  may be granted as fully and entirely as the same would have
  been held and enjoyed by me if this assignment and sale had
  not been made.

  And I do hereby declare that I have not conveyed to any
  other party the rights and interest herein transferred to
  the said John Roe.

GRANT OF A TERRITORIAL INTEREST

  _Whereas_, I, Richard Doe, of Dayton, County of Montgomery,
  State of Ohio, did obtain Letters Patent of the United
  States for improvements in Corn-Cultivators, which Letters
  Patent are numbered 000,000, and bear date the first day of

  _This agreement_, made this tenth day of January, 1901,
  between Richard Doe, of Wilmington, County of New Castle,
  State of Delaware, party of the first part, and the Metallic

  _In witness whereof_, the parties above named have hereto

                              RICHARD DOE,
            _Metallic Railway Tie Company_,
                     Per John Roe, President.




LICENSE:--EXCLUSIVE--WITH ROYALTY

  _This agreement_, made this tenth day of January, 1901,
  between Richard Doe, of Boston, State of Massachusetts,
  party of the first part, and the Roe Vending Machine
  Company, a corporate body under the laws of the State of New
  Jersey, located and doing business at the city of New York,
  in the State of New York, party of the second part,

  _Witnesseth_, that whereas, Letters Patent of the United
  States, No. 000,000, were, on the first day of January,
  1901, granted to the said party of the first part, for
  improvements in Coin-Controlled Machines, and whereas said
  party of the second part is desirous of manufacturing and
  selling said patented article: Now, therefore, the parties
  hereto have agreed as follows:

  I. The party of the first part gives to the party of the
  second part the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the
  said patented improvements, to the end of the term of said

  party of the second part concerning any items, charges,
  memoranda, or information relating to the manufacture or
  sale of said patented Coin-Controlled Machines; and upon
  request made, said party of the second part shall produce
  all such books for said examination.

  to amount to that sum at the regular royalty of five dollars
  each.

  V. The party of the second part shall cast, or otherwise
  permanently place, upon every such machine made under this
  license the word "Doe," and in close relation thereto the
  word "Patented," and the number and date of said patent.

  VI. The party of the second part shall not, during the life
  of this license, make or sell any article which can compete

  agreement, the party of the first part may, at his option,
  terminate this license, and such termination shall not
  release said party of the second part from any liability due
  at such time to the party of the first part.

  _In witness whereof_, the above-named parties (the said Roe
  Vending Machine Company, by its president) have hereto set
  their hands the day and year first above written,

                              RICHARD DOE,

No general legal forms should be relied upon too implicitly as suiting
particular cases, and an inventor, in order to fully protect his
interests, should consult a reliable patent attorney, and have the forms
properly prepared to suit his individual case.

PATENTS

FOR OVER SIXTY-SIX YEARS the firm of MUNN & CO. has conducted the
largest patent practice in the country. We file thousands of
applications for patents every year. Our system is so perfected that
every case receives the best of attention and is prepared by experts who
have had special training in handling every class of invention.

SEND SKETCH. If you will send us a sketch, no matter how crude, we will
give you a fair and candid opinion as to whether it is probable a patent
can be obtained. All matters of this kind are strictly confidential and
the description and sketches will be dated and placed in our secret
archives for future reference. This service and our Hand Book on Patents
are free.

QUALITY. The quality of our work has given us an unrivaled reputation
among Patent Attorneys and we are the recognized American attorneys for
many leading Foreign Patent Solicitors. Our staff consists largely of
Examiners from the United States Patent Office, who are therefore
familiar with the latest procedure and the best practice. Our draftsmen

SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN

_The Weekly Journal of Practical Information_

THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, founded over sixty-seven years ago (1845), has
become to-day the official organ of those people who really do things,
and want to know what others are doing; it is for the one whose whole
business success depends upon these great mechanical, chemical,
electrical and engineering achievements, which are rapidly and surely
making this nation.

THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN is the authority; it is always up to date; and
gives its readers the first news as well as the most complete news of
any new development in the Sciences, Arts, Manufactures, etc. Some of
the department features are:

HANDY MAN'S WORKSHOP.--In this department those who use tools either for
pastime or profit will find suggestions which will be helpful.

HANDY MAN'S LABORATORY.--This is a department of Experimental Science
with many useful and interesting experiments along the lines of modern
scientific thought.

NOTES AND QUERIES DEPARTMENT.--In which is published replies to our
correspondents, embracing the widest range of topics. An able corps of
experts is engaged to attend to this correspondence and the service is
free to our subscribers.

INVENTORS' DEPARTMENT.--In these columns inventors have their say; their
trials and tribulations and final successes are fully discussed.
Inventors are also given an opportunity to present their mechanical
ideas to the world. There is also a column of "Patent Office Notes" and
a column of "Legal Notes" in which questions of Patent Law, about which
inventors and manufacturers should be informed, are briefly and simply
elucidated.

CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE AND INVENTION is a department of notes in which
all the curious and ingenious ideas of the day are illustrated and
briefly described.

The "Scientific American" is published weekly and a year's numbers
contain over 1200 fine illustrations and about twice as much text as a
standard magazine. Subscription price, $3.00 per year; $1.50 for six
months. Sample copy free.

[Illustration: Book]

This valuable work, which is partly based on the twenty-eighth edition
of "The Scientific American Cyclopedia of Receipts, Notes and Queries,"
contains a collection of about 15,000 selected formulas, covering nearly
every branch of the useful arts and industries. Never before has such a
large collection of valuable formulas, useful to everyone, been offered
to the public.

This work may be regarded as the product of the studies and practical
experience of the ablest chemists and workers in all parts of the world,
the information given being of the highest value, condensed in concise
form, convenient for ready use. Almost every inquiry that can be thought
of relating to formulas used in the various manufacturing industries
will here be found answered.

The formulas are classified and arranged into chapters containing
related subjects, while a complete index, made by professional
librarians, renders it easy to find any formula desired.

Those engaged in any branch of industry will probably find in this
volume much that is of practical use in their respective callings. Those
in search of salable articles which can be manufactured on a small
scale, will find hundreds of most excellent suggestions. It should have
a place in every laboratory, factory and home.

An eight-page descriptive circular and complete table of contents will
be furnished on application.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org
