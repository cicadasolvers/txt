Notes.

JOURNAL OF THE EXPENSES OF JOHN, KING OF FRANCE, IN ENGLAND, 1359-60.

Possibly some of the readers of "N. & Q." may remember that King John II.
of France was taken prisoner by Edward the Black Prince at the battle of
Poitiers, fought September 20, 1356. If not, I would refer them to the
delightful pages of old Froissart, where, in the version of Lord Berners,
they will see chronicled at length,--

    "How Kyng John of Fraunce was taken prisoner at the Batayle of
    Poyeters; how the Englyshmen wan greatly thereat, and how the Prince
    conveyed the Frenche Kyng fro Burdeaux into Englande."

I am induced to bring under the notice of your readers a curious roll,
containing one year's expenditure (July 1, 1359, to July 8, 1360) incurred
by the French king during his captivity in England. This important document
has been very recently printed in the _Comptes de l'Argenterie_, and edited
from a MS. in the Bibliotheque Nationale by M. Douet d'Arcq for the
_Societe de l'Histoire de France_. It may perhaps be well to state, that
after the battle of Poitiers the heroic Prince Edward conducted his royal
prisoner to Bordeaux, where he remained till the end of April, 1357. On the
24th of May following they both made their entry into London, "the Frenche
Kynge mounted on a large whyte courser well aparelled, and the Prince on a
lytell blacke hobbey (_haquenee_) by hym." John was lodged at first at the
Savoy Palace, but was removed shortly afterwards to Windsor Castle, at
which place he was allowed to "go a huntynge and a haukynge at hys
pleasure, and the lorde Phylyp his son with him." The document in question
refers to the years 1359 and 1360, when the king was confined at Hertford
Castle, at Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire, and lastly in the Tower of
London. As this document, which is so intimately connected with a favourite
portion of our history, has, I believe, received no notice from any English
journal, and as it moreover affords many valuable illustrations of domestic
manners, and of the personal character of the royal captive, I have made a
few extracts from it for insertion in "N. & Q.," in the {506} hope that
they may prove interesting to the numerous readers of that useful and
entertaining work.

WAY OF INDICATING TIME IN MUSIC.

The following rough mixture of Notes and Queries may serve to excite
attention to the subject. The merest beginner is aware that the letter C,
with a vertical line drawn through it, denotes _common time_; in which he
will take the C for the first letter of _common_. The symbols of old music
are four: the circle, the semicircle, and the two with vertical lines drawn
through them. After these were written 2 or 3, according as the time was
double or triple. And instead of a bar drawn through the circle or
semicircle, a central point was sometimes inserted. All these are true
facts, whether connected or unconnected, and whether any implication
conveyed in any way of stating them be true or false. The C, with a line
through it, certainly did not distinguish common time from triple. Alsted,
in his _Encyclopaedia_ (1649), says that it means the _beginning of the
music_; without any reference to time. Solomon de Caus, known as having had
the steam-engine claimed for him, but who certainly wrote on music in 1615,
found the circles, &c. so variously used by different writers, that he
abandons all attempt at description or reconciliation.

May I suggest an origin for the crossed C? In the oldest church music, it
often happens that the lines are made to begin with a vertical line
impaling two lozenges, with a third lozenge between them, but on one side.
It is as if in the three of diamonds the middle lozenge were removed a
little to the left, the upper and lower ones sliding on a vertical line
until they nearly touch the removed middle one. Now if this figure were
imitated _currente calamo_, as in rapid writing, it would certainly become
an angle crossed by a vertical line; which angle would perhaps be rounded,
thus giving the crossed semicircle. Has this derivation been suggested? Or
can any one suggest a better?

But, it will be said, whence comes the full circle? It is possible that
there may have happened in this case what has happened in others: namely,
that a symbol invented, and firmly established, before the partial disuse
of Latin, may have been extended in different ways by the vernacular
writers of different countries. This has happened in the case of the words
_million_, _billion_, _trillion_, &c. The first, and the root of all, was
established early, and while no vernacular works existed, and it has only
one meaning. The others, certainly introduced at a later time, mean
different things in different countries. May it not have been that the
variety of usage which De Caus notes, may have arisen from different
writers, ignorant of each other, choosing each his own mode of deriving
other symbols from the crossed semicircle, obtained as suggested by me? I
am fully aware of the risk of such suggestions--but they have often led to
something better.

Minor Notes.

_A smart Saying of Baxter._--In his _Aggravations of Vain Babbling_,
speaking of gossips, Baxter says:

    "If I had one to send to school that were sick of the talking evil--the
    _morbus loquendi_--I would give (as Isocrates required) a double pay to
    the schoolmaster willingly; one part for teaching him to hold his
    tongue, and the other half for teaching him to speak. I should think
    many such men and women half cured if they were half as weary of
    speaking as I am of hearing them. _He that lets such twattling swallows
    build in his chimney may look to have his pottage savour of their
    dung._"

_Latin Hexameters on the Bible._--The verses given under this title by LORD
BRAYBROOKE, in Vol. v., p. 414., remind me of a similar method which I
adopted, when at school, in order to impress upon my memory the names of
the Jewish months. The lines run thus:--

 "Nisan Abib, Iyar Zif, Sivan, Thammuz, Ab, Elul;
  Tisri, Marchesvan, Chisleu, Thebeth, Sebat, Adar."

The first verse commences with the first month of the ecclesiastical year,
the second with the first month of the civil year.

A. W.

_Ancient Connexion of Cornwall and Phoenicia._--The effort to trace the
ancient connexion of countries by the relics of their different customs,
would be amusing if not useful. The fragment of the voyage of Hamilcar the
Carthaginian confirms the trade of the Phoenicians with Cornwall for tin.
The Roman writers still extant confirm it. The traffic was carried on by
way of Gades or Cadiz, the Carthaginians being the carriers for the
Phoenicians. In Andalusia to this day, middle-aged and old men are
addressed _Tio_, or uncle; as _Tio Gorge_, "Uncle George." This custom
prevails in Cornwall also, and only there besides. Is not that a trace of
the old intercourse? Again, clouted cream, known only in the duchy of
Cornwall, which once extended as far as the river Exe in Devon, is only
found besides in Syria and near modern Tyre, whence the same tin trade was
carried on. These are curious coincidences. Many of the old Cornish words
are evidently of Spanish origin: as _cariad_, _caridad_, charity or
benevolence; _Egloz_ or _Eglez_, a church; _Iglesia_ or _Yglezia_, and many
others, which seem to bear a relation to the same intercourse.

The notice respecting the word _cot_ or _cote_,--termination of proper
names in a particular district in Cornwall,--already mentioned in these
pages, supposed to be Saxon from the idea that its use was confined to one
district, which I have shown to be a mistake, may be from the Cornish word
_icot_, "below," in place of the Saxon _cote_ or _cot_, "cottage." Thus,
_goracot_ is probably from _gora_ or _gorra_, and _icot_, i. e. "down
below." {508} _Trelacot_ from _Tre_, "a town," and _icot_, "below." The _l_
was often prefixed for sound sake: as _lavalu_ for _avalu_, "an apple;"
_quedhan lavalu_, "an apple tree;" _Callacot_, from _cala_, or _calla_,
"straw," and _icot_. The introduction of the vowel _a_ for _i_ might be a
corruption in spelling after the sound. This is only surmise, but it has an
appearance of probability.

_Portrait of John Rogers, the Proto-Martyr._--Should you think the
following minor Note interesting to your correspondent KT., perhaps you
will find a corner for it in your miscellany.

Living some time ago on the picturesque coast of Dorsetshire, I had the
good fortune to have for a neighbour a lady of cultivated taste and
literary acquirements; among other specimens of antiquity and art to which
she drew my attention, was a portrait, in oil, of John Rogers; it was of
the size called "Kit Cat," and was well painted. This portrait she held in
great veneration and esteem, declaring herself to be (if my memory does not
deceive me) a descendant of this champion of Christianity, whose name
stands on the "muster roll" of the "noble army of martyrs."

In case KT. should wish to push his inquiries in this quarter, I inclose
you the name and address of the lady above alluded to.

"_Brallaghan, or the Deipnosophists._"--Edward Kenealey, Esq., reprinted
under the above sonorous title (London: E. Churton, 1845) some amusing
contributions of his to _Fraser_ and other Magazines. At pp. 94. and 97. he
gives us, however, the "Uxor non est ducenda" and the "Uxor est ducenda" of
the celebrated Walter Haddon; and that too without the slightest intimation
that he himself was not their author. It is not, I think, fair for any man
thus to shine in borrowed plumes, or at least transcribe verbatim, and
without acknowledgment, from a writer so little known and old-fashioned as
Haddon. Let me therefore give the reference, for the benefit of the
curious: _D. Gualteri Haddoni Poemata_, pp. 70-3. Londini, 1567, 4to.

_Stilts used by the Irish._--We have all heard of the use of stilts by the
shepherds of the Landes; but I have met with _only one_ passage which
speaks of their use in Ireland. I have crossed rivers, both in Scotland and
in Ireland, on stilts, when the water was not deep, and have seen them kept
instead of a ferryboat, when there was no bridge, but do not think they are
in common use at the present day. The passage in question is quoted in
Ledwich's _Antiquities_, p. 300.:

    "I had almost forgotten to notice a very remarkable particular recorded
    by Strada (Strada, _Belg._, 1. viii. p. 404., Borlase's Reduction,
    132.). He tells us that Sir Wm. Pelham, who had been Lord Justice of
    Ireland, led into the Low Countries in 1586 fourteen hundred wild
    Irish, clad only below the navel, and mounted on _stilts_, which they
    used in passing rivers: they were armed with bows and arrows. Having
    never met with this use of stilts among any other people, it seemed a
    matter of curiosity to notice it here."

What is the etymology of the word _devil_? This may appear an unnecessary
question, since we have a regular chain of etyma, [Greek: diabolos,]
_diabolus_, _diavolo_, _devil_. But it is the first of this chain that
puzzles me. I am aware that it is considered a translation of [Hebrew:
SAT`AN], and is derived usually from [Greek: diaballein], _calumniare_. But
[Hebrew: SAT`AN] means _adversarius_, consequently the rendering would not
be accurate. As the word in classical writers always means a false accuser,
and never a supernatural agent of evil, I doubt the correctness of the
usual derivations in the case of ecclesiastical usage; and am inclined to
consider it one of the oriental words, in a Hellenistic dress, with which
the Septuagint and Greek Testament are replete. Mr. Borrow, in _Lavengro_,
instances as a reason for believing that divine and devilish were
originally the same words, the similarity of the gypsy word _Un-debel_,
God, and our word _devil_. Struck with this remark, on consideration of the
subject, I perceived that there were several other coincidences of the same
kind, as follows:--The Greek [Greek: daimon] means either a good or bad
spirit of superhuman power. The Zend word _afriti_, "blessed," corresponds
to the Arabic _afrit_, "a rebellious angel." The Latin _divus_, "a god,"
(and of course [Greek: Dios], with all its variations,) belongs to the same
family as the Persian _div_, "a wizard or demon;" while the _jin_ or _jan_
of the _Arabian Nights_ answer to the forms _Zan_, _Zena_, _Zeus_, _Janus_,
_Djana_ or _Diana_. All words denoting deified power, and employed by the
inhabitants of Greece and Umbria.

These singular resemblances may prove that fetish worship was more widely
spread than is generally believed, and I think justify my doubts as to the
etymology of the word in question.

FORGED PAPAL SEAL.

An old seal was discovered some years ago by accident in the ruins of an
abbey in the south of Ireland, of which the followings is a description.
The workmanship is rude, the material a species of bronze. The impression
consists of a circle of raised spots: on either side are two venerable
human faces, both bearded; there is a rude cross between them. Above them
are the letters--

 "S - P - A - S - P - E."

{509} These are supposed to stand for "St. Paul" and "St. Peter." It is
said that this seal was used for the purpose of affixing an impression to
an instrument which pretended to be a Papal Bull: in fact, that it was used
for forging Pope's Bulls. One of the objects of such forgeries (if they
really occurred) would be, to grant dispensations for marriages on account
of consanguinity. Some noble families in Ireland had very ancient Papal
dispensations of this nature. It would often be convenient that
extraordinary despatch should be used in obtaining a dispensation.

Can any of your correspondents compare the seals on those dispensations
with the above, or throw any light on the practice of dispensing with the
ecclesiastical law against consanguineous marriages?

A PASSAGE IN "ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL."

Will MR. SINGER favour me with the information where the proposed
emendation, referred to by him in "N. & Q.," Vol. v., p. 436., in _All's
Well that ends Well_, _infinite cunning_ for "insuite comming," of the
folio 1623, is to be met with? If it be in the _Athenaeum_ it has escaped
my observation, although I have turned over the pages of that able
periodical carefully to find it. I have a particular reason for wishing to
trace the suggestion, if I can, to the source where it originated. Owing to
an accident, which it is needless to explain, the number of "N. & Q."
containing MR. SINGER'S communication did not meet my eye until this
morning.

SURNAMES.

I have to thank many of your readers who have favoured me with private
letters on this subject since the printing of the prospectus of my
_Dictionary of Surnames_ in your columns; and before troubling you with a
string of Queries, I would briefly refer to two or three points in the kind
communications under this head in "N. & Q." of May 1. E. H. Y. will find
the question, _sur_name or _sir_name, slightly touched upon in my _English
Surnames_ (3rd edit., vol. i. p. 13.), and argued at length in the
_Literary Gazette_ for Nov. 1842, in a correspondence originating out of a
notice of the first edition of my book. I think the balance of evidence is
in favour of _sur_name; that is, a name superadded to the personal or
baptismal appellation, which applies with equal propriety to the sobriquets
given to monarchs and distinguished men, and to the hereditary designations
of people of humble rank. Alexander _Mitchell_, your groom, is no other
than Alexander the Great; and Bill _Rowse_, your errand-boy, is the
namesake of the Red King who fell in the New Forest; the only difference
being, that the plebeians inherit their second name from their ancestors,
while the magnates enjoy theirs by exclusive right. I do not think,
therefore, that the distinction contended for by E. H. Y. is either
necessary or desirable: indeed I consider _sire_name as a mere play upon a
mis-spelt word. In saying this, I would by no means disparage your
excellent correspondent, whose communications I always read with pleasure I
might add, that the distinction of "nomen patris additum proprio,"
_sire_name, and "nomen supra nomen additum," surname, is by no means new.

I cannot quite agree with E. S.'s suggestion as to the desirableness of
omitting the names derived from Christian names, this being one of the most
interesting branches of my inquiry. I have already shown that from ten to
thirty family names are occasionally found to proceed from _one_ baptismal
appellation; and at least half a dozen of the names to which E. S. calls my
attention for explanation are so derived. To the termination _-cock_,
occurring in so many names, I have already given attention, and the result
may be seen in _Eng. Surn._, vol. i. pp. 160. to 165., both inclusive.

To the surnames derived from extinct or provincial words designating
employments, I am paying considerable attention; but although I am
tolerably well acquainted with our mediaeval writers, and their
glossarists, there are many names ending in _er_ (generally having in old
records the prefix _le_), which have hitherto baffled my etymological
skill.

W. L.'s remarks support the statements made in _Eng. Surn._, vol. i., p.
38. _et seq._, to show that family names have scarcely become hereditary,
in some parts of England, even now, in the middle of the nineteenth
century. Without occupying your valuable space unduly, I would now submit
the following Queries:--

1. What book gives any rational account of the origin of the Scottish
clans, and their distinctive or family names? I know Buchanan's work, but
it gives very little information of the kind desired. _Any_ authentic
particulars regarding Scottish names will be acceptable.

2. What is the real meaning of _worth_, which forms the final syllable of
so many surnames? I have seen no less than six explanations of it, which
cannot all be correct.

3. Are there any works (besides dictionaries) in the Dutch, German, and
Scandinavian languages which would throw light upon the family names of
this country?

4. What is the best compendious gazetteer or topographical dictionary of
Normandy extant?

5. Is anything known of a collection of surnames made by Mr. Cole, the
antiquary, in the last century? It is mentioned in Collet's _Relics of
Literature_, 1823. {510}

6. Can any reader of "N. & Q." explain the following surnames, which are
principally to be found so early as the reign of Edward I.?--Alfox, Colfox,
Astor, Fricher, Grix, Biber, Bakepuz, Le Chalouner, Le Cayser, Le Cacherel,
Trelfer, Metcalfe, Baird, Aird, Chagge, Le Carun, at Bight.

_Owen, Bishop of St. Asaph._--To what family belonged John Owen, Bishop of
St. Asaph, mentioned in Winkle's _Cathedrals_ with so much honour? His
father Owen Owen was Archdeacon of Anglesea, rector of Burton Latymer. I
cannot find either name in the printed pedigrees of the various families of
Owen, nor in such of the Harl. MSS. as I had time to examine. Wanted, the
bishop's arms and crest, and any reference to his pedigree. It is said by
Winkle that his monument is under the episcopal throne in St. Asaph's
cathedral. He died 1651, and his father 1592.

_St. Wilfrid's Needle in Yorkshire_,--"where they used to try maids,
whether they were honest." (_Burton._) Does this stone exist? "Ancient
writers do not mention," says Lingard, "Stonehenge, Abury, &c., as
appendages to _places of worship_ among the Celtae," therefore may it not
be that these remains of antiquity were devoted to vain superstitions of
the ignorant people, if not to gloomy rites of the officiating priests of
the British Druids? The gigantic obelisks of single stones, called the
"Devil's Arrows," near Boroughbridge, and the assemblage of rocks called
Bramham Crags, a few miles north-west of Ripon, are considered to have been
Druidical. Is St. Wilfrid's either of these? and can farther information
about this rock be afforded?

_Governor of St. Christopher in 1662._--Will any one be so kind as to
inform me who was the governor of the island of St. Christopher in the year
1662? I have an original, but unsigned letter, from him to the contemporary
Dutch governor of St. Martin's, demanding reparation for an outrage of most
extraordinary nature. He complains that the Dutch had seized and _reduced
to slavery_ the crew and passengers of an English ship during a time of
peace. Is anything known of this affair, or is there any means of
discovering the names of the colonial governors of that age? The letter is
dated Sept. 1, 1662, and is endorsed, "A Coppie of my letter to the Gov. of
St. Martin's."

_The Amber Witch._--I am anxious to learn whether this be a pure fiction or
a genuine document dressed up. Its strongest appearance of authenticity
arises from the tedious pedantry of the ancient Lutheran pastor, its
supposed author, which not only renders the perusal heavy, but also lets in
various things unsuited to the decorum of modern manners. If a pure
forgery, my inquiry extends to _the motives_ of a fabrication, tedious to
both reader and writer.

_Coffins for General Use._--In the parish church of Easingwold, Yorkshire,
there was within the last few years an old _oaken shell_ or _coffin_,
asserted to have been used by the inhabitants for the interment of their
dead. After the burial, the coffin was again deposited in the church. Are
there any other well-authenticated instances of a similar usage? And do the
words of the rubric in the Order for "the Burial of the Dead," "When they
come to the grave, while the corpse is _made ready to be laid_ INTO _the
earth_," render it probable that such a custom was generally prevalent in
the Anglican church _since_ the Reformation?

I have met with one corroborative circumstance, in which numbers of bodies
were disinterred in a piece of ground _supposed_ to have been consecrated,
and not a vestige of a coffin was found.

_The Surname Bywater._--Can any of your correspondents furnish me with
particulars relating to the surname "_Bywater_?"

The earliest period from which I can trace it _direct_ to the present day,
and then only by family tradition, is about the close of the seventeenth
century, or say 1680, about which time "---- Bywater" married Miss Witham,
and resided at Towton Hall, near Tadcaster, Yorkshire, a place celebrated
as being the field of a battle fought between the York and Lancaster forces
on Palm Sunday, 1461.

Stow mentions, in his _Survey_, that "_John Bywater_" was a Sheriff of
London in 1424.

Perhaps some of your readers, in Yorkshire or elsewhere, can throw a light
on the subject, or can refer me to a book or MS. where information may be
obtained?

_Robert Forbes._--I should be glad if any of your correspondents could
furnish me with any particulars relative to this talented and eccentric
individual. He was the author of _The Dominie Deposed_, in the Buchan
dialect. On the title-page of that piece he is described as "Robert Forbes,
A.M., Schoolmaster of Peterculter," near Aberdeen. On application, however,
to the Session Clerk of Peterculter, that functionary states that no such
person was ever schoolmaster of that parish. Be this as it may, Forbes was
obliged to leave Scotland on account of an intrigue, which he has
humorously described in his _Dominie Deposed_. He appears to have removed
to London, where he commenced the business of a hosier, in a shop on Tower
Hill, at the sign of the "Book." Here he composed that {511} celebrated
travestie on the _Speech of Ajax to the Grecian Chiefs_, also in the Buchan
dialect:

 "The wight an' doughty captains a',
    Upo' their doups sat down;
  A rangel o' the commoun fouk
    In bourachs a' stood roun."

I think Forbes states that his place of business on Tower Hill was "hard by
the shop of Robbie Mill." (See Chalmers' _Life of Ruddiman_.) Forbes is
supposed to have died about the year 1750.

Can any one inform me where I can obtain a sight of this tract? I have

Bodleian, Grenville, Douce, and other collections, but in vain; and can
find no trace of it anywhere.

_Alteration in Oxford Edition of the Bible._--In the stereotype edition of
the Bible, in 8vo., printed at Cambridge, for the British and Foreign Bible
Society, I find the word _Judah_, 2 Chron. xxi. 2., substituted for
_Israel_. This latter word is the reading of every copy of the authorized
English version that I have been able to consult, including the 12mo.
edition printed for the British and Foreign Bible Society at Oxford.

No doubt _Judah_ is the right word in this passage. The context requires
it; and it is the reading of forty Hebrew MSS., and of all the ancient
versions, except the Chaldee. It is also the reading of the old English
version by Coverdale. But it has not been adopted by King James's
translators. How has this deviation from their text crept into an edition
emanating from a University press?

Rolls _betwixt the time of the death of Sir Gilbert Gerrard and the entry
of Sir Thomas Egerton_." Now Sir Thomas Egerton entered on the 10th of
April, 1594, and I have reason to believe that the office had been vacant
for about a year. But I can find no notice of Sir Gilbert's death. He was a
member of Gray's Inn; admitted in 1537, barrister 1539, ancient 1547,
reader 1554, serjeant 1558, attorney-general 1559, Master of the Rolls
1581; and during the interval between the death of Lord Chancellor Hatton
(Nov. 22, 1591) and the appointment of Lord Keeper Puckering (May 28, 1592)
one of the commissioners for hearing causes in chancery.

son of John Fitzjohn Fitzgeoffrey, who died near Guildford in 1258, and who
was the son and heir of John Fitzgeoffrey, Justiciary of Ireland in 1246.
His mother's name is not mentioned in any authorities I have been able to

_Smyth's MSS. relating to Gloucestershire._--In Rudder's _History of

    "John Smyth, of Nibley, ancestor to the present proprietor, was very
    eminent for his great assiduity in collecting every kind of information
    respecting this county and its inhabitants. He wrote the Genealogical
    History of the Berkeley Family, in three folio MSS., which Sir William
    Dugdale abridged and published in his _Baronage of England_. In three
    other folio MSS. he has registered with great exactness _the names of
    the lords of manors in the county in the year 1608_, _the number of men
    in each parish able to bear arms, with their names, age, stature,
    professions, armour, and weapons_. _The sums each landholder paid to
    subsidies granted in a certain year_ are set down in another MS. He
    likewise committed to writing a very particular account of the customs
    of the several manors in the hundred of Berkeley, and _the pedigrees of
    their respective lords_. These and some other MSS., which cost him
    forty years in compiling, are now (1779) in the possession of Nicholas
    Smyth, Esq., the fifth from him in lineal descent."

_Proclamations to prohibit the Use of Coal, as Fuel, in London._--Dr.

Polytechnic Institution, mentions the fact that three separate
proclamations were issued for this purpose, and that it was at last made a

executed for burning coal within the metropolis. Now what I want to
ascertain relative to the above facts, is: 1. The date of each; 2. Any
particulars that you or any of your correspondents may be kind enough to
furnish; 3. The name, and station, trade, or profession of the person so
executed.

As Dr. Bachoffner has now often reiterated the above statement at the

ARTHUR C. WILSON.

    [We have not been able to find any account of the execution for burning
    coal noticed by Dr. Bachoffner, which probably took place during the
    reign of Edward I., when the use of coal was prohibited by proclamation
    at London in the year 1306. These proclamations are noticed in Prynne's
    _Animadversions on the Fourth Part of Sir Edward Coke's Institutes_, p.
    182., where it is said, that "in the latter part of the reign of Edward
    I., when brewers, dyers, and other artificers using great fires, began
    to use sea-coals instead of dry wood and charcoal, in and near the city
    of London, the prelates, nobles, commons, and other people of the
    realm, resorting thither to parliaments, and upon other occasions, with
    the inhabitants of the city, Southwark, Wapping, and East Smithfield,
    complained thereof twice one after another to the king as a public
    nuisance, corrupting the air with its stink and smoke, to the great
    prejudice and detriment of their health. Whereupon the king first
    prohibited the burning of sea-coal by his proclamation; which being
    disobeyed by many for their private lucre, the king upon their second
    complaint issued a commission of Oyer and Terminer to inquire of all

ADDISON AND HIS HYMNS.

(Vol. v., p. 439.)

Any attempt to divorce Addison from his hymns in the _Spectator_, and to
ascribe them to any other writer, is so great a wrench to the feelings of a
sexagenarian like myself, that the question must at once be set at rest.

In reply to J. G. F.'s inquiry, these hymns, or a portion of them, were
claimed for Andrew Marvell by Captain Edward Thompson, the editor of
Marvell's works; but a writer in Kippis's edition of the _Biographia
Britannica_ remarks:

    "We shall content ourselves with observing, that any man who can
    suppose that the ease, eloquence, and harmony of the ode, 'The Spacious
    Firmament,' &c., could flow from Marvell's pen, must be very deficient
    in taste and judgment."

This claim on Captain Thompson's part was to have been considered under the
article "Marvell," but the second edition of the _Biographia_ did not, as
we well know, extend beyond the letter F.

But though we cannot concede these hymns to Marvell, he must not be
underrated. His downright honesty of character and purpose must ever excite
respect. His biographer strangely introduces him to us as "A witty droll in
the seventeenth century, the son of a facetious gentleman at Hull." In one
respect he resembled our gifted essayist; his style in prose was so
captivating that we are told

    "From the King down to the Tradesman, his _Rehearsal Transposed_ was
    read with great pleasure; he had all the men of wit on his side."

To return to the hymns and the just claims of Addison to the whole of them.

In the _Spectator_, No. 453., Addison says,

    "I have _already_ communicated to the public some pieces of divine
    poetry, and as they have met with a very favourable reception, _I shall
    from time to time publish any work of the same nature which has not yet
    appeared in print_, and may be acceptable to my readers."

Then follows the hymn "When all Thy Mercies," &c. Coming from such a man as
Addison, this {514} must be considered as pretty strong evidence of
authorship.

In the _Spectator_, No. 441., when introducing the hymn "The Lord my
Pasture," &c., Addison observes--

    "As the poetry of the original is very exquisite, I shall present my
    readers with the following translation of it."

With respect to this composition Bishop Hurd remarks, that Addison's

    "True judgment suggested to him that what he drew from Scripture was
    best preserved in a pure and simple expression, and the fervour of his
    piety made that simplicity pathetic."

No doubt seems to have crossed the Bishop's mind as to the authorship.
Sometimes Addison thought fit to throw a little mystery over these hymns.
In _Spectator_, No. 489., after alluding to Psalm cvii. v. 23., "They that
go down to the sea," &c. (which Addison says gives a description of a ship
in a storm, preferable to any other that he has met with), he subjoins his
"divine Ode made by a _Gentleman_ on the conclusion of his travels," "How
are Thy servants blest," &c.

The verses 4 to 8 are said to refer to the storm which Allison himself
encountered on the Mediterranean, after he embarked at Marseilles in 1700.

The hymn "When rising from the bed of death," _Spectator_, No. 513, "a
thought in sickness," is contained in a supposed letter from a _Clergyman_,
viz. one of the club, "who assist me in my speculations."

Tickell, in his exquisite elegy, so worthy of its subject, when asking,

 "What new employments please the unbody'd mind?"

adds,

 "Or mixed with milder cherubim to glow,
  In _hymns of love, not ill essayed below_."

Were not the very hymns which we are speaking of in Tickell's mind?

Addison's piety, we may well gather from his writings, was, as Mr. Macaulay
observes, of a cheerful character. The feeling which predominates in all
his devotional papers, is that of gratitude; do we not find it also
strikingly developed in his hymns? We all remember the beautiful lines,

 "Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
    My daily thanks employ,
  Nor is the least a cheerful heart,
    That tastes those gifts with joy."

Let Bishop Ken and Addison retain their divine hymns--dear as they are, and
let us hope ever will be, to man, woman, and child--whilst the English
language is read or spoken. How greatly is their sublimity heightened, and
their beauty enhanced, when we associate with them the purity of character
and the assemblage of virtues which distinguished their excellent authors!

WITCHCRAFT--MRS. HICKES AND HER DAUGHTER.

(Vol. v., p. 394.)

The particulars your correspondent asks for have not been furnished; but on
what authority, _to move the previous question_, does the alleged fact of
such a trial and execution at Huntingdon in 1716 for witchcraft, stated by
Mr. Wills, and adopted by the _Quarterly Rev._, rest? Mr. Wills (_Sir Roger
de Coverley_, Notes, p. 126.) mentions also the execution of two women at
Northampton for witchcraft just before the _Spectator_ began to be
published (March 1, 1710-11), but gives no reference to any original source
to support his statement. On the other hand, Hutchinson, the first edition
of whose _Essay concerning Witchcraft_ was published in 1718, and the
second in 1720, who gives a chronological table of facts, informs us that
the last execution in England for witchcraft was that at Exeter of Susan
Edwards, Mary Trembles, and Temperance Lloyd in 1682 (vid. _Essay_, p. 41.,
1st edit.). He was too painstaking a writer to be in ignorance of cases
which had occurred so recently; and he had the assistance, in collecting
his materials, of the two chief justices Parker and King, and Chief Baron
Bury, to whom the work is dedicated. Through their means he must have been
informed of what had taken place on the circuits, if any cases of
witchcraft on which convictions had arisen had actually come before the
judges. When it is remembered what attention was directed to the trial of
Jane Wenham in 1712, who, though condemned, was not executed, and on whose
case a great number of pamphlets were written, it can scarcely be supposed
that in four years after two persons, one only nine years old (I take the
account in Mackay's _Popular Delusions_, vol. iii.), should have been tried
and executed for witchcraft without public attention being called to the
circumstance. I may add that in the _Historical Register_ for 1716, which
notices in the domestic occurrences all trials of interest, there is no
mention of such a case; and that in two London newspapers for 1716, which I
have in a complete series, though enumerating other convictions on the
circuit, I have equally searched without success. As it is a matter of
considerable historical interest to ascertain accurately when the last
execution for witchcraft took place in England, I should be glad if any of
your correspondents would refer me to the authority on which the statements
of the trials circ. 1710 and in 1716 are founded. Mr. Wright, I observe,
does not notice them, and his words are--

    "The case of Jane Wenham is the last instance of a witch being
    condemned by the verdict of an English jury."--_Narratives of Sorcery
    and Magic_, vol. ii. p. 326.

DODO QUERIES.

(Vol. i., p. 261.)

In answer to MR. STRICKLAND'S third Query, I beg to inform him that among
the original authors who speak of the Dodo as a living bird, Johan Nieuhof
merits a place. His work is entitled:

    "Johan Nieuhofs gedenkweerdige Brasiliaense zee en Lantreize,
    behelsende alhetgeen op dezelve is voorgevallen: beneffens een bondige
    beschrijving van gantsch Neerlants Brasil, zoo van lantschappen,
    steden, dieren, gewassen, als draghten, zeden en godsdienst der
    inwoonders; en insonderheit, een wijtloopig verhael der merkwaardigste
    voorvallen en geschiedenissen, die zich, geduurende zijn negenjarigh
    verblijf in Brasil, in d'oorlogen en opstant der Portugesen, tegen
    d'onzen, zich sedert het jaer 1640-1649 hebben toegedragen. Doorgaens
    verciert met verscheide afbeeldingen, na't leven aldaer getekent. Te
    Amsterdam, voor de Weduwe van Jacob van Meurs, op de Keizersgracht,
    anno 1682."

This work, although published in six languages, and several times
reprinted, adorned with a hundred exquisite engravings, and portrait of the
author, seems to be no longer generally known. It was dedicated to Nikolaes
Witsen, burgomaster and councillor of Amsterdam; and the licence granted to
Jacob van Meurs, the 14th Dec. 1671, by the states of Hollandt en
Westvrieslandt, is signed "Johan de Wit."

The copy in my possession consists of two parts in folio, bound together in
parchment, furnished with two indexes, which however do not mention all the
volume contains, for we look in vain for the name _Dodaers_, _Dodo_, or
_Dronte_ in the indexes; and yet we find in the second part, p. 282., a
well-executed representation of this bird, and on the following page we
read:

    "_Dronte of Dodaers._

    "Op het eilant Mauritius inzonderheit, houdt zeker vogel van een
    wonderlijke gestalte, Dronte, en by d'onzen Dodaers genoemt. Hy is van
    groote tusschen een vogel-struis en Indische Hoen; en verschilt in
    gestalte, en komt ten deele daer mee over-een, ten aenzien van de
    veeren, pluimen en staert. Hy heeft een groot en wanstaltigh hooft met
    een vel bedekt, en verbeelt dat van een koekoek: d'oogen zijn groot en
    zwart: de hals krom, vet, en steekt voor uit. De bek is boven mate
    lang, sterk en blaeuwachtigh wit: behalve d'einden: waer van d'onderste
    zwartachtigh, een bovenste geelachtig zijn, en beide spits en krom. Hy
    spert den bek leelijk en zeer wijt open, is ront en vet van lijf, dat
    met zachte en graeuwe pluimen, als die van den struisvogel, bedekt is.
    De buik en aers is dik, die byna op d'aerde hangt: waerom, en van wegen
    hunnen loomen gang, deez vogel Dodaers by d'onzen genoemt wort. Aen
    beide zijden zitten eenige kleine pluymige pennen, in plaetse van
    vleugels, uit den gelen witachtigh, en achter aen den stuit, in plaetse
    van de steert, vijf gekrulde penne-veeren van een zelve kleure. De
    beenen zijn geelachtigh en dik; maer zeer kort: doch met vier vaste en
    lange pooten. Deze vogel is langzaem van gang en dom, en laet zich
    lichtelijk vangen. Het vleesch, inzonderheit dat van den borst, is vet
    en eetbaer. Hy is zoo zwaer, dat hondert menschen aen drie of vier
    Dronten genoegh t'eeten hebben. Het vleesch van d'ouden is, zoo niet
    gaer gekookt is, zwaer om te verteeren. Het wort ook ingezouten.
    Veelijts hebben zy een grooten en herden steen in de mage, die
    holachtigh en evenwel hart is."

Should MR. STRICKLAND wish further information concerning the work of Johan
Nieuhof, I shall ever be happy to oblige him.

THE HEAVY SHOVE.

(Vol. v., p. 416.)

Like your correspondent MR. CLARK, I too have kept a sharp look-out for
this curious piece ascribed to Baxter; but having been unable to track it,
I had long since come to the conclusion that its existence was apocryphal.

The Rev. James Graves, in his _Spiritual Quixote_, written to ridicule
Moravians and Methodists, notes it "as a very good book of old Baxter's,"
among several others of questionable identity, forming the library of
Geoffrey Wildgoose's grandmother.

When we recollect the temptation offered in the quaint and uncouth titles
of the old Presbyterians, we can hardly wonder at their enemies improving
upon them; and in this way, it appears to me, we are to account for the
respectable name of Baxter being popularly attached to a book which
everybody talks about, but which nobody has seen.

It is again mentioned by Richard Cooksey, in his _Life of Lord Somers_,
Worcester, 1791, and, taking its existence for granted, the author is
astonished that Baxter, whom he extols to the skies, "could so far
condescend to the temper and debased humour of the times as to entitle one
of his tracts _A Shove_, &c. Commenting upon this, Wilson, in his _History
of Dissenting Churches_, London, 1808, is the next who alludes to the book
in question, but merely to shift its authorship from "the famous Richard
Baxter of Kidderminster" to a more obscure individual of the same
name,--described as "an elder (in 1692) of the Particular Baptist
congregation worshipping in Winchester House." Of this person he says, "I
know nothing excepting that he appears to have been a Fifth Monarchy man,
and to have been far gone in enthusiasm."

Although thus doubting that the author of the _Saints' Rest_ wrote such a
book as that described, I {516} do not deny that there is a piece bearing
the title in existence; but upon it the name of "_William_ Bunyan" figures
as the author. A copy of this was in the Theological Portion of the late
Mr. Rodd's books, sold by Sotheby & Co. in 1850, and bears the imprint of
"London, 1768." This, I am inclined to think, is the only _Shove_ MR. CLARK
is likely to meet with; and although I can give no further account of it, I
am disposed to consider it the spurious catchpenny of some ignorant
scoffer, who, taking his _cue_ from Graves, or rather from some earlier
writer who has noticed it, thought it would be a good _spec._, and
therefore launched into the world _his_ "_Effectual Shove_."

GROUND ICE.

(Vol. v., p. 370.)

Your Querist J. C. E. is informed that the singular phenomenon of the
formation of ice in the beds of running rivers has not escaped the notice
of scientific observers. M. Arago has devoted a paper to its investigation
in the _Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes_ for 1832 or 1833, in which he
specifies the rivers in which it has been observed. Indeed, although from
its nature it is likely to escape notice, it is probably of not infrequent
occurrence. Ireland, in his _Picturesque Views of the Thames_, quoting Dr.
Plot, speaks of the subaqueous ice of that river. Colonel Jackson, in the
fifth volume of the _Journal of the Royal Geographical Society_, alludes to
its formation in the Neva, in a paper on the congelation of that river; and
in the following volume of the same Journal is an article by Mr. Weitz,
especially devoted to the ground ice of the rivers of Siberia. More
recently, Mr. Eisdale has contributed the result of his researches upon the
same subject to the _Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_, vol. xvii.; and,
finally, Dr. Farquharson has made public his observations upon the
ground-gru of the rivers Don and Leochal, in Lincolnshire, in the
_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1835. There is also an article on the
subject in one of the later volumes of the _Penny_ or _Saturday_ Magazines.

That bodies of running, water, the surface of which solidifies when exposed
to a diminished temperature, should have a tendency to congelate in their
sheltered depths, seems an anomaly which demands inquiry and explanation;
and accordingly each of the above-mentioned writers has raised an
hypothesis more or less probable, to account for the phenomenon. Dr.
Farquharson would attribute it to the radiation of heat from the bottom, as
dew is formed by radiation from the surface of the earth; but a
consideration of the supervening obstacles to radiation--a body of moving
water thickly coated with ice and even snow--destroys the plausibility of
his theory. That of Mr. Eisdale, that the frozen _spiculae_ of the
atmosphere falling into the water become _nuclei_, around which the water
at the bottom freezes, seems merely frivolous. The explanation of M. Arago
is more satisfactory, viz. that the lower currents of water being less
rapid in motion than those intermediate, or at the surface, congelation may
be expected at a lower temperature (say 32deg Fahr.), the process of
crystallisation being favoured by the pebbles, fragments of wood, and the
uneven surface of the river's bed. After all, however, the phenomenon has
been but imperfectly investigated under its various manifestations, and its
real cause probably remains yet to be discovered.

CHARACTER OF ALGERNON SYDNEY.

(Vol. v., pp. 426. 447.)

Your two correspondents C. E. D. (p. 426.) and C. (p. 447.) appear to have
read MR. HEPWORTH DIXON'S Query about Algernon Sydney either very hastily
or very carelessly. Yet it seems to me plain enough. There is not one word
in it about Barillon or Dalrymple; no inquiry about the home life of
Sydney. As every one knows a great part of his time was spent abroad, it is
probable MR. DIXON thinks that anecdotes and allusions to so conspicuous a
person may occur in the cotemporary letters and memoirs of France, Germany,
Italy, &c., and he asks for references to any such anecdotes or allusions
as may have fallen in the way of readers of "N. & Q." Surely this is
explicit. But what has Dalrymple or Mr. Croker to say in answer to a
question about Sydney's way of life when abroad? That, as I take it, was
the point, and a general discussion as to the character of the author of
the _Discourses on Government_ is _a-propos_ of nothing. As the subject has
been opened, and as I know of none more interesting in the whole range of
English history, I cannot refrain from at least entering one protest
against C.'s description of the "illustrious patriot" as a "corrupt traitor
of the worst class."

That MR. DIXON is not single in his admiration of the character of Sydney I
could quote many "instances," from our late prime minister downwards. But
the title "illustrious" can scarcely be denied to a man who, besides being
of the best blood in England, played a leading part in the Revolution, and
was one of the closest thinkers and most masculine writers our language has
to show. What makes a man illustrious? Birth, commanding position,
intellect, learning, literary genius? Sydney had them all. But C. thinks
{517} he ought not to be called a patriot. What, do his wisdom and
moderation in the civil war; his opposition to the extreme measures of
Cromwell; his long solitary exile; his glorious death, count for nothing?
There is, however, the charge of taking money from the King of France. No
doubt this is a very "curious case," and I too shall be anxious to see
"what light MR. DIXON may be able to throw on it." The accusation rests on
the sole authority of Dalrymple; and Dalrymple is _not_ a man who can be
taken on his mere word. He was a violent partisan. He hated the Whigs, and
is convicted of having suppressed the truth, when it suited his party or
his passions to misrepresent. The Barillon Correspondence should be again
examined, and, if possible, further particulars of the money payments to
our party leaders obtained.

MONUMENT TO THE MEMORY OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS AT ANTWERP.

(Vol. v., p. 415.)

Having visited the interesting city of Antwerp in the autumn of 1846, I can
answer the Query of your correspondent C. E. D. from personal inspection.
The monument to Mary Queen of Scots is still in existence; and consists of
a richly ornamented slab, placed at a considerable height from the
pavement, against a pillar in (I think) the southern transept of the church
of St. Andrew. I was told on the spot that it was erected by two English
ladies, but my informant was silent as to the tradition respecting the
head. In the centre of the carvings which adorn the upper part of the
monument, is inserted a medallion portrait of the beautiful but unfortunate
queen; it is extremely well painted, and represents her in that peculiar
costume so familiar to those acquainted with her accustomed style of dress.
I inclose a copy of the inscription:--

                 "MARIA STUARTA,
                Scot. et Gall. Reg.
          Jacob. Magn. Britan. Reg. Mater.
    Anno 1568, in. Angl. Refugii causa descendens.

      Martyrium consumavit. Anno D. N. 1587.
                  Aeta. Regy. 45."

The wood-carvings, with which this church abounds (especially those of the
pulpit and its accessories), are marvellous efforts of Art.

M. W. B.

Having visited the church of St. Andrew at Antwerp during the autumn of
last year, I am able to inform your correspondent C. E. D. (Vol. v., p.
415.) that the monument to which he alludes still exists.

The portrait of Mary Queen of Scots is above the tablet, which was, I
believe, erected to the memory of Elizabeth Curle; who, after the execution
of her mistress, resided at Antwerp, and was buried in that church.

F. H.

The monument dedicated to the memory of their beloved mistress by the two
noble ladies of the household of Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Barbara Mowbray,
the wife, and Elizabeth Curle, the sister, of Gilbert Curle, the queen's
confidential secretary, still exists in the church of St. Andrew at
Antwerp. The history, or rather _story_ of the decapitated head having been
borne away by these ladies, and buried at the foot of the pillar on which
the monument is placed, which is alluded to by your correspondent, is too
apocryphal for belief. There is no reason to suppose that any _head_ of the
queen was carried away by these devoted women into exile, excepting in the
shape of her portrait painted on copper; which, instead of being interred
_beneath_ the monument, is still to be seen placed above the dedicatory
inscription. It is true that in the edition of Descamps' _Voyage
Pittoresque de la Flandre_, published at _Paris_ and _Rouen_ in 1769, it is
stated that the monument was surmounted by "_son buste en marbre_;" but
this error was corrected in the _Antwerp_ edition of 1792, where it is
correctly affirmed to be "_son portrait peint_."

Mention is made of this crowned portrait, of a circular form, in Mackie's
_Castles and Prisons of Queen Mary_, and of the close resemblance it bears
to another in the possession of Lady Cathcart; who assured Mr. Mackie that
the two portraits were painted by order of the queen, and presented by her
to _two Scottish ladies_, but whose names are not mentioned.

The following epitaph to the memory of these two faithful servants of the
unhappy queen, has also been preserved by Jacques Le Roy in his _Theatre
Sacre du Brabant_, tom. ii. p. 90. It was copied by him from a blue marble
slab placed over the entrance to the vault in which they were deposited:--

    "D. O. M.

    _Sub hoc lapide duarum feminarum vere piarum conduntur corpora_ D.
    BARBARAE MOUBRAY _et_ D. ELISABETHAE CURLE _utraeque Scotae,
    nobilissimae Mariae Reginae a cubiculis, quarum monumentum superiori
    affigitur columnae. Illa vidua mortalium legi cessit_ XXXI. _Julii anno
    1616 aetatis_ LVII., _dum haec semper caelebs_ XXIX. _Maii, aetatis_
    LX. _Dni_ M.DC.XX."

In the inscription placed against the pillar, dedicated to the memory of
Queen Mary, Lady Barbara is said to be a daughter of Lord John
Mowbray--_Barbara Moubray, D. Johan Moubray, Baronis F._

The writer of this note is desirous of obtaining some authentic information
respecting these two noble Scottish families, and hopes this {518}
communication may serve to elicit what he has long sought to trace. The
armorial bearings of both families (originally affixed to the monument)
have been effaced.

He would be glad also to be referred to any documents tending to throw
light on the obscure history of poor Mary's intriguing _French_ secretary,
Nau; as to where he was born, his connexions and avocations in early life;
how, and by what secret influence he entered into the service of the queen;
and, lastly, how he came to be pardoned, and what became of him afterwards?
She declared, in her last hours, that _he was the cause of her death_?

LORD KING; THE SCLATERS; DR. KELLET, ETC.

(Vol. v., p. 457.)

If BALLIOLENSIS wishes for a more particular account of the Sclater family
than that which follows, I shall be happy to correspond with him upon the
subject.

_Anthony Sclater, D.D._, was vicar of Leighton Buzzard for fifty years, and
died, aged 100, about 1620. His son--

_William Sclater, D.D._, Fellow of King's, and vicar of Pitminster in
Somersetshire, is the person mentioned by Dr. Kellet. He was an exceedingly
learned man, and the author of many theological works (for a list, see
_Bib. Bod. Cat._), some of which were published after his death, _which
occurred in 1627_. There is a curious and interesting account of him in
Fuller's _Worthies_, vol. i. p. 119. (see also _Athenae Oxonienses_). His
son--

_William Sclater, also D.D. and Fellow of King's_, was vicar of Collumpton,
Devon, and prebend of Exeter, and appears to have kept up by several works
and sermons the reputation of the family for doctrinal theology.[2] His
son--

_Francis Sclater, B.D._ (Fellow of C. C. C. Oxon. May 17, 1667, aet. 17),
was likewise a person of extraordinary learning and abilities, as appears
from several notices, and more particularly from the inscription on a
silver-gilt cup presented to C. C. C. in memory of him by his father; and
from an elegant Latin epitaph which was placed on the south wall of St.
James's, Clerkenwell.[3] He died in 1685, aet. 35, leaving a son--

_Christopher Sclater, M.A._, born 1679, rector of Loughton in Essex, and
afterwards of Chingford in the same county. His eldest son--

_William Sclater, D.D._, seems (from MSS. still existing) to have inherited
the theological talent of his ancestors, but o. s. p. Richard Sclater,
Esq., the second son of Christopher, was grandfather to William Lutley
Sclater, Esq., of Hoddington House, Hants, the present representative of
the family. By a third son, Christopher Sclater was grandfather to Eliza
Sclater, wife of ---- Draper, Esq., and celebrated for her Platonic
attachment to Lawrence Sterne. From MSS. preserved in the family, it is
clear that she must have been a woman of considerable talent.

I had always supposed _William Sclater_, the Nonjuror, and author of _An
Original Draught_, &c., to have been a brother of _Francis Sclater_; but,
if it be true that his work was a posthumous publication (as I learn for
the first time from the Note by the EDITOR of "N. & Q."), I think it most
probable that it was his father (the vicar of Collumpton above mentioned),
who would have been about sixty years of age in 1688, and who was certainly
a man of learning and scholarship.

I have no doubt that Edward Sclater, the pervert of Putney, belonged to the
same family, though I know not in how near relationship.

The name of Sclater, which is curious, seems to have originated in a place
called Slaughter (olim Sclostre or Sclaughtre, _temp._ King John) in
Gloucestershire, where a family of Sclaughters flourished as lords of the
manor for upwards of 300 years. The arms of both families are: arg. a
saltier az.; crest, an eagle sa. rising out of a ducal coronet. The motto
of the Sclater family (which they owe, no doubt to one of their learned
ancestors) is a Greek quotation from Gal. vi. 14.: "[Greek: ei me en toi
stauroi]."

About the commencement of the seventeenth century, another branch of the
same family (whose patronymic was Thomas) was settled in Cambridgeshire.
The last male representative of these, Sir Thomas Sclater, Bart., died
without issue in 1684 (see Burke's _Ext. Baronetages_).

I should be glad of any information respecting the connexion of these two
branches with each other, or of either with the parent stem in
Gloucestershire. I should also be glad of information respecting one Will.
Slatyer, D.D. (whose name is sometimes, I _believe_ erroneously, spelt
Sclater) a very learned person, chaplain to James I., the {519} author of
some curious historical and genealogical works, and a celebrated Hebraist
in those times. He was a cotemporary of Sclater of Pitminster, and died at
Ottenden in Kent about the same time; but it is doubtful whether they were
relations.

The following Notes are very much at the service of your correspondent
BALLIOLENSIS. It is true that they do not afford a precise answer to his
immediate Query, but they comprise particulars which may very probably lead
to it, and will at least be interesting in compliance with his request for
any notices respecting the family of Sclater.

Anthony Sclater was minister of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire for about
fifty years, and died at the age of nearly one hundred. His son, William
Sclater, was born there in 1577; educated at Eton and King's College,
Cambridge, B.D. and D.D., preacher at Walsall, co. Staffordshire; presented
to the vicarage of Pitminster, near Taunton, co. Somerset, by John Coles,
Esq.; and to a rectory in the same county by John, afterwards Lord Powlett.
Died at Pitminster, 1627. He was the author of the following works, and of
others unpublished:--

    "A Key to the Key of Scripture, or an Exposition, with Notes, on the
    Epistle to the Romans, &c. 4to, London, 1611. Dedicated to Sir Henry
    Hawley, Knt., and four other Gentlemen."

    "The Minister's Portion, a Sermon on 1 Cor. ix. 13, 14. 4to. Oxford,
    1612. Dedicated to Thomas Southcote, Esq., of Mohun's Ottery in
    Devonshire."

    "The Sick Soul's Salve, a Sermon on Prov. xviii. 14. 4to. Oxford, 1612.
    Dedicated to John Horner, Esq., and to the devout Anna his wife, at
    Melles in Somerset."

    "The Christian's Strength, a Sermon at Oxford on Philip. iv. 13. 4to.
    Oxford, 1612. Dedicated to William Hill, Esq., of Pitminster."

    "An Exposition upon the First Epistle to the Thessalonians. 4to.
    London, 1619. Dedicated to the Lord Stanhope, Baron of Haringdon."

    "The Question of Tythes revised, &c. 4to. London, 1623. Dedicated to
    Lake, Bishop of Bath and Wells."

    "A Briefe Exposition upon the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians. 4to.
    London, 1629. Dedicated to 'John Pawlet, Esq., his very honourable good
    Patron, and Elisabeth his Wife, his much honoured Patronesse.'"

    "Utriusque Epistolae ad Corinthios Explicatio, &c. Edited by his Son.
    4to. Oxon. 1633. Dedicated to 'Edvardo Keletto, S. T. D. Sancti Petri
    apud Exoniensis residentiario, nec non M. Georgio Goadio coll. Regalis
    in Academia Cantabrig. Socio, suo non ita pridem tutori dilectissimo.'"

    "A Brief and Plain Commentary on the Prophecy of Malachy, &c. Published
    by his Son. 4to. London, 1650. Dedicated to Mr. Henry Walrond of
    Bradfield, Devon."

    "An Exposition on the Fourth Chapter of the Romans, &c. Published by
    his Son. 4to. London, 1650. Dedicated to 'John Bampfield of Poltimore
    in Devon, Esq., a most eximious and exemplary Worthy of the West.'"

William Sclater, son of the above, was born at Pitminster; admitted member
of King's College, Cambridge, in 1626; Fellow of that College; Chaplain to
the Bishop of Exeter's Barony of St. Stephen's in Exeter, and preacher at
St. Martin's in that city, 1639; Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral; admitted
Vicar of Collumpton, co. Devon, 4th Feb. 1644, on the presentation of Roger
Mallack of Exeter, Esq. Living there in 1650, then styled B.D., and late
Fellow of King's College; D.D.; minister of St. Peter's-le-Poor, Broad
Street, London, in 1654. Died before 1660.

The following were his published works:

    "The Worthy Communicant rewarded, &c.; a Sermon in Exeter Cathedral,
    21st April, 1639. 4to. London, 1639. Dedicated to Dr. Peterson, Dean of
    Exeter."

    Aldersgate, Sept. 25, 1653, for Mr. Abraham Wheelock, B.D., &c. 4to.
    London, 1654."

The registers of Pitminster and Collumpton would perhaps assist in tracing
the descendants of these worthies, whose name still exists near Exeter.
Fuller, under "BEDFORDSHIRE," gives some further particulars. The works
above-mentioned may almost all, I think, be found in the Bodleian.

J. D. S.

BALLIOLENSIS will find an account of "William Sclater," whom he rightly
supposes to have been at Eton and King's, in Harwood's _Alumni Etonensis_,
p. 200., under the year 1593, 35 Eliz. He will there see that he died 1627,
in the fifty-first year of his age, and was the author of _Comment on the
Romans and Thessalonians_; _Sermons at St. Paul's Cross_; and the _Treatise
on Tithes_, styled _The Minister's Portion_.

Under 1598 occurs "John Sclater." From a MS. account it is stated, "John
Sclater, B.D., 1613, Rector of Holford, Somerset; then of Church Lawford,
Warwick. (See _Dugdale_.) Query, If ejected 1662? if so, his farewell
sermon in Collection A." (See too _Harwood_, p. 203.)

Under 1626 occurs "William Sclater," at p. 227. of _Harwood_, probably a
mistake for 1625. In MS. under 1625 appears "William Sclater, son of W. S.
of 1593, of Pitminster, Somerset, where his father was V.; R. of St.
Steph., Exon.; D.D. 1651; Minister of St. Peter le Poor, Broad Street. (See
_Engl. Worth._, 8vo., p. 21.) Pr. of Exon., Sept. 18, 1641. (See _Walker_,
ob. 1656. See _Wood_.)"

Edward Kellet occurs in _Harwood_ under 1598, {520} p. 204. The account of
his works given there agrees with the extract from the _Gentleman's
Magazine_. It is also stated that he was the author of a sermon entitled _A
Return from Argier, preached at Minehead, March 16, 1627, on the
Re-admission of a relapsed Christian into our Church, on Gal._ v. 2.:
London, 1628, 4to, and that he was a sufferer from the rebellion. In
Harwood he is described as Rector of Bagborough and Crocombe, and Canon of
Exeter. The MS. account is very short. He is there described as "R. of
Rowbarrow, Som.; Can. of Exon.--See his works in _Wood_."

BIRTHPLACE OF ST. PATRICK.

(Vol. v., p. 344.).

From the following extracts I send in answer to your correspondent CEYREP,
there seems to be very great doubt if St. Patrick ever existed in reality,
but that we ought rather to place him in the same category with St.
Amphibalus, St. Denis, &c. Dr. Ledwich relates that--

    "In Usuard's, and the _Roman Martyrology_, Bishop Patrick, of Auvergne,
    is placed at the 16th day of March, and on the same day the office of
    the Lateran canons, approved by Pius V., celebrates the festival of a
    Patrick, the apostle of Ireland. The 17th of March is dedicated to
    Patrick, Bishop of Nola. Had not Dr. Maurice, then, the best reasons
    for supposing that Patricus Auvernensis sunk a day lower in the
    calendar, and made for the Irish a Patricius Hibernensis? This seems
    exactly to be the case. It is very extraordinary the 16th and 17th of
    March should have three Patricks, one of Auvergne, another of Ireland,
    and a third of Nola! The antiquities of Glastonbury record three
    Patricks, one of Auvergne, another archbishop of Ireland, and a third
    an abbot. The last, according to a martyrology cited by Usher, went on
    the mission to Ireland, A.D. 850, but was unsuccessful: he returned and
    died at Glastonbury. If all that is now advanced be not a fardel of
    monkish fictions, which it certainly is, the last Patrick was the man
    who was beatified by the bigoted Anglo-Saxons, for his endeavours to
    bring the Irish to a conformity with the Romish church."

Dr. Aikin remarks upon this--

    "The author now ventures upon the bold attempt of annihilating St.
    Patrick. It is an undoubted fact, that this saint is not mentioned in
    any author, or in any work of veracity, in the fifth, sixth, seventh or
    eighth centuries. His name is in Bede's _Martyrology_; but it is more
    than probable that that martyrology is not Bede's: nor can it be
    conceived that Bede, in his other works, should never notice the signal
    service rendered by Patrick to the Roman church, and the signal
    miracles wrought by him in its behalf, if he had ever heard of them;
    for the old venerabilis was zealously devoted to that church and its
    mythology."

The saint certainly vanishes into "an airy nothing," if we are to credit
the above authors. I have also consulted Ware, a Roman Catholic writer,
author of the _Antiquitates Hibernicae_, and nowhere can I find a trace of
St. Patrick's birthplace, although he is frequently mentioned. In his
seventh chapter he says, "Sancti praecipui Hibernici Seculi quinti, qui
Euangelium in Hibernia praedicaerunt, fuerunt Palladius, Patricius," and
many others. The twenty-sixth chapter entitled "Monasteriologia Hibernica,
sive Diatriba de Hiberniae Coenobiis, in qua Origines eorum et aliae
Antiquitates aperiuntur," gives the names and titles of the founders of
monasteries, as also their dates, and, in speaking of one of them, but in
this case specifying no date, relates a curious circumstance as to the
building of a church. It may perhaps interest your readers, and I will
therefore quote the passage (p. 212.):

    "Sanctus Patricius construxit hoc coenobium Canonicis regularibus,
    eique praefecit Abbatem S. Dunnium: Ecclesiam vero adjecit (juxta
    Jocelinum Furnessensem), contra morem receptum, non ab Occidente in
    Orientem, sed a Septentrione in Austrum protensam."

This nevertheless hangs upon the reality of a St. Patrick. In another part
of the same work it is said of a monastery (p. 219.):

    "S. Dabeocum fundasse ferunt Seculo 5, vivente S. Patricio. Alii S.
    Patricium fundatorem volunt."

From these quotations it is clear Ware treated him as a real actor in Irish
ecclesiastical affairs; but the two first-named authors appear to set the
matter at rest.

_Cabal_ (Vol. iv., p. 507.).--The two quotations from _Hudibras_ evidently
refer to two different meanings of this word _Cabal_. The first, alluding
to the ancient Cabala, or Mysteries, or Secrets, from whence _Cabalistic_;
the second, to its more modern, or political acceptation,--both, however,
including the idea of _secrecy_ or _privity_, as opposed to a general
participation of knowledge or purpose. It is the latter application of the
word to which the inquiry of E. H. D. D., at p. 443., Vol. iv., refers: and
MR. KERSLEY's quotation from a book printed in 1655 (p. 139., Vol. v.),
proves its usage in this sense at least seven years before Burnet's
derivation of the word from the initials of the five chief ministers of
Charles II. I do not think that Pepys could use the word _Cabal_, as
applicable to the "king's confidential advisers," _several_ years before
Burnet derived it from their initials; the ministers in question having
been appointed circa 1670. Burnet's definition was published in 1672, and
Pepys was appointed Secretary to the Admiralty in 1673. Blount, in his
_Glossographia_, 3rd edition, 1670, says, "We use to say he is not of our
_cabal_, that is, he is not received into our {521} council, or is not
privy to our secrets." Cole, in his _English Dictionary_, 1685, defines
_Cabal_, "a secret council:" and Bailey derives _Caballer_ from _cabaleur_
(French), "a party man" and _To cabal_, from _cabaler_ (French), "to plot
together privately, to make parties;" and _Cabal_, from "a junto, or
private council, a particular party, a set, or gang."

I find among my papers a scrap relating to the derivation of the word
_Whig_. I do not know where I took it from; but the origin which it gives
to this much-used word is new to me, and may be to some others of your
readers also:

    "The word Whig was given to the Liberal party in England by the
    Royalists in Cromwell's days, from the initial letters of their motto,
    'We hope in God.'"

_The Word "Oasis"_ (Vol. v., p. 465.).--I beg to inclose MR. TEMPLE an
instance of the use of the above word in English poetry, it will be found
in a poem entitled _Hopes of Matrimony_, by John Holland, author of
_Sheffield Park_, published by Francis Westley, 1822, and now lies before
me.

 "Is there a manly bosom can enfold,
  A human heart, so withered, dead, and cold,
  As not to feel, or never to have felt,
  At genial Love's approach, its ices melt?
  No--in the desert of the dreariest breast,
  Some verdant spot, its presence have contest;
  Though parch'd and bloomless, and as wild as bare,
  A rill of nature once meander'd there;
  E'en where Arabia's arid waste entombs
  Whole caravans, the green oasis blooms."

O[)a]sis will be found also in Lempriere's _Classical Dictionary_, but not
in the same sense as above.

_Frightened out of his Seven Senses_ (Vol. iv., p. 233.).--A passage
containing the words "seven senses" occurs in the poem of Taliesin called
_Y Byd Mawr_, or the Macrocosm, of which a translation may be found in vol.
xxi. p. 30. of _The British Magazine_. The writer of the paper in which it
is quoted refers also to the _Mysterium Magnum_ of Jacob Boehmen, which
teaches "how the soul of man, or his 'inward holy body,' was compounded of
_the seven properties_ under the influence of the seven planets:"--

 "I will adore my Father,
  My God, my Supporter,
  Who placed, throughout my head
  The soul of my reason,
  And made for my perception
  _My seven faculties_,
  Of fire, and earth, and water, and air,

_Spick and Span-new_ (Vol. iii., p. 330.).--In Dutch, _spyker_ means a
warehouse, a magazine: and _spange_ (spangle) means anything shining {522}
and thus _spick_ and _span-new_ means, shining new from the _warehouse_.

Q.

_Junius Rumours_ (Vol. v., pp. 125. 159. 474.).--"N. & Q." contains
abundant speculation about the "Vellum-bound" to which your correspondent
refers (p. 474.). Some persons, I know, consider it doubtful whether the
printer did have a copy bound in vellum as Junius directed, and they
strengthen their doubts by, as they assert, no such copy having ever been
met with. MR. CRAMP, on the contrary, maintains that such copies are so
common that the printer must have taken the Junius copy as a pattern. As
MR. CRAMP, I observe, is become a correspondent of "N. & Q.," I will take
leave to direct his attention to the question asked by V. B. (Vol. iii., p.
262.) Others, again, assuming that the printer did have a copy specially
bound for Junius, think it doubtful whether it ever reached him. Of these
differences and speculations your correspondent is evidently unaware; and
he therefore raises a question as if it were new, which has been under
discussion for thirty years. As a set-off, however, he favours us with an
entirely original anecdote, so original, that neither the anecdote nor the
tea-service were ever heard of by H. S. Woodfall's family. Yet it must be
admitted that his story has all the characteristics of authenticity--names,
dates, places. I know, indeed, but one objection, viz. that Mr. Woodfall
never was "in prison on account of the publication of these redoubtable
letters." He was tried, but _acquitted_, under the somewhat celebrated
verdict of "guilty of printing and publishing _only_."

_Cuddy, the Ass_ (Vol. v., p. 419.).--Jamieson is sometimes very absurd;
but in my edition of his _Dictionary_ (Edinburgh, 1808), I do not find the
_Hindoo_ root for _cuddy_ which you attribute to him. I only find: "CUDDIE,
an ass--probably a cant term;" with a reference to the _Lothian_ dialect.

But if it be worth while to answer such questions, I would remind the
inquirer that in Northumberland, and the adjoining districts of Scotland,
_cuddie_ is the contraction of the very common name of _Cuthbert_ (_teste_
"Cuddie Headrig"); and that as the ass is called in other districts "Ned"
and "Neddy," and in others again "Dick" and "Dicky," so he is called in
Northumberland _Cuddie_ by a name familiar in the locality. Everywhere the
male is called "Jack," and the female "Jenny;" are these also derived from
the Hindoostanee?

_The Authorship of the Epigram upon the Letter "H"_ (Vol. v., p. 258.).--I
observe that a controversy has lately been carried on in your columns upon
the authorship of the celebrated enigma on the letter _H_. Permit me, as
one well acquainted with the circumstances, to corroborate the statement of
E. H. Y. The epigram in question was written at the Deepdene, the seat of
the late Thomas Hope, Esq., by Miss Catharine Fanshawe, in the year 1816,
as is recorded in the heading of the original MS. of it contained in a
contemporary _Deepdene Album_ still existing.

You may rely upon the authenticity of this information, which proceeds from
one acquainted with the volume in question and its history.

_John Rogers, Protomartyr, &c._--The reply to my inquiry, as to the present
descendants of this celebrated divine, which appeared in "N. & Q," Vol. v.,

required the information; but I am not the less obliged to E. D. for the
attention given to my request; and I should esteem it a favour to be
further informed where I could procure a complete genealogical account of
the family--to what county the martyr belonged, or if other descendants
survive besides those mentioned by E. D.? John Rogers, Gentleman, buried in
the nave of St. Sepulchre's Church, London, 1775, was a native of Wales.

I should feel grateful for any information, either in "N. & Q." or directed
to me.

_Ancient Timber Town-halls_ (Vol. v., pp. 257. 295. 470.).--During a visit

quaint-looking timber building used for corporate purposes, called the Moot
Hall; I made a rude pen-and-ink sketch of the principal front. On a
subsequent visit I found this building was standing, but that it had ceased
to be used, a new town-hall having been erected. Since then I hear that the
Moot Hall has been pulled down and its site thrown into the market-place.
If I recollect rightly, the principal window of twelve lights was unglazed.

_Johnny Crapaud_ (Vol. v., p. 439.).--When the French took the city of Aras
from the Spaniards, under Louis XIV., after a long and a most desperate
siege, it was remembered that Nostradamus had said:

 "Les anciens crapauds prendront Sara.
  The ancient toads shall Sara take."

This line was then applied to that event in this very roundabout manner.
Sara is Aras backward. By the ancient toads were meant the French: as that
nation formerly had for its armorial bearings three of those odious
reptiles, instead of the three flowers de luce which it now bears.
(Seward's _Anecdotes_, vol. i. p. 78.) Nostradamus died in 1566.

C. B.

_Juba Issham_ (Vol. v., p. 435.).--The signature is two names. The first
needs no explanation; Juba, in _Cato_, is the lover of Marcia: the second
may merely mean that the first is assumed, or false. We have such a surname
as Isham, but it is spelt with one _s_ only.

_Optical Phenomenon_ (Vol. v., p. 441.).--The circumstance mentioned by
your correspondent is only one instance of a very familiar fact, that sight
is rendered clearer by diminishing the quantity of rays, which might
confuse one another. Some for that purpose look between two fingers brought
near. Others nearly close their eyes, &c.

_Bishop of London's House_ (Vol. v., p. 371.).--In the _Wards of London_,
by H. Thomas, 1828, vol. i. p. 7., we are told that--

    "The great fire of London having destroyed the Palace of the Bishop of
    London, which was near St. Paul's Cathedral, this house [Peter House,
    which stood on the west side, about the middle of Aldersgate Street]
    was purchased for the city mansion of the prelates of the diocese, one
    of whom only resided there, Bishop Henchman, who died there, and was
    buried at Fulham, A.D. 1675. It was then called London House, and,
    being subsequently deserted, was let out into private tenements until
    1768; when it was entirely destroyed by fire while in the occupation of
    Mr. Seddon, an upholsterer and cabinet-maker."

A large brick building now covers the site, and retains the name of "London
House." It is occupied by Mr. H. Burton, builder.

In the work above quoted I find no mention of a residence of the Bishops of
London in Bishopsgate. I therefore conclude that the one I have alluded to,
is that respecting which your correspondent wishes to learn.

"_Inveni Portum_" (Vol. v., pp. 10. 64.).--"Actum ne agas" is generally a
safe motto, and a particularly safe one when so learned a scholar as MR.
SINGER has preceded. However, it may do no harm to mention, that since the
Query occurred in the "N. & Q." I have met with two quotations of a very
analogous kind.

The first is given as a quotation, and may be found at the end of George
Sandys' _Divine Poems_, 1648,--"Jam tetigi Portum ---- valete." The second
may be found amongst the _Poems_ of Walter Haddon, and refers to something
more ancient still:

       "_In obitum N. Pointzi Equitis,_
    _Ex Anglico clarissimi viri Th. Henneagii._

  Per medios mundi strepitus, caecosque tumultus,
    Turbida transegi tempora, Pointzus eques.
  Nullus erat terror, qui pectora frangere posset,
    Mens mea perpetuo quod quereretur, erat.
  _Nunc teneo portum, valeant ludibria mundi_,
    Vita perennis ave, vita caduca vale."

Warmington.

_"Cane Decane," &c._ (Vol. v., p. 440).--I cannot inform your correspondent
who was the author of the punning couplet--

 "Cane Decane, canis; sed ne cane, cane Decane,
  De cane, de canis, cane Decane, cane."

But I think that he has injured the spirit of the original in his "_free_
translation."

_Decanus_ means a "Dean," not a Deacon: and the word _canis_, which is both
masculine and _feminine_, was often used by the poets in a _metaphorical_
sense. It seems to me that the author was alluding to some aged _dignitary_
of his day, who had been in the habit of singing songs upon _the ladies_. I
therefore submit to you my _more free_ translation:

          1.
 "Dean Hoare!
  You sung, of yore,
  O'er and o'er,
  Molly ashore.

          2.
  Now, shut the door;
  And of such lore
  Sing no more,
  Dean Hoare!"

BAVIUS.

These lines are cited by Mr. Sandys in the Introduction to his _Specimens
of Macaronic Poetry_, and are there attributed to Professor Porson.

_Fides Carbonarii_ (Vol. iv., pp. 233. 283.).--In reply to QUERIST as to
this saying, E. H. D. D. states that it originated in an anecdote told by
Dr. Milner, or some other controversial writer. A coal-porter being asked
what he believed, replied, "What the church believes:" and being asked what
the church believed, replied, "What I believe."

Now I find the same meaning given by Henry {524} de Bellingen, in his
_Etym. des Prov. Francais_, printed at the Hague, 1656. His words, as
quoted by Leroux de Lincy, are as follow:

    "On fait un conte qui a donne l'origine a ce proverbe. Un charbonnier
    estant enquis par le diable de ce qu'il croyait, luy respondit:
    'Toujours je crois ce que l'eglise croit.' De la est venu que lorsqu'on
    a voulu marquer qu'un homme avait une foi ferme, mais sans science, on
    a dit: 'La foi du charbonnier.'"

Also, in P. J. Le Roux's _Dictionnaire Comique_, 1750:

    "_La foi du charbonnier._ Quand on parle d'une foi implicite, qui fait
    croire a un Chretien en general tout ce que l'eglise croit."

In Landais' _Dictionary_, 4to.:

    "_La foi du charbonnier_, foi simple et aveugle qui ne raisonne pas."

PHILIP S. KING.

_The Book of Jasher_ (Vol. v., p. 415.).--I have a translation of a work
thus named. It was published by Noah and Gould, 144. Nassau Street, New
York, 1840. The publisher's preface mentions Illive's work as "a miserable
fabrication;" claims, as the original of his own, a book "said to have been
discovered in Jerusalem at its capture by Titus," and preserved at Venice,
1613. It also speaks of the "owner and translator" as resident in England.
I have a vague idea that I heard from New York, at the time I received my
volume, that the Duke of Sussex had possessed a copy of the Book of Jasher,
and that some steps had been taken towards the translation by order of His
Royal Highness. I mention this merely to lead inquiry: I cannot trust my
memory as to the verbal expression of a friend so many years ago.

I have long wished the Book of Jasher to obtain a fair hearing, and a more
critical examination than I am qualified to make; and I shall be happy to
lend it to your correspondent L. L. L. in furtherance of what I think an
act of justice.

F. C. B.

_Sites of Buildings mysteriously changed_ (Vol. v., p. 436.).--Perhaps W.
H. K. may deem the following account of the foundation of Bideford _Bridge_
near enough to his purpose:

    "Before whose erection the breadth and roughness of the river was such,
    as it put many in jeopardy: some were drowned, to the great grief of
    the inhabitants, who did therefore divers times, and in sundry places,
    begin to build a bridge; but no firm foundation, after often proof
    being found, their attempts came to no effect. At which time Sir
    Richard Gornard was priest of the place, who (as the story of that town
    hath it) was admonished by a vision in his sleep, to set on the
    foundation of a bridge near a rock, which he should find rowled from
    the higher grounds upon the strand. This he esteemed but a dream; yet,
    to second the same with some art, in the morning he found a huge rock
    there fixed, whose greatness argued it the work of God; which not only
    bred admiration, but incited him to set forwards so charitable a work:
    who eftsoons, with Sir Theobald Grenvile, knight, lord of the land, an
    especial furtherer and benefactor of that work, founded the bridge
    there, now to be seen, which for length, and number of arches,
    equalizeth, if not excelleth, all others in England," &c.--Risdon's
    _Survey of Devon_, s. v. BIDEFORD.

The traditions relating to St. Cuthbert and the foundation of Durham
Cathedral are too well known to find a place in "N. & Q."

_Wyned_ (Vol. v., pp. 321. 474.).--Read _joined_ for _wyned_: "divers
parcels of joined waynescott, windowes, and other implements of household,"
_i. e._ wainscot of joiner's work. I have no doubt this is the true
reading, having once made the very same mistake myself in reading and
printing an inventory of this period.

_Sweet Willy O_ (Vol. v., p. 466).--This song was written by Garrick for
the jubilee in honour of Shakspere, which was held at Stratford-upon-Avon
in 1769, and was sung on that occasion by Mrs. Baddeley. It is printed in
_Shakespeare's garland_, 1769; in the _Poetical works of David Garrick_,
1785; and in the _History of Stratford_, 1806.

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

We have received from Messrs. Rivington, four volumes of their new and
complete edition of _The Works and Correspondence of The Right Honourable
Edmund Burke_, and we do not know that a more valuable contribution could
be made to our stores of historical and political literature, than this
handsome collection of the writings of one whom Sir Robert Peel pronounced
"the most profound of the philosophic statesmen of modern times." Dear to
all lovers of literature as must be the memory of Burke, the friend of
Johnson, who declared, "he was the only man whose common conversation
corresponded with the fame which he had in the world," and of Goldsmith,
who complained that--

 "He to party gave up what was meant for mankind;"

and that he

  ... "too deep for his hearers still went on refining,
  And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining;"--

the present aspect of the political world compels us to look at him rather
as a politician than as a man of letters. Considering, therefore, not only
the profoundly philosophical character of his political works, but also the
elevated tone of political morality which is displayed in the writings of
Edmund Burke--a wisdom and a morality rendered still more attractive by the
unrivalled eloquence with which they are enunciated--the present handsome
and cheap collection of {525} those writings is alike creditable to the
enterprise of the publishers, and well calculated to exercise a beneficial
influence upon the political condition of the country. It would indeed be
well if all who aspire to seats in the new parliament would fit themselves
for such positions by a study of the writings of Edmund Burke.

Mr. Willis has just issued a neat reprint of what has now become a very
scarce volume, _The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin_, a work which may be
regarded as a model of political satire. It is accompanied by occasional
notes elucidating allusions now become obscure through lapse of time, and
the blanks in the text have been filled up with the names of the various
persons introduced or alluded to. Some attempt has also been made to
identify the various authors by whom the several articles were written; but
we are surprised to find this so imperfectly executed, for when the editor
speaks of the authorship being in many cases mere matter of conjecture, it
is clear that he did not know of the very curious, and, we may add,
authentic list, furnished to the third volume (p. 348.) of this journal by
Mr. Hawkins of the British Museum; who has also given a history of the
work, and of the manner in which it was conducted, which ought to have been
made use of.

BOOKS RECEIVED.--_Legal Iambics in Prose, suggested by the present Chancery
Crisis_, a quaint discourse, in which there is no small learning and
humour, and to which may be applied, with some variation, Gay's well-known
Epilogue:

 "Our pamphlet has a moral, and no doubt
  You all have sense enough to find it out."

_An Essay upon the Ghost Belief of Shakspeare_, by Alfred Roffe, is a
little pamphlet well deserving perusal, in which the author--who holds that
ghost belief, rightly understood, is most rational and salutary--endeavours
to show that it must have had the sanction of such a thinker as
Shakspeare.--_Rome in the Nineteenth Century, containing a complete account
of the Ruins of the Ancient City, the Remains of the Middle Ages, and the
Monuments of Modern Times_, by Charlotte A. Eaton. _Fifth Edition_, Vol.
I., the new issue of Bohn's _Illustrated Library_, with its thirty-four
engraved illustrations, will be found a very useful and instructive guide
to the "Eternal City."--_The Heroides, the Amours, Art of Love, &c., of
Ovid, translated_ (with the judicious exception of the more questionable
passages, which are left in the original Latin), forming the new volume of
Bohn's _Classical Library_. In his _Standard Library_ we have now the fifth
and concluding volume of what has been well described as "the enthralling
Biographies of Vasari." Thus for considerably less than one pound has the
English lover of Art the means of possessing one of the most interesting
and instructive works on the subject of his favourite study ever produced.
The work deserves, and, we trust, will meet with a very wide circulation.

A COPIOUS AND CRITICAL

LATIN-ENGLISH LEXICON,

In reviewing this Lexicon, the _Athenaeum_ says--

    "In conclusion, we are glad to have an opportunity of introducing so
    excellent a work to the notice of our classical and philological
    readers. It has all that true German _Gruendlichkeit_ about it which is
    so highly appreciated by English scholars. Rarely, if ever, has so vast
    an amount of philological information been comprised in a single volume
    of this size. The knowledge which it conveys of the earlier and later
    Latin is not to be gathered from ordinary Latin Dictionaries.... With
    regard to the manner in which it is got up, we can speak most
    favourably. Every page bears the impress of industry and care. The type
    is clear, neat, and judiciously varied."

The LITERARY GAZETTE says--

    "We have examined this book with considerable attention, and have no
    hesitation in saying it is the best Dictionary of the Latin language
    that has appeared."

The SPECTATOR says--

    "An elaborate fulness and completeness, while everything is quite
    clear, are the characteristics of this work,--rendering it the best
    Latin Dictionary for the scholar or advanced student."

The EXAMINER says--

    "Dr. Andrews has a claim to our gratitude for his translation, not
    simply on the ground of his faithful retention of the excellencies of
    Dr. Freund, but also for much correction and some additions. In the
    1663 large 8vo. pages which form the volume before us, all the most
    valuable arrangements of detail have been compressed. It remains for us
    only to add that we never saw such a book published at such a price."

*** "In consequence of a strict adherence to this rule, the present work is
distinguished from every manual Latin-English Lexicon heretofore published,
not only by the number of authorities cited, but by its full reference in
every case, both to the name of the classical author, and to the particular
treatise, book, section, or line of his writings, in which the passage
referred to is to be found."

    "To those who wish to possess a critical knowledge of their own native
    English, some acquaintance with Anglo-Saxon is indispensable; and we
    have never seen an introduction better calculated than the present to
    supply the wants of a beginner in a short space of time. The
    declensions and conjugations are well stated, and illustrated by
    references to the Greek, Latin, French, and other languages. A
    philosophical spirit pervades every part. The Delectus consists of
    short pieces on various subjects, with extracts from Anglo-Saxon
    History and the Saxon Chronicle. There is a good Glossary at the
    end."--_Athenaeum, Oct. 20, 1849._

to be original authorities.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
