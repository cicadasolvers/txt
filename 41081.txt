Transcriber's note:

      The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six
      volumes. Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further
      divided into two e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume I, the
      General Introduction, will be released after all other volumes,
      matching the original publication order.

      Except for footnotes and sidenotes, all brackets are in the
      original, as are parenthetical question marks and (_sic_)
      notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are as in
      the printed original.

      The year was shown in a sidenote at the top of each page; this
      has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
      Letter or Abstract.

      A carat character is used to denote superscription. The
      character(s) following the carat is superscripted (example:
      vj^ti). Braces { } are used only when the superscripted
      text is immediately followed by non-superscripted letters
      or period (full stop). Errata and other transcriber's notes
      are shown in [[double brackets]]. "(o)" is used to represent
      the male ordinal.

      Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page
      number to make them usable with the full Index. They are
      grouped at the end of each Letter or Abstract.

      Typographical errors are listed at the end of each Letter,
      after the footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
      corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing
      italics, or mechanical, such as u-for-n misprints. Italic
      "d" misprinted as "a" was a recurring problem, especially
      in Volume IV. The word "invisible" means that there is
      an appropriately sized blank space, but the letter or
      punctuation mark itself is missing.

      The spelling "Jhon" is not an error. Gresham and Tresham
      are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent spelling
      of the name "Lipyate" or "Lipgate" in footnotes is
      unchanged. In this volume, the spelling "apostyle" for
      "apostille" is used consistently.

      Note that the printed book used z to represent original small
      letter yogh. This has not been changed for the e-text.

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[1.1]

_A Lettre to J. Paston, Armig., from his wife, shewing his imprisonment
in the Fleete._[1.2]

[Sidenote: 1461 / NOV. 2]

Ryth worchepfull husbond, I recomand me to yow. Plesyt yow to wet that I
receyvyd yowyr lettyr that ye sent me by John Holme on Wednysday last
past, and also I receyvvd a nothyr lettyr on Fryday at nyt, that ye sent
me by Nycolas Newmanys man, of the whyche lettyrs I thanc yow; for I
schold ellys a' thowt that it had be wers with yow than it hathe be, or
schal be, by the grace of Almyty God. And yet I kowd not be mery, sethyn
I had the last lettyr tyll thys day that the Meyir sent to me, and sent
me werd that he had knowlege for very trowthe that ye wer delyveryd owt
of the Flet, and that Howard was comytyd to ward for dyvers gret
compleynts that wer mad to the Kyng of hym. It was talkyd in Norwyche
and in dyvers othyr plasys in the contre on Saterday last past, that ye
wer comytyd to Flet, and in good feyth, as I herd sey, the pepyle was
ryth sory ther of, bothe of Norwyche and in the contre. Ye ar ryth myche
bownde to thank God, and all tho that love yow, that ye have so gret
love of the pepyll as ye have. Ye ar myche behold to the Meyir[2.1] and
to Gylberd,[2.2] and to dyvers othyr of the aldyrmen, for feythfully
they owe yow good wyll to ther porys.

I have spoke with Syr Thomas Howys for swyche thyngys as ye wrot to me
for, and he promysyd me that he schold labour it aftyr yowyr intent as
fast as he kowd; and in good feyth, as my brodyr and Playter kan tell
yow, as be hys seying to us, he is and wole be feythfull to yow. And as
for Wylliam Wyrcestyr, he hathe be set so up on the hone, what by the
parson and by othyr, as my brodyr and Playter schall telle yow, that
they hope he wole do well i now. The parson seyd ryth well and pleynly
to hym. The parson tolde me that he had spook with Syr Wylliam
Chambyrleyn,[2.3] and with hys wyfe, and he thynkyth that they wole do
well i now aftyr yowyr intent, so that they be plesantly intretyd. The
parson tolde me that he wyst well that Syr Wylliam Chambyrleyn cowd do
more ese in swyche matyers as ye wrot of, towchyng my Lord of
Bedford,[2.4] than ony man kowd do that leveyth at thys day. Also he
tolde me that he felt by hem that they wold owe yow ryth good wyll, so
that ye wold owe hem good wyll. The parson hopyth verily to make yow
acordyd when he comyth to London.

Item, my brodyr and Playter wer with Calthorp[3.1] to inquer of the
mater that ye wrot to me of. What answer he gave hem, they schall tell
yow. I sent the Parson of Heylysdon[3.2] to Gurnay[3.3] to spek to hym
of the same mater, and he seyth feythefully ther was no swyche thyng
desyiryd of hym, and thow it had be desyiryd, he wold nowthyr a' seyd
nor done a yens yow. He seyd he had ever fownde you lovyng and feythfull
to hym, and so he seyd he wold be to yow to hys power, and desyiryng me
that I wold not thynk hym the contrary. As for John Gros, he is at
Slole; ther for he myth not be spok with.

I pray yow that ye wole send me word whedyr ye wole that I schall remeve
frome hens, for it begynyth to wax a cold abydyng her. Syr Thomas Howys
and John Rus schall make an end of all thyngys aftyr yowyr intent, as
myche as they can do ther in this wek, and he purposyth to come forward
to yow on the Monday next aftyr Seynt Leonardys Day.

My brodyr and Playter schold a be with yow er thys tym, but that they
wold a byd tyl thys day wer past, be cause of the schyer. I spok to my
brodyr Wylliam as ye bad me, and he told me, so God hym help, that he
hyryd ij. horse ij. dayis be for that ye redyn, that he myth a' ryde
forthe with yow; and be cause that ye spak not to hym to ryde with yow,
he seyd that he wend[3.4] ye wold[3.5] have had hym with yow.

Thomas Fastolfys modyr was her on the next day aftyr ye wer redyn, to

of God, that ye wole be hys good mastyr, and to help hym in hys ryth,

hys nownage. Sche seyth that they wold mak hym a yer yonger than he is,
but sche seyth that he is more thane xxj., and upon that sche dare take
an othe.

And the Blyssyd Trynyte have yow in Hys kepyng, and send yow good sped
in all yowyr matyrs, and send the vyctary of all yowyr enmyis.

Wretyn in hast, on Sowlemas Daye.[4.1]

    [Footnote 1.1: [From Fenn, iv. 232.] This letter is ascribed by
    Fenn to the year 1465, in consequence of the allusion to John
    Paston's imprisonment in the Fleet. But there were more occasions
    than one on which he was confined there. Fenn himself knew of two.
    Paston was committed to the Fleet, as we know from William
    Worcester, on Saturday, the 3rd November 1464. He was also
    confined there in August and September 1465, and may very possibly
    have been released by the beginning of November. But I am inclined
    to think this letter refers to an imprisonment prior to either of
    these. For, in the first place, the news of it seems only to have
    been recent. It had become general subject of conversation at
    Norwich, 'on Saturday last,' whereas in 1465 it must have been
    known two months earlier. Secondly, Sir William Chamberlain, whose
    influence Sir Thomas Howes hopes will be of service, must have
    died in the spring of 1462. According to Blomefield (_Hist. of
    Norfolk_, i. 321), his will was dated the 3rd March 1461 (which
    would be in the modern computation 1462), and was proved on the
    21st April 1462. It may be presumed, therefore, that on receiving
    the letter from his brother Clement (No. 484), written on the 11th
    October 1461, John Paston hastened up to London and was
    immediately thrown into prison. By this letter, however, we find
    that he was soon afterwards released, and his great enemy Howard
    sent to prison in his stead.]

    husbands after him, the second of whom was John, Lord Scrope of
    Bolton, was buried by her own desire beside her first husband, in

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[4.2]

_To my ryth worchepfull [hus]bond, John Paston, be thys delyveryd in
hast._

[Sidenote: 1461 / NOV. 20]

Ryth worchepfull husbond, I recomand me to yow. Plesyt yow to wet that I
receyvyd yowyr lettyr that ye sent by the gold smyth, as thys day in the
mornyng. As for Syr Thomas, he sent me word he schold to yow ward as on
Twysday last past; if he fayle ony thyng that ye sent word he schold
bryng with hym, it is not for no lak of remembrans, for I sent to hym
thryis or fowyr tymys ther for, and that he schold hast hym ther in. As
for Rychard Call, he was not at home thys fortnyth. When he comyth I
schall do yowir erendys to hym; and as for all yowyr odyr erendys I
schall do hem as well as I can. I sent yow a byll yestyrday by old
Taverham, and a byll of Jone Gaynys mater, the whyche bylle I pray yow
may be delyveryd to Thomas Playter. I spak to hym of the same mater or
he yed hens, and I pray yow, if it plese yow, to geve hym yowyr avyse
what ye thynk is best to do ther in. Sche seyth sche is ryth sory, and
if hyr old mastyr demene hym not well to yow sche prayith yow that ye
wole be hyr good mastyr, and I that sche fare never the werse for hys
defawtys. And also I pray yow that ye wele be John Lysterys good mastyr
in hys mater. He spak to Playter ther of, and Playter seyd he hopyd to
fynd a mene aftyr that he had spook with yow, that schold ese hym ther
in. I thank yow hertly for yowyr lettyr, for it was to me gret comfort
to her fro yow. God knowyth my modyr and I thowt ryth longe tyll we herd
tydyngys fro yow. And the blyssyd Trinite have yow in Hys kepyng. Wretyn

ROGER TAVERHAM TO JOHN PASTON[5.1]

_To my reverent and most be trusted maister, John Paston, Esquyer,

maters be kept secrete by your best a vise.

  Be youre poure servaunt,

  ROGER TAVERHAM.

    [Footnote 5.1: [From Fenn, iv. 252.] This letter and the next are
    placed here merely for convenience. The two are evidently some
    years apart in point of date, and nothing is quite clear about the
    date of either, except that the latter must have been written in
    the reign of Edward IV., and of course before the death of John
    Paston in 1466. This, which is several years earlier than the
    other, was almost certainly written in the reign of Henry VI. The
    writer was probably the 'old Taverham' mentioned by Margaret
    Paston in the last letter.]

ROGER TAVERHAM TO JOHN PASTON[7.1]

_To my right wourshipful maister, John Paston, Esquyer, be this letter
delyvered._

[Sidenote: 1461(?)]

Right wourshipful maister, I recommaunde me un to your maistership, and
I thank your maistership that hit pleased your maistership to sende me
wourde a yen of my letter that I sende you by the brynger herof. Sir, as
I am enfourmed, ye sent me wourde how that my fader was dede long tyme
passed, and also ye desired to knowe my titylle of ryght. Sir, I am very
heyre, by the disceas of my fader, to a place called Keswyk, in
Taverham, with all the apportenauncez, and that comyth by enherytaunce
and discente to me, for I am the helder and heyre; and though my Lorde
Cromwell[8.1] hath taken Thomas Taverham, my yonger brother, as warde
for the same enheritaunce, that maketh no mater to me, in so moche I am
helder brother. Wher for I beseche you to sende me a letter of attournay
made to you in my name in the strengest wise that ye can, for to entre
in to the same lyvelode, and I shall asseal that, and than I shall do my
service and feaute to the seid Lorde Cromwell in all thing as by the
tenure of the same lyvelode of olde tyme aught to be done. And herin I
kno well the King shal cause my Lorde Cromwel to do me bothe lawe and
right; and also my Lorde Chaunceler, with oder Lordes diverse, shall do
the same. And, sir, I beseche your maistership to do and to take
possession in the saide place with the apportenaunce in short tyme, for
losyng of the rent this yer passed.

And, sir, as for the place of Attylbrigge that my moder in lawe now
duellith in, sir, your maistershep shal right not [_naught_] attempte
ther now in; for my Lorde of Warwik[8.2] hath seen how the same place
was yeven me by testament by Sir Roger Dallyng after the disease of my
fader, whiche is redy to be shewed. And therupon my Lorde of Warwik hath
comaunded certeyn gentilmen to entre in the same place, and your
maistership hadde be moved ther in or this, but for cause that ye love
wel Lumpnour,[8.3] and that my moder in lawe is his sister; but I knowe
wel hit woul cost CCC_li._, but that she shal be dispossedded of that
place in short tyme. And, maister, how ye woul be rewled in the seid
place of Keswyk, I be seche you to sende me wourde, as my sengler trust
is in you; for and ye woulde not take possession in the saide place, my
Lorde Wenlok[8.4] woulde have that ful fayne, for all the contray
knowith while that while I leve, I am heyr and non other. And therfor I
beseche you in all hast sende me wourde by the bryngger herof in hast,
quia mora trahit periculum. And, sir, I would come speke with you. I am
seke, and may not goo; but telle the bryngger heroff all your entent.
For my liff duryng I hadde lever that ye hadde that place for j_d._ than
a nother man, thow he woulde yeff me meche mony, for your maistership
ther shewed to me in my yong age. And God kepe you, &c.

  Your chapeleyn,

  ROGER TAVERHAM.

    [Footnote 7.1: [From Fenn, iv. 258.] The mention of Lord Wenlock
    in this letter proves that it cannot be earlier than 1461; but if
    the writer be, as we have surmised, the 'old Taverham' mentioned
    by Margaret Paston in No. 489, it is most probably of that year.]

ABSTRACT[9.1]

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1461 / NOV. 20]

Since I left you I have received at Cotton L4 : 2s., with which I have
made purchases of linen shirts, &c. for you. Shall have more money
before Christmas. Debenham, Jenney, nor none of his men 'come not there
sen' that I was there.' A letter of attorney is made for Nakton in your
name to Sir John Heveningham, and a rental and fermal sent him. We kept
a court this week at Calcotte but could get little money, not so much as
I paid my Lady of Suffolk's officers. Farmers will not occupy there till
appointment be made between Paston and Debenham; nor Risynge till he
hear from Paston. Can get no day for Mautby. They will not give a noble,
nor even 6 shillings, for a cow. Dey occupies your lands there till you
come home. Risynge would take them and the closes at Castre if he is not
to have Calcotte. The prests shall be paid as soon as we get money,
I hope this week. Wheat 12_d._ a comb, barley 8_d._, malt 9_d._ and
10_d._ No good price for malt, 'saving, as we understand, it is good
Flanders.' John Russe and Robert Glover are sending a ship with corn
over, and we have ventured with them 100 comb malt. You should make some
bargain with your beer brewers. Can get no money from Aleynes, farmer of
Gresham, since ye rode, but 40_s._ Has laid in sufficient beef for
Paston's household till 'Fastegang' (Lent). Sir Thomas Howys advises my
mistress not to send Edmund Paston to Cambridge or elsewhere till after
Christmas. Please ask Clement, your brother, to get a writ against
Geoffrey Clerk of West Somerton for the 20_s._ that Belys gave him to
pay Clement. Remember the letter I sent you last week.

Caister, St. Edmund's Day.

  [From what is here said of the levying of rents at Cotton, and from
  the mention of Debenham and Jenney in connection with it, we may
  presume this letter was written in 1461. With this supposition
  agrees the reference to John Paston's brother, Clement, who, as we
  see by No. 484, was in London in October.]

ANONYMOUS TO JOHN PASTON[11.1]

[Sidenote: 1461(?) / DEC.]

Ryght worchefull master, I recommend me on to yow, &c. The cause of my
wrytyng is this; I was at Blofeld on Sent Andruys Day[11.2] wyt the
person,[11.3] and he understode non noder but that I cam to se is master
chepe, for it was hese cheve day,[11.4] and that I mevyd in to hym of
the lond in Sochewerk, how I hard sey qwan I was in Sochefolk that Geney
mad hys avaunt that he had zon [_given_] zow and hym a choppe of xx.
pownd of lond. And in contynent he telde me al the mater beter than I
cowde telle hym, and as I cowde understond in hym be my sympyl wyt, that
he was of knoleche of alle the mater; for he seyd that Yelverton cam don
fro the benche, and plete the mater, and for cause ye wer to laches, and
cam not in tyme, the mater yede a mys. And so I understode be hym that
he is dysposyd to excuse Yelverton in al materys rather than yow; but
never de les make good cher to the person, as thow ye understode that he
wer your frend, tyl tyme ye have your in tente. But be warr and trost
hym not, but make yow so strong in lorchepe and in the lawe, that ye
reeke not meche qwder he be good or bad, &c.

Item, ye be meche be held on to Tomas Grene and Edmund Wydewel, broder
to Heu a Fen, for thei reporte meche worchepe of your master chepe in al
maters, and that cause the substans of the towne to howe yow servese,
and be wel dysposyd on to yow masterchepe, and that understonde I hevery
day. And yf that plese yow, qwan we partyt at Norwyche in yowr plase, ye
seyd on to me ye wold som qat do be my sympyl a wyse; and this is myn a
wyse that in ony wyse ye make Heu a Fen and Tomas Grene on your consel,
yf ye can fyne in yow herte. For I dare sey, as I her and understonde,
that thei how yow ryth good well and servyse, for a man may her be the
halfe qwat the hole menyth, and therfor for Godds lowe remember yow wel
in this mater; for and it stode on myn lyfe, I wold do as I awyse yow,
&c.

Item, for howr Lords love, goo tharow with Wyll Weseter, and also plese
Chrewys as ye thynke in yow hert best for to do; for it is a comon
proverbe, 'A man must sumtyme set a candel befor the Devyle'; and
therfor thow it be not alder most mede and profytabyl, yet of ij. harmys
the leste is to be take.

Item, ye xul oonderstonde that the parson telde me that dey wer somuned
to cum for the probat of the testement at Convercyon of Sent
Powle;[12.1] and therfor I wolde avyse yow in ony wyse that ye xuld
understond the mater wysely her ye com hom, for I sopose that Yelverton
and he is confydett and acorde to geder.

Item, qwan I was at Blofeld with the parson, ther cam Robert Fyrass to
hym, seyyng that he is compeld be the Kyngs Commycyoners to have harnes
after is degre, and that the parson sent hym to my mastras that che xuld
delyver hym harnes, and I understond che wylle not tylle ye com hom. But
ye xul understond it is an halmes dede to do hym good, understondyng is
nesessyte and nede that he stond in, and also understondyng that he was
kynnyes man to my master, and it is a comon proverbe, 'A man xuld kepe
fro the blynde and gevyt to is kyn'; and hevery man wyl sey wel ther of,
the mor cause he is a gentylman, and of is kyne, and in gret penur. And
therfor, for the love of God, remembyr seche maters.

No mor at this tyme, but God have yow in Hys kepyng, bothe body and
sowle, and spede yow in yowr maters as wel as wel as I wolde ye
xulde do.

    [Footnote 11.1: [From Fenn, iv. 64.] The date of this letter is a
    little uncertain, but it seems to have been written at the
    beginning of the dispute between Paston and Yelverton, about
    Fastolf's will, and the year 1461 appears to me on the whole most
    probable.]

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[13.1]

_To my right wurchepfull husband, John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1461 / DEC. [3]]

Right wurchepfull husbond, I recomaund me to you. Please it you to wete
that myn awnte is dissesid, whos sowle God assoyll. And if it please you
to send word how ye wull that we do for the lifflode that she had at
Walcote, wheder ye wull that any body take possession thir in your name
or not. And if it like you to have with you my cosyn William her sone,
I trow ye shuld fynde hym a necessary man to take hede to yowr howshold,
and to bye all maner of stuffe nedefull therto, and to se to the rewle
and gode gidyn therof. It hath be told me be for that he can gode skill
of such thyngs; and if ye wull that I send for hym and speke with hym
ther of, I shall do as ye send me word, for in feyth it is tyme to crone
your old officers for diverse thyngs wher of I have know parte be
Dawbeney, and more I shall telle you whan ye come hame.

Also it is thought be my cosyn Elizabeth Clere, and the viker[13.2] and
other that be your frends, that it is right necessary for you to have
Hew of Fen to be your frende in your maters; for he is callid right
feythfull and trosty to his frends that trost hym, and it is reported
her he may do myche with the Kyng and the Lords, and it is seid that he
may do myche with hem that be your adversaryes: and therfor, Godds sake,
if ye may have his gode wille, forsake it not. Also it is thought the
more lerned men that ye have of your owyn contre of your councell, the
more wurchepful it is to you.

Also if ye be at home this Cristmes, it wer wele do ye shuld do purvey a
garnyssh or tweyn of powter vesshell, ij. basanes, and ij. hewers, and
xij. candlestikes, for ye have to few of any of thes to serve this
place. I am a ferd to purvey mych stuffe in this place till we be
suerrer therof. The Blissid Trinyte have you in His blissid kepyng.

Wretyn the Thursday next after Sent Andrew.

  Be yowr

    [Footnote 13.1: [From Fenn, iv. 106.] Except that it seems to be
    of the reign of Edward IV., the date of this letter is about as
    uncertain as that of the last; but as they are both written about
    the same time of year, and both recommend John Paston to use the
    counsel of Hugh Fenn, it is highly probable that they are of the
    same year. Perhaps the last letter may have been written by the
    vicar mentioned in this.]

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[14.1]

_To my ryth worchepful husbond, Jonhn Paston, be thys delyveryd in
hast._

[Sidenote: 1461 / DEC. 29]

Ryth worchepfull husbond, I recomande me to yow. Plesyt yow to wete that
I receyvyd the lettyr that ye sent me by a man of Seynt Mychell parysche
on Fryday next aftyr the Consepcion of owyr Ladi;[14.2] and anon as I
had it, I sent my modyr[14.3] the lettyr because of swyche materys as
longyd to hyr in that same lettyr. And sythyn that tyme I kowd gete no
massanger to London but if I wold have sent by the Scheryfys men; and I
knew nowthyr her mastyr nor them, not whedyr they wer well wyllyng to
yow or not; and therfor methowt it had be no sendyng of no lettyr by
hem.

And as for swyche materys as John Geney and Jamys Gresham spak to me,
I sped hem as well as I kowd; and they bothe told me that ye schold
veryly a ben at home before Crystmas, and that causyd me that I wrot not
to yow now non answer. For if I had know that ye schold not have ben at
home er thys tyme, I schold a sent some man to yow; for I thynk ryth
longe tyll I have some god tydyngys fro yow. I fer me that it is not
well with yow that ye be fro home at thys good tyme. And many of yowyr
contre men thynk the same; but they be hertty inow to yow-ward, and full
fayn wold her god tydyngys fro yow. The wer no byllys put to the
Scherryf[15.1] at hys beyng her, ner non opyn playnt mad that I
. . . . . of no persone, be cawse they had so lyttyll knowlage of hys
comeyng in to thys contre. He demenyd hym full . . . . . and
indeferently, as it was told me, and Yelverton mad a fayir sermone at
the Sesschyonys, and seyd . . . . . so that the Kyng was informyd that
ther was a ryotows felawschep in thys contre, wer for the Kyng was
gretly dysplesyd, and that the Kyng undyrstood well that it was not of
ther owne mosyon, boot of cownselyng of one or ij. that ben evyll
dysposyd folk. And also he seyd if ony man wold put up ony byllys of
compleynts of ony extorcion or brybery don be ony men of thys contre to
them, they wer redy to receyve them, and to make a-kord be twyx hem; and
if they cowd not mak the acord, that than the schold tak the byllys to
the Kyng, and he schold set hem thorow. And the Scheryfe seyd that he
wold he . . . . . . them that wold compleyne and dorste not for fer put
up ther byllys.

And Yelverton preyid the Scheryfe that if he had for get onythyng that
the Kyng seyd to hem at ther departtyng, that he wolde rehersyt
[_rehearse it_] ther. And than the Scheryf seyd that he had seyd all
that he remembryd, save only [that] the Kyng . . . . to hem ij.
personys, Syr Thomas Todenham and Heydon. And than Yelverton seyd, 'A,
that is trowthe, as th . . . . . . . that J[ohn of] Dame told me that he
spak with the Scheryf aftyrward, and let hym h . . . . . . . the rewylle
[and] demenyng of thys contre, and what cawsyd the pepyll for to grwge
ayens swyche folkys as had the reuyll be fortyme; and he was pleyne to
hym in many thyngys, as he told me; and he fond the Scheryfe ryth pleyne
ayen to hym, and well dysposyd in that that myth growe to the welfar of
the schere. The Scheryfe seid he undyrstood by swyche informacion as he
had, syns he came into thys contre, that they had not all gydyd hem well
that had the rewyill of thys contre be for; and therfore he seyd
feythfully, and swore by gret othys that he wold nowthyr spar for good,
nor love, nor fer, but that he wold let the Kynge have knowlage of the
trowthe, and that he wold do asmyche for thys contre as he cowd or myth
do to the welfare therof, and seyd that he lekyd the contre ryth well.
And John of Dame seyd if the contre had had knowlage of hys comyng, he
schold have had byllys of compleyntes and knowlage of myche more thyng
than he myth have knowlage of that tyme, or myth have because of schort
abyng; and he seyd he wold not be longe owt of thys contre.

And also Yelverton seyd opynly in the Seschyons they to come downe for
the same cause to set a rewyll in the contre. And yet he seyd he woste
well that the Kynge myth full evyll have for bor ony of hem bothe; for
as for a knyth ther was none in the Kyngys howse that myth werse a be
for bore than the Scheryfe myth at that tyme. I have myche mor to wryt
to yow of than I may have leyser at thys tyme; but I troste to God that
ye schall be at home yowyr selfe in hast, and than ye schall knowe all.
And but if ye come home in haste, I schall send to yow; and I pray yow
hertly, but if ye come home, send me word in hast how ye do. And the
blyssyd Trinyte have yow in hys kepyng. Wretyn in hast on Seynt Thomas
day in Crystmas.[16.1]

_To my right reverent and my moost wurschipful maystre, my Maystre John
Paston._

[Sidenote: 1461 / DEC. 29]

Right wurshipfull and my mooste reverent mastre, I recomaunde me unto
your goode maystreship. Like you to witte that on Childremasse
daye[17.2] there were moche people at Norwich at the shire, be cauce it
was noyced in the shire that the Undresheriff had a writte to make a
newe aleccion; wherfore the people was greved be cauce they had labored
so often, seying to the Sheriff that he had the writte, and pleynly he
shulde not a wey unto the tyme the writte were redd. The Sheriff[17.3]
answerd, and seyd that he had no writte, nor west who had it. Heruppon
the people peacyd, and stilled unto the tyme the shire was doone, and
after that doone, the people called uppon hym, 'Kylle hym! Heede
[_behead_] hym!' And so John Dam, with helpe of other, gate hym out of
the schire-hows, and with moche labour brought hym unto Sporyer
Rowe;[17.4] and ther the people mett a yenst hym, and so they a voided
hym unto an hows, and kept fast the dore unto the tyme the meyer was
sent fore, and the Sherif, to strenght hym, and to convey hem a wey, or
ell he had be slayne. Wherfor divers of the thrifty men came to me,
desiryng that I shulde writte unto your maistreship to lete you have
undrestandyng of the gidyng of the people, for they be full sory of this
trowble; and that it plese you to sende hem your advice how they shal be
gided and rwled, for they were purposed to a gathered an c. or cc. of
the thriftyest men, and to have come up to the Kyng to lete the Kyng
have undrestandyng of ther mokkyng. And also the people fere hem sore of
you and Mastre Berney,[17.5] be cauce ye come not home.

Plese you that ye remembr the bill I sent you at Hallowmesse for the
place and londs at Boyton weche Cheseman had in his ferme for v. mark.
Ther wol no man have it above xlvj^s. viij^d., for Alblastre and I have
do as moche therto as we can, but we can not go a bove that. And yet we
can not lete it so for this yere, with owte they have it for v. or vj.
yere. I wrote to your mastreship herof, but I had non answre; wherfor I
beseche you that I may have an answere of this be Tlwelthe, for and we
have an answre of this be that tyme, we shall enfeffe hem with all, &c.

My right wurshipfull and my moost reverent maistre, Almyghty Jesu
preserve you, and send you the victorye of your elmyes, as I truste to
Almyghty Jesu ye shall. Wreten at Norwich on Seyn Thomas daye after

Plesith your maystership to undrestande that as for the ferme that
Cheseman had in Boyton, that is to sey, xl. acre lond erable, j. medwe,
and other smale parcell, payng yerly for it iiij_li._, weche I can not
lete the xl. acre lond abowe xl. comb barly or xl_s._, and ye to bere al
charges of the reparaucion and fense aboute the place, weche shulde be
gret cost. The lond is so out of tylthe that a nedes [_uneath_, _i.e._
scarcely] any man wol geve any thyng for it. Ther can no man lete it to
the walwe that it was lete before, and that I reporte me to my master,
Sir Thomas Howys, not be gret gold. Wherfore I wol not do therin unto
the tyme that I have answere from your mastership, weche I beseche you
it may be hast. And as for Spitlynges, I have lete som of the lond in
smale parcell, because I cowde gete no fermor for it. And as for Sir
T. H., in good feythe I fynde [him] weele disposed in all thynges,
excepte for Sir W. Chamberleyn for Rees in Stratton. And so the blissid
Trinite preserve and kepe you from all adversite. Wrete at Blofeld, the

_To John Paston, the older, in hast, and if he be not at London, than to

[Sidenote: 1461 / DEC.]

Lyke your maisterchip wete that at the last cessyons Erpyngham hundred
and other hundredys ther aboute were not warned, and the schreff excused
hym be cause he cowde not knowe who was officer there. Item, Yelverton
lete the pepoll understand that the Kyng wold have his lawes kept, and
that he was dysplesed with the maner of ther gaderyng, and that he wold
have it amendyd; for he conceyveth that the hole body of the shire is
well dysposed and that the ille dysposed pepoll is but of a corner of
the hole shire; and yet that ther mysdoyng growyth not of ther owyn
dysposysyon but of the abbettement and steryng of sum ille dysposed
persones whiche is understand and knowe to the Kynges hygthnesse. Item,
he lete hem wete that the Kyng had commandyd hym to sey if ther were any
man, pore or ryche, that had cause to complayne of any person that he
schuld put up his bylle to the shref and hym, and they schuld set a
reule be twyx hem; and if he wold not abyde ther reule they schuld
delyver the sayd bylle of compleynt to the Kynges hignesse, and he
schuld set the rewle and suche dyreccion that the party compleynaunt or
defendaunt schuld be punysshed for his dysobeysauns of the said rewle if
the case requyred; and also more over, if ther were ony person that put
up ony suche bylle, and it mygth apere to them by ther examinacion or
other wyse fals or untrewe, or elles be cause of malyce, that than suche
compleynaunts schuld sharpely be punysshed. And than whan he had sayd
this and moche more, in dyscoragyng to the pepoll to put bylles, as
after my conseyt, he reported hym to the schref ther present, that the
Kyng thus comanded hem thus to sey, desyreng the said schref if ony
thyng of the Kyngs comaunded were be hynd unspoken by hym self that he
wold remembre and helpe forthe to telle it. And than the schref said,
lyke as he rehersed the Kyng comanded, and more over that the Kyng named
ij. men, by name Tudenham and Haydon, and if ony man wold put bylles a
yens them, he said in feythfull wyse he wold help hem, and ferther the
mater to the Kyng higthnesse. And for his demenyng ther every man
thougth hym rigth wel dysposed; but Yelverton had for yeten to expresse
the names of Tudham and Haydon.

Item, the schref desyred the jentylmen to go with [him] to Felbryg
Halle, and specially he requyred Mr. John P., the younger; but he cowde
no pepoll gete, and so he cam not there. Item, there was a bylle set up
on the shirehous dore, and the content ther of was but of the favour to
you ward, Barney, Knyvet and Felbrygge, and of the hatered of other; it
was but of sum lewde dysposed person it semeth. Item, sir, at the last
shire was moche pepoll and ille governed for they wold not be rewled be
no body, they had almost a slayne the underschref, for they told hym
wryttes of eleccion was sent doun and he kept it on syde to be gyle hem,
and to make hem labour ayen, and ther for he that kepyth it is to blame,
me thynketh. Item, sir, please you to telle Mr. Clement, we have goten a
reles of al maner accions and appelles of Margret Clerk, made to
Gymmyngham, on of the pryncypalles, and that he woll inquyre wheder it
be suffycyant for alle, and send me word, and weder it dyvers fro
trespas and dette, wher damages is to be recovered, for in this appell
is no damages to be recovered, but only an execucion, whiche non of them
may be contributory to other execucion as is in other cases.
Nevertheles, I hope it be sufficiant for all, for sche is in the cas to
have the lyf in stede of damages.

    [Footnote 19.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The mention of Tuddenham
    and Heyden in this letter proves that it cannot be of later date
    than the year 1461, as the former was executed in February 1462.
    At the same time the reference to John Paston, Junior, could not
    be much earlier, and the message from the King to the people of
    Norfolk certainly could not have come from Henry VI. only a year
    or two before. The date must therefore be 1461 precisely.]

    [Footnote 21.1: [From Fenn, iv. 104.] This letter appears to have
    been addressed to Margaret Paston at a period when her husband was
    a man of some influence, and perhaps the year 1461 is not far from
    the true date. It is not unlikely to have been written about the
    same time as No. 500, which also refers to a meeting at the shire
    or county court.]

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[24.1]

_To my ryth worchepfull husbond, John Paston, be thys delyveryd in
hast._

[Sidenote: 1462 / JAN. 7]

Ryth worchepfull husbond, I recomand me to yow. Plesyt yow to wet that I
sent yow a lettyr by my cosyn Barneys man of Wychyngham wyche was wretyn
on Seynt Thomas Day in Crystmas,[24.2] and I had no tydyngys nor lettyr
of yow sene the wek before Crystmas; wher of I mervayle sore. I fere me
it is not well with yow be cawse ye came not home or sent er thys tyme.
I hopyd verily ye schold have ben at home by Twelthe at the ferthest.
I pray yow hertly that ye wole wychesave to send me word how ye do as
hastly as ye may, for my hert schall nevyr be in ese tyll I have
tydyngys fro yow. Pepyll of this contre begynyth to wax wyld, and it is
seyd her that my Lord of Clarans and the Dwek of Suthfolk and serteyn
jwgys with hem schold come downe and syt on syche pepyll as be noysyd
ryotous in thys contre. And also it is seyd here, that there is retornyd
a newe rescwe up on that that was do at the scher. I suppose swyche
talkynge comyth of false schrewys that wold mak a rwmor in this contre.
The pepyll seyth here that they had levyr go up hole to the Kynge and
compleyne of siche false screwys as they have be wrongyd by a fore, than
they schold be compleynyd of with owt cause and be hangyd at ther owne
dorys. In good feyth men fere sore here of a comone rysyng but if
[_i.e._ unless] a bettyr remedy may be had to a pese the pepyll in hast,
and that ther be sent swyche downe to tak a rewyll as the pepyll hathe a
fantsy in, that wole be indeferent. They love not in no wyse the Dwke of
Sowthfolk nor hys modyr. They sey that all the tretourys and
extorsyonerys of thys contre be meynteynyd by them and by syche as they
get to them with her goodys, to that intent to meynten suche extorsyon
style as hathe be do by suche as hathe had the rewyll undyr them be fore
tyme. Men wene, and the Dwke of Sowthfolk come ther scholl be a schrewd
reuell but if [_unless_] ther come odyr that be bettyr belovyd than he
is here. The pepyll feryth hem myche the more to be hurt, because that
ye and my cosyn Barney come not home; they sey they wot welle it is not
well with yow and if it be not well with yow, they sey they wot well,
they that wole do yow wronge wole sone do them wronge, and that makyth
them all most mad. God for Hys holy mersy geve grace that ther may be
set a good rewyll and a sad in this contre in hast, for I herd nevyr sey
of so myche robry and manslawter in thys contre as is now within a
lytyll tyme. And as for gadyryng of mony, I sey nevyr a werse seson, for
Rychard Calle seyth he can get but lytyll in substans of that is owyng,
nowthyr of yowyr lyvelod nor of Fastolfys th'eyr. And John Paston seyth,
they that may pay best they pay werst; they fare as thow they hopyd to
have a newe werd [_world_]. And the blyssyd Trinite have yow in Hys
kepyng and send us good tydyngys of yow.

Yelverton is a good thredbare frend for yow and for odyr in thys contre,
as it is told me.

Wretyn in hast on the Thorsday nex aftyr Twelthe.

JOHN DOWBIGGING TO JOHN PASTON[28.1]

_To the ryght reverent and worship sir, John Paston, sum tyme Lord of
Gresham, and now fermour therof, as hit is seide._

Perys of Legh come to Lynne opon Cristynmesse Even in the fresshest
wise, and there he dyned so as was; bot when my Lorde of Oxenforde herde
hereof he with his feliship and suche as I and other your presoneres
come rydyng unto Lynne, and even unto the Bysshop gaole where the seid
Perys dyned with other of his feliship. My Lorde pulled hym oute of the
seid gaole and made to kest hym opon an horse, and tyed an halter by his
arme, and so ledde hym furth like hym selff. And even furthwith the seid
Bysshop, the Mair, and other their feliship mette with my seide Lorde
and your presoneres, and also the seide Perys tyed by an halter, the
Bysshop havyng thies wordes unto my Lorde with his pillion[28.2] in his
handes, 'My Lordes, this is a presoner, ye may knowe by his tepet and
staff. What will ye do with hym?' Therto my Lorde seide, 'He is my
presoner nowe.' Wherto the Bysshop seid, 'Where is youre warraunt or
commission therto?' My Lorde seide, 'I have warraunt sufficiaunt to me.'
And thus they departed, the Mair and all the cominaltie of Lynne kepyng
theire silence. Bot when we weren goon, and Perys of Legh fast in Rysyng
Castell, then the yates of Lynne, by the Bysshop comaundement weren fast
sperred [_shut_] and keped with men of armes. And then the Bysshop and
his squyers rebuked the Mair of Lynne and seid that he hade shamed both
hym and his toun for ever, with muche other langage, &c.

The Bysshop shulde have keped his Cristenmesse at Gaywode, bot yet he
come not oute of Lynne. In faith, my Lorde dyd quyte hym als
curageousely as ever I wist man do. The Bysshop come to the toun with
lx. persones the same tyme, and made to sper the yates after hym, bot
when we mette, ther bode not with hym over xij. persones atte the most,
with his serjaunt of armes; whiche serjaunt was fayn to lay doun his
mase; and so atte the same yates we come in we went oute, and no blode
drawen, God be thanked.

Yf ye will any thyng atte I may do, send me worde; hit shall be doon to
my power, &c. Comaunde me to my maistresse your wyff, &c. And yf ye dar
joperdie your suyrtie of C. marc I shall come and se you. And elles have
me excused, for, &c.

    [Footnote 28.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is evidently

    is printed in the fifth volume of Fenn's edition as a letter of

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON[29.1]

_To the ryght reverent and my mooste worschipful master, my Master John
Paston, in the Inneer Tempyll._

[Sidenote: 1462 / FEB. 1]

Plesith it your maisterschip to witte that I have been at Burnewyll in
Nacton to receyve the rentes and fermys of the tenauntes. And I
undrestande be them, and be Robert Goordon that Mastre Jenney whas there
and helde a coorte on the Mondaye next aftre Tlwelthe, and warned the
tenauntes that they schulde pay no money to no man onto the tyme they
had worde from hym, seyng that he whas on of the feffeys of the same
maner, and that he whas feed with Sir John Fastolff, of weche fee he was
be hynde for ij. yere; wherfore he desired the tenauntes that they
schulde not be redy in payement onto the tyme they had word from hym,
but that he myght be payed of his seide fee, lyke as the wylle of the
deede was. Wherfore I can gete no money of them unto the tyme they have
knowleche how it stond be twyx your maistership and Mr. Jenney; for
withoute Jenney write to hem or come hom ward that wey, and have the
tenauntes together and lete hem witte that ye ought to have the rentes
and fermes of the seid maner, I can not see that ye be like to have but
litell money there, withoute ye woll do distreyne throuout all the
lordeschip. I have sette dayes to purvey but [_their_] money ayenst the
first weke of cleene Lenton, and than they schul have an answere who
shal receyve it. Wherfore that it please your maistership to remembre to
speke to Mastre Jenney. The blissed Trinite preserve you and kepe you
from all advercyte. Wreten at Yebbyshep[30.1] the furst daye of
Februare.

  Your pore servaunt and bedman,

Item, the maner of Stratton shuld paye of rente xxvj_s._ viij_d._, weche
the fermour seythe my mastresse Brandon is acorded with you. He is be
hynde for certeine yeres, &c.

    [Footnote 29.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The manor of Burneviles
    in Nacton, near Ipswich, was part of the lands of Sir John Fastolf
    which Paston inherited by his will; but his claim was disputed by
    Jenney, one of the executors. As Jenney is here said to have
    complained that his fee was two years in arrear, we may presume
    that it was little over two years since Fastolf's death when this
    letter was written. For further evidences of date compare No.
    494. It may also be observed that we find undoubted evidence that
    John Paston was residing in the Inner Temple six weeks later

JOHN PASTON TO ----[30.2]

[Sidenote: 1462 / FEB. 9]

Right trusty and welbeloved, I grete yow hartily well, and will ye wite
that where hit is so, that Sir John Fastolf, whom God assoyle, with
other, was sum tyme by Sir Herry Inglose enfeffed of trust of his maner
offe Pykewurthe in Rutlande, the which made his wille, proved, that the
seid maner sholde by solde by Robert Inglose and Edmunde Wychingham his
executours, to whom the seid Sir John hath relesed, as his dute was to
do; now it is so that for John Browne[31.1] ther is shewed a dede under
seall of armes berynge date byfore his reles made to the Duke of
Norffoke, Henry Inglose and other, contrarie to the wille of the seid
Sir Herry and the trust of the feoffement that the seid Sir John
Fastolff was infeffed inne. And a letter of Attorney under the same
seale of armes to yow, to deliver seison acordynge to the same
feffement, to the gret disclaundre of the seid Sir John and all his, yef
this be true. Wherfore I preie yow hertili that ye feithfully and truly
rescribe to me in all the hast ye may what ye knowe in this mater such
as ye wull stonde by with outen glose, and how ye can imagine that this
crafte shulde be practised, and specially whether ye yourself delivered
seison in Rutlond or noo. And this and what incedentes ye knowe, I preie
yow by wrytinge certefie me in all hast, that I may be the more ripe to
answer to this, to the wurship of the seid Sir John, that was your
maister, so that thorowh your defaute your seid maisters soule ther for
lie not in perell, but this disclaundre may be eesed and cesed as reson
requireth, to the wurship of hym and all that longe to hym. And this I
pray yow faile not offe as I truste yow. Wret at Londo[n] the ix. day of

    [Footnote 31.2: [From Fenn, iv. 68.] For evidence of the date of
    this letter, Fenn quotes the following extracts from the
    Institution Books in the Registry of the Bishop of Norwich:--

      'Draiton

    'Reg. xi. 124. 29 January 1460-1. Johannes Bullock ad
    praesentationem Joh'is Paston arm. et Tho. Howys capellani.

    'Reg. xi. 131. 15 March 1461-2. Joh'es Flourdew ad praesentationem
    eorundem.'

    It thus appears that the living was resigned by John Bullock in
    1461-2, and on the 15th March John Flourdew was presented to it,
    not the person here recommended by Howes.]

Right worshipfull sir, I recomaund me to you, and lete you wytte, that I

the Duk of Burgoyn[35.2] is poysened, and not like to recovere. And as
for powers to be gadered ayenst our weelfare; thei sey, there shulde
come in to Seyne CC. gret forstages[35.3] owt of Spayne, from the Kyng
there;[35.4] and CCC. shippes from the Duk of Bretayne[35.5] with the
navy of Fraunce, but thei be not yet assembled, ne vitayll there
purveyd, as thei sey, ne men. And the Kyng of Fraunce[35.6] is in to
Spayne on pilgrymage with fewe hors as thei sey; what the purpose is
thei can not telle certeyn, &c. In hast at Norwich.

The Kyng of Frauns hath comitted the rewle of Bordews on to the
marchaunds of the toun, and the browd[35.7] tha[t] be therin to be at
ther wages; and like as Caleys is a Stapole of wolle here in England, so
is that made staple of wyne.

John Fermer, presoner, seyth, on [_one_] John Gylys, a clerk that was
with the Erle of Oxforthe, wych was some tym in Kyng Herrys hows, was a
prevy secretary with the Erle of Oxforthe; and if any wrytyng wer made
by the seyd Erle, the seyd Gylys knew ther of in this gret matyeres.

Pentecost; but my brother Clement is purposed to come forward on Monday
or on Twesday next comyng at the ferthest. No more at this tyme but the

    [Footnote 40.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is evidently
    not far removed in date from No. 489, in which 'Joan Gayne's
    matter' is also mentioned. The year, however, cannot be 1461, as
    William Paston was in London that year as early as the 4th April.
    It seems also from this letter that John Paston had recently left
    home, which could not have been the case in 1461 if No. 453 be of
    that year. We have therefore little doubt that the true date is
    1462, and that the substance of the letter relates to proceedings
    taken by the widow of Thomas Denys against her husband's
    murderers.]

[Sidenote: 1462 / JULY 3]

Most reverent and worchepfull master, I recommaund me onto your god
masterchep. Please you to have knowlage, on the Fryday at afternoon next
after Seynt Peter, there was at the taveran in London old Debnam and
young Debnam, Thomas Edmonds, and I; and ther the seyd Thomas Edmonds
fell in communicacion with old Debnam, and seyd that my Lord
Tresorer[43.1] had put hym to a gret charge for the vetelyng of _Mary
Talbot_,[43.2] seyyng to old Debnam that he hard sey that he had a C.
bulloks to selle, the wyche the seyd Edmonds wolle bey so that they may
a cord of the price. Than the seyd old Debnam answerd ageyn, and seyd he
wold, so that he myght have good payment, or elles the seyd Edmonds to
be bound in abligacion to pay hym at suche dayys as they myght a cord.
And noon upon thys same langwage, yong Debnam spake to hys fader, 'Sir,
I pray you that ye wolle take avisment of this mater tille to morowe,
for I trost to your good faderhod that ye wolle late me have a serteyn
of your bulloks for the vetelyng of the _Barge of Yermothe_, and I shall
fynd you sufficiant suerte for the payment therof for Edmonds. I wolle
that ye knowe I have be ther, and spoke with the owner and with the
maister of the seyd barge, and they knowyn myn oppoyntment.'

Than the seyd Edmonds answered to yong Debnam, and told hym that the
sety of Norwic and Yermothe hathe grauntyd, and send wrytyng to the
Kynge and to the Lords that they wolle manne and veteylle the seyd barge
of her owne cost fro the tym of hyr goyng owt tylle hyr comyng home; and
thus the seyd Edmonds told hym that my Lord Tresorer and all the Lords
that be at London thynk they do ryght well her devyer, and be worthey
moche thanke of the Kyng. 'Well,' quod yong Debnam, 'I had in
commaundment for to have the rewle of the seyd barge, and I wolle be at
Yermothe as thys day iiij. dayys, and man hyr and bryng hyr downne to
the Gylys of Hulle, for that ys my chype.'

Also he seyd mor, with out that he myght have the seyd barge, he wolle
note goo to see but hym self and hys xxiiij. men. And thus, yf please
your maisterchep, he departyd from the taveran; and at hys departyng, he
told the seyd Thomas Edmonds, 'Thys ys Paston labor.' Than the seyd
Edmonds answerd hym ageyn, and seyd playnly he was to blame for to
reporte so of your masterchep, for he knoythe veryly he seyd on trewly
of you and of my master your son bothe, and ther on he wold take a
hothe. And so, yf it please your good masterchep, late the cety of
Norwic and Yermothe have knowlage of hys gret crakyng and bost, and let

Item, my master your son wolle have to hys jakets murry[44.1] and tany
[_tawny_], and that it please yow sum of my felachep may spek to on of
the drapers for to ordeyn yt ageyns hys comyng hom, for I trowe it shall

Item, sir, if please you, Skrowpe hathe sent to you to London be Byngham

ABSTRACT[46.2]

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1462(?) / [JULY 5]]

Cannot inform him how much malt he has at Castre, 'for the malters have
not moten all up yet,' --probably 400 quarters new and 160 comb old malt
of Castre and Mauteby, of which 40 quarters will be spent in the
household by Hallowmas. At Yarmouth it is now 2_s._ 2_d._ a bushel--it
was 2_s._ 6_d._ But London is a better market. Thinks the price will
fall here, as the fields are reasonably fair in Flegge, and so up to
Norwich. The carriage from Yarmouth to London will be 6_d._ per quarter,
'and I understand j. quartre of Yermothe mette makethe at London but
vij. busschell.'

Norwich, Monday after St. Peter's Day.

  [As John Paston does not seem to have been in undisturbed possession
  of Caister before 1462, and we have evidence of Richard Calle having
  been there in that year about the time of year when this letter was
  written, we may with great probability refer it to that year.]

herts ease; for it is half a deth to me to here the generall voyse of

Sir, I beseke youre maistirshyp to remembre my maystresse for the lytil
sylvir, whiche for serteyn thyngs delyverid to youre use is dewe to me.
I have nede of it now. I have bought salt and other thyngs, whiche hathe

    [Footnote 47.1: [From Fenn, iv. 120.] The precise year in which

JOHN RUSSE TO JOHN PASTON[57.1]

_To my right honourabyl and worshypfull maister, my Maister John
Paston._

[Sidenote: 1462]

Plese your worshypfull maistership to wette, here is a ship of Hith,
wyche seith that John Cole cam from the west cost on Wednysday last
past; and he seyth that the fleet of shippis of this londe met with lx.
seile of Spanyards, Brettenys, and Frenshemen, and there tok of hem l.
[50], wherof xij. shyppys were as gret as the _Grace de Dewe_; and there
is slayn on thys partyes the Lords Clynton[57.2] and Dakyr,[57.3] and
many jentilmen juve (?)[57.4] and othyr, the nombre of iiij.^ml. [4000];
and the seid Spanyards were purposyd with marchaundise in to Flaundres.
My Lord of Warwyks shyp, the _Mary Grace_ and the _Trenyte_, hadde the
grettest hurt, for they wer formost. God send grace, thys be trew. On
Thursday last past at London was no tydings in serteyn where the flet
was, nor what they had doon, and therfore I fere the tydings the more.

Item, sir, as for tydings at London, ther were arystyd be the tresorer
xl. seyles lyeng in Temse, wherof many smale shyppis; and it is seyd it
is to carye men to Caleyse in all haste, for feer of the Kyng of Fraunce
for a sege. And it was told me secretly there were CC. in Caleyse sworn
contrary to the Kyngs well, and for defaute of there wages; and that
Qwen Marget was redy at Boleyn with myche sylver to paye the soudyers,
in cas they wold geve here entresse. Many men be gretly aferd of thys
mater, and so the tresorer hath mych to do for thys cause.

Item, sir, as for tydings out of Ireland, ther wer many men at London at
the feyre of the contres next them of Ireland, and they sey thys iij.
wyks came there neythyr shyp nor boot out of Irelond to bryng no
tydings; and so it semyth there is myche to doo there be the Erle of
Pembrook.[58.1] And it is seyd that the Kyng shuld be at London as on
Satyrday or Sonday last past, and men deme that he wold to Caleyse hym
selfe; for the soudyors are so wyld there, that they wyll not lette in
ony man but the Kynge or my Lord Warwyk.

Othyr tydings the were come to London, but they were not publyshyd; but
John Wellys shal abyde a day the lenger to know what they are.

No mere un to you, my right honourable maister, at thys tyme, but Jesu
send yow youre herts desyre, and amende hem that wold the contrary.

[JOHN] PASTON TO [THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK][62.1]

[Sidenote: 1462-3]

That it please my lordis good grase to be good lord and supporter of
Paston in his right and possession of the maner till his right can be
lawfully or be trete dispreved by his adversaries, consideryng that the
said Paston is my lordis homager and was nevir ayens his lordship and
that my lord is not gretly behold to do for the seid Pastons adversaries
as he understandith.

And in case my lord woll not supporte the seid Paston in his right but
be indifferent athwyx bothe parties, that thanne it please my lorde to
have consideracion to the right of the mater as folowyth in articles and
ther upon to be remembird whedir it be resonably desired by William
Jenney or by Debenham as his waged man or for his sake that Paston shuld
leve the possession or the takyng of the profitez of the seid maner.

First to be remembird that the seid maner aswell as the maner of Nakton
were Sir John Fastolffis, and that the seid Paston of the seid maners
toke estatis at Cotton and attornement of the tenauntis viij. or ix.
yere goo, in such wise as the tenauntes can reporte, and continued there
in possession aswell in the live of the seid Sir John as sithen, and
hath take the profitez therof sith the discese of the said Fastolff,
except for the terme of Mighelmes a yere passed, whech tyme the
tenauntes were compellid by fors of distresses to pay ayens ther willes
part of the seid profitez.

And that also the title of the seid Paston to the seid maner is not all
only by the seid feffement but aswell by a graunt and bargeyn made a
thwyx the seid Fastolff and the seid Paston as by the last will of the
seid Fastolff, where by the seid Paston ought to take the hole profitez
of the seid maner, and also it is lefull to the seid Paston to kepe the
seid maner with fors, consideryng he hath be in possession iij. yere and
more; hough be it, the seid Paston intendyth to kepe the seid maner
pesibly and non otherwise. And that the pretense and cleyme of the seid
Jenney is that he schuld be infeffed with the seid Paston in the seid
maner; by whech pretense, if it were trewe, yet the seid Paston by
reason shuld not be put out of the seid maner, for who som evir had
titell therto by feffement or by executrie, Paston shuld be on that had
title; hough be it, the seid Paston cleymyth not in that forme, but by
the titell of his bargeyne and by the seid Fastolffis will.

Item, to be remembird, whech tyme as my lord had wretyn his lettirs and
sent his servauntes for the eyde and supporte of the seid Paston to take
the profitez of the seid maner of Nakton as of the maner of Cotton,
desyryng the tenauntes to the seid Paston, the seid Jenney wold have no
consideracion therto; hough be it, though he were a feffe he had no
titell to take the seid profitez, consideryng he is non executor, but
presumptuously, havyng no consideracion to my lordis lettir ner sendyng,
compellid the tenauntis by distresses to pay hym more besely thanne any
feffe or executor, and now at this same tyme hath be at Nakton and
reseyvid as moch mony as he coud gader there.

Item, where at Mighelmesse the yere passed the seid Paston sent his
sone, a servaunt of my Lordis, and also Richard Calle, servaunt to the
seid Paston put to hym by my Lordis fader,[63.1] to reseyve the profitez
of the seid maner as thei had do many yeres before, the seid Jenney ded
arest the seid Calle for a thef and as a thef caried hym to th'entent
that the tenauntes shuld be discoraged to pay the seid Paston. Whech
tyme, at the request of the said Calles kynred, it pleased my lord to
write to the seid Jenney and Debenham for the deliverauns of the seid
Calle; to which letteris they nouther toke hede nor reputation, but by
that sotilte reseyved the profitez of the seid maner, the seid Paston
havyng non help by my seid Lordis writyng nor sendyng.

Wherfore please my Lordis good lordship to supporte the seid Paston in
kepyng of his right and possession till it be dispreved or knowe
onlawfull, and the seid Paston will applye to such meanes as it pleasith
my Lord to take wherby the right of the mater may be undirstond and
determined.

And also that it like my lord to remembir that it is not behofefull for
any prinse lightly to geve trust or to applye to the desires of any
persones that have geve hym cause of mistrust.

    is a rough draft in John Paston's hand, and there can be no doubt
    to whom it was addressed. As to the year in which it was written
    there is no positive evidence; but Daubeney and Calle were both
    with Margaret Paston in the beginning of 1463 (_see_ No. 536), and
    the only thing against that date is that Margaret, writing to her
    husband (then in London) on the 19th, acknowledges only a letter
    of the 9th. This, however, might well be owing to the disturbed
    state of the country, or it may be that the present letter, which

Please you to wet that Will. Jeney and Debham cam to Calcote on
Wednysday before none, and ther they spake with Rysyng and John Smythe,
and haskyd hem rent and ferme, and they seydyn they had payed you, and
so they myght not paye hem. Also, ferthermore, they told hem that ye had
hold a corte ther syn that they enteryd there. Than Jenney answerd ageyn
'Be cause he held a corte here we mad hym hold corte at London, and so
shall we make the to hold a corte at Ipysweche withowt thow wolt pay us
the rent and ferme.' 'Sir,' quod Rysyng, 'I toke the ferme of my master
and of Sir Thomas Howys.' Jenney seyd, 'And as for Sir Thomas, he and we

Item, as towchyng the burges of Yermothe they wer chosyn on Wednysday.

    Parliament of 1463. From one expression used it is clear that it
    was written some time before Easter, and the dispute with Jenney
    and Debenham about Calcote proves the date to a certainty. Compare

ABSTRACT[71.3]

[JOHN PASTON] TO JOHN PAMPYNG, RICHARD CALLE, AND WILLIAM WYKES.

[Sidenote: 1463]

Remember my instructions about bills and actions against Debenham by my
tenants at Calcote. Make a 'remembrance apart' of the ground on which
every trespass has been committed, whether it be in my lands or in those
of my tenants, and whether the land was holden of me by Calcote Hall
fee, or Freton Hall fee, lest Debenham justify [on the plea that] he
took them elsewhere. As my tenants at Cotton have been compelled to pay
much money to Jenney and Debenham against their wills, I would, as I
have told John Paston the younger, that he should ride to Cotton with
Richard Calle and such friendship as he can get, and demand my duties,
except from those who had been compelled to pay the others. The latter
to take actions next term against Debenham. Will respite them for this
once all they have paid, till it may be recovered by law; that is,
provided they ask it: otherwise, will politicly put them in jeopardy of
losing their farms. Desires Calle to make a roll of the tenants and when
he comes to Cotton enter therein how much cattle has been distrained
from each.

  It appears by the last letter that a writ was issued, evidently at
  the suit of Debenham, against John Paston, junior, and the other
  agents of his father in Suffolk. From the present paper it would
  seem that John Paston also instituted a prosecution on behalf of his
  tenants against Debenham. We shall find by later letters that these
  suits were going on in 1463, and were not terminated in the
  beginning of the following year. The MS. from which the above
  abstract has been made is a draft with a heading in John Paston's
  hand. On the back are notes of the Statutes of Westminster and of
  Richard II. touching _scandalum magnatum_, etc.

RAFF LAMPET TO HIS COUSIN DAUBENEY

[Sidenote: Date uncertain]

Reminds him that he spoke to him at Redham, in the church, about certain
lands 'which John of Berney bought of me,' and for which there is still
owing him 13s. 4d., and a rent of 6d. four years in arrear. Begs him to
speak to Master Paston to get him the money.

  We place this letter immediately after another document signed by
  Ralph Lampet, the exact date being uncertain and immaterial. It is
  probably, however, about this period, as it may be surmised to be
  after the death of John Berney.

ABSTRACT[73.2]

[Sidenote: 1463 / APRIL 6]

Testimony of Sir Roger Chamberlain, witnessed by Reginald Tylneye, prior
of Ixworth, and Sir John Rose [a brother of the house], that he was with
the Duke of Norfolk in September before Sir John Fastolf died, when my
Lord urged Fastolf to sell him the reversion of Caister, or (as he
wished to give it to the Abbey of St. Benet's) to exchange it for a
manor of my Lord's in South Walsham, which lay more convenient for the
Abbey. Sir John, however, begged him not to press it, as he had
appointed with his cousin, John Paston, to have Caister and all his
other livelode in Norfolk and Suffolk in order to endow a college of
seven priests and seven poor men. My Lord said, many thought Sir John
would make Paston his heir; to which he replied that there was no man
living that he would like better to be his heir, and begged my Lord to
be his good lord if it so fortuned, which the Duke promised to do. Has
heard the Duke since often acknowledge that Sir John had declared
plainly he would make Paston his heir. Not having his own seal present,
has sealed this with that of the prior of Ixworth, and requested him to
put his seal to it besides. Ixworth, 6 April 1463.

_To mygth rigth good and speciall maister, John Paston, dwellyng at
Heylesdon be syde Norwich._

[Sidenote: 1463 / JULY]

Rigth reverent, &c. Please your maisterchip wete that I resseived your
letter whiche ye sent by Crome, and as for the examinacion of, &c. that
I wrot to you of in my former letter to be taken on the Munday or on
Tewysday, &c. this was the cause. Ye yaff me informacion at my last
departyng fro you that the murdre was don uppon the day nexst after
Seynt Petre. And for doute lesse ye had be ougth at the comyng of my
seid letter, and for dowte that I supposed that my maistres, your wyf,
had not be remembred of the day, it caused me, accordyng to your
informacion, to wryte the uttermost day for her remembrans.
Neverthelesse, if ye certifie that ye toke the examinacion with in the
yere and day, and sette the day in certayn, your certificat is
sufficiant in lawe and shall bynd any of the parties to sey the
contrary. And also the writte is that ye schuld certefie _sine
dilatione_, and no day expresly yoven you whan to certifie it; wherfor
ye may kepe uncertefiet tyl the nexst terme. And so do sir, for it schal
do no hurt; but if ony questions or jangelyng schuld be mad when the
examinacion was, let a sufficiant day with inne the yere be noysed, and
if the _teste_ be to schort we schal fynd the mene it schal be amendyd
by hym that wrot it. For after the informacion that I had of Crome the
Sunday was the uttermest day, and therefor it was happy that sche was
examined thenne. And where that ye wold I schuld tak the advice of
Maister Markham, &c., if all thyng were laufull, and elles not, it is
full hard to my self to determine the certaynte of every circumstans of
the mater, and it is not gretely to be comuned of with other, nor to
comune of casez lyke; for whan the mater schuld come in revelysshon it
wold cause prevy titlers and flaterers ougth of suche questions to
ymagyn, and contryve mater of distourbans. Wherfor uppon the certeynte
of myn determinacion I brak the mater to Master Markham, which called to
hym Master Byngham, and so thei ij. meved Y.[77.1]; and after that
mocion he kept not his owyn councell but brak to every man of it. Hou be
it he was sore mevyd with it, I wote it well, and glad to take avyse and
comfort of other personez than of Masters Markham and Byngham. Al
circumstans were to long to wryte, but I hope to speke with you be tymes
i nougth or ye schall nede to certefye, &c. And, sir, in conclucion,
Masters Markham and Byngham thynk it sufficiant i nougth to take his
promys and his othe with ougth obligacion that he schal mak amends if
profe here after can be mad uppon hym. And to this Maister Markham
prayed you to agre by the same token ye mevyd hym to sette an ende be
twyx you and my masters your brethern. Neverthelesse if ye thynk this
wey not sufficiant, ye may lete sum other handele the mater at hom to
hym if that ye hope to gete good pref in the mater, for with ougth
evydent proffe the mater schall be but noysefull to you, and cause men
to thynk that it growyth of your ille wyll to hym ward, &c.; for he
noyseth and seyth, because of ille wyll ye have caused a mad woman to
take apell a yens hym.

Item, sir, as for Leukenore he is not at London, but peraventure I schal
make hym to be meved in the mater here after.

Item, I dede your erand to my maister your son.

Item, as for John Say,[78.1] he recomendyth hym to you, bothe for your
billes and for your labour, and prayeth you if ony land that lyth for
the priour ease mygth be aspyed, that ye wold help to gete it hym and
send hym word; and as for the morteysyng . . . . . . and at his cost and
labour.

Item, as for tydyngs, the Kyng and the counsell is at Northampton,[78.2]
and the Convocacion schall be . . . . . . . . . after Relyk Sunday. And
ther be ij. marchaunts come fro Caleys, and they mygth no leve have to

[Sidenote: 1463]

Please it your good mastresship to wete that a _fieri facias_ is come
out of the Exchequir for Hue Fen to the Shireff of Norffolk to make levy
of CC. mark of the propir goods and catels of my masters, as executor of
Sir John Fastolf; of whech _fieri facias_ we sent my master word, whech
sent us word ayen by Berney that we shuld lete the Shiref undirstand
that my master nevir toke upon hym as executor, and so for that cause
that writte was no warant to take my masters goods; and also that my
master mad a dede of gift of all his goods and catels to Master Prewet
and Clement Paston and other, so that my master hath no goods whereof he
shuld make levy of the forseid summe; and if the Shireff wold not take
this for non answere, that thanne my master wold he shuld be lettid in
Master Prowetts and Clement Pastons name. Nevirthelesse we spak with the
Shireff this day, and lete hym undirstand the causes aforeseid, and he
agreid, so that he myght have suerte to safe hym harmeles, to mak such
retorne as my master or his counsell coud devise. And because my master
wrote by Berney that he wold not fynd the Shireff no suerte, we wold not
apoynt with hym in that wyse; and so we toke avyse of Thomas Grene, and
by cause the Undir-Shireff shall be on Monday at Hygham, by Bastewyk
brygg, and he and we thought that it was best that Master Prowet shuld
mete with the Shireff there, and require and charge hym that by colour
of the foreseid _fieri facias_ that he make no levy of any goods and
catels of the seid Prowetts and Clement Pastons ayens the seid John
Pastons, letyng hym vete that such goods as the seid Paston had, be now
the seid Prowetts and Clement Pastons by vertu of a dede of gift mad to
hem almost ij. yere agoo; and if the Shireff woll be besy aftir that to
take any catell, that he be lettid in Master Prowetts name and Clement
Pastons by Daubeney and other; whech besines of the Shireff shall be on
Tuisday or Wednesday, and as we understand at Heylesdon. Wherfor ye must
send thedir Daubeney with Pecok, and the may gete hym here more felasep

    [Footnote 78.3: [From Fenn, iv. 130.] John Paston's eldest son
    appears to have been knighted in the course of the year 1463. The
    earliest notice which I find of him as knight is in a writ dated
    11th July, 3 Edward IV., entered on the Coram Rege Roll of Trinity
    term, 3 Edward IV. This letter is not unlikely to have been
    written about that time, as it appears by a subsequent letter
    (No. 550) that Sir John Paston remained for some time at home in
    Norfolk, when the friends of the family thought he ought to be
    abroad in the world.]

    [Footnote 80.2: [From Fenn, iv. 250.] John Mowbray, Duke of
    Norfolk, the writer of this letter, succeeded his father in the
    dukedom in November 1461, being at the time only seventeen years
    of age. A year afterwards, in November 1462, we find him living at
    his castle of Holt in Denbighshire, where he proposed to spend
    Christmas (_see_ No. 532), but before that season came he was sent
    for by the King to serve against the Scots (No. 533). I am
    inclined to think this letter was written in the August of 1463;
    for although the Duke was again living at Holt in March following,
    it seems probable that he would have visited his chief family seat
    at Framlingham in the meanwhile. John Paston, the youngest, who
    was attached to his household, was certainly at home with his
    family in the latter part of this year (_see_ No. 560).]

    [Footnote 82.1: [From Fenn, iv. 128.] In the preceding letter Sir
    John Paston seems to have been at home; in Letter 552, we find
    that he had left home without leave. It is very probable,
    therefore, that the present letter was written in the interval
    between them, seeing that the writer complains of Sir John being
    kept at home.]

    [Footnote 83.1: [From Fenn, iv. 88.] I have found no letters of
    Margaret Paston dated from Caister before the year 1463; but I am
    inclined to think that this and the letter following both belong
    to that year. The latter, being addressed to Sir John Paston, at
    least cannot be earlier, and my reasons for believing it to be of
    that very year will be seen in the note to it (p. 84, Note 2). It
    is just possible that this letter may be of a different date, but
    considering that both were written in November, and both of them
    certainly between the 12th and the 19th, and that in both Margaret
    Paston not only dates from Caister, but speaks of Daubeney as
    being with her, the presumption, I think, is pretty strong that
    they are of the same year.]

I wold ye shuld send me word howghe ye doo, and howghe ye have schevyfte
for yourself syn ye departyd hens, be som trosty man, and that your
fader have no knowlage therof. I durste not late hym knowe of the laste
letter that ye wrot to me, be cause he was so sor dyspleasyd with me at

Item, I wold ye shuld speke with Wekis, and knowe hys dysposysion to

As for your harneys and ger that ye left here, it ys in Daubeneys

I wold ye shuld make mech of the parson [of] Fylby, the berer herof, and

    [Footnote 84.2: [From Fenn, iv. 168.] As Sir John Paston was
    knighted in the year 1463, and his father died in May 1466, the
    date of this letter must lie between the years 1463 and 1465.
    I think the first of these years is probably the true date. Sir
    John Paston, it seems, had left home without letting his mother
    know of his intention. Whither had he gone? Not to London, because
    he addressed a letter to his father there; besides he had passed
    by Lynn. One would naturally suppose, therefore, that he had gone
    to wait upon the King, at a time when Edward was at a distance
    from the capital. And in this view we are confirmed by the passage
    in which Margaret desires her son to speak with Wykes, who, as we
    know by Letter 514, was an usher of the King's Chamber. Now Edward
    IV. was in Yorkshire, staying, for the most part, at Pomfret,
    during October and November 1463, while about the same time of
    year in 1464 he was at Reading, and in 1465 at Greenwich. Sir John
    would naturally have passed through Lynn on his road to the
    North.]

to helpe that he myth be dyschargyd ther of, and Hwe of Fen promysyd hym

and so, but [_unless_] he have xx_s._ for a fyne within shorte tyme he
wol not suffyr her to have the avayle of the londys. Wher fore she
prayith yow, for Goddys sak, that ye wole purvey a mene that Hwe of Fen
may save hyr harmles, in as myche as he promysyd hyr husbond to purvey
ther fore in hys lyve; and if it plese not yow to spek to hym ther of,
that it plese yow to do John Paston or Thomas Playter or sume othyr,

for the mater that ze wold I schold spek to Wylliam Worcester of

    most probable year is either 1462 or 1463, for it is mentioned

    [Footnote 89.5: [From Fenn, i. 278.] By the mention of Sir John

    of course the date cannot be later than 1466, in which year John
    Paston the father died, to whom the letter is addressed. It
    appears also to have been written shortly after the death of James
    Sevenoke, Abbot of St. Augustine's, Canterbury, which Fenn, I know
    not on what authority, says occurred in 1463. Even the new edition
    of Dugdale does not give the date; but Fenn's date is in all

    [Footnote 92.1: [From Fenn, iv. 72.] This letter and the next both
    mention assizes at Thetford. The latter, which is dated on
    Wednesday, the last (29th) day of February, and which was
    certainly written in the year 1464, mention them as being held on
    that very day. The present letter, dated on the second Monday in
    Lent, says they are _to be_ held on Wednesday following. Now the
    second Monday in Lent 1464 fell on the 27th of February, that is
    to say just two days before that particular Wednesday on which we
    know that the assizes really were held. This alone seems almost
    sufficient evidence of the date of the letter. As for the King's
    going up to London, it appears by the dates of the Privy Seals
    that on the 9th February he was at Gloucester, on the 16th and
    17th at Kimbolton; and it is stated in the next letter that he was
    at Waltham on the 27th, which shows that he really was moving
    towards the capital. This was not the case in 1462, the year to
    which Fenn assigns the letter; nor do I know his authority for
    stating that there was a Burgundian Embassy in the beginning of
    that year.]

JOHN PAMPYNGE TO JOHN PASTON, SENIOR[93.1]

_To my right worshipfull master, John Paston, the elder, Squier._

[Sidenote: 1464 / FEB. 29]

Please your mastership to wete that the Assise holde this day at
Thetford; and as for any newe Assise, that ye spak of, ther is non, ner
non other savyng on for a man a bought Brunham.

I spak with Herward, and I askyd hym if ther was any gret day at Bury,
and he seid ther was but a small day, and as for any assises ther wer
non but old; and he told me that Debenham and the Undershireff were
falle ought. Debenham bare the Shireff on hand[94.1] that he had do
indited an hundred men son he cam in to his office, and the Shireff told
hym that the Kyngs bokkes apperid whedir it was so or nought; and he
told Debenham that he coud indite an hundred at on tyme whan ye wer
indited, and named yow the cause of ther brekyng.

Ther was a man kyllid now late in Suffolk, and he that ded it was on of
Debenhams men; and Herward told me that the Shireff seid to hym he wold
do Debenham a shrewd turne and he coud.

Item, it was told me at Norwich that Master Berney shuld have be here
with a gret felaship, and it is not so, ner no man heryth of hys comyng,
ner her is but litell pepill nowther, ther wer not so few this iij. yer,
as men say.

Item, Herward askyd me where John Gayn was, and I askyd why, and he seid
ther is a _capias_ ought ayens hym upon the condempnaceon,[94.2] and the
Shireff hath it, he bad me geve hym warnyng; it is retarnabill xv.
Pasch.[94.3]

Item, thei sey here that the Kyng was on Monday at Waltham.

Item, Nicholas Colman hath brought home your fardell; it is at Norwich.

Item, ther be no more Juges here but Sir Pers Ardeyn.[94.4]

Wretyn at Thetford, the Wednesday the last day of Februar.

Item, Wymondham[95.1] is here, and was at the shirehows this day, and
the Kyngs livery abaught his nekke, and ther stood be the Juge, whill a
lettir of the Kyngs was red. The effect was, as it was told me, that the
Kyng will that justice be had, and that all risers ayens the pees, and
oppressers of the pepill, be chasteised, letyng hem weet[95.2] that he
was late in Cambrigge Shire, and there such as had offendid askyd grace,

punyshid, purposyng to be in this contry abought Estern, &c.

    [Footnote 93.1: [From Fenn, iv. 158.] The circumstance of the last
    day of February falling on a Wednesday fixes the date of this
    letter to the year 1464. There is no evidence in the dates of
    Privy Seals that the King was at Waltham in the end of February,
    or that he had previously visited Cambridgeshire, in any year
    during the period when this letter must have been written; but it
    is quite possible that he was at Waltham on the 27th February
    1464, and if so, that he had passed through Cambridgeshire on his
    way from Kimbolton, where he had been on the 17th.]

were apelyd of othyr se[r]teyn poyntys of treson, and thys mater. And
bycause the Kyng sent my Lord woord to keep thys contre, is cause that
my Lord terythe here thus longe. And now the Kyng hathe geve my Lord
power, whedyr he wole do execusyon upon thes gentyllmen, or pardon hem,
whedyr that hym lyst; and as fertheforthe as I kan undyrstand yet, they

fortnyght. The menys namys that be apechyd ar thes, John Hanmer, and

Wretyn in the Castyll of the Holte, in Walys, the fyrst day of Marche.

  Your sone and lowly servant,

  JOHN PASTON, the yongest.

    [Footnote 95.3: [From Fenn, i. 284.] 'The Duke of Somerset's
    going' here referred to cannot well be his flight to Scotland in
    1462 (_see_ No. 512), though the time of year at which this letter
    is dated would agree very well with that supposition; for it
    appears by Letter 511 that John Paston, the father, was at that
    time residing in the Temple and not at Caister; nor indeed have we
    distinct evidence of his being at the latter place before 1464.
    Moreover, in the beginning of 1463, Somerset had just made his
    peace with King Edward and been received into favour, but early in
    1464 he rebelled again. There can be little doubt, therefore, that
    this year is the true date.]

CLEMENT PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[100.1]

_To my rygth worchepful broder John Paston Sqwyer._

[Sidenote: 1464 / APRIL 18]

Ryght worshypfull brothyr, I recomawnde me to zow. After all dew
recomendacions, &c., plesse it zow to wett that after that I had harde
say that the person of Blowfelde[100.2] wasse com to town I went to hym
to his in, and he bade the mesenger say that he wasse not within, and I
bad hym say a gayn that I come thyder to hym for hys own worchep and
avayle and that I wasse sory that I com so fer for hym; and after that
he sent for me and he cowde not fynde me, and I harde say ther of. And
than I wrott a letter, resytyng how that he wasse sworn yesterday for to
say the trowthe of al maner of materis consernyng Sir John Fastolfe,
avysyd hym to remember qwat hys wytnesse hadde sayd for hys sake, and
wat schame it xwlde be to hym to say the contrary; And also, if he sayde
the contrary, ze wold herafter prove the trowthe and contrary to hys
sayyng, and prove hym in a perjuri. And also I badde hym remember with
wat maner of men he delt wythe; and I rehersyd how untrwly they hadde
don. And not with standyng thys, after I met with hym in the strett and
spak with hym, and I fownde hym passyng strawngely disposyd and sor
mevyd with consiens that ze xwld have the lond and fownd the colage but
with an C. marcs, not with stondyng he myth fynde in hys consiens by the
well that the colage xwld be fowndyd in a noder plasse but with an C.
marcs, and the reminaunt of the lylode sold so that he myth pwroe the
mony; so I felt by hym that all hys strawngenes from zow is for he
demythe that ze wold parte from no thyng; and I told hym the contrary
ther of to be trwe, az this day he is exaymined up on a bok to sey the
trowthe of all thynges as the juge will[101.1] aske hym, for the jugeis
informacion; wych I trowe wyll not be good. Also they have pwt in
_testes_ azens zow iij^xx or iiij^xx men. Mayster Robard Kent wold sayn
that ze xwle gett zow ij. lycens of the prioris of zowre wytnes, Mayster
Clement and the monke, with an A[101.2] datt beryng before the comyng
up; for that must ye nedis have. Also he wold sayn that ze xwld com to
thys towne. Me thowte by Sir Thomas that they have aswerte in maner that
ze xall have no lycens for zour fundacion. And [_i.e._ if] they be
abowte to gett a lycens to fownde the colage in a noder place, me
thynkythe that wold hurte; her colour is for cause ze can gett no lycens
to fownde it at Caster; werfor thow zour wyll wer trwe, they myth
lawfully fownde it in a noder place. My Lord Chawnceler[101.3] is gone

ABSTRACT[101.4]

DEPOSITIONS TOUCHING SIR J. FASTOLF'S WILL

[Sidenote: 1464 / APRIL-NOV.]

'Primum testes reprobatorii producti per Yelverton, contra testes Paston
principaliter productos &c.

Druell, utriusque juris doctorem, examinatorem et commissarium ad infra
scripta specialiter deputatum. In praesentia mei Nicholai Parker notarii
auctoritate Apostolica, publici scribae in hac parte de et super
exceptionibus infra scriptis, par partem domini Willelmi Yelverton et
Willelmi Worceter productorum.'

1. John Davy chaplain, staying at the University of Cambridge, _liberae
conditionis_, 30 years old and more, examined _super exceptionibus
infrascriptis_ of which the tenors are quoted, viz., on the part of
Yelverton and Worceter against John Russe, Robert Cutteler clk., Master
Clement Felmyngham, Rob. Boteler, Ralph Lampet, Brother Will. Bokyngham,
and Master Robert Popy, witnesses on the opposite side, whose testimony
is discredited 'eo quod parte sua non praesenti juraverunt et super non
juratis deposuerunt, ac in depositionibus suis fuerint et sint varii,
contrarii, singulares negativam asserentes, causas dictorum suorum
minime reddentes, unumque et eundem praemeditatum sermonem proferentes,
a testatore non vocati aut rogati perhibere testimonium, nec
sufficienter probantes in hac parte, prout ex inspectione depositionum
suarum liquere poterit intuenti.' Further, John Russe was illiterate,
and did not understand Latin when he made his deposition, and he
contradicted the other witnesses on his own side: viz., to the 9th
interrogatory he said, Sir J. Fastolf's will was not written before his
death, which Clement Felmyngham and Robt. Cutteler in their reply to the
3d said it was. Moreover he expected advantage to himself from his
testimony, and was discharged by Howys of L300 that he owed Fastolf. He
had also secretly abstracted certain muniments and charters of the
testator, which were in the custody of Will. Worceter, in the house of
John Tovy, at Castir, Norwich dioc., in Nov. 1459. Moreover he was
_supravisor et locator_ of the testator's lands called Akethorpe, yearly
value 9 marks, appointed by Paston or Howys, who promised to sell them
to him much under value for his testimony. Further, his statement that
he was present _in quadam bassa camera_ at Caister between 8 and 9 A.M.
on the Saturday before Sir J. Fastolf's death, was a perjury, for he was
really all that time in other places a long way off. His declaration
that he was no servant or tenant of those who brought him forward was
untrue: he had hired a house of Howys in the town of Yarmouth, value
40s. a year. He was inconsistent in his testimony about the hour Sir J.
declared his will. He also pretended never to have seen Fastolf's will
before his death, although he wrote the said pretended will with his own
hand with the date at the head, which at the beginning of this suit he
caused to be cut off from the writing and hidden.

Also the said Rob. Cutteler chaplain, when he made his deposition, was
'levis opinionis, malae conscientiae et de mensa Joh'is Paston ac tenens
ipsius, prout ad primum interrogatorium examinationis suae primae et
secundae respondebat.' Also he was perjured; because in April 1457 in
par. of Holy Trin., Castir, he beat and maimed one Jo. Flemyng, and
boasted of it (_ac sic factum nomine suo ratum habuit_), but being taken
before Sir J. Fastolf, justice of the peace, he swore he had not done
so.--Proofs that he was not disinterested.

Exceptions to Rob. Popy: He was a tenant of Paston's, &c. &c.

_Davy_ says John Rus was at Yarmouth on the Saturday in question, as he
usually was on Saturdays, to buy victuals for Fastolf's house, &c.
(Proof declared insufficient in the margin). Sir J. Fastolf was so ill,
that, as Davy had heard he was unable to speak from 22d Oct. 'Quae quidem
infirmitas vocabatur judicio medicorum, _sincope_, quae ipsum vexabat
singulis horis et ipsum deduxit ad extasim de scientia istius jurati,
qui continue conversabatur cum eo usque ad ipsius mortem.'

2. Thos. Upton, one of the clerks of the King's kitchen, _literatus_,
'liberae conditionis,' forty years old and over; 2d. witness.

Mentions that W. Worceter gave Jo. Rus a casket to keep containing
certain documents, which Rus delivered to Howys after Fastolf's death.
Was clerk of the kitchen to Fastolf when Rus used to go on Saturday to
Yarmouth, &c.

9 May. Jo. Bokkyng produced by Jo. Naseby, proctor of Yelverton and
Worceter, before Master Tho. Wynterton, LL.D., auditor of Thomas
Archbishop of Canterbury, at his house in the parish of St. Martin, in
presence of Robert Kent, proctor of John Paston.--Examination committed
to John Druell, LL.D. who on the 12th May examines him secretly in the
house of the treasurer of St. Paul's.

'Dicit quod Johannes Tovy quaedam munimenta et evidencias[103.1] in
certis bagis et pixidibus contenta quae Willelmus Worceter eidem Johanni
Tovy liberavit custodienda.' Rus was and is Howys' tenant for the house
he lives in. After Fastolf's death Upton delivered to Clement Felmyngham
a signet or gold ring, 'ad signandum sigilla dicti domini Johannis
Fastolf,' in a little bag, which was to be returned 'post signacionem
hujusmodi,' but afterwards he said he had lost it. Touchyng brother
W. Bukyngham, it was publicly noised at Yarmouth that Robert Brown,
a chaplain of that town, had killed one Seman Burton, that Bukyngham
knowingly received him, and that by his advice he fled. To the last
exception he says he believes Fastolf did not release Paston from the
payment of the said 4000 marks, 'quia iste juratus non intellixit in
tota vita sua tantam liberalitatem in dicto domino Johanne Fastolf.'
Fastolf had such difficulty in breathing for five or six days before his
death that he could hardly speak.

   *   *   *

Interrogatories proposed on the part of Paston and Howys, and
administered to witnesses.

'In primis, interrogetur quilibet testis hujusmodi cujus sit conditionis
et an sit famulus, [104.1]serviens aut tenens partis eum producentis, et
cui parti magis favet partium praedictarum.' Secondly, whether he be in
the pay of any one. There are six interrogatories in all, and they are
numbered.

Then follow answers of some one, whose name does not appear, to each of
these six interrogatories; and other answers by--

1. Nich. Newman, Usher of the Chamber to Lady Catherine, Duchess of
Norfolk.

2. John Loer, servant of the Abbot of Langley.

3. Will. Eton.

4. Rob. Lynne of Bucklande.

5. Barth. Elys of Yarmouth, 'literatus liberae conditionis,' fifty years
old and more (proves Rus's absence, but his testimony is declared in the
margin to be improbable, and not to agree with Davy's).

_6 July._ Naseby produces Rob. Wylly on the part of Yelverton and
Worcester. Examined on the 9th.--Says he was required by Paston and
Howys to see Fastolf's will, and 'ad impediendum [_impendendum_]
consilium suum:' --that on a Sunday in the summer after Fastolf's death,
John Paston showed him, at Fastolf's house in Southwark, Sir John's will
written on paper, in presence of Clement Felmyngham and John Bracley,
and asked his opinion if it was valid. Thought it insufficient to
overthrow any previous will. A clause mentioning Tudenham and Heydon as
executors was cancelled by this deponent's advice, 'eo quod erat contra
caritatem.'

_13 July at Bow Church._ Naseby produces John Marshall and John Davy,
whose examinations follow.

_19 Oct. 1464._ Druell examines Hen. Wenstall at the treasurer's house
of St. Paul's.

_15 Nov. 1464._ Druell examines Rob. Hert.

_1 Dec._ Naseby produces Rob. Fyztrauf, whose production Kent opposes;
who tries to prove Rus's absence (insufficiently, as remarked in the
margin), because he was constantly with Fastolf, except half an hour
that morning, and held the basin while Henry Barbour lathered the beard
(_lavit barbam_) of the said Sir John Fastolf.

Howys says he did not see Coteler or Rus in Fastolf's chamber that
Saturday before he went to dinner. On Saturday and Sunday before his
death Fastolf spoke so low he could hardly be heard by any one, and
Howys heard him only by putting his ear close to his mouth. Fastolf's
mind was clear.

    were produced in the Spiritual Court by Sir William Yelverton and

    Thomas Howes to be Sir John Fastolf's executors. The examinations
    were taken at intervals during the years 1464, 1465, and 1466, and
    the suit was not terminated when John Paston died. The MS. volume
    here referred to contains three distinct bundles of these
    depositions bound up in a wrong order. A volume containing similar

    men between the ages of sixty and sixteen were ordered to attend
    the King. The date is confirmed by the reference in the postscript

ABSTRACTS[116.1]

OUTLAWRY OF JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1464 / NOV. 20]

  The following writs and copies of writs stood originally on a file
  in the order in which they are here noticed.

I. Edward IV. to the Prior of Norwich.--Orders him to deliver to the
bearer all goods in his hands belonging to John Paston, Esq., who is
outlawed. Reading, 20 Nov.

II. Writ to Edmund Clyre, Escheator of Norfolk, touching the above
outlawry.--John Paston is here called 'the elder.' Dated 20 Nov.

III. _Supersedeas_ addressed to the Escheator of Cos. Cambridge and
Hunts to stay confiscation of the goods of John Paston, who has been
outlawed, first for trespass against William Jenney, and secondly for
trespass against William Hogan; of which he was convicted in Suffolk on
Monday, 10 Sept., 4 Edw. IV. Both cases are removed by writs of error
into the King's Bench.--Teste J. Markham apud Westin., 28 Nov., 4 Edw.
IV.

IV. Copy of _supersedeas_ on the exigent issued at Jenney's suit
to the Sheriff of Suffolk.--Teste J. Markham apud Sekbrok, 24 Aug.,
4 Edw. IV. With the return on the writ of exigent, notifying Paston's
non-appearance when proclaimed at the county courts held at Ipswich on
Monday 21 May, Monday 18 June, Monday 16 July, and Monday 13 Aug.,
4 Edw. IV. The _supersedeas_ was delivered to the sheriff by Richard
Calle in Paston's name on the 29 Aug.

V. Edward IV. to Sir John Markham, Chief Justice of the King's
Bench.--Commands him to make _supersedeas_ upon the exigents. For, as
the King understands, Jenney obtained judgment against Paston for L23 :
10s., and William Hogan by the support of Jenney took another action,
and obtained a judgment of L16 : 13 : 4 'against conscience and law, as
we be informed.' If Paston has delivered to the sheriff any writs of
error to send the actions to our court of parliament, he is to comply,
according to the usual course in such cases.--Fotheringay, 3 Aug.

VI. Edward IV. to Thomas Croxton, Clerk of the Crown.--Commanding him to
search the records and see that the processes of outlawry against John
Paston have been well and sufficiently made out.--Reading, 3 Oct.

Memorandum subjoined, 'that William Jenney's counsel hath openly vaunted
in Westminster Hall that the King hath sent another letter to the
sheriff, commanding him to certify John Paston outlawed.'

[asterism] V. and VI. are copies on the same paper.

And wher Godds lawe and manys lawe acorden that hit shall nat be lawful
to non erthely man to be so lyberall and plenteous of that that God
sendith hym, that he sholde so despose hit so that he sholde nowgch have

  By your Servaunt and brother,

  [Illustration {signature: T and symbol}]

    [Footnote 118.1: [From Fenn, iii. 418.] It is difficult to assign
    with confidence either a date or a meaning to this strangely
    worded epistle. The signature itself is a mystery. The order of
    the Temple of Sion is unknown to archaeologists, and the place from
    which the letter is dated cannot be identified. From the peculiar
    device used as a signature, resembling what in heraldry represents
    a fountain, Fenn threw out a suggestion that Fountaine was the
    writer's name, remarking that a family of that name resided at
    Salle, in Norfolk, and might have been related to Paston as the
    writer claimed to be. But there seems to be an air of irony about
    the whole communication which forbids us to construe any of its
    statements seriously; nor do we find the slightest allusion to
    this letter or its contents in all the rest of the correspondence.
    For my part, I am inclined to think it was a mocking letter
    addressed to John Paston by one of the prisoners in the Fleet,
    where Paston had himself been confined in 1464. His imprisonment
    on that occasion was probably of short duration, but I cannot tell
    the precise date of his release. He was committed to the Fleet, as
    we are informed by William Worcester (_Itinerary_, p. 366), on
    Saturday the 3d November. If I am right in my conjecture about
    this letter, he had, perhaps, been already liberated; but some of
    his late fellow-prisoners, probably members of the Inner or Middle
    Temple like himself, who had formed themselves into a fancy 'Order
    of the Temple of Sion,' amused themselves by speculating on the
    probability that he was not yet quite clear of the toils of the
    law, and that he would be obliged to come back and spend Christmas
    in gaol, among the jolly companions whom he had recently deserted.
    I may remark that the name of Thomas Babington occurs in Dugdale's
    _Origines Juridiciales_, p. 163, as having been elected a reader
    in the Inner Temple in 22 Hen. VII., when he seems to have been an
    old man; for, owing to his sight failing, he was excused from
    reading, and John Port, who was afterwards Attorney General, and,
    later still, Justice of the King's Bench, read in his place.]

    [Footnote 119.1: _i.e._ your fellow-Christians.]

    [Footnote 119.2: Fenn interprets this word _free will_, which I
    cannot think to be the meaning intended.]

[JOHN PASTON] TO MARGARET PASTON AND OTHERS[121.1]

_To my mastres Margrete Paston, and to my welbelovid Frendis, John
Daubeney and Richard Calle._

[Sidenote: 1465 / JAN. 15]

I pray yow, see to the god governaunce of my housold and guydynge of
other thynges touchyng my profite, and that ye, with Daubeney and
Richard Calle, and with other such of my frendis and servauntis as can
avise yow aftir the mater requireth, wekely take a sad comunecacion of
such thynges as be for to do, or oftenner and nede be, takyng avise of
the master, and of the viker[121.2] and Sir Jamis,[121.3] that is for to
say, as well for provision of stuffe for myn howsold as for the gaderyng
of the revenew of my livelode or greynes, or for setting awerk of my
servauntis, and for the more poletik meane of sellyng and carryng of my
malt, and for all other thynges necessari for to be do; and that whanne
I come home I have not an excuse, seying that ye spoke to my servauntis
and that Daubeney and Calle exkuse them that thei wer so besy thei myght
not attende; for I woll have my mater so guided that if on man may not
attende a nother shall be comaunded to do it; and if my servauntis faile
I had lever wage some other man, for a jorny or a season, thanne my
mater should be on sped.

As for my livelode, I left with Daubeney a bille of many of my dettis,
wherby ye alle myght have be indused whedir ye shulde have sent for
silver.

It liketh me evill to here that my prestis and pore men be onpaiid, and
that no mony sent to me more thanne x. markis be Berney of alle this
season, and yet therof telle Richard Calle he sent me viii. nobils in
goold for v. markis, and that as longe as gold was better payment thanne
silver I had nevir so moche gold of hym at onys; and telle hym that I
wolle nat that he shall kepe that use, for I trowe my tenauntis have but
litell gold to pay.

Also remembir yow in any housold, felaship or cumpany that will be of
good rewle, purvyauns must be had that every persone of it be helpyng
and furtheryng aftir his discrecion and powyr, and he that woll not do
so without he be kept of almes shuld be put out of the houshold or
felachep.

Item, where ye desire me that I shuld take your sone[122.1] to grase,
I woll for your sake do the better, and will ye knowe he shall not be so
oute of my favour that I will suffir hym to mischefe without be eftsones
his owne defaut. And hough be it that in his presumptuouse and
ondiscrete demenyng he gaf bothe me and yow cause of displeasir, and to
other of my servauntis ille exaumple, and that also guided hym to alle
mennes undirstandyng that he was wery of bidyng in myn hows, and he not
insurid of help in any other place; yet that greveth nat me so evill as
doth that I nevir coud fele nor undirstand hym poletyk ne diligent in
helpyng hym self, but as a drane amongis bees which labour for gaderyng
hony in the feldis and the drane doth nought but takyth his part of it.
And if this myght make hym to knowe the better hym self and put hym in
remembrauns what tyme he hath lost, and hough he hath leved in idelnes,
and that he coud for this eschewe to do so heraftir, it myght fortune
for his best. But I here yet nevir from no plase that he hath be in of
any poletyk demenyng or occupacion of hym. And in the kynges hows he
coud put hym self foorth to be in favour or trust with any men of
substauns that myght forther hym; neverthelesse as for your house and
myne I purpose not he shall come there, ner be my will non othir but if
[_i.e._ unless] he can do more thanne loke foorth and make a fase and
countenauns.

Item, send me word whedir my glasier hath do at Bromholm and at the
friers of the South Towne,[123.1] and whedir he be paiid such mony as I
sent home word he shuld be paiid, and if he have do all he must have
more mony, but I remembir not certeynly what, till I come home, for I
remember nat what his bargeyn was for the work at the Southtowne.
I trowe Mr. Clement can telle, and also fele hym self and send me word.
Also that ye and Richard Calle and Daubeney see that Mr. Clement and Mr.
Braklee[123.2] which hath grete nede I wote well, and my prestis and
pore men be paiid and also all othir men. And that ye see that I be not
callid on for that is my dewte. Also that ye see amongis yow that that
is owynge me be not lost ne forborn for lewdnes, for that shall bothe
hurt me and do my tenauntis harme. Lete Richard Calle remembir that my
fermour of Sweynesthorp is falle in gret dette for defaut of callyng
upon but be on [_one_] yere; And I deme that bothe John Willeys and my
new fermour of Snaylewell arn like to be in the same case, and
peraventure Aleyn of Gresham and other.

Item, remembir yow or evir I had a doo with Fastolffis livelode, whill I
toke hede to my livelode my self, it both served myn expenses at home
and at London and all other charges, and ye leid up mony in my cofirs
every yere, as ye knowe. And I wote well that the payment of my prestis
and other charges that I have for Fastolffis livelode is not so gret as
the livelode is, thow part therof be in trobill. And thanne consider
that I had nought of my livelode for myn expenses at London this twol
monyth day; ye may verely undirstand that it is not guided wittely nor
discretly; and therfore I pray yow hertly put alle your wittes to gedir
and see for the reformation of it. And ye may remembre be this how ye
shuld do if this wer yowris alone, and so do now.

And that ye woll remembir I have sent yow all many lettirs touchyng many
maters, and also a bille now last by Pecok of erandis, desiryng yow to
see hem alle to gedir and send me an answere articlerly; and such as ye
can not spede at this tyme, lete hem be sped as sone as ye may, that ye
se over my seyd lettirs oft tymes til they be sped.

Item, I remembir that myn heygh at Heylisdon the last yere was spent and
wasted fwll recklesly and colored under my shep.[124.1] I pray yow see
that I be not servid soo this yere.

Item, Pecok told me of a fermour that wold have had Mautby Mersh, paying
xij. markis as it went afore; and Richard Calle told me of on [_one_]
that wold pay more. Burgeys paiid me first xij. markis vj_s._ viij_d._,
and I had the reed and the rushis, and he found the shepherdis hyre in
shakke tyme for my fold; and sithen he brigged awey the shepherdis hyre
and thanne the nobill, and I trowe he occupyth ne lenger hym self. And I
remembir he told me vij. yere goo that my merssh shuld alwey apeyr
[_impair_] till the prime were past the nombre of xix., and thanne it
shuld amend a ix. or x. yers, promittyng me he wold thanne amend my
ferme. I praye yowe help to lete it aswell as ye can, rather to hym
thanne a nother man if he woll do aswell, and that ye comon with Pecok.

Item, as for the mater that I wrote of to the viker and other goode
felaws, desire hem that thei be not to excessive hasty in the mater for
non nede, but to do that the may do therin [goodly][124.2] and wittely
as sone as thei may; And as for the respite of the mater here, lete hem
not care therfore. I shall do well ineugh, telle hem; for certeyn, the
mater is in as good case as any such mater was this xx. wynter, as my
counsell tellyth me; but I will be sure of all weyes that I may have,
and specially of the declaracion of the trought of my mater and of my
frendis.

Item, as for the mater athwyx the parson of Mautby, Constantine[124.3]
and the viker of Derham,[124.4] whedir it were smalle mater or gret I
care not, but I am sure that too witnesse which I knowe were apposed
therin before a juge spirituall, whech as I suppose was Master Robert
Popy or some other; the viker of Derham can telle, and as I trowe can
John Wynter of Mautby, or othir parysshons telle, where the sute was
athwyx hem, and I can think it was in the chapitell; if ye can easely
gette me what the witnesse seid, I wold nomore; but do no gret cost over
it.

Item, recomaund me to Master Robert Popy, and telle hym, as for any
thyng seid ayens hym in my mater then myn adversaris ment ontrewly, they
proved nought but that he is a good man and a worshipfull and a trewe.

Item, if I have any otis beside my stuffe, or may any bye aftir

chafers, and send me word hough moch ye may bye.

reknyng of his malt, and cast ye my book and loke what ye can amend it;
and apeyre [_impair_] it shall not if alle folkis have do trewly; but I
suppose fewe of you have take any heed at it as moch as I ded.

Item, I may selle here for vj_s._ viij_d._ a quarter clene fyed after

Item, if on [_one_] man may not attende to gader silver, sende a nother,
and send me word what hath be reseyved and spent.

Item, that I have an answer of alle my lettirs and of every article in
hem.

Item, but if ye make such purvyauns that my prestis be paiid and pore
men, beside other charges, and purvey mony for me beside; owther ye
gadir shrewdly or ellis ye spend lewdly.

Item, I sent a lettir by Rauff Greneakyr to James Gresham and to yow,

But take ye hed and inquere and knowe other mennes purpos, and kepe your

    [Footnote 127.1: [From Fenn, iv. 134.] This letter must be later
    than the year 1463, as Sir John Paston does not appear to have
    been knighted so early as February in that year. But as John
    Paston, the father, was at Caister and not at London in the early
    part of the year 1464, it cannot be that year. Neither can we
    assign it to 1466, the last year of John Paston's life, as it
    appears by a letter written on the 17th February in that year that
    although John Paston was in London, his son Sir John could not
    have been there for some time before. We are therefore shut up to
    the year 1465 as the only possible date for this letter.]

hafe aunsuer uppon by hym for myn acquytaille another day, yff onye

hafe demened me at London accordyng to the message sent me by the baylly
of Drayton, and I vele but littille that my gode wille ys
allowed.[128.3] I hafe also, seth I came to Norwiche, enformed hym whate
proffyt ease and avaylle I may help stand hem both yn my maister godes
and yn hys lyvelode; yff he or hys frendys set littlle by it, I may nat
do wyth all. And the blessed Trinite be with yow, because ye wolle the
wellfare off my maister, whoos soule God hafe pytie on and bryng hym

the principall doer and cause that both Maister Paston and myne oncle
came fyrst yn the testament viij. yeer goon, to a gode entent; and yff
they wold wyrke ayenst me to minussh my power, theyr disposicion woll be
construed ferther than they wille it were, and they not so avaylled as
they weene yn all thynges. The blessed Trinete be wyth yow. Wryt on

Memorandum to Thomas More that because ye myzt foryete myne erand to
Maister Bernay, I pray you rede hym my bille, and that he wille take it
to a gode entent; for how so evyr I wryte I meene well, and so shall.

    [Footnote 128.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] In this letter reference
    is made to a 'testament' drawn up by Sir John Fastolf eight years
    previously. This, however, cannot be his last will, as that would
    carry the date to a year after John Paston's death, who seems to
    be here spoken of as living. The settlement referred to is
    doubtless the testamentary declaration of 1457 mentioned in No.

    [Footnote 129.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The claims laid by the
    Duke of Suffolk to Drayton and Hellesden occupy a prominent place
    in this correspondence during the year 1465, and I do not find
    them alluded to in any letter of an earlier date. Moreover, the
    purchase by virtue of which the Duke laid claim to the latter
    manor, which is reported here as a secret, is mentioned again as a
    piece of news in a letter undoubtedly written on the 10th May
    1465. There can be little doubt therefore that this letter is of
    the same year. The apostyle, or set of marginal notes appended, is

[Sidenote: Malt, barly.]

desyre that we shuld purvey for your malte and barley; and soo shall we
doo as well as we cann, and send you word howe that we may doo therewith
in hast.

Item, yesterday Master Phylyp[132.1] toke Dorlets hors uppon Drayton
lond as they went to the plowe for the hole yere ferm; and as it ys told
me the tenaunts of Drayton tolde hym that he dyde hym wrong to make hym
pay for the hole yere, for non of the tenaunts had payd hym but for the
di' [_half_] yere and he say thohg they had not payd but for the di'
yere,

[Sidenote: Dorlat et verba M.P.]

Paston shuld pay for the other di' yere, and for moo yers also yf he
lyvyd. But I trow to gyte Dorlet ayen hys hors or els Mr. Phylyp ys lyke
to be unhorssyd ons, and we lyve all. Your son[132.2] shall com hom to
moryn, as I trowe, and as he demenyth hym hyr after I shall lete you
have knowlych;

[Sidenote: J. P., sen.]

and I pray you thynk not in me that I wyll supporte hym ne favour hym in
no lewdnesse, for I wyl not. As I fynd hym hereafter, soo I wyll lete
you have knowlych. I have put your evydens that com owte of the
abbay[132.3] in a seck and enseylyd hem under Ric. Call ys seall that he
shal not say but they eryn as he left hem;

[Sidenote: Rotuli prioris (?)]

but as for the place where they ern kypt he hath no knowlych . . . .
. . . . . . . As for the gentylwoman that ye wrote to me for yn youre

as it shold doo me, I trow . . . . . . . a bowte yf her frends were as
well a gryed therto, and as they . . . . . . . . parte, yf ye wyll that
it be movyd of more hereafter I wyll . . . . . . . . wyll make a newe

    [Footnote 131.2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Holy Rood Day, on which
    this letter is dated, commonly means the 14th of September (feast
    of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross). Here I suspect it is the 3rd
    May (Invention of the Holy Cross), as the contents of the letter
    suit that date in the year 1465. It will be seen that Margaret
    Paston dates from Caister, and proposes next week to be at
    Hellesden. Her next letter, dated the 10th May, is from Hellesden,
    and shows that she carried out the intention here expressed of
    sending men to collect money at Drayton, and had left her eldest
    son at Caister to keep the place. There is also a close agreement
    between that letter and this, in what is said about the demeanour
    of the tenants and Mr. Philip's conduct. The apostyle of this
    letter, as of the preceding, is in the hand of John Paston, very
    ill written, and occasionally ambiguous.]

JOHN RUSSE TO JOHN PASTON[133.1]

_To the right worshypfull sir, my right honourabyll maister, John
Paston, at London._

[Sidenote: 1465 / MAY 6]

Right worshipfull sir and my right honorabyll maister, I recomaund me to
you in the most humble wise. And please youre maistir ship to wete that
my maistresse hathe dyverse tymes spokyn to me to helpe to purvey a
merchaunt for sum of youre malt; but in good feyth I can gete no man
that wyll geve at the most more than xxij_d._ for a quarter, for soo men
selle dayli at the moste, and sumtyme xx_d._ a combe. My maistresse is
right hevy therfor, but I can not remedy it; if ony good marchaunt were
there, after my sympil conseyt it were good to take hym, for the yeer
passith faste and the [feldes][133.2] be right plesaunt to wards, &c.
Sir, at the reverence of Jesu, laboure the meanys to have peas; for be
my trowth the contynwaunce [of this] trobill shall short the dayez of my
maistresse, and it shall cause you to gret losse, for serteyn she is in
gre[t hevi]nesse as it apperith at . . . . . . . . . . . ll covertly she
consederith the gret decay of youre lyflode, the gret detts that hange
in detours hands and h . . . . . . . . . . . . . [she speaket]h not thus
to me, but I conceyfe this is cause of here gret hevynesse; me semyth of

every foot of grownd withinne fewe dayez, and rather to geve it awey for
nowght tha[n] . . . . . . it. Where as they many tymes have meovyd a
trety and never it taketh to noo conclucion, and as they have seyd in
youre d . . . . . . Sir, after my sympyll conseyt it were well doon to
agree to a trety, and be that ye shuld knowe ther desyre and the uttir
. . . . . . . the lond were dubyll the valwe that it is. Worsestyr
shewyth hem presedents what every maner cost at the fyrst byeng, and
ther . . . . . . . . rekne the bargeyne shuld avayle you foure tymes mor
than it shall; and in thys they be gretly blyndyd; my maister the parson
hathe . . . . to rellesse in serteyn londs whiche he refus[eth to] doo,
but I conseyve, and ye drawe not to a conclucion thys terme that he wyll
be as redy to rellesse . . . . men, truste ye thys for serteyn; and soo
he [told] me serteynly. He hathe be meovyd to revoke Maister Roberd
Kente and to take the avoket or proctor [that] Maister Yelwirton hathe.
What it myght hurtyn if he soo dede I knowe not, but they have made gret
labour to hym therfor. He gaf me a gret reb[uke] . . . . the bill that
was put in ayens Elyse Davy and otheris, to whiche I answeryd hym as me
thowght and soo in maner made my peas, &c. Maister . . . . was here and
in presence of men of the most substance in Jeremuth he be havyd hym to
you wards in full goodly termys, soo God helpe . . . . and after my
conseyt he wyll not be redy to relesse in ony of the londs. A man of
hyse teld me secretly that Maister Yelwyrton and otheres blamyd hym and
seyd . . . . to hym be cause he was so redy be hym self to agree to
trete and make hyse peas with yow, neyther he seyd to me to trete nor
the contrary nor had but langwage to me as he had to othyr. I askyd my
maister the parson if he undyrstod that Maister Yelwyrton yaf ony favour
to my Lord of Suffolk in Drayton, and he seyd he supposyd Maister
Yelwyrton was not cler of that mater, but Mayster Jenney was in nowyse
pleasyd with all, &c. Sir, as for the wytnesse that were desyred to be
redy whan nede requirith in thys mater, R. Calle can avertise youre
maistirshyp. Sir, at the reverence of Jesu consedre how many yeers it is
past that my good lord and maister deseasyd and how lytill is doon for
. . . . of the grete substaunce that he hade it is hevy to remembre; ye
sey the defaute is not in yow after your conseyt, but I can here no
. . . . in that of youre openyon, for thys I knowe for serteyn and it
had pleasyd you to have endyd be the meanys of trety, ye had ma[de]
. . . peas to the gret well of the dede with the forthe part of the mony
that hathe be spent, and as men sey only of very wylful[nesse of your]
owyn person. For the mercy of God remembre the onstabylnesse of thys
wold hou it is not a menut space in comparyson to ever . . . . . . .
leve wylfullnesse whyche men sey ye occupye to excessifly. Blyssyd be
God ye had a fayre day laste whiche is noysyd cost yow . . . . to iiij.
lords, but a newe mater anewe cost and many smale growe to a gret summe,
and summe mater on recurabyll, formen seyd . . . . is lyk to stonden in
a perplextif if ye take not a conclucion in haste, and if it were doo it
were hard to have recovery; but as my [maister] the parson seyd, thys
terme they wyll prove if ye wyll agree to trete, and if ye refuse they
all wyll do the uttirmest. I conseyve well [your] maistirshyp hathe a
conseyt that if a man of good will meove yow or remembre you to trete,
that that man, what soo ever he be, shuld be meovyd be youre adversaryez
to meove you in that mater, and soo in that it hertyth you gretly that
they shuld seke to you for peas. Be my trowth, sir, there was nor is no
man, savyng onys, as I teld you, Maister Jenney spake to me, that ever I
knewe wold seke or feythefully desyre to have peas with yow, savyng
because of the exspence of the good so onprofitably in the lawe, and
that is the prynsypal cause of meovyng of ther peas, &c. I wold well God
helpe me soo it grevyth me to here that ye stonde in no favour with
jentylmen nor in no gret awe with the comowns. Ye truste the jury of
Suffolk; remembre what promyse Daubeney hade of the jury and what it
avaylid; it is a dethe to m[e] to remembre in what prosperite and in
what degre ye myght stonde in Norfolk and Suffolk and ye had peas and
were in herts ease, and what worship my maisters your sones and my
maistresse youre douters myght have be preferryd to if ye had be in
reste. A day lost in idyll can never be recoveryd, &c. Sir, I beseke
youre maistershyp for yeve me that I wryte thus boldly and homly to you;
me thynkyth my hert . . . . not be in ease but if I soo doo, for ther
was, nor never shal be, no mater that ever was soo ner myn herte, that

and he lete hem playnly wyte that yf ye or any of your servaunts toke

Ric. Calle axid the parson and Stermyn yf they wold take an accyon for

wold not be trobelyd herafter; he sayd he had lever lose hys catell, for

    [Footnote 141.1: [From Fenn, iv. 164.] There can be little doubt
    this letter was written in the year 1465, when Margaret was
    troubled by Mr. Philip Lipgate and the Duke of Suffolk's bailiff
    of Cossey. It may be observed also that Margaret here dates from
    Hellesden, and speaks of having been recently at Caister. Compare
    Nos. 579 and 581. Further, the name of John Jenney is found on the
    Commission of the Peace for Norfolk, dated the 1st April 1465
    (Patent, 5 Edward IV., p. 1, m. 32), but it is not on the
    commission issued on the 20th February following (_ib._, m. 27);
    so that John Paston seems to have acted on his wife's suggestion

_To my ryght wyrshypfull husbond, John Paston, by thys delyvery[d] in

[Sidenote: 1465 / MAY 20]

Please it you to wyte that on Satourday last your servaunts Naunton,
Wyks, and other, wer at Drayton, and ther toke a dystresse for the rent
and ferm that was to pay, to the nomber of lxxvij. nete, and so broght
them hom to Hayllesdon, and put them in the Pynfold, and so kept hem
styll ther from the seyd Satour day mornyng un to Monday,[143.2] at iij.
at clok at after non. Fyrst on the same Satour day the tenants folwyd
uppon, and desyryd to have ther catell ayen; and I awunsweryd hem, yf
they wold do pay such dewts as they oght for to pay to you, that then
they shold have ther catell delyveryd ayen; or els yf they wer not a
power to pay redy money, that then they to fynd suffycyant suerty to pay
the money at such a day as they mygh agrye with me, and therto to be
bonden to you by obligacyon; and that they seyd they durst not for to
take uppon hem for to be bonden, and as for money they had non for to
pay at that tyme, and therfor I kept stylle the bestys.

Harleston was at Norwych, and send for the tenants the seyd Satour day
at after non, and ther, by the menys of the Bayllyf of Coshay, put the
tenants in such feer, sayng that yf they wold pay such dewts, or els for
to be bonden to pay, that then they wold put hem owte of such londs as
they huld bondly of the Lordshyp, and so to dystrayn hem and trobell
hem, that they shuld be wery of ther part; and that put hem [in] such
feer that they drust nother pay nor be bonden.

And on the same day at evyn-song time Harleston com to me to Haylesdon,
desyryng me that I wold delyver a yen the seyd dystresse; and as for
such dystressys as they had taken here of your tenants shold be
delyveryd a yen in lyke forme; and I seyd I wold not delyver hem soo,
and I told hem that I wold delyver hem as ys wryten a fore and other
wyse not, and other wyse I wold not delyver hem but by the form of lawe.
And other comynycacyon was had by twene us at that tyme of dyvers maters
whych wer to long to wryte at thys tyme, but ye shall have knowlych
therof in hast.

And on Monday next after at ix. at clok ther com Pynchemor to Haylesdon

Understewerd of the Duche [_Duchy_], sayng that the bests were taken
uppon the Duche Fee, wherfor he desyryd me to mak hym levery of the seyd
bests so taken; and I seyd I wold not delyver hem on to the tyme that I
had examenyd the tenants of the trough [truth]. And so I send theder
Wyks with Pynchemor to understond what they wold say; and the tenants
seyd that ther was taken non uppon the Duche at ther knowlych, save only
Pyrs Warryn the yonger. And Paynter seyd that ther catell was taken
uppon the Duche, whych they connot prove by non record, save only by
ther awyn sayng; and so we wold not a bey that replevyn, and so they
departyd. And at iij. at clock at after non Pynchemor come to Haylysdon
a yen with ij. men, whych broght with hem a replevyn from the Shyryff,
whos namys be John Whytherley and Robert Ranson, whych requyryd me by
the same replevyn to make them delyvery of the seyd bestys taken at
Drayton; and so I, syyng the Shyryffs replevyn and under hys seale, bade
my men delyver hem, and soo they wer delyveryd.

And as for all other maters that ye have wretyn to [me] of, I wyll spede

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[147.1]

_To my ryght wyrshypfull husbond, John Paston, be thys letter
delyveryd._

[Sidenote: 1465 / JUNE 11]

Ryght wyrshypfull husband, I recomaunde me unto you. Please it you to
wyte that I recevyd letters from you on Wensday laste passyd, the were
wryten the Monday next before, wherof I thanke you of the letter that ye

to youre pleasure and profet; and in such thyngs as I cannot skyle of,
I wyll take a vyse of such as I know that be youre frendes and doo as
well as I canne. Wher as ye wrote to me that Lydham told you that I told
hym that the Ducks men werre not so besy as they had be by fore, no more
thay were not at that tyme, but sythen thay have be bysyer. What confort
that thay have I canne not have no knowlych as yet, but I suppose and
all your felshyp were gode, thay shold not have so grete confort as they
have, or ells they wold not be so besy as thay have be. Grete bost thay
make that the Duck shold have Drayton in peas, and after thys Haylesdon,
and that with in short tyme; thay er moch the bolder, I suppose, by
cause that ye be wher as ye be. At the reverens of God, yf ye may by any
wyrshypfull or resonabell mene, com oute therof as sone as ye may and
come home amonges your frends and tennaunts, and that shold be to hem
the grettyst confort that thay myzt have and the contrary to your enmys.

It ys sayd here that the Duck of Suffolk shall com to Coshay in haste
and logge ther for a season; I fyle well by your tenaunts that yf ye
were peaseabyly possessyd and your cort holden in peaseabyll wyse, and
that they myzt be in pease a yenst the other many, than they wold take
accyons a yenste hem for such wrongs as have be don to hem, and ells
they say that they thernot [_dare not_] take it uppon hem, for they
dwelle so ney to the other many that thay knowe well thay shold never be
in ease yf thay dyde soo whyle that thay dele amongs hem. On Thursday
last John Doket, the bayly ys son y lawe, and Thomas Ponte, with other,
erly in the mornyng, an owre by fore the sonne rose, com to your fold,
and drove away the flock at Drayton, both Colyet and other, in to Coshay
fee, or ever that the shipherd myght have knowlych therof and then he
fowlyd one and desyryd to have hem a yen, and thay wold not suffer hym
to have them no more but the Colyet and ther were c. and j. of yours and
tho had thay forth with hem to Coshay, and the same day we had a
replevyn for the cc. shype and replevyn for the hors that wer taken at
Haylesdon, and how that thay were obbeyd Ric. Calle shall enforme you,
and of other maters also, the whych I may not wryte to you of at thys
tyme.

Item, I have spoke with [John] Strange of the mater that ye wrote to me
of, and in gode feyth I[148.1] fynd hym, as me symyth, ryght well
disposyd to you wards; and he hath, acordyng to your desyre, spoken with
Yelverton yesterday to fyle his dysposicion in that mater, and
Yelverton, as it symyth by hym, roght not gretely thogh the mater brake,
so that he myght have any resonabell colour to breke, he ys so callyd
uppon by Wayte and other of the Duck of Suffolk ys counsell that he ote
[_wot_] not where to hold hym, and he ys put in so gret confort, as I am
enformyd, to receve money for the lond, and that temptyth hym ryght
sore; for with money he wold fayn be in handelyng, as ye know he hath
nede therof. He told John Straunge that it ys informyd hym that ye have
up an enquest to depreve ther wytnesse and ther with ys he sore movyd
. . . . . . . . . that yf any thyngs be don in temporall maters other in
spyryt[uall] . . . . . . maters tochyng executors or feoffeys or wyttnes
tyll the day of . . . . . . trety be passyd, he wyll not abyde no trety
therin, but do as . . . . . . . . . thynkyth best for to do therein.
I told John Straunge that I kn[ew] . . . . . . . . thogh it were soo
that shold passe any such enquest it shol n . . . . . . . . . . of them
in provyng of her trothys, the whych shold be no hurt . . . . . . . . .
for John Straunge desyryd me that I shuld send to you in al haste that
. . . . . . . . . any such folks that thay shold not doo in the mater
till the day of . . . . . . . . . may have knowlych howe he and other
wold doo in such maters as sh . . . . . . . . he wold be loth that he
shold have any colour to breke for any thyng . . . . . . . . and
Yelverton sayth it shall not breke thorf his defaute yf ye wyll
n[ot] . . . . . . . . be ryght glad to have your gode wyll and to goo
thorgh in all maner mate[rs] . . . . . . . . eschewyng of wastfull
expens of the dede ys godes and that the godes myzt be dyspendyd to
the welle of the dede. Straunge desyryd to knowe what appoyntements
he desyryth to have in the trety, and he sayd he wold not let that be
understond tyll the tyme of trety cam. Me symyth, save your beter avyse,
it were wel do that thay that be com up for you myzt be kypt in som
secryte place and not do [_naught done ?_] in the mater tyll the tyme
of the trety were passyd. The cost there of shall not be grete to that
it myzt hurte yf the trety were broken by that meane and then ye may
have hem nyer; and yf ye thynk it be to doo ye may have hem to go to
ther mater after the seyd tyme, for of ij. hurtes the grettyst ys best
to be eschewyd.

Item, as for youre houshold at Caster, savyng your beter avyse, me
thynkyth that v. or vj. of your folkes, such as ye wyll assyngne, were
[enough to?][149.1] kype the place, and they for to go to bord with the
prustes, and ye not to kype no houshold ther yet; and that ye shall fynd
more profettabyll than for to doo as we do nogh; for ther expens, as I
understond, have not be moch the lesse by fore Wytsontyde than it shold
be thogh I had be at home by cause of resortyng of pepell theder; and yf
the houshold were broke thay myzt have a gode excuse in that, whosome
ever come. Ric. Call shall enforme you of thys maters, and mo other,
more playnly than I may do wryte at thys tyme. It is necessary that
possessyon be kypt hyre yett tyll ye be more ferther forth in other
maters. The Blessyd Trynyte have you [in] Hys kypyng, and send you gode
spyde in all your maters, and send you grace to have a gode conclusyon
in hem in haste. Wryten on the Tewysday nex before Corpus Christi.

JOHN PASTON THE YOUNGEST TO HIS FATHER[150.1]

[Sidenote: 1465 / JUNE 15]

Ryth reverent and worchepfull fadyr, I recomand me on to yow, beschyng
yow lowly of your blyssyng. Plesit yow to have knowlage how that I have
be in Sowthefolk for syche materys as my cosyn Dawbeney took my modyr a
byll of, towchyng the materys be twyx yow and Jenney. And of all the
jentylmen that ye wold my modyr schold send to for thys mater ther ar no
more at home bot John Alyngton; and I schewyd hym the byll of the namys
of the Inqwest and knew no more of hem all bot thes, John Depden, Thomas
Wodborne, John Donemowe, Herry Chesten, and Adam Wrene. And to all them
Alyngton sent a man of hys for to fele hem how they wer dysposyd. Thys
was the answer of John Depden and Thomas Wodborne, they sayd the last
tyme they wer at London iche of ther costys stood hem on x_s._, and they
seyd they wold no mor come at London bot if[150.2] they knew who schod
pay for ther costis; but me thowt by Alyngtonys man that they wold have
had a brybe of yow be syd the paying for ther costys for to have bedyn
at home, for they have non othyr levyng but brybys. As for John Donemow
and Herry Chesten, so that ther issuys may be payd they wyll not come
ther; nor in trowthe they scholl not come ther. Wher for Alyngton
prayith yow that ther issuys may be payid. Adam Wrene was not spoke to,
for he is Jenneys baly or hys fermour. As for the quest they ar not yet
somoned to aper, and but if[151.1] they be somonyd ther scholl non of
hem all aper. The most part of the todyr dwell a bowt Ippyswyche and
they be Debnamys tenauntys and Brewsys, and I knowd get no man to spek
with hem but if[151.1] I schold have spok with hem my selve; and my
spekyng with hem schold rather aperyd [_have impaired_] the mater than a
mendyd it. And also I hyid me the faster home a geyn, for I lay at my
cosyn Lovedays on Corpus Christi Day at nyth; and he told me that the
Duches of Sofokys consell wold entre in to Calcot Hall, and they wold
kep it tyll the Duches knew who schold be her tenaunt, owthyr ye or
Debnam. Thus told one of the men of the seyd cowncell to Loveday; whyche
man schold ryd thedyr with hem. And thys schold be do as to morow at
aftyr non; bot I trow they wole but tak a distres for the servys of the
maner, whych is dwe; but I have sent word to Rysyng and to the tenauntis
that they schold dryve a wey ther catell. And as for the maner, my
brodyr and I scholl kepe it so that they schall not entyr as that daye,
by the grase of God, nor aftyr nowthyr and [_i.e._ if] we may knowe of
it, but if[151.1] ye send us othyr wys word. As for the namys that ye
wold have for to pase upon the mater betwyx yow and Hogan, I spok to
Alyngton and Loveday therof, and Loveday seyd he knew non that wold pas
up on ony inquest for hym, for he medylyd with no syche men; and
Alyngton seyd that he kowd assyne me none men for serteyn, not tyll he
had spok with some, whyche he seyd wold aske gret leyser, for he knew
bot fewe in Sofolk; if it had be in Cambrygge schyre he kowd have get
you j now. My modyr spak with old Banyard of Sibton Abbey for the same
mater, and he knew none that wold pase upon the mater at his desyer, but
he asygnyd dyvers men that love not Jeney, whyche he kowd thynk wold
pase upon it at yowr desyer if ye spok with hem your selve; or at the
lest iche of hem kowd get yow ij. or iij. men that wold sey as they wold
in cas ye spok with hem your selve, whoys namys I send you in a byll by
Loveday. Item, as for the gape at Nakton Rychard Calle seyth that it was
a thorn busche was leyd in with owt a stake betwyx ij. thornys that
grew; and as for Jeneys netes, ther was not one lost her calfe that I
can inquer of. And I pray God farther yow in all youyr materys to Hys
plesans and to youer hertys desyir. Wretyn in hast at Hallysworthe the
Saterday next aftyr Trinite Sonday.

My cosyn Hevenyngham is at London, and he kowd asygne you men that wold
say as he wold mor than Syr John Wyngfeld, Alyngton, and all.

  JOHN PASTON THE YONGEST.

    been examined in the spring of 1464 (_see_ No. 565); but the suit
    was still going on in 1465, and in a letter of Margaret Paston's,
    of the 24th June following, Richard Calle is mentioned as having

[JOHN PASTON] TO MARGARET PASTON AND OTHERS[156.2]

_To my cosyn Margret Paston and to John Dawbeney and Richard Calle._

[Sidenote: 1465 / JUNE 27]

I recomande me to yow, and have received a letter from yow and a nother
for Richard Calle be John Colman, and . . be Roos; and I have received
of Colman the plate and mony acording Richard Callis letteris. Item,
I con yow thonk ye send me word the prise of corn. Item, as for yowr
sone,[157.1] I lete yow wete I wold he dede wel, but I understand in hym
no disposicion of policy, ne of governans as man of the werle owt to do,
but only levith and ever hath as man disolut with owt any provision, ne
that he besiith hym nothinge to understand swhech materis as a man of
lyvelode must nedis understond; ne I understond nothing of what
disposicion he porposith to be, but only I kan thynk he wold dwell ayeyn
in yowr hows and myn, and ther ete and drinke and slepe.[157.2] Therfor
I lete yow wete, I wold know hym or he know myn entent, and how wel he
hath ocupiid his tym now he hath had leyser. Every pore man that hath
browt up his chylder to the age of xij. yer waytyth than to be holp and
profited be hes chylder, and every gentilman that hath discrecion
waytith that his ken and servantis that levith be hym and at his coste
shuld help hym forthward. As for yowr sone, ye knowe well he never stode
yow ne me in profite, ese or help, to valew of on grote, savyng at
Calkot Hall whane [he[157.3]] and hes brothir keptid on day ayeyns
Debenham, and yet was it at iii. [times[157.3]] the coste that that ever
Debenham sones put hym to. For be her police [_by their policy_] they
kepe Cotton at my cost and with the[157.4] profitis of the same. Wherfor
geff hem no favor tyle ye feel what he is and will be.

Item, Calle sendith me word that Master Phylip[157.5] hat entrid in
Drayton in my Lord of Suffolk's name, and hat odir purpose to entre in
Heylisdon, and he askith my avyse; whech is that ye confort my tenantis
and help hem til I com hom, and lete hem wet I shall not lese it, and
that the Dowk of Suffolk that last diid wold have bouth it of Fastolff,
and, for he mygth not have it so, he claymyd the maner, seying it was on
Polis [_one Pole's_], and, for his name was Poole, he claymed to be eyr.
He was ansueryed that he com nothing of that stok, and how
somever[157.6] wer kyn to the Polis that owth[157.7] it it hurt not, for
it was laufully bowth and sold, and he never kleymid it after. Item,
I am in purpose to tak assise ageynse hem at this tyme, and elles I wold
have sent thedir streyt be a letter of attorney to entre in my name;
never the les ye be a gentilwoman, and it is worshep for you to confort
yowr tennauntis; wherfor I wold ye myth ryd to Heylisdon and Drayton and
Sparham, and tari at Drayton and speke with hem, and byd hem hold with
ther old master til I com, and that ye have sent me word but late,
wherfore ye may have none answer yet, and informe hem as I ha (_sic_)
wrete to ye within; and sey oupinly it is a shame that any man shuld set
anny lord on so ontrwe a mater, and speciall a preste; and lete hem
wete, as sone as I am com hom I shall see hem. Item, that as for
distreyn for rent of ferm, thow the Dewk had tytill, as he hath not, he
may non ask til the next rent day after his entre, that is Michelmes,
and seye that ye will be paiid everi peni and asken hem it. And make
mech of men of Cossey, becawse they wer owr welwillers when we wer
neyboris ther; and lete hem wete that the begyningis of shech mater had
never worchip nor profite of me, ne shall, and desyr god will of yowr
neyboris, &c., and suyn all othir menes that ye kan to plese the pepill.
And lete yowr tenaunts wete that the Dewke may never be lawe compel hem
to torn from me; and do all so well as ye can, and if any entyr be made
in Heylisdon shuff him owt and set sum man to kepe the place, if ned be,
not withstandyng it longith not to the manere. Item, I wold fayn have
sum man to be bayle of Heylisdon and Drayton, &c., that myth go amongis
the tenauntis. And elles I wold han Richard Chyllins (?) to go amond
[_q._ among?] hem tyl I com hom and also Richard Calle whan home. Item,
he sent me word that the tenauntis of Drayton wold not come to the
Dewkis cort and that they will be stefast to me and kepe hem straunge
and froward from the Dewkis cowncell; all this mater shall turne to a
jape and not hurt hem; ner, and if ye be wavering it shall hurt hem.
Item, I let yow wete this is do to cause me to loose my labor ayens hym
for Dedham, which I wil not for it. God kepe yow. Wret the Thursday
befor Sent Petres day.

Item, tel Richard Calle to have wittenses redy. I wol spede this mater
spirituall befor Estern.

    [Footnote 159.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is not
    addressed on the back, nor is the handwriting that of Margaret
    Paston, but from the subscription it would appear to have been
    written by her to one of her sons; and as John Paston the younger
    is mentioned in the body of the letter, the person addressed was
    evidently his elder brother. The letter seems to have been written
    shortly before the Duke of Suffolk's attempt on Hellesden
    mentioned in the next No., probably on the Saturday preceding it.]

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON[160.1]

_To my mastre, John Paston, in hast._

[Sidenote: 1465 / JULY 10]

Plesith it youre maysterschip to witte of the rwle and disposicion of
the Master Philip and the Balyf of Cossey, with others of my Lorde of
Suffolkes men. On Monday last past, at aftrenoon, [they] wer at
Heylesdon, with the nombre of CCC. men, for to have entred,
notwithstandyng they seyde they come not for to entre; but withoute
dought, and they had been strong inough for us, they wolde have entred,
and that we undrestonde nough, but we knowyng of ther comyng and
purveyed so for hem, that we wer strong j nough. We had lx. men withinne
the place, and gonnes, and suche ordynauns, so that if they had satte
uppon us, they had be distroyed. And ther my mastres was withine, and my
mastre, Sir John, and hathe gate hym as grete worschip for that day as
any gentleman myght doo, and so is it reported of the partye and in all
Norwiche. And my Lorde of Norwiche sent theder Master John Salett and
Master John Bulleman for to trete, and so they ded; and the Duc men
seide they had a warant for to attache John Dawbeney, Wyks, Calle,
Hunewrthe, and Bliclyng and other, weche they wuld have; and my master,
Sir John, answerd them, and seide that they were not withine, and though
we had ben, they shuld not have had hem; and so they desired oon of our
men. And so Naunton stede by my mastres and haxed hem whom they wold
have, and seyde if they wold have hem he wold go with hem, and so he
ded. And on the next day they caryed hym forthe to my Lord of Suffolk to
Claxton, through Norwich; and ther we had founde a remedy for hym for to
heve lette hym; and he wold not, but nedys go forthe with hem; but like
a jentelman he was entreated amongs hem. And Harleston desyred at
Heylesdon to speke with my mastre, Sir John, and so he ded, and seyde to
hym it were ryght weele don that he rode to my Lord of Suffolk and
desired hym in any wice that he schulde do so, and seyde that it was hes
dwte so for to do, in asmoche as my Lorde was come to contre, and that
he wolde ryde with hym, and brynge hym to my Lorde; and he answerd and
seide to hym, whan that he undrestode that my Lord were hes fathers
goode Lord and hes, that thanne he wolde se hes Lordship, and [ell]es he
had non aronde to hym; and so they departed. And thanne appoyntement was
taken that they shull sende home ther men, and we schuld send home oure.
And nough my Lord of Suffolks men come from Claxton to Norwich, and face
us and fray uppon us, this dayly. Ther fylle uppon me befor Sevayne dore
xij. of hes men, viij. of them in harneys, and ther they wold have
myscheved me and the Scheryf letted hem and other, and they make ther
awaunte were that I may be goten I schul dye; and so they lye in a wayte
for to myscheve me, Dawbeney, and Wyks; and so I dare not ryde out alone
withoute a man with me. And I undrestonde ther is comyn an Heyre
Determyner[161.1] to enquer of all ryots, and my Lord of Suffolk and
Yelverton be Comyscioners; and so they sey as money of us as can be
taken shal be endyted and hanged forth with; and so the people here are
dysmayed with ther rwle. Wherfore that it like you to sende werd how my
mastres schal do at Heylesdon, and we in all other maters; and wether ye
wol that we feche a yene the flok of Heylesdon, for they are nough
dreven to Causton, and there go they on the heyth; and my Lord of
Suffolk wolbe at Drayton on Lames Daye, and kepe the Coort ther;
wherefor ye must seke an remedy for it, or ell[es] it woll not do weele.

If my Lord of Norffolk wold come, he schulde make all weele, for they
feere hym above all thyngs, for it is noyced here that my Lord of
Norffolk hathe taken partye in thes mater, and all the cuntre is cladde
of it, seyng that if he come they wooll hooly go with hym.

And me senethe it were wele don to meve my Lord in it, though ye schuld
geve hym the profyghts of Heylesdon and Drayton for the kepyng, and som
money be side; for ye must seke som other remedy than ye do, or ell[es]
in my conseyte it schull go to the Divell, and be distroyed, and that in
ryght schort tyme. And therfore at the reverence of God take som
appoyntement with Master Yelverton, suche as ye thynke schuld most hurt.

I beseche you to pardon me of my writyng, for I have pitte to se the
trybulacion that my mastres hathe here, and all your frends, &c.

Almyghty Jesu preserve and kepe you. Wreten the Wednesday next Seint
Thomas Daye.

  RIC. CALLE.

    [Footnote 160.1: [From Fenn, iv. 212.] From what has been already

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[162.1]

_To my right worschipfull husbond, John Paston, in hast._

[Sidenote: 1465 / JULY 12]

Ryght worshypful husbond, I recomaund me to yow, preyeng you hertyly
that ye wyl seke a meen that yowr servauntys may be in pees, for they be
dayly in fer of ther lyvys. The Duke Suffolks men thretyn dayly
Dawbeney, Wykys, and Richard Calle, that wher so ever they may gete them
they schold dye; and affrayes have ben made on Rychard Calle this weke,
so that he was in gret jupperte at Norwych among them; and gret affrayes
have ben made uppon me and my felashep her on Monday last passyd, of
whych Rychard Calle tellyth me that he hath sent yow word of in
wryghtyng, mor pleynly than I may doo at thys tyme, but I shal informe
yow mor pleynly heraftyr.

I suppose ther shal be gret labor ageyn yow and yowr servaunts at the
Assysis and Cescions her; wherfor me semyth, savyng your better advyce,
it wer wele do that ye shold speke with the Justicys or they com her;
and yf ye wol that I compleyn to them or to any other, if Good fortune
me lyfe and helth, I wol do as ye advyse me to do, for in good feyth I
have ben symply intretid among them; and what with syknesse, and troble
that I have had, I am browte ryght lowe and weyke, but to my power I wyl
do as I can or may in your maters.

The Duk of Suffolk and both the Duchessys shal com to Claxton thys day,
as I am informyd, and thys next weke he shal be at Cossey; whether he
wol com ferther hyddyr ward or not, I wot not yit. It is seyd that he
schold com hyddyr, and yet hys men seyd her on Monday that he cleymyd no
tytyl to thys place; they seyd ther comyng was but to take out such
ryotus peple as was her within thys place, and suche as wer the Kyngys
felonys, and indytyd and outlawyd men. Neverthe lesse they wold schew no
warauntys wherby to take non such, thow ther had suche her; I suppose if
they myght have com in pesably, they wold have made an other cause of
ther comyng.

Whan alle was doo and they scholde departe, Harlyston and other desyryd
me that I schold com and se myn olde Lady, and sewe to my Lorde, and if
any thyng wer amysse it schold be amendyd. I said if I scholde sewe for
any remedye, that I scholde sewe ferther, and lete the Kynge and alle
the Lordys of thys lond to have knowlech what hathe be don to us, if so
wer that the Deuk wolde meynten that hathe be don to us by hys
servauntys, if ye wolde geve me leve.

I pray yow sende me worde if ye wyl that I make any compleynt to the
Duke or the Duchesse; for as it is tolde me, they know not the pleynesse
that hathe ben don in such thyngys as hathe ben don in her [_their_]
namys.

I schold wryght muche mor to yow but for lak of leyser.

I comaundyd my Mayster Tom thys day to have com ageyn by me from
Norwych, when he had spokyn with Rychard Calle, but he cam not. I wolde
he wer qwyte of hys indytments, so that he wer qwyte of yowr servyce;
for by my trowthe, I holde the place the mor ongracyous that he is in,
for hys dysposycion in dyverce thyngys, the whych ye schal be informed
of her after.

The Trynyte have yow in kepyng. Wretyn the Fryday next after Seynt
Thomas.

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[164.1]

_To my cosyn, Margaret Paston._

[Sidenote: 1465 / JULY 13]

I recummand me to yow, I thank of yow of yowr labour and besynes with
the unruly felechep that cam befor yow on Monday last past, wherof I
herd report be John Hobbis. And in god feyth ye aquyt yow rygth wel and
discretly and hertyly to yowr wurchep and myn, and to the shame of your
adversarijs, and I am wel content that ye avowid that ye kept possession
at Drayton and so wold doo. Wherfor I pray yow, make yowr word god if ye
may, and at the lest, let myn adversarijs not have it in pees if ye may.
Jon Hobbys tellith me that ye be seekly, whech me lekith not to here;
praying yow hartyly that ye take what may do yowr eese and spar not, and
in any wyse take no thowth no to moch labor for thes maters, ne set it
not so to yowr hert that ye fare the wers for it. And as for the mater,
so they overcome yow not with fors ne bosting, I shall have the maner
sewrlyer to me and myn, than the Dewk shall have Cossey, dowt ye not.
And in cas I come not home within thre wekis, I pray you com to me, and
Wykes hath promisid to kepe the plase in yowr absens. Nevertheles whan
ye come set it in seche rewle as ye seme best and most suer, bothe for
Castre and Heylisdon if the werr hold. In cas ye have pees send me word.

As for that it is desyrid I shuld show my tytill and evydens to the
Dewk, me thynkyth he had evyll cowncell to entre in opon me, trusting I
shuld shew hym evydens. And [_if_] ye seme it may do yow god or eese,
lete my Lord of Norwich wet that the maner of Drayton was a marchants of
London callid Jon Heylisdon longe er any of the Polis that the seyd Dewk
comyth of wer borne to any lond in Norfolk or Suffolk; and if they wer
at that tyme born to no lond, how may the seyd Dewk klaym Drayton be
that pedegre? As for the seyd John Heylisdon, he was a por man born, and
from hym the seyd maner dessended to Alice his dowtyr, hos estat I have,
and I soppose the seyd Dewk comyth not of hem.

Item, as for the pedegre of the seyd Dewk, he is sone to William Pool,
Dewk of Suffolk, sone to Mychell Pool, Erl of Suffolk, sone to Mychel
Pool, the furst Erl of Suffolk of the Polis, mad be King Richard seth my
fader was born; and the seyd furst Mychell was sone to on William Pool
of Hull, whech was a wurchepfull man grow be fortwne of the werld. And
he was furst a marchant, and after a knygth, and after he was mad
baneret; and if any of thees hadde the maner of Drayton I will los
C_li._ so that any persone for the Dewk will be bond in as moch to prove
the contrary; and I wot weel the seyd Dewkis Cowncell wil not claym the
seyd maner be the tytill of the fader of the seyd William Pool. And what
the fader of the seyd William was, as be the pedegre mad in the seyd
last Dewkis fadirs daijs I know rygt weell; wherof I informyd Herry
Boteler to tell my old Lady of Suffolk, becawse he is of her cowncell;
and more will I not tell in thes mater, but if [_unless_] I be desyrid
or compellid.

Item, let my Lord of Norwich wete that it is not profitabe ner the comen
well of gentilmen that any jentilman shuld be compellid be an entre of a
lord to shew his evidens or tytill to his lond, ner I wil not begine
that example ne thralldam of gentilmen ner of other; it is god a lord
take sad cowncell, or he begyne any sech mater.

And as for the Pools that owth Drayton, if ther wer C. of hem levyng, as
ther is non, yet have they no tytill to the seyd maner. God kepe yow.
Wret the Satirday, &c.

  Yowr JON PASTON.

I pray yow be as mery with yowr felachep as ye kan.

Item, I send hom writt and prasens for yowr servaunts and myn.

Item, I may sell you woll for xl_d._ the ston, redi mony, as Arblaster
can tell yow, and malt for iiij_s._ the quarter at days xxj. for xx.
delivered of Yermouth mesur. If ye fayle mony ye most make it of yowr
wole or malt.

I send you hom writts of replevin for the shep and the horses that wer
take, and avise yow lete the writtis be delivered be fore my Lord of
Norwich, and god rekord; and if ye may make men with fors to take the
catell agey[n] be waran of replevyn, spar not rather than fayle.

  On the back of the letter is the following memorandum in a different

    be no difficulty in fixing the precise date, both of day and

    [Footnote 167.2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The MS. of this letter
    seems to be a draft in a hand like that of James Gresham. It is
    anonymous and without address. Even the writer is very uncertain.
    But it may not unlikely be a draft letter from Margaret Paston to
    some neighbour who, while the Duke of Suffolk was laying claim to
    Hellesden and Drayton, was not too mindful of John Paston's
    rights. Brandeston is about eleven miles from Norwich, eight miles
    beyond Drayton. Thomas Hoop was parson of Brandeston from 1448 to
    1475. He was presented to the living by Sir John Fastolf.]

_To my ryght worschipful husband, John Paston, be this delyverd in

[Sidenote: 1465 / AUG. 7]

Right wurchepfull husbond, I recomaund me to you. Please it you to wete
that I sent on Lammesse day[169.3] to Drayton, Thomas Bonde and Sir
James Gloys to hold the court in your name, and to clayme your tytill;
for I cowde gete none other body to kepe the court, ner that wuld go
theder but the seide Thomas Bonde, be cause I suppose thei were a ferd
of the pepill that shuld be there of the Duke of Suffolks parte. The
said Thomas and James, as the Duke of Suffolks men, that is to sey,
Harlesdon, the parson of Salle, Mayster Phillip and William Yelverton,
the which was styward, with a lx. persones or more be estymacion, and

byllys, comyn in to the maner yard to kepe the courte, met with them,
and told them that thei were comyn to kepe the court in your name, and
to clayme your titill. Wherfore the seid Harlesdon, with ought any mor
words or occasion yovyn of your men, comytted the seid Thomas Bonde to
the kepyng of the new Baly of Drayton, William Dokett, seyng that he
shuld go to my lord and do his herand hym self, notwithstandyng that Sir
James dede the erands to them, and had the words; wherfor thei toke the
seid Thomas with ought occasion. Thei wuld have mad the seid Thomas to
have had the words, and the seid James told hem that had hem, because he
was the more pesibill man, whan afterward thei bade avoyde, and sithen
led forth Thomas Bonde to Cossey, and bownde his armes be hynde hym with
whippe cord like a theffe, and shuld have led hym forth to the Duke of
Suffolk, ner had be that I had spokyn with the juges in the morwyn or
thei yede to the shirehous and enformed hem of such ryottes and
assaugthis as thei had mad up on me and my men; the baly of Cossey and
all the Duke of Suffolks councell beyng ther present, and all the lerned
men of Norffolk, and William Jenney and my[che] pepill of the contre;
the juge callyng the baly of Cossey befor them all, and yaffe hym a gret
rebuke, comaundyng the shereffe to se what pepill thei had gadred at
Drayton; which came after to Helesdon to se the pepill ther, with weche
[pe]pill he held hym wele content; and fro thens he rode to Drayton to
se ther pepill, which wer avoyded or he came. And ther he desired to
have delivered the seid Thom. Bonde to hym; and thei excusid hem and
seid thei had send hym to the Duke of Suffolk. Notwithstandyng,
afterward thei sent hym to Norwhich to hym, desiryng hym that he shuld
delivere hym not withought he mad a fyne, be cause he trobilled the
Kynges lete; for which thei mad l . . . . to juges. But after that I
understod it, I sent Danyell of Mershlond and Thomas Bonde[170.1] to
enforme the juges how the seide Thomas was entreted amonges hem, and so
he ded. And the juges were gretly . . . . . with the Dukes men, and
forwith comaunded the sheryf to delyver the seide Bone withoute any fyne
m[aking], seyng that he out non to make. And in goode feythe I founde
the juges ryght gentell and forborable to me in my matres,
notwithstandyng the Duckes councell had made her compleynt to them or I
come in ther werst wice, noysyng us of gret gatheryng of peopell and
many riotes thynges don be me and your men. And after I enformed the
juges of ther untrouthe and of ther gidyng, and of our gidyng in like
wice. And after the juges undrestod the trouthe he gave the baly of
Cossey befor me and many other a passyng gret rebuke, seyng without he
amended hes condicion and governaunce, thei wuld enforme the Kynge and
helpe that he schuld be punyschet. And wher as ye avyced me . . . . .
a felaschip to kepe the coorte at Drayton with easy cost, it was thought
be your councell it wer better otherwise, and not to gather no people,
for it was told me that the Dukes men had to the nombre of v. C. men,
and your councel avised me to gete a felischip to kepe my place at
Heylesdon, for it was told me that they schuld come and pulle me out of
the place, weche cauced me to kepe the place the strenger at that tyme.
And as for kepyng of any coort for you at Drayton, I can not wete how it
cowde be brought a boute withoute helpe of other but if there schuld
growe gret inconvenyence of it. And at the ass[izes] . . . . made gret
labor to endite your men, notwithstandyng it was letted. And as for the
writtes of replevyn, they were delyverd openly be for the juges to the
scheryf, and also other writtes wech Jamys Gresham brought; and aftre
that Ric. Calle spake with the high scheref for the servyng of hem. And
so he promysed to serve it and to send men of hes owne to serve it; and
so he sent ij. of his men with Ric. Lynsted, and with ij. of Scheperdes
to Cossey for the schepe. And ther they wer answer that Yelverton
cleymeth the properte, and so wer they answerd in all other places wher
as any catell was. And so they departed and come to the scheryf and
enformed hym; and I undrestande the scheryf taketh it for an answere;
notwithstandyng I send hym word withoute that Yelverton had ben ther in
hes owne persone he myte not cleyme the properte, and aviced hym to be
ware what retorne he made that he were not hurte by it. And so he hathe
made no retorne yet. What he wul doo I wat ner. He is stylle in this
contre yet and schal be this iiij. or v. dayes, but your councell
thynketh it were well don that ye gete an _allias_[172.1] and a
_pluries_ that it myght be sent don to the scheryf and than he can mak
non excuse but nedys . . . . .[172.2] it well (?) to make a retorne as
he wol abide by. I can not wete how the catell woll be goten ayen
withoute other processe be had more than we have yet.

Item, on Tuesday next comyng schal the sescions of the pees be at
Wolsyngham. What schal be do ther I wot not yet; for as for any
indytementes that we schuld labor a yenst them it is but wast werk; for
the scheryf ner the jerrours wol no thyng do ayenst them.

Item, wher as ye desire to knowe what gentelmen wolde do for you at this
tyme, in goode feythe I founde Herry Greye, Lomnor, Alblastre, Wer
. . . . (?), Berney of Redham, Skyppewith, and Danyell of Merchelond,
ryght weele disposed to you ward at this tyme in helpyng and in zevyng
ther goode avice to me for suche maters as I had to doo. Ye schal have
more pleyne undrestondyng of all thynges her after than I may write to
you at this tyme.

Item, the _supersedias_[172.3] and the _supplicavit_[172.3] is delyverd
to Alblastre and to Wechyngham, and they have mad out bothe warantes and
_supersedias_;[172.4] nevertheles ther is non servyd yet.

Item, I received the box with the writt and the letter that Berney sent
to me on Friday last and non er [_no earlier_].

Item, as for the pris of malte it is fallen here sore, for it is worthe

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[173.1]

_To my cosyn, Margaret Paston, at Heylisdonn._

[Sidenote: 1465 / AUG. 7]

I recomaund me to you. And as for the letter that I send yow touchyng
John Russe, I will that ye and your counsell see it openly; and kepe
this bille to your self or to some secret frend of yours. And I pray yow
remembir ij. thynges; on, if ye fynd hym in any maner wise disposed to
leve his bargeyn, take it at his offer, and take ayen the writyng that
he hath of that bargeyn, or a writyng of his owne hand of relesyng his
bargeyn to me; for peraventure at this tyme he woll be glad to leve his
bargeyn, as I undirstand, and whanne he sethe that I have peas he wolle
calle theron ayen. Wherfore I pray yow werk wisely herin, for he may in
no maner wise aske the money of me and kepe his bargeyn, for he hathe
divers tymes desired me to have take of hym more masse (?) therfore.
Another, as sone as ye may, or ye breke this mater with John Russe, make
due serche with the fermours at Akthorp what mony Russe hath reseyved
ther in my tyme, that is to sey, for Mighelmes the first, the ij., iij.,
iiij. yeres of Kyng E., of whech he hath reseyved ij. payments, that is
xij_li._ at the lest, or er the maner was trobelid by Jenney or
Yelverton. And I deme that he hath reseyvid some sithen, but that he
kepith counsell.

Item, for as moch as Sir Thomas Howes gaderid for the xxxix. yere of
Kyng Herry, the seid John Russe woll, under colour of that surmytte,
that he reseyvid in my tyme was therfore, wherfore ye must make a serche
what he hath reseyvid sith Sir John Fastolff dyed, and what tyme; and
therupon ye shall undirstand what he hath reseyvid for me, and what for
hym; and in case he hathe reseyvid xii_li._, and Richard hath payd hym
his dute as he promised, thanne growyth nat to John Russe past iiij. or
v_li._; notwithstanding fare fayre with hym and resonabilly, so that he
leve his bargeyn, and lend hym the remnaunt of the xx_li._ upon suerte
for xx_li._ He desireth to have outher his dewte or borowyng at this
tyme.

Item, he that shall speke with the fermours of Akthorp, whos name is
Langham, he must inquere generally what mony he hath payd to all men
sith Sir John Fastolff dyed, and see his billes of payment, and take
therof a titelyng. Ric. Calle hath a bille of parcellis of every mannes
ferme, and he can serche this best, in case he be not to favorabill to
John Russe, wherfore I remitte this to your discrecion; but I suppose
John Russe woll telle yow what he hath reseyvid for hand bifore this
tyme wretyn by his seying what he had reseyvid, and I suppose and he
remembird that he seid to me, he wold not aske his mony in this forme;
nevirthelesse it shall do good, so he leve his bargeyn by this meane.

I mervyll that I here no tidyngges from yow hough ye have do at the
assisses. The berer of this letter is a comon carier, and was at Norwich
on Satirday, and brought me lettirs from other men, but your servaunts
inquere nat diligently after the comyng of cariers and other men. Wretyn
at London the Wednesday next after Lammes day.

Ye shall have lettirs of me this weke.

  JOHN PASTON.

    [Footnote 173.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] It is sufficiently clear

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON AND OTHERS[174.1]

_To my mastresse, Margret Paston, James Gresham and Ric. Calle._

I recomaund me to yow, and have reseyvid ij. lettirs from John Russe,
wherin he remembirth me that I shuld owe hym xix_li._, or therupon, for
divers parcelles whech he seith he shuld have deliverid in to myn hows,
wherof he seith xiiij_li._ was deliverid in to myn howse ij. yere
g[oon], and that I had a bille deliverid me therof, and the remnaunt
sithen, and desireth of me payment of the seid xix_li._ Wherfore I
certi[fye] yow as I undirstand in the mater; ye may lete John Russe come
to yow and take such a direccion in the mater as reason and trought
woll. I lete yow wete that abought ij. yer goo the seid John Russe
deliverid me first a bille of the seid xiiij. [_li._], and I examined
the parcelles; and as I remembir xj_li._ was my dewte, wherof the
certeyn somme is writen in my blak book of foreyn reseytes that yere,
and the remnaunt was Ric. Calles dewte, wherof he was allowed, savyng
apart was Elys dewte. And as for the seid xj_li._, I offerid the seid
John Russe payment in hand at that tyme, and desired hym he shuld no
more send in to myn howse, and warnyd yow and Richard that ye shuld no
more stuffe take in to myn hows without ye peyd in hand, nowther of hym
ner of non other. And the seid John Russe prayd me to remembir that I
had grauntyd hym the maner of Akthorp in Leystoft, at a certeyn prise,
as it apperyd by writyng undir my seall, and desired me that I wold take
the seid somme in party of payment. And I told hym that as for such mony
that shuld com from hym for that lond, I wold take it of hym and ley it
up by the self, that I myght purchase other lond therwith, bicause I
wold lesse Fastolffs lyvelode for the college, but I wold pay hym his
dewte without any stoppage. And he thanne desired me to take that same
xj_li._, and ley it up to the same use, seying to me that it was as good
to do so as I for to take it hym, and he to take it me ayen. And thus he
and I agreed, and departed, and thanne he prayd me to take more chafar
of hym, whech I denyed. And nough I merveyll what shuld cause hym to
aske mony for that dewte; neverthelesse I deme he supposith that he coud
not opteyne his bargeyn by me, bicause of the trobill that it standyth
in; and for that or for some other cause he repentyth his bargeyn and
woll nomore of it. Wherfore send for hym, and take James Gresham or some
of your frends and Richard Calle, and fele what he menyth; and if ye can
fynd hym disposed to leve his bargeyn yet, though I myght kepe stille
the seid mony I wold he shuld not lese therby. Nevirthelesse if he woll
refuse his bargeyn, thanne take ayen the writyng that he hath of that
bargeyn and a writyng of his hand that he dischargyth me of the graunt
that I mad hym of that same bargeyn. And thanne loke that ye enquere
what mony he hath reseyvid of the seid maner in my tyme, wherof the
ferme is vj_li._ yerly whech I suffird hym to occupie to his owne use by
fors of the seid bargeyn all my tyme; and aftir the parcellis cast what
I have had of hym; abbate therof the mony that he hath reseyvid of the
seid maner, and also as moch of the xiiij_li._ as the seid Ric. Calle
and Elys owen, wher of he is alowid; and thanne see that the seid John
Russe be content of the remnaunt of his parcellis that is dew by me, but
loke ye pay non other mennes dewtes.

Also the seid John Russe writyth in his lettir that rather thanne he
shuld fayle this mony that I wold lend hym asmoch to pay ayen at
Cristemasse; wherfore, if he leve his bargeyn I woll ye lend hym asmoch
mony over his dewte as shall make up xx_li._, takyng of hym suerte to
pay ayen at Cristemasse, as he writyth; in case be that he will kepe
stille his bargeyn, thanne ye may answere hym it is no reason that he
shuld aske me any part of that mony ayen, for he owyth that and moch
more.

Item, the seyd John Rus sent me heder a man for this mater only with in
thes ij. daijs. Wherfor let him know an ansue letyng (?) for I fel well
(?) he hath mad agret bargen but late, wherfor he hath mor nede of mony
now, and I wol do for hym that I may resonably. Nevertheles his wryting
merveylith me that he askith thes mony as dewte, wheche he toke me for
parte of my payment. I deme it comith not all of his owne disposicion.
Inquier ye that ye can what it menith. God kepe yow. Wret the Wednisday
nex Lammes.

  Yowr JOHN PASTON.

In cas ye han Drayton in any quiete take sewertie of yowr tenants for
paiment as I have wret befor.

JOHN ESTGATE TO ----[177.1]

[Sidenote: 1465]

Ser, ze sent to me a letter conteynyng the substaunce of the processe
off Mr. Robert Ippyswell for the mater off the codicill of Nicholas
Pykeryng, &c. Me mervelyt gretly off the certificat off Mr. Robert in
that be halve, for this is the truthe as forth forth as I kan remembre
me. The codicill had nether day nor place lymyte, qwer or qwan it xuld a

nor place it had be gret foly, &c. Therfor I askyd off the juge hys
accounts, and specyally the deposicionys and attestacionys off the
wytteness that wer swor in the seyd codicill, &c.; by the qwyche it
mowth appere clerly qwan and qwere this codicill xuld a be made and
wrete. And this sen I mad protestacion to for the seyde Mr. Robert that
I wolde impugne the mater as lawe requiryd. The qwych peticion I made
diverse tyme to fore moche recorde, judicialy syttyng the seyde
M. R.,[177.2] &c. The qwyche peticion he wold not her, but seyde
expresse that nether Will. Pykeryng nor non other man xuld sen his
accounts nor knowe qwat the deposicion wer in that parte; this mater was
comownyd to for Mr. John Selet and my mayster and yours diverse tymys,
and ever he seyde we xuld not sen the seyde deposicions. And so qwat sum
ever he hath certyfyid, this is the truthe, God to wetenesse and all
Seynts, qwo preserve zow evermore.

And I pray zow to declare this to my mayster and zours; and comende me
hertly to hys good maysterchep. And God sende hym victorye off all hys
elmyes, and so pray all hys well wyllers at Norwich.

    [Footnote 178.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] From the contents of the
    preceding letter it is probable that this document was drawn up in
    1465. Blomefield, indeed, states (vol. ii. p. 221) that Nicholas
    Pickering was buried in the steeple of Filby church in 1466. But
    the date may be an error, for he certainly seems to have been dead
    in or before 1465.]

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[179.1]

_To my ryght wyrshypfull mayster, John Paston, be thys letter delyveryd
in haste._

[Sidenote: 1465 / AUG. 18]

Ryght wyrshypfull husbond, I recomaund me to you. Please it you to wyte
that the cause that I wrote to you non er [_earlier_] than I dyde after

As for the hygh shyrf [_sheriff_] he demenyd hym ryght well her to me,
and he sayd to me, as for replevyns he wold aske counseyll of lernyd men

for the replevyns Richard Calle sayth he hath send you a awnswere of
hem, and also the copys of them.

    [Footnote 179.1: [From Fenn, iii. 370.] That this letter was
    written in the year 1465 appears clearly by the reference to the
    Assizes held at Walsingham (_see_ No. 599), and the intention
    which the writer intimates of visiting her husband in London.
    Moreover, the first sentence of the letter, and also the
    postscript, are evidently written in answer to her husband's
    complaint in No. 600, that she had not written to him what she had
    done at the Assizes.]

In the Introduction in Volume I., will be found a document entitled
'A remembrance of the worshipful kin and ancestry of Paston, born in
Paston in Gemyngham Soken.' This paper, which was printed in the preface
to vol. v. of the original edition, p. xliv., appears to have been
composed during the lifetime of John Paston by some one who owed the
family no good will, not unlikely by Sir William Yelverton. The contents
agree very well with the imputation made on John Paston, for which he
was imprisoned in 1465, that he was a bondman to the King. The original
of this document I have not met with.

ABSTRACT[181.1]

EXAMINATIONS TOUCHING FASTOLF'S WILL

[Sidenote: 1465 / AUG.]

John Paston examined by a commission of Thomas, Archbishop of
Canterbury, addressed to John Druell, LL.D., in the cause between Sir
William Yelverton, Knight, and William Worcester, pretensed executors of
Sir John Fastolf, and John Paston, Esq., and Thomas Howys, executors, as
is said, dated 8 July 1465.

1. Whether Sir John Fastolf made his will, dated 14 June 1459, in
English, and sealed by him with his seal of arms? Answer. He made a note
of articles in his will, deponent thinks in Latin, probably on that day,
but it was not then sealed, and no executor was named.

2. Whether before the will was fair copied an original note of it was
made on paper, and corrected and interlined by Paston? And whether that
note fair copied was the true will which was sealed by Fastolf?--There
was such a note, which being made, Paston went to London and waited some
time, when William Worcester informed him it had been fair copied in the
beginning of July. Had seen an old will long before, in which some of
the articles were the same, but Fastolf altered them from time to time
in consultations held with this deponent. Does not know if he did
interline, but the note will show, which was then in the keeping of
William Worcester, Fastolf's clerk; nor does he know if the will was
drawn up from it, as he was not present at the engrossing or sealing,
but hears there were several things altered.

3. Where the will is, in whose custody, and whether he have power to
execute it?--The parchment sealed by Fastolf, which Worcester says was
his will, was kept some time after his death at Caister, and afterwards
produced in audience of the Archbishop, and there remains.

28 Aug. Examined in the Fleet.--Said he was a prisoner, wished first to
speak with his counsel, and desired another notary joined with Nicholas
Parker, who was not indifferent.

10, 11, 12 Dec. Appeared before the commissary in the treasurer's house
of St. Paul's Cathedral, London. Examination continued.

4. Whether the said will was kept in the tower called the treasury of
Sir John Fastolf at Caister till his death, and whether Paston and Howys
afterwards entered and took it, and what was then done with it? Whether,
since Fastolf's death it was exemplified in Latin, and sealed with
Fastolf's seal, and by whom? And whether the Latin contained more or
less than the English? Who exhibited the English will in audience of
Canterbury? Was it the true will, or was it written and sealed after
Fastolf's death?--Soon after Fastolf's death the said parchment was
exhibited to Paston by Howes and Worcester. It afterwards remained in
the keeping of Howes and Paston, and has since been exhibited in the
audience of Canterbury. It was not translated into Latin after Fastolf's
death, nor sealed, to Paston's knowledge. Does not know any will, Latin
or English, to have been sealed after Fastolf's death.

5. Whether Paston exhibited any English will sealed in the audience of
Canterbury?--The note made in June contained an article relative to
Fastolf's college, and lands in Norfolk and Suffolk granted
conditionally on their being refused by Paston. When Paston went to
London, and after a time Worcester came to him, Worcester told him this
note was put in parchment and sealed, with the other articles, by advice
of Master John Brakley, about the beginning of July. William Bukman, now
Abbot of Wymondham, then Prior of Yarmouth, was present when it was
sealed, and named as a witness. He and Thomas Ingham reported that
Fastolf told them at the time it was his will that Paston should have
those things he had granted at the time of the seisin of the said
feoffment delivered, whatever was written in the parchment. The said
parchment (English) remains in the court. As to the Latin, Fastolf made
on paper a schedule of executors for the Latin parchment, and told
Paston and Howys that he did not mean all the executors to have
administration of his goods. He also told Paston, Bracley, and Clement
Felmyngham, after Paston returned from London, that he was informed the
Latin will gave equal powers to all the executors, which he never
intended. Fastolf made his last will in November, not altogether the
same.

6. Who kept Fastolf's seal of arms and signet after his death, how long
did it remain whole, and how many writings did Paston seal with
them?--At Fastolf's death his seal was in a purse sealed with his
signet, and placed in a chest. The signet was on his finger at death,
but was afterwards placed in the chest in presence of deponent and
Thomas Howys, Master John Bracley, Master Clement Felmyngham, and three
servants of Fastolf's chamber, and sealed with the seals of deponent,
Howys, and others. The chest remained in Fastolf's chamber, sometimes in
custody of his servants, and sometimes in that of Howys. Afterwards the
seals were placed in a white box sealed in the presence of divers men in
the hall of the manor, which box was delivered along with certain rings
to John Stokys, who opened the box, and after inspecting the seals and
rings, sealed it up again and delivered it to Roger Malmesbury, in whose
custody they now remain. This deponent sealed nothing with them.

7. Whether, after Fastolf's death, Paston or any other wrote on a
schedule of paper a certain grant or bargain, viz., that Paston should
have Fastolf's lands and tenements in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Norwich, for
4000 marks, and that Paston and Howys should have sole administration of
his goods so long as Paston was alive; and whether after Fastolf's death
it was so recently written that Paston, to dry the writing, scattered
ashes over it? And if he say it was written during Fastolf's life, by
whom was it written? By himself, or John Russe, or Friar Brakley, or
whom? And how long before Fastolf's death, and in whose presence? And
whether that sum was specified in the schedule or a blank left for it?
And whether the contents of this schedule were extracted and put in a
new one? and by whom was that written? Whether by J. Russe? And what
time elapsed between the two writings? And whether the second schedule
contained more than the first, and what the additional matter was, and
by whom added? And whether this asserted will of Fastolf, made, as
Paston pretends, on Saturday, 3 Nov. 1459, was extracted or imagined
from the contents of the said bills, or either of them? And what was the
matter in the said will added to the matters in the schedules? And how
long it was before the said pretended will could be formed to the
satisfaction of John Paston?

For two years before his death Fastolf had granted that Paston should
have the above lands after his death, without any condition, but for the
purpose that he should found a college at Caister of seven monks or
priests, and pay 5000 marks to be distributed for the soul of Sir John
Fastolf; and about that time he enfeoffed Paston and others in the said
lands, declaring that that enfeoffment was to the use of the said Sir
John for life, and afterwards of Paston. After this, viz., in the said
month of June, Fastolf made the said articles in certain paper notes in
Latin and English. Master John Brakley kept copies, which he showed to
Paston after his return to London. After that, viz., in September and
October, Fastolf several times requested Paston to engross the
agreements made between them about the college, saying he would remit to
him 1000 marks of the said 5000 marks. And in October and November he
recited in certain writings that in order that he might not be
disquieted with worldly affairs he had bargained with this deponent that
he should have the control of all his lands from which any profit might
be derived in England, and of the households and foreign expenses
belonging to him, so that he should put aside as much of his dues as he
could spare for the college; and that he should have all his lands in
Norfolk, Suffolk, and Norwich, for 4000 marks, which he was to pay on
certain stated days to Fastolf's executors for the benefit of his soul.
Two paper writings were made of the premises, one by the hand of Paston
and the other by Mr. John Brakley, which are severally remaining with
them. This agreement Brakley, by Fastolf's order, got written out in
parchment indented, and read to Fastolf, who sealed it in his presence
as Brakley reported to Paston. Afterwards, another of the said writings
was read to Fastolf in the presence of Paston, Brakley, Mr. Clement
Felmyngham, and others, several times in October and November. Comments
were made on the reading of it by Fastolf on one occasion, when he said
a certain clause was not consistent with his intention, which was that
Paston and Howys should be sole administrators of his goods, and that as
to his lands in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Norwich, and the college to be
founded, he would dispose of them according to his agreement with
Paston,--the master to have a stipend of L10, and each of the fellows of
10 marks, and that seven poor men should be found with 40s. a year each,
as stated in the will. Fastolf desired his will dated in June to be
corrected in these particulars, and written anew by Walter Shipdam, for
whom he frequently sent on this business. Meanwhile Brakley and Paston
wrote another paper in English as a memorial of Fastolf's intention, of
which deponent delivered a copy under his own hand in Court. The last
two lines this deponent wrote and dried with ashes in presence of Thomas
Howys. The will of 14 June and that exhibited by Paston and Howys differ
little or nothing in effect, except in these articles touching the
college, and the sole administration given to Paston and Howys.

As to new writings after Fastolf's death. Brakley translated those words
about the sole administration from English into Latin, partly before his
death and partly after. After Fastolf's death Paston, Howys, and Brakley
caused the said Walter Shipdam to put into form (_fecerunt dictum W. S.
formare_) the last will and testament of the said Fastolf, both of the
said college and of the said single administration (_de dicta singulari
administratione_), and of other things in the will of June not contrary
to his last will and declaration, of which several writings were drawn
by Shipdam, first in paper and afterwards in parchment. As to the
writing of the agreements, Brakley kept it during Fastolf's whole life,
and a year after, and a copy remained with this deponent after Fastolf's
death; at which time deponent and Howys were sitting in the hall of the
manor of Caister at supper when William Worcester came into the hall,
and Paston and Howys, rising from supper, had a talk with Clement
Felmyngham, John Brakley, and William Worcester, immediately after
Fastolf's death. At that time, by the advice of Brakley, a copy of the
agreement was delivered to William Worcester, at his request, folded up
and sealed that night by Brakley, Clement Felmyngham, and Howys. It
remained in Worcester's keeping till he rode to London, and then he left
it with the said Master John Brakley, Clement Felmyngham, and Thomas
Howys. Its tenor was transcribed on parchment by Shipdam shortly
afterwards.

Item, as for the mater of the ix.^{xx.}_li._ askyd by my Lady of
Bedford[188.3] for the maner of Westthirrok, where as Sir Thomas Howes
saith that he hath no wrytyng therof, but that Sir John Fastolf
purchased the seid maner, and payd serteyn money in ernest, and
aftirward graunted his bargeyn to the Duc of Bedford, and so the money
that he toke was for the mony that he had payd. Peraventure Sir Thomas
hath writyng therof, and knowyth it not; for if ther be any such mony
payd upon any bargeyn he shall fynd it in Kyrtlyngs bocks that was Sir
John Fastolfs reseyver, and it was abought such tyme as the Duc of
Bedford was last in Inglond, whech, as it is told me, was the viij. yere
of Kyng Herry the fift, or the viij. yere of Kyng Herry the sext, and
the somme that he payd for the seid bargeyn was CCC. marks. Also he
shall fynd, the xxij. yere of Kyng Herry or ther abought, in the acompts
of on of Fastolfs Reseyvors at London, that ther was take of Sir Thomas
Tyrell, and of the Duchesse of Excestre,[189.1] that was wif to Sir

  For upon trust of Calles promise, we may soon onthryve;
  And, if Calle bryng us hedir xx_li._,

  Or ellis, if he woll not pay yow the valew of the peses, there

  No more to you at this tyme,
  But God hym save that mad this ryme.
  Wret the      of Sent Mathe,[190.6]
  Be yowr trew and trustie husband, J. P.

    [Footnote 188.1: [From Fenn, iv. 90.] From the mention of 'this
    cold winter' at the beginning of this letter we might naturally
    suppose that the feast 'of Sent Mathe,' on or about which it was
    written, was that of St. Matthias, which occurs on the 24th of
    February. But we believe the day of St. Matthew to have been
    intended, so that the expression must have had reference to some
    unusually cold weather in September. It is clear from the contents
    of the letter that Margaret Paston had recently been with her
    husband in London, and had just left him in company with Richard
    Calle on her return towards Norfolk. Letters for her and Richard
    Calle had arrived from her two sons since they departed. Now the
    only time, so far as I can find, that Margaret Paston ever visited
    her husband in London--at all events when her sons were grown
    up--was in September 1465; and on that occasion Calle was with
    her, and everything else agrees. Indeed, no one can doubt that the
    latter portion of the letter immediately following was written in
    answer to this letter.]

    [Footnote 188.2: Worsted is a small market-town in the most east
    part of the county of Norfolk, formerly famous for the manufacture
    of those stuffs which still bear its name, and of which, for the
    worship of Norfolk, J. Paston desired his doublet to be made.--F.]

    [Footnote 188.3: Jaquetta, daughter of Peter of Luxembourg, Earl
    of Saint Pol, was the second wife of John, Duke of Bedford, the
    Regent of France during Henry VI.'s minority. She was married to
    him in 1433, and after his decease, in 1435, she became the wife
    of Sir Richard Wydvile, and died in 1472.]

    [Footnote 189.1: Anne, eldest daughter of John Montacute, third
    Earl of Salisbury, married, 1st, Sir Richard Hankford, Knight;
    2ndly, Sir Lewis John, Knight (whose will was proved in 1442); and
    3rdly, John Holland, who was created Duke of Exeter 6th January
    1443, and died in 1446. Fenn erroneously supposed the lady to have
    been the widow of Thomas Beaufort, a previous Duke of Exeter, who
    died in 1426. This Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, married Margaret,
    daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Nevill, but his wife did not
    survive him, as Fenn supposed, for at his death he was found to
    have been tenant of her lands for life by the law of England.
    Fenn's note on this passage is, however, so interesting that we
    must quote a part of it. Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, was buried in
    the Abbey of Bury St. Edmunds. 'On digging,' he says, 'amongst the
    ruins of this Abbey, the body of the Duke was found, on the 20th
    of February 1772, wrapt in lead, and entire. The face, hair, and
    every part were perfect, and the flesh solid, but being exposed to
    the air, the body soon became offensive . . . . . I procured some
    of the hair, which was of a fine brown colour, and very
    flexible.']

    Rivers of Grafton, in Northamptonshire, and elected a Knight of
    the Garter. His daughter Elizabeth afterwards became the Queen of

    Rivers. He was seized by the Lancaster mutineers, and beheaded at
    Banbury in 1469.--F.]

[Sidenote: 1465 / SEPT. 27]

Ryght wourchipful husbonde, I recomaunde me to yow, dyssyryng hertely to
here of yowr welfare, thankyng yow of yowr grett chere that ye made me,
and of the coste that ye dede on me. Ye dede more cost thanne my wylle
was that ye choulde do, but that it plesyd yow to do so, God gyf me
grase to do that may plese yow. Plesyt yow to wet that on Fryday after
myn departyng frome yow I was at Sudbury and spake with the schreve, and
Ric. Calle toke hym the ij. writts, and he brake them, and Ric. hathe
the copes of them;

[Sidenote: Vic. Norfolk pro ovibus.]

and he seyde he wolde send the writts to hys undre-schryf and a leter
therwyth, chargyng hym that he schowlde do ther ine as largely as he owt

[Sidenote: Answer of the writts and of the replevyn.]

And I and Ric. informyd hym of the demenyng of hys undrchryf, how
parciall he hade be with the other partye, bothe in that mater, and also
for the accionnys beyng in the scher; and he was nothyng wel plesyd of
the demenyng of hys undreschef, and he hat wretyn to hym that he choulde
be indeferent for bothe partyes acordyng to the lawe, bothe for that
materys and for alle other. What the undreschryf wylle do therin I wot
ner, for he is not yet spokyn with.

[Sidenote: Margareta Paston intravit manerium Cotton die Dominica
proxima ante festum Michaelis.]

Item, as for Cotton, I entryd in to the plase as on Sunday last was, and
ther I abode tyll un Wednysday last pasyd. I have left ther John Paston
the yonger, Wykes, and other xij. men for to receive the profyttes of
the maner; and ayenst the day of kepyng of the corte, I hope ther shall
be more to streynkyth them, yf it nede. John Paston hath be with my
lorde of Norfolk seyth [_since_] we entryd, and dyssyryd his good
lorchyp to streynth hym with hys howsolde men and other yf nede be; and
he hath promysyd he would do so.

[Sidenote: I thank yow of your demenyng at Cotton.]

And I sent Ric. Calle on Tusday to Knevett, dysyryng hym that he woulde
sende to hys baley and tenaunts at Mendlesham, that thei choulde be redy
to come to John Paston whan he sent for them; and he sent a man of his
forthwith, chargyng them in aney wyse that they choulde do so.

[Sidenote: Remembir Nakton.]

And he sent me wourde be Ric. and hys sonne also, yf wee were not
stronge inough, that owther he or hys sonne, or bothe yf nede were,
would come with suche feleschipp as they coude gett abowt them, and that
thei woulde do as feythfully as they kowde for yow, bothe in that mater
and in alle other.

Item, on Saterday last was, Jenney ded warne a corte at Calcotte to be
holde ther in hys name as on Tusday last was, and Debenham de[d] charge
another court ther the Sunday next after to be holde ther the same
Tusday in hys name. And Daubeney had knowleche ther of, and he dede send
on Sunday at nyght to yowr elder sonne, for to have some men fro thens;
and so he sent Wykes and Bernay to hym on Monday in the mornyng.

[Sidenote: Mokenge of Jenney and Debenham at Calcotes the Tuisday next
bifore Sen Migchell.]

And assone as thei were come to Castre thei sent for men ther in the
contre, and so they gett them in to a iij.^xx. men; and Daubeney and
Wekes and Bernay rod to Calcott the same Munday at nyght with ther
felechyp, and ther kept them prevye in the pl[a]se, so that non of alle
the tenaunts kneue them ther, saf Rysyngs wyff and her howsolde, tylle
the Theusday at x. of the cloke.

[Sidenote: Now your cost is doon, consideryng your frends be corayges
and your enemyes discoraged, gadir up the profits in all goodly hast,
and that I may see acompt for this trobill tyme.]

And than Sir Thomas Brews, Debunham the fadre,[192.1] and the knyt hys
sonne,[192.2] Jenney, Mykelfylde younger, Jermyn, and younge Jernyngham,
and the Baley of Motforde, with other to the noumbre of a iij.^xx.
persones, coum fro the sessionnys at Becklys, the whech thei hade keppt
ther on the day byfor, coume to Seynt Olevys, and ther thei teryed and
dynyd. And whan thei had dynyd, Sir Gylberde Debenham came to Calcott
with xx. hors for to wett what felechipp ther was in the plase. And than
Wekes aspyed them commyng; and he and Bernay and ij. with them rode owt
to a' spoke with them. And whan Sir Gilberd aspyd them comyng, he and
his felechipp flede and rode ayen to Seynt Olovys. And than they sent
young Jernyngham and the Baley of Mottforde to yowr men lettyng hem wete
that the Justice of the Pese wer coum doune with Debunham and Jenney, to
se that the pese choulde be kepte, and that thei choulde entre and kepe
the courte in pesible wyse. And yowr men answeryd and seyd that they
knewe no man was possessyd ther in, ner hade no ryght therin but ye, and
so in your name, and in your ryght they seyd they woulde kepyt. And so
they yede ayen with thys answer, and wer put fromme ther purp[o]se that
day. And all the tenaunts bestes wer put fro Calcalcott[193.1] fee, and
challe be tylle other remedy maye be hadde. Yowr men woulde not kepe
ther a cort that daye by cause it was warnyd by the tother parte, but we
wyl do warne a corte and kepyt, I hope in hast. Ye wyll laugh for to

of other materys.

[Sidenote: Cessiones Norwici et Dunwici Martis proximo post festum
Michelis.]

It is tolde me the sessionys choulle be her at Norwiche on Tusday next
comyng, and in Suffolk the Sessionys challe be the same Tusday owther at
Dounwyche or at Ypswyche. I suppose ther challe be labowr ayenst soume
of our folks ther, but we cholle assay to lete ther pourpose yf we maye.

[Sidenote: De prudencia custodiendi Heylesdon.]

It is tolde me yf ther hade no folks a' be left here in thys plase whyll
I have be owt, they choulde a' be neue masters her by thys tyme; therfor
it is not good to leve it alone yett.

[Sidenote: Tenentes comitis Oxoniae pro custodia Cotton.]

Item, Arblaster hathe sent a letter to myn Lorde of Oxenefords tenaunts
that be nerrest abowt Cotton to help John Paston yf they be sent to, &c.

[Sidenote: Episcopus Norwici pro ecclesia de Drayton.]

Item, I was thys daye with myn Lorde of Norwyche at Thorppe, and
informyd hym of the demenyng of the mater for Drayton chyrche, and of
alle the demenyng and parcialte of Master John Solatt and Ypswell; and
also I informyd what disposission that they were of that were upon the
quest.

[Sidenote: Lete yowr counsell comone with hym, but thei may sey they
knowe not myn evidens nor titell,]

And in good feyth me thynkyth by hym that he is ryght ille plesyd that
the mater was so gydyt. He seyde to me ryght pleynly that the Jugis dede
not therin as thei owght to do, and he seyd thowe I hadde hade noo
councell, the he howght of ryght to have assyngyd me councell suche as I
hadde dyssyrid; but he seyde he wyst well he dede in that mater as he
have do in other materys byfor. Me thynkyth by suche thynges I harde
ther that the seyd Master John ner the tother is not grettly in conseyt
at thys tyme; and so tolde me Aschefylde in councell.

[Sidenote: ner have no mor to do by my writynge that I sent yow thanne
to avyse hough I shall take myn accion, and that in that accion I have
as good titell as my Lord of Norwich hath to the chirch of Thorp.]

What the cause was he myght have no leyser to telle me. I mevyd my lorde
in the mater acordyng to the intent of yowr wrytyng yf aney axcion wer
take; and he seyd feythefully yf it myght prevayle yow, he woulde with
ryght good wylle that it choulde be doo; and ellys he woulde not in noo
wyse that it choulde be doo. And he dyssyryde me to sende to hym suche

for he seyd he woulde not ye choulde take non axcion therin withowt it
myght provayle. He was well payed that I tolde hym that ye woulde not do
therin withowt hys knowleche and assent; and he seyd he woulde do therin

It is tolde me that Sir Thomas wyll ressyng Mautby chyrche, and yf it
plesyd yow to geve it to on Sir Thomas Lyndis, I truste verely that ye

_To my ryght worschipfull husbond, John Paston, in haste._

[Sidenote: To get a copy [of] that he hath . . hed; notwithstandyng [I]

Item, it was tolde me thys day that Master John Salatt hathe made a
serge in the regestre this monethe aftre the wylles and testements or
suche as hought the maners of Heylesdon and Drayton this c. yere, and be
that hathe they founde suche evidence as schal be gret strenghthyng to
the Duks tittle, as it is seide. I undrestonde verely that Mastre John
Salet is all on that partye, and no thyng with you.

Item, as for the bill that ye sent to Sir Thomas Howys touchyng on
Edmond Carvyll and on Fraunces, I wote ner whether he had hem or nought,
for he is not spoken with yett in the maters. As wee spede owr materys,

    As it refers to Paston's dispute with the Duke of Suffolk about
    the manors of Hellesden and Drayton, it must belong to the year
    1465. The reader will also perceive that it contains an allusion
    to John Paston's imprisonment in the Fleet, and to my Lord Percy,

SIR JOHN PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[196.1]

    [Footnote 196.1: [MS. in Pembroke College, Cambridge.] This

SIR JOHN PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[197.1]

_To my ryth reverrend and worchepfull fadre, John Paston, be thys
delyveryd._

[Sidenote: 1465 / OCT. 3]

Aftyr all humbyll and most due recomendacion, as lowly as I can,
I beseche yow of your blyssyng. Plesyt yow to have knowlege that as on
Sonday next be for Myhelmas Day, as my modyr came fro London ward, sche
cam homward by Cotton, and sche sent for me to Heylysdon to come to hyr
thedyr, and so I have ben in the plase ever sethyn. And as sone as
Myhelmas Day was past, I begane to dystreyne the tenants, and gadryd
some syllvyr, as myche, I trowe, as wyll pay for our costs; and yet I
cepe here ryth a good felawschep, and mor wer promysyd me, whyche that
came not to me, wherby I was ner deseyvyd. For when Debnam herd sey how
that I began to gadyr sylvyr, he reysyd many men with in j. daye and an
halfe, to the nombyr of iij^c. men, as I was credebly assartaynyed by a
yeman of the chambyr of my Lordys[198.1] that owythe me good wyll, whech
yeman, as sone as he had sene ther felauschep, rod streyth to my Lord
and informyd hym of it; and also he informyd my Lord how that I had
gadryd a nothyr gret felashschep, whyche felawschep he namyd more than
we wer by j^c. and an halfe and yett more. And he seyd on to my Lord and
my Lady, and to their consell, that with owt that my Lord took a
dyrectyon in the mater, that ther wer leek to be do gret harme on bothe
oure pertyes, wheche wer a gret dysworchep to my Lord, consederyng how
that he takyth us bothe for hys men, and so we be knowyn well inow. Upon
whyche informacion, and dysworchep to my Lord, that tweyn of hys men
schold debat so ner hym, contrary to the Kyngs pese, consedryd of my
Lord and my Lady and ther cownsell, my Lord sent for me and Syr Gylberd
Debnam to come to hym to Framlyngham bothe, and as it fortunyd well my
modyr come to me to Cotton not half an owyr be for that the mesenger
came to me fro my Lord, wheche was late upon Twysday last past at nyth;
and the next day on the mornyng I rod to my Lord to Framlyngham, and so
ded Syr Gylberd also. And as sone as we wer come, we wer sent for to
come to my Lord, and when we come to my Lord, he desiyryd of us bothe
that we schold neythyrthyr gadyr no felawschep, but syche men as we had
gadryd that we schold send hem home a yen, and that the coort schold be
contenuyd in to the tyme that my Lord, or suche as he wold asyngne, had
spok bothe with yow and Yelverton and Jenney, and that on indeferent man
chosyn by us bothe schold be assynyd to kepe the plase in to the tyme
that ye and they wer spook with.

And then I answed my Lord, and seyd how that at that tyme I had my
maistyr within the maner of Cotton, whyche was my modyr, and in to the
tyme that I had spook with hyr I cowd geve none answer; and so my Lord
sent Rychord Fulmerston, berer hereof, to my modyr thys day for an
answer, whyche answer he schold bryng to my Lord to London, for my Lord
rod to Londons word as yesterday, and the soner be cause he trustyd to
have a good end of this mater and alle othyr be twyx yow, whyche he
takyth for a gret worchep to hym, and a gret avantage bothe, and he cowd
bryng this mater abowt, for then he wold trust to have your servyse,
alle whyche wer to hym gret tresour and avantage.

And this was the answer that my modyr and I gave hym, that at the
instans of my Lord and my Ladye we wold do thus myche as for to put the
coort in contenuans, and no more to receyve of the profyts of the maner
than we had, and had dystresid for tyll in to the tym that sche and I
had werd ayen fro my Lord and yow, if so wer that they wold neythyr mak
entreys nor dystreyn the tenantys, nor chepe no coort mor then we wold
do. And we told Rychord Fulmerston that thys my modyr and I ded at the
instans and gret request of my Lord, be cause my Lord intendyd pes,
whyche resonably we wold not be ayenst, and yet we seyd we knew well
that we schold have no thank of yow when ye knew of it, with owt it wer
be cause we ded it at my Lordys instans. But be for thys answer we had
receyvyd as myche sylvyr full ner as Rychord Calle sent us bokys of for
to gadyryt bye; and as for the possessyon of the plase, we told hym that
we wold kepe it, and Syr Gylberd agreyd, so that Yelverton and Jeney
would do the same; for it was tyme for hym to sey so, for my Lord told
hym that he wold hym fast by the feet ellys, to be suyr of hym, that he
schold make non insurreccions in to the tyme that my Lord came ayen fro
London.

I wene, and so dothe my modyr bothe, that thys appoyntment was mad in
good tyme; for I was deseyvyd of bettyr than an C. men and an halfe that
I had promyse of to have come to me when I sent for hem. Thys promes had
I befor that I sent to yow the last lettyr the daye aftyr Seynt Myhell.
Jenney herd seye that I cepyd Cotton, and he rod to Nacton, and ther
held a cort and receyvyd the profytys of the maner.

I beseche yow that I may have knowlage in hast fro yow ye wyll that I be
demenyd in thys mater and in al othyr, and I schal aplye me to fulfyll
your intent in them to my power by the grace of God, whom I beseche have
yow in guydyng, and sende yow yowyr herts desyir. Wretyn at Hemnalle
Halle, in Cotton, the Thursday next befor Seynt Feythe.

My modyr recomandyth her to yow, and preyith yow to hold hyr excusyd
that sche wrytyth not to yow at thys tyme, for sche may have no leyser.
The berer her of schall informe yow whedyr Jeney wyll agre to thys
appoyntment or not. I thynk he dar do non othyr wyse.

    Inquisitions _post mortem_, 1 Edward IV., No. 46, that John, his
    son and successor in the title, was seventeen years old on St.
    Luke's Day (18th October) in that year. He must therefore have
    been born on the 18th October 1444, and would have been of full
    age on Friday, 18th October 1465. The John Paston, Esq., to whom
    this letter was addressed, must have been the youngest of that

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[204.1]

[Sidenote: 1465 / OCT. 17]

On Tuesday in the morwyn whas John Botiller, otherwyse callid John
Palmer, and Davy Arnald your cook, and William Malthows of Aylsham,
takyn at Heylesdon be the balyf of Ey callid Bottisforth, and led for to
Cossey, and ther thei kepe hem yet with ought any warant or autoryte of
Justice of Peas. And thei saye thei will carie hem forth to Ey preson,
and as many as thei may gete more of your men and tenaunts, that thei
may know that owe yow good wyll or hath be to you ward, thei be thret to
be slayn or presoned. The Duke came to Norwich[204.2] on Tuesday at x.
of clok with the nombre of v. hundred men. And he sent after the Meyr
and Alderman with the Sherefs desiryng hem in the Kyngs name that thei
shuld take an enqueraunce of the constablys of every ward with in the
cyte what men shuld a go on your party to have holpyn or socowryd your
men at any tyme of thes gaderyngs, and if any thei cowde fynde, that
thei shuld take and arest hym and correct hym, and also certifie hym the
names on Wyndenesse day [_Wednesday_] be viij. of clok. Which the Meyr
dede, and wull do anythyng that he may for hym and his. And her up on
the Meyr hath arestid on that was with me callid Roberd Lovegold,
braser, and threte hym that he shall be hanged be the nek; wherfor I
wuld that ther myght come down a writ to remeve hym if ye thynk it be to
do. He was not with me not save that Harleston and other mad the
assaught up on me and Lammesse; he is right good and feythfull on to
you, and therfore I wuld he had help. I have non man at this tyme to
avayte upon me that dare be avowyd but Litill John. William Nawton is
here with me, but he dare not ben avowyd, for he is sore thret. It is
told me the old Lady and the Duke is set fervently ageyn us be the
enformacion of Harlesdon, the Bayly of Cossey and Andrewys and Doget the
balys sone, and suych other fals shrewys the which wuld have thes mater
born ought for ther owyn pleser; the which causith an[205.1] evyll noyse
in this contre and other places. And as for Sir John Hevenyngham, Sir
John Wyndefeld and other wurchepfull men ben mad but her
doggeboldes;[205.2] the whiche I suppose wull turne hem to diswurchep
here after. I spake with Sir John Hevenyngham and enformed hym with the
trough of the mater, and of all owyr demenyng at Drayton, and he seid he
wuld that all thyng wer wele, and that he wuld enforme my lord as I seid
to hym, but Harleston had all the words and the rewle with the Duke
here, and after his avyse and Doctor Aleynes he was avysed here at this
tyme.

The logge and the remenaunte of your place was betyn down on Tuesday and
Wednesday, and the Duke rode on Wednysday to Drayton and so for to
Cossey whille the logge at Heylesdon was in the betyng down. And this
nyght at mydnyght Thomas Sleyforth, Grene Porter, and Joh. Botesforth
the Baly of Eye, and other, had a cart and fetched awey fetherbeddes,
and all the stuffe that was left at the parsones, and Thom Wateres hows
to be kept of owrs. I shall send you billes er after, as ner as I may,
what stuffe we have forborn. I pray you send me word how ye will that I
be demened, wheder ye wull that [I][205.3] abide at Cayster or come to
you to London. I have no leyser to write more. God have yow in His
kepyng. Wretyn at Norwich on Sent Lukes Evyn.

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[206.1]

_To my ryght wyrshypfull hosbond, John Paston, be thys delyveryd in
hast._

[Sidenote: 1465 / OCT. 27]

Ryght wyrshypfull hosbond, I recomand me to you. Please it you to wyte
that I was at Haylesden uppon Thersday laste passyd, and sey the place
ther, and in gode feyth ther wyll no cryatur thynke how fowle and
orubelly it ys arayed but yf they sey it. Ther comyth moch pepyll dayly
to wonder ther uppon, both of Norwych and of other placys, and they
speke shamfully therof. The Duck had be beter then a m^{l}._li._ that it
had never be don; and ye have the more gode wyll of the pepyll that it
ys so foylle don. And they made youre tenauntys of Haylesdon and
Drayton, with other, to help to breke down the wallys of the place and
the logge both,--God knowyth full evyll ayenst ther wyllys, but that
they derst no notherwysse don for ferre. I have spoken with your
tenauntys of Haylesdon and Drayton both, and putte hem in comfort as
well as I canne. The Duck ys men rensackyd the church, and bare a way
all the gode that was lefte ther, both of ours and of the tenaunts, and
lefte not so moch but that they stode uppon the hey awter, and ransackyd
the images, and toke a way such as they myght fynd, and put a way the
parson owte of the church till they had don, and ransackyd every mans
hous in the towne v. or vj. tymys. And the chyff maysters of robbyng was
the Baylly of Ey, the Baylly of Stradbroke, Thomas Slyford, and Porter;
and Slyford was the chyff robber of the cherch, and he hath most of the
robbery next the Baylly of Ey. And as for lede, bras, pewter, yren,
dorys, gatys, and other stuffe of the hous, men of Coshay and Causton
have it, and that thay myght not cary, thay have hewen it a sonder in
the most dysspytuose wyse. Yf it myght be, I wold som men of wyrshop
myght be send from the Kyng to see how it ys both ther and at the logge,
or than any snowys[207.1] com, that they may make report of the troth,
ellys it shall not mo be seyn so playnly as it may now.

And at the reverens of God, spyde your maters nowe, for it ys to orybell
a cost and trobell that we have now dayly, and most have tyll it be
other wyse; and your men dar not goo abowte to geder uppe your lyfflode,
and we kype here dayly more than xxx. persons for savacyon of us and the
place, for, in very trowght, and the place had not be kypyd strong, the
Duck had come hether. Arblaster thynketh verely that Hugh a Fen may do
moch in your maters, and he thynkyth that he wole do for you faythfully,
yf ye wyll, &c.

At the reverens of God, yf any wyrshypfull and profetabile mene may be
take yn your maters, for sake it not in eschuyng of our trobell and gret
costs and charges that we have, and may growe here after. It ys thoght
here that yf my Lord of Norffolk wolld take uppon hym for you, and that
he may have a comyssyon for to enquer of such ryotts and robberyes as
hath be don to you and other in thys contray, that then all the contray
wyll a wayte uppon hym, and serve your entent; for the pepyll lovyth and
dredyth hym more then any other lord except the Kyng and my Lord of
Warwyk, &c.

God have you in Hys kypyng, and send ous gode tydyngs from you. Wryten
in haste, uppon the Sonday Seynt Symon and Jude ys Evyn.

  By yours,

  M. P.

    [Footnote 206.1: [From Fenn, iv. 226.] The Eve of St. Simon and
    Jude is the 27th October. It fell on Sunday in the year 1465.]

    [Footnote 207.1: Fenn remarks that if we may judge from the
    mention of snow in this place, the winters began earlier in those
    days than they do now. But perhaps Margaret was only urging the
    necessity of timely action, taking into consideration the ordinary
    delays of suitors. We have seen, however, from Letter 609 that in
    the year 1465 there must have been unusually cold weather even in
    the beginning of September.]

MESSAGE TO SIR WILLIAM YELVERTON[208.1]

_This is the Instruccion for the Messenger._

That ye grete well Sir William Yelverton, letyng hym wete in our behalf
we be informed that certeyn persones, in the name of the right
worshipfull our cosyn the Duc of Suffolk, have enterid in the manoir of
Drayton that was Fastolffes, and have dreven from the seid manoir and
other xiij^c. shep and other bestes pastured upon the seid manoir.
Notwithstandyng, we merveyle gretly that the seid Sir William, his sones
and servauntes, as it is seid, assiste and comfort the seid persones so
entryng and withdrawyng the seid catell, seying that he is named both
feffe and executour. And all be it so that there is variaunce bithwene
hym and our welbelovid John Paston in our coort, consernyng as well the
seid manoirs as other goodes that were Sir John Fastolffes, whom God
assoyle, yit it may not acorde with worship and consiens for the seid
Sir William to assiste the distruccion of the seid manoirs and goodes in
the meane tyme. Wherfore we desire hym that he woll do his devoir
effectually to help to save the seid manoirs from all such pretense of
titell, and to cause the seid catels to be restored to the manoirs
aforeseid, and not to be withdrawen and distroyed as they be; and that
he do his feithfull part in this behalf acordyng to the trust that he
was put in, as we may do for hym in tyme to come.

    [Footnote 208.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This appears to be a
    message from the King rebuking Judge Yelverton for partizanship in
    assisting the Duke of Suffolk against Paston in his entry into the
    manor of Drayton. The date is therefore 1465. The MS., however, is
    only a corrected draft, and it is not certain that such a message
    was actually sent.]

Wreten at Norwich, on Seint Martyn is Even.

  Your poer cosyn and ffrend,

  J. WYMONDHAM.

And how that ever ye do, hold up your manship.

    [Footnote 209.1: [From Fenn, iv. 240.] As to the date of this
    letter, we can only reproduce what is said of it by Sir John Fenn:
    'John Wymondham, Esq., the writer of this letter, married Margery,
    the daughter of Sir Robert Clifton, Knight, of Denver, in Norfolk,
    and widow of Sir Edward Hastings, of Elsing, Knight. He therefore
    calls her "My Lady." He died in 1475.

    'He purchased the manor and estate at Felbrigg, of the trustees of
    Sir Simon Felbrigg, where he had resided; but once in his absence
    Sir John Felbrigg made a forcible entry, and dragging out his Lady
    by the hair of her head, who had locked herself up in a chamber to
    keep possession, got into possession, and retained it till
    Wymondham obtained the King's order to Thomas Montgomery, Esq.,
    High Sheriff of the county, to put him again into possession. The
    dispute was then settled with Sir John Felbrigg, and upon
    Wymondham's paying to him 200 marks [L133 : 6 : 8] he released his
    claims, &c.

    'This letter seems to have been written during the time that he
    was dispossessed of Felbrigg, and which must have been either
    before the year 1461 or 1466, those being the years in which Sir
    Thomas Montgomery was Sheriff of Norfolk, and as J. Paston at this
    time seems to have been under misfortunes, it was probably near
    the latter year. I have therefore ventured, though doubtfully, to
    date the letter in 1465.']

NOTE

The letter of John Payn to John Paston (No. 126 in vol. ii.), which, on
account of the circumstances to which it refers, we have placed in the
year 1450, was written, as appears by the contents, fifteen years later,
_i.e._ in 1465. We therefore call the reader's attention to it in this
place.

    [Footnote 214.1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 223.] The principal lordship
    in the manor of Thurning belonged to the Radcliff, or Ratcliff,
    family, afterwards Earls of Sussex; but it seems there was another
    lordship which belonged to John de Mauteby in the ninth year of
    Edward II. From this very likely Margaret Paston derived some
    claims, and John Paston through his wife. _See_ No. 634. The year
    of this letter, however, cannot be ascertained.]

  By your cosyn,

  JOHN FELBRYGGE.

    [Footnote 215.1: [From Fenn, iv. 242.] The date of this letter
    cannot be ascertained with very great precision; but as it belongs
    most probably to about the same period as Letter 619, which we
    have referred to November 1465, we may assign this to the January
    following.]

    [Footnote 216.1: The modern version in Fenn reads 'the Monday
    _after_ Saint Agnes's Day,' and the date subjoined at the bottom
    of the page is in accordance with this reading. But it is more
    likely the text as printed in the old spelling is correct. St.
    Agnes' Day is the 21st January. The Monday before it would have
    been the 20th in 1466.]

JOHN WYKES TO SIR JOHN PASTON[216.2]

_Un to the ryght wyrshypfull mayster, Sir John Paston, Knygt, be thys
letter delyveryd._

[Sidenote: 1466 / FEB. 17]

Ryght wyrshypfull and my especyall gode mayster, I recomaund me unto
your gode maystershyp, letyng you wyte that the berour herof told me
that ye had grete mervyll that I send to you no word ne letter of
awnswer of the letters that ye had send to me to London. As for on
letter ye send to me by Rychard Playtorys man, and therof I send you an
awnswer in a letter by a man of the Prior of Bromholm; and as for other
letters, ther com no more to me but that on.

Item, Mayster Flemmyng lokyth dayly for hys hors, and at every tyme that
I mete with hym, he askyth of me when hys hors shuld com, and when I
here any word from you. Wherfore I pray you send me word in a letter how
he shall be awnswerd, and yf the hors shall com, lette me knowe when;
for and he had not trustyd theruppon, he wold have purveyd hym in a
nother place, &c.

Item, John Oter ys not yet payd, but as I suppose it shall not be long
to tyll he have it, for he hath spoken to my mayster your fader a yer
therfor; and as for Gylmyn, he hath not spoken to my mayster as yet, &c.

Item, I truste he wylbe your gode fader, for John Say hath told hym
playnly of hys demenyng ayenst you, and told hym that he had the lasse
favour for your sake, &c.

Item, the Erle of Arundell ys[217.1] son hath weddyd the Quyne ys
suster.

Item, the Lord Lovell ys son[217.2] hath weddyd my Lady Fytzhugh ys
doghter, &c.

Item, Jenney desyryth a trety with my mayster, and spake to my mayster
therof hym sylf in Westminster Hall.

Item, all felaws in the Kyngs hows fareid well, and wold have you ther.

No more to you at thys tyme, but the Holy Trynyte have you [in] kepyng.
Wryten at London, the Monday next after Seynt Volentyn.

  Your servant,

  JOHN WYKYS.

    [Footnote 216.2: [From Fenn, iv. 246.] As this letter was written
    after Edward IV.'s marriage, and before the death of John Paston
    the father, the date must be either 1465 or 1466. Fenn assigns it
    to the latter year, and I think he is right, though he does not
    state his reasons. I find that John, Lord Lovel, died on the 9th
    January 1465, leaving his son and heir, Francis, only nine years
    old, so that even if we date this letter 1466, the young lad was
    married at the early age of ten. This was probably owing to his
    wardship having been obtained by Lord Fitzhugh, or some person
    interested; but as the inquisition on his father's death (_Inq.
    p. m._, 4 Edw. IV., No. 27) was not taken till October 1465, there
    seems no ground for believing that he could have been forced into
    wedlock a month after he was left an orphan.]

    [Footnote 217.1: Thomas Fitz Alan, Lord Maltravers, eldest son of
    William Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel, married Margaret, second
    daughter of Richard Widville, Earl Rivers, and sister to
    Elizabeth, Queen of Edward IV. He succeeded his father as Earl of
    Arundel in 1487, 3 Hen. VII., and died in 1524, 16 Hen. VIII.--F.]

    [Footnote 217.2: Francis Lovel, son and heir to John, Lord Lovel,
    married Anne, daughter of Henry, Lord Fitz Hugh. It is curious
    that she is here called 'Lady Fitz Hugh's daughter,' when her
    father was alive.]

_To hys rythe worchypfwll mayster, John Paston, Sqwyer._

[Sidenote: 1466 / MARCH 18]

Rythe worchypfwll broder, I recomawnde me to zow. And as for zour letter
to my Lorde Chawnceler I have not delyveryd it; for I askyd avysse there
in, and I was aunsweryd there in that sythen he was takyn to baylle, the
Chawncelerer[217.4] cowde not compelle the swertes to bryng hym in befor
hys day. Also me thowte zour letter was not most plesauntly wrytyn to
take to swyche a lorde. And as for the tresorer, hys name is Sir John
Fooge, but he is not in London nor wythe the Kyng, so I kan [not] have
the letter sent hym but if I hyeryd a man to bere it. And as for zour
question of the patentes, Grenfeld and Catesby and Sterkey holdyn it a
good question, for the statute is, _Patentes dez tenements dount null
titill est trouve pur le roy de recorde sount voydez_, anno xviij.
H. VI. ca. vj. But I trowe in zour cas that be ther opiniounis the Acte
of the Parlement is a tytyll of recorde. It is said to the contrary
intent, thow the londs be forfetyd of record, yet ther is no
certificacion of recorde qwat londes they be, nor wer [_where_] nor
in qwat place they lye; but and thys clawse be in the patents, _Non
obstante quod nulla inquisicio pro nobis inde est inventa_, by Grenfelde
is consayle the patents xwld be clerly goode. But me semythe that
amendyt not the mater, for be for the makyng of the statute above sayde,
patents graunttyd of londs be fore inquisicion were goode and effectuell
and the statute is generall:-- _Patents dount null tytill, &c. sount
voydez_. Thanne it folowyt well if the Acte of Parlement be no tytyll
for the Kyng thann is ther no tytyll for the Kyng of recorde, for that
clawse in the patente is no tytyll; than if ther [be] no tytyll, ergo
the patents voyde.

My suster[218.1] standythe in the same casse with my Lord of Kent.

Broder, I pray zow send mor mony for my nevew John, for he mwst ellys
com hom azen; for the Kyng gothe into Scotlonde, and he is nowther
horsyd nor harneysyd, for his grett hors is lykly to dye; and if ze wyll
sende it to me or to Christofyr Hanyngton it xall be save for hym.
I send zow a letter from hym closyde herin. And I pray spek to my moder
that my hors faylle not on Passyon Swnday,[218.2] for thann xall I be

    [Footnote 217.3: [From Paston Letters, B.M.] The reference to the
    dispute between Elizabeth Poynings and the Earl of Kent, which is
    alluded to in a subsequent letter, proves this letter to have been
    written in the year 1466. The earl in question was only so created
    on the 3rd of May 1465, and John Paston, to whom the letter is
    addressed, died in May 1466.]

_To my worchepful mayster, John Paston the holdest, be this letter
delyveryd in hast._

[Sidenote: 1466 / MAY 12]

Ryth reverent and worchepful sire, I hartyly recomende me on to your
reverens, thankyng yow for the gret cher and comfortabyll words that ye
yovyn on to me wat tyme that I was last yn yowr presens; desyryng ful
specyaly of Almity God, owt of al your wordly tribulacyonys and
adversyte, gracyowus delyverans, and yn al vertuows prosperite, good
encres and contynuans. If yt like your maysterchep to know the cause of
this wrytyng, it ys thys; it is nowth unknow[219.2] on to yow that
Mayster Brakle (Cryst rest hys sowle!), delyveryd to Wyllam Paston, your
broder, certayn oblygacyonys, of the weche the dute xuld grow to my
convent yn Norwyche. I have spoke on to Wyllam Paston her of, and he
excuseth hym and seyth on this wyse; that be the wyl of Mayster Brakle,
wat tyme that Sire Tomas Todenham,[219.3] Knyth, xuld be put on to hys
deth, he delyveryd hem on to hys confessor; the weche, as he seth, xuld
a be Grey fryer, hows name he knowyth nowt; also he seyth that after the
deth of the forseyd Knyt, he spake with the Fryer, confessor on to the
Knyth, and hasked hym aftyr the forseyd oblygacyonys, and as he seyth,
the Fryer seyd on to hym that he had delyveryd hem on to [the] Knyth
Marchall. Werfor I beseche you, as specyaly as I may, that, now wyl your
broder is at London, that ye of your grace wyl know the trowthe in this
mater, for the comfort of the dede, and profyth of my convent. Nomor at
this tyme, but that I be seche Almyty God in Trinyte conserve your, and
kepe yow in all vertuows prosperite. Amen.

Wretyn at Heylysdon in gret hast, the xij. day of May, in your maner
aftyr mete. The cause wy the mayster delyveryd hem to hym mor than to
yow, was, as he seyd on to me, for as meche as ye had so many maters yn
hand for yowr self, and also for the dede, that he durst not attempt yow
with all; and al so be cause he had lesse for to do hys hope was that he
xuld asped yt mor redyly.

    [Footnote 219.1: [From Fenn, i. 256.] Friar Brackley, who is here
    mentioned as dead, is spoken of in John Paston's deposition of
    December 1465, without any indication that he was at that time
    deceased (_see_ No. 606). We may presume, therefore, that he died
    between that time and May 1466, in which month and year died John
    Paston, to whom this letter is addressed.]

MARGARET PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[220.1]

[Sidenote: 1466(?) / NOV. 13 (?)]

I grete you wele and send you Goddis blissyng and myn; letyng you wete
that I send you be the berer herof xl_li._ of Ryall which I have
chevysshed and borwed for you, be cause I wuld not take that was leyd
ought for you at Norwich; for, as I am enformed be Mayster John Smyth,
the Chaunceller, and other that we ben all a cursed that we have thus
mynystred the dedis godes with ought licence or auctorite, and I wene we
spede all the wers there fore. At the reverence of God, gete you a
licens of my Lord of Caunterbery in dyschargyng of my conscyens and
yowris, to mynystre a certeyn summe of iij. or iiij^c marcs, enfourmyng
hym how that your lyffelod hath stond this ij. yer in such trobill that
ye myght right nought have of it, ner yet can take of it with ought ye
shuld hurt your tenauntis, thei have so ben vexid be on trew meanes
before this tymes, And ye have many grete materis on hand and may not
have to bere them ought, ner to save your ryght, withaught ye myght for
a tyme takyn of your faderis godes. And this I hope shall discharge owr
conscyens of that we have mynystred and spend be fore. For we have nomor
to acquite this xl_li._ and bere all other charges but the xlvii_li._
that your unkyll and ye is privy to, that was leyd up at Norwich. I wuld
ye were ware of large theftis and rewardis gevyng, as otheris folkis
avyse you to do, for though ye have nede thei wull not be right redy to
help you of ther owyn; and that ye may understand be that that thei have
taken a wey from you be for this tyme. I wuld not in no wyse ye shuld
put your self in no daunger to hym but as litill as ye may; for if ye
do, it shall be right wele remembred you her after. And be ware how ye
ben bownd in any obligacion to any creature but if it be leyd in
endifferent handis and trosty for yowr part. And remembre to gete the
obligacion that ye mad to the Duchesse of Suffolk; for though it be in
my Lord Chancelleris hande it is jepartows, be cause of perell of deth.
Item, understand wele the poyntis that ben in my cosyn Arblasteris
letter that arn wretyn in yowrs, and purvey redily ther for for your
owyn a vayll. Item, send me home answeris of sueche materis as arn now
sent you bethen (_sic_) mowth and wrytyng at this tyme as hastly as ye
can, or ells it shall hurt yow mor than ye or I can yet understand.
Item, me semyth, if ye shall not comyn home this Crystmesse, or if ye
shuld be at my Lady of Suffolk, it [were[221.1]] necessary to have
Playter there with you if ye shuld engroos any appoyntementis with here
at that tyme. For she is sotill and hath sotill councell with here; and
therfore it were wele do ye shuld have summe with you that shuld be of
your councell. If John Paston be with you at London desire hym to take
hede to yowris materis and in what case thei ben left at your departyng,
that if nede be he may help you to labore for such causes as Wykes shall
telle yow be mowth; and if he be not with yow, and ye wull I shall send
hym to you. Item, spare of[221.2] the xl_li._ as mych as ye may that ye
may perfourme by the mony that the Duchesse of Suffolk shuld have, in
cas that it may not be gadered of the lyvelode. Send home Wykes a sone
as ye can, and how ye will that I do in your materis and lyvelode at
home. God have you in His kepyng. Wretyn the Thursday next Sent Martyn.

  Be your Moder.

    [Footnote 220.1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 99.] This letter was written
    before administration had been obtained of John Paston's will;
    presumably therefore in the year in which he died, 1466. It may be
    observed, likewise, that in 1467 'my lord of Canterbury' would

    [Footnote 222.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] I find no very
    satisfactory evidence touching the date of this letter. Allusion
    is made to John Paston having been at Lincoln. The occasion
    referred to might have been in 1458, when, as we know by No. 373,
    he went into the North as far as Doncaster; or it may have been in
    the spring of 1461. (_See_ Nos. 452 and 458.) It is not probable,
    however, that this letter was earlier than the latter date, as
    there is no appearance at that time of any dispute having arisen
    between John Paston and his brother William. On the contrary,
    William Paston is in correspondence with his brother in April 1461
    (No. 450). On the other hand, if the occasion referred to when
    John Paston was at Lincoln was in the spring of 1461, this letter
    could hardly have been written in the same year; for it cannot be
    supposed that he left books at Caister on his return south, when
    Caister was in the possession of the Duke of Norfolk. The date,
    however, being so uncertain, I prefer to place this letter at the
    end of John Paston's correspondence rather than assign it
    doubtfully to any particular year.]

    [Footnote 224.1: [From Fenn, iv. 262.] There is no evidence of the
    date either of this or of the four following letters beyond the
    fact that this and the two next are addressed to John Paston,
    while the two last are addressed to Margaret Paston during her
    husband's life. None of them, therefore, can be later than 1466.]

Thanks him for speaking to the Mayor and Recorder for the appearance of
certain persons at this last session, as he wrote from Walsingham.

ABSTRACT[225.1]

JOHN PASTON, JUNIOR, TO HIS FATHER, JOHN PASTON

Has spoken 'with Warwyk and Stwkle' for the place and lands in Arleham.
Declined their offer of 6_d._ an acre, they keeping the place in repair;
but Stwkle has promised all the lands shall be purveyed for, as for this
year. Warwyk this day offered my mother 7_d._ an acre for the lands in
Arleham, but I counselled her to hold out for a longer term. Kook will
no longer hold the place for 7_d._ or 8_d._ an acre, and will only give
6_d._, if he is to keep it in repair. Has spoken with Dame Alice Weche
and Geoffrey Spyrlyng, who have agreed to set a tenant to occupy the
lands in dispute till Paston comes home.

St. Martin's Even.

ABSTRACT[225.2]

THOMAS GNATYSHALE TO MRS. PASTON

I hope the young man I sent will please 'my master and you.' I hope you
will not receive him at this time, and when my master comes home refuse
him. As for your lands at Sparham, there are not many lands to let. Has
inquired at Salle. Master Edward[225.3] is clearly answered of L18 a
year and 7_s._ or 8_s._ more. Bryston, Thyrnyng, and Owleton are let,
which belong to the manor of Salle. So he is clearly answered twice a
year at London, besides the fees, viz., of the receiver 26_s._ 8_d._, of
the steward 20_d._, and of the bailliff 26_s._ 8_d._

T. GNATYSHALE TO MRS. PASTON

James and Robert Radclef mean to take away my goods, and I shall be
taken if I be at Norwich at next shire. Pray let my master know.
I suppose it was by their commandment that my two neat were taken on
Saturday last at Lyng, 'for one that is under bailly of Richmond took
hem.' John Everyton will tell you more. The receipts of the manor of
Sparham with costs are L10, 3_s._ 11-1/2_d._ If any man of yours come
to Norwich please send me your advice.

ABSTRACT[236.1]

EXAMINATIONS TOUCHING SIR JOHN FASTOLF'S WILL

[Sidenote: 1466 / MAY and JUNE]

A.D. 1466. The following witnesses were examined secretly and apart on
behalf of Sir William Yelverton, 'deceased,'[236.2] in the house of the
treasurer of St. Paul's Cathedral by John Druell, LL.D.:--

  May 17. John Monke _alias_ Smyth.
      19. John Dawson and John Gyrdyng.
      20. William Boswell, Robert Inglys, Ric. Horne, and Thos.
              Pykeryng.
      21. Henry Clerke, John Tovy, Thos. Hert, William Shawe, and
              Nich. Cherche.
      22. Thos. Newton, Th. Spycer, and Thos. Neve.
      23. John Rugge, John Clerke, and Rob. Bunche.
 June 10. Stephen Scrope.
      11. Ric. Fastolf.

I. John Monke, a smith of the parish of St. James, Pokethorpe, in
Norwich, illiterate, of free condition, thirty-two years old and over,
alleges bribery of witnesses by Paston and Howys, who offered to sell
John Russe lands at Leystofte at little more than half their value.
Howes made Russe a present of salt, barley, and malt to the value of
L20, and promised him a full discharge of his account for goods of the
testator in his custody to the value of L200 and over. He paid Robert
Cutteler, vicar of Caster, 'colore cujusdam ultimi _vale_ dicti
testatoris prius non debite' (_sic_), money and corn to the value of 20
marks, and promised to present him to the living of Mawdeby whenever
Thomas Howse resigned it. They gave Felmyngham an annuity of 8 marks,
and 40s. to a boy who is his servant. They gave Robert Boteler a fee
(_feodum_) of 5 marks [a year] for life, and the farm of a close called
Mawdeby close, besides some other gifts which are specified. Hence the
said John Russe, Rob. Cutteler, Clement Felmyngham, and Rob. Butteler,
falsely deposed in answer to the second interrogatory that on the
Saturday before the testator's death they were present in a certain low
room (_bassa camera_) in the manor of Caister, where the testator was
principally between the hours of 8 and 11 A.M., and that with them were
the said John Paston and John Brakley, and no others; for in reality
there were present in the chamber with the testator on that day, and
especially during those hours, the said Rob. Fitzrauf, Nich. Newman, and
John Loer continually, and the said Dan John Davye, Dan Thomas Howys,
Friar John Bernard, physician, and Henry Barbour, and several others [at
intervals]. Moreover, Cutteler, Felmyngham, and Butteler, said Russe was
present on that occasion, whereas both he and Cutteler were in other
places. Moreover, bribes were given by Paston and Howes in various forms
during the months of January, February, and March 1462[-3], and at other
times in the parishes of Caister and Yarmouth, and in the city of
London, to Ralph Lampet, brother William Bukenham, and the said Rob.
Cutteler. Paston promised to promote Bukenham to the priory of Yarmouth,
and also, as a reward for his testimony, to give him 13 acres of the
testator's land in Scroudby and Caister called Isabell, to the use of
the prior and convent of Norwich. Hence the testimony of these witnesses
was false, that Fastolf, about the beginning of Autumn five years ago,
had made to John Paston estate and feoffment and livery of seisin of his
manor of Caister, and other lands in Cos. Norf. and Suff., and the city
of Norwich, to the use of the said testator while he lived, and
afterwards to that of the said John Paston and his heirs; for if any
such thing was done (which is not admitted) it was on the 16th October
1457, in the 36th year of Henry VI., after the Autumn of the said year,
and not to the use of Paston and his heirs, but to the use of Fastolf
himself, and for the accomplishment of his will. Further, the testimony
of Russe, Cutteler, Bukenham, Felmyngham, and Butteler was untrue as to
the alleged will of Fastolf that John Paston should obtain the King's
license for the foundation of a college at Caister. It was in truth
Fastolf's will that the executors should obtain the King's license to
found a college there of seven Benedictine monks of the same profession
as the monastery of St. Benet at Hulme, of whom one should be prior, and
of seven poor men, and that they should be endowed out of his lands to
the extent of 300 marks a year, all charges deducted, to pray for the
soul of Lady Milicent, his wife, his parents and benefactors; and if the
executors were unable to obtain this license, they were to give the
abbot and convent of St. Benet's lands and money for the maintenance of
six new monks and seven poor men in that monastery with a like object.
Further, it is not true as alleged that on Saturday before his death,
viz., 3rd Nov., between eight and eleven A.M., the testator openly
declared his will with a clear voice in the hearing of bystanders, for
he was so ill and weak from want of breath that he was unable to speak
distinctly at any time that whole day, especially during the hours above
mentioned.

Moreover, bribes were offered by Paston and Howes in May and June 1465,
in the parishes of Caister and Yarmouth, and in the city of London, to
Thomas Thorald, Robert Lawes, Will. Waterman, John Osbern, John Heydon,
Will. Pykeryng, John Symmys, and John Shawe, for their testimony in this
matter, viz. that they should have 20s. besides travelling expenses and
divers other sums which were offered to them in Paston's name by
Cutteler, vicar of Caister, and Ric. Calle; and John Paston promised the
said William Pykeryng that he should recover certain lands in the tenure
of his brother John Pykeryng, in Fylby, to the value of 40s. Influenced
by these bribes, Thos. Thorald deposed that on the Saturday before
Fastolf's death, Bartholomew Elys and John Davys came to his house in
Belton, two miles and more from Yarmouth, about eight A.M., when he was
in his grange, and asked him to come with them to divers manors of the
said Sir John, to receive certain grain from his farmers; after which
they drank in Thorald's house, and he went with them to Freton, and to
the manor called Calcote hall, and other places in Lothynlond until
midday. Robert Lawes also deposed that on Friday before Fastolf's death
he went to Becclys, and next day, viz. Saturday, returning homeward
(_rediens domorsum_), met on the way the said Bartholomew Elis, John
Davy, and Thomas Thorald going to Freton, when Davy called him and bade
him tell Thomas Howys or John Rus that on Monday or Tuesday next he
would go to Caister and give an account of his stewardship. Afterwards,
about two P.M., Lawes came to Caister and told John Rus his business in
the absence of Howys. But the said William Waterman, being bribed as
aforesaid, falsely declares that on the Saturday before Fastolf's death
Barth. Elys and John Davy came to his house at Gorlyston about seven
A.M., and that he went with them to Thorald's house, and that they went
and spoke with Thorald at the grange while he waited for them at the
gate. Afterwards they all entered the hall of Thomas Thorald and drank
beer together, and all four went together to Calcote-halle and waited
there till ten A.M., when Watyrman left the other three and returned
home. And about two P.M. Elys and Davy returned and drank beer at
Watyrman's house. But the truth is that Elys and Davy were at Yarmouth
that day from seven till past eleven A.M.

Further, John Osberne, Will. Pykerynge, and John Heydon were corrupt
witnesses. John Osberne said that on Saturday before the Feast of St.
Leonard, when Fastolf was ill of his last illness, the said Osberne,
Pykerynge, and Heydon came to Caister to receive certain monies of John
Rus for barley sold to him by Osberne; that about eight A.M. they
entered the hall of the manor and found Robert Hert and others, servants
of Fastolf, sitting at breakfast; and that John Russe immediately came
to Osberne and talked to him about the payment. At last Russe took them
into the _claustrum_, and leaving them, entered Fastolf's chamber; then,
after remaining two hours and more, returned into the _claustrum_ and
delivered the money to Osbern. This testimony was confirmed by Heydon
and Pykeryng; but the truth is that Russe that Saturday, from seven till
near twelve o'clock (_a principio horae septimae usque ad finem horae
undecimae_), and Robert Hert from seven to ten A.M., were at Yarmouth,
three miles off.

Further, John Symmys and John Shawe were corrupt witnesses, the former
saying that Robert Hert was present in the said manor-house of Caister
at eight A.M. on the said day, and even at nine o'clock at dinner-time
(_tempore prandii_), and that he saw the said Robert Hert sitting among
Fastolf's other servants at breakfast (_jentaculum_); and that he
(Symmys) and Henry Wynstall, Fastolf's barber, were occupied together in
shoeing horses in the said manor from breakfast-time aforesaid to
dinner-time, and that at dinner-time Symmys saw the said Henry sitting
in the hall with others; and that on the said Saturday, about eight
A.M., and even at noon, Symmys saw John Rus in the hall of the said
manor. Also John Shawe deposed that on the Saturday before Fastolf's
death he saw John Rus and Henry Wynstall in the hall of the said manor,
both at eight A.M. at breakfast and at dinner at midday, and he also saw
Robert Hert, porter at the gate of the manor, at those hours; and that
between breakfast and dinner Shawe and Wynstall were occupied along with
John Symmys in shoeing Sir John's horses. But the truth is that both Rus
and Hert were absent as above-mentioned, and Wynstall was with Fastolf
in his chamber from nine A.M. to half-past ten. Also Symmys, William
Pykeryng, Heydon, Osberne, and Lawes were all absent the whole of that
Saturday, and certainly between eight and eleven A.M. And
notwithstanding that the contrary is alleged against them, John Davy,
Barth. Elys, John Bokkyng, John Davy, chaplain, Thos. Upton, Nich.
Newman, John Loer, Wm. Eton, Robert Lynne, John Marshall, Wm. Lynne,
Henry Wynstall, Robert Hert, and Robert Fitzrauff, gave honest testimony
in behalf of Yelverton and Worceter, being men of good repute,
sufficiently rich, and well worthy of credit.

Additional exceptions on the part of Yelverton and Worcester to the
testimony of John Rus and Clement Felmyngham, showing that Paston had
offered to let to the former a tenement in Yarmouth for less than its
true value, and had promised the latter 100 marks for the Austin Friars
at South-Town,[239.1] which was not bequeathed in Fastolf's will; also
that he had given Master Robert Popy, besides his expenses, 20 marks for
his testimony, and remitted to him 10_s._ of the rent of a fishery which
was five years in arrear, and that he had also released to him 40 marks
of a penalty of 100 marks due by Popy upon a bond; in consequence of
which Popy deposed that on the 30th October three years
previously,[240.1] John Paston had reported to him at Caister that he
had made an agreement with Fastolf by which he was to have all Fastolf's
lands in Norfolk, Suffolk, and the city of Norwich, after his death,
paying for the same 4000 marks, and was to found a college in the manor,
etc.; on hearing which Popy returned to Fastolf, and related to him what
Paston had said to him, and Sir John confirmed it, requesting him to
show the same goodwill towards Paston, as he had done to himself. But in
truth Fastolf never asserted or confirmed any such thing.

Answers to interrogatories by the same deponent, viz.--1. As to his
knowledge of the parties and witnesses.

2. As to the alleged instances of bribery, and the absence of Rus on the
day referred to. The latter fact deponent says he knows, because he and
Rus lay together in the chamber of Thomas Howys, and on Friday before
Fastolf's death Rus went to Yarmouth to buy victuals, and left with him
the key of the chamber, Howys being then at Blowfeld; and Rus remained
at Yarmouth all that Friday and the Saturday following, and returned on
Sunday.

4. As to the condition of Fastolf on the Saturday before his death. He
was so weak for want of breath that he could not speak distinctly; those
about him could not hear what he said without inclining their ears to
his mouth, and even then they could hardly understand him. And this
deponent says he knows, because on Friday and Saturday before his death
he was frequently in Sir John's chamber, and when people spoke to him to
comfort him in his illness he only answered by sighs, so that deponent
and others could not tell what he meant. Moreover, Sir John was
accustomed when in health daily to say certain prayers with his
chaplain, but on that day the chaplain said the service alone, while
Fastolf lay on his bed and said nothing.

6. As to Russe and Hert being at Yarmouth, he says he heard Thomas Howys
that Saturday morning order the latter to take horse and ride thither to
get provisions for the household, and he saw him ride out of the manor
accordingly about seven A.M., and also saw him return with the
provisions about ten A.M. [In the margin here is written 'Nititur
deponere de absencia Hert, sed non probat.']

7. Knows that Henry Wynstall was absent from the hall of the manor from
about nine to half-past ten, for he saw him enter the chamber with his
instruments to shave Sir John, and wait there an hour and a half, and he
could not have left without deponent seeing him. Moreover, John Symmys
did not shoe horses in the manor that Saturday, for deponent had the
custody of the forge and kept the keys.

Answers to another set of interrogatories proposed on behalf of Paston
and Howes, and here quoted at length, to the following effect, viz.: 1.
Where each witness has lived since he was born, and whether he be in the
service of the party producing him? 2. As to his knowledge of the
witnesses on the other side? 3. What particulars he can give as to any
bribery he imputes to them, and what was its special object? 4. By what
means he knew it, and by whom he has been asked to give testimony, and
whether he has conferred with his fellow-witnesses; whether they have
received instructions what to depose; how often he has come up to London
to give evidence and returned without being called; and how much he was
promised for coming? 5. Each witness is to declare how he knows the
facts, and to be charged not to reveal to the others on what subjects he
was questioned.

The only point of interest in these replies is that deponent was asked
by William Worcester in the city of Norwich on Sunday eight days to give
his testimony in the cause. He denies all communication with his
fellow-witnesses, &c.

  _Note._--The evidence of this first witness runs to five or six
  times the length of any other, and we have noted all the material
  points in it. Of the depositions of the others we shall not give any
  summary, but mention briefly any new statements that seem to be of
  interest:--

II. John Dawson, husbandman (_agricultor_), of Blowfeld, where he has
been for four years, having formerly lived five years in the manor of
Caister, and before that in Cambridge three years, _literatus, liberae
conditionis_, about thirty years old.

His testimony generally agrees with that of Monke, and he says the
covenant of Akethorpe was made in the February before Fastolf's death.
Between Christmas and Easter after his death deponent heard Howes in the
manor of Caister say to Robert Cutteler the vicar that he should have 6
marks for his labour in giving evidence about Fastolf's will; and
afterwards Howes in his chamber in the said manor paid him 6 marks.
Paston also promised him a benefice worth 40 marks. He says, about a
month before Fastolf's death, he heard Howes and Paston frequently
repeat publicly in the household the tenor of Sir John Fastolf's will.
About St. John Baptist's day last he was at Yarmouth, and heard John
Symmys and John Shawe say they were hired by Paston and Howes to give
evidence in the proving of Fastolf's will.

III. John Gyrdynge of Fretenham, where he has lived four years; before
which time he lived with the Prior of St. Faith's two years, before that
in the manor of Caster four years, before that with John Emeryngale of
Wroxham two years, and before that in Norwich as an apprentice with
Henry Toke five years; a cook, illiterate and of free condition,
thirty-two years old and over.[241.1] Agrees with the evidence of
corruption against Rus and others. Was present in Fastolf's room that
Saturday forenoon, and saw the two chaplains celebrating mass.
H. Wynstall the barber was present till ten A.M.

IV. William Boswell of Thetford, who was four years with Friar Bracley,
&c., _literatus_, of free condition, thirty years old and more. Heard
Howys, Paston, and Rus frequently confer at Caister about the sale of a
house in Yarmouth, which Howys, at the request of Paston, at length
granted to Rus at L20 less than its value, to the end that Rus might
bear witness in their favour and in the proving of Fastolf's will. [Here
occurs a marginal note by another hand, 'Male sonat. Quod alius
consensit non probatur.' At the head of this deposition also it is said
that this witness has been proved corrupt.]

V. Robert Inglys of Lodon, gentleman, who has lived there two years,
and before that in the parish of Hopton three years, before that with
Henry None, Esq., for more than a year, before that with Sir John
Fastolf two years, before that with the Abbot of Langley two years, and
before that in Hopton with his father; illiterate, and of free
condition, thirty years old and more.

VI. Richard Horne of Brundall, Norwich diocese, husbandman
(_agricultor_), who has lived there four years, and before that with
Thomas Howys six years, and before that in the parish of St. George,
Southwark, three years; illiterate, of free condition, twenty-six years
old.

VII. Thomas Pykeryng of Wroxham, Norwich diocese, who has been a
schoolmaster at Norwich and Aylesham, and is now clerk to Robert
Norwich, steward of the Abbot of St. Benet's, Hulme.

VIII. Henry Clerke of Blowfeld, husbandman (_agricultor_), once in the
service of Sir John Fastolf, illiterate, twenty-eight years old, of free
condition. Says that on the Saturday before Fastolf's death Howys sent
him and John Shawe to Yarmouth about seven A.M., with a cart-load of
malt to one named Chirche; that they arrived about eight, and were
spoken to by John Rus and Robert Cutteler in the market-place; that they
waited with their cart till two P.M., when deponent took leave of Russ
and Cutteler in the street, having repeatedly seen them there in the
interval. Also that at eight and nine A.M. he saw Robert Hert in
Yarmouth, who soon after his arrival delivered him a sack containing
meat, bought, as he said, by Rus for Fastolf's household. He says also
that between eight and nine he spoke with the said John Symmys, William
Pykeryng, and John Osbern in Yarmouth.

Marginal notes are appended to the above statements, affirming that
bribery had been proved against this witness by four others, and that he
stood alone in his testimony.

IX. John Tovy of Caister, where he has lived ever since he was born,
_agricultor, literatus_, of free condition, twenty-four years old and
more; cannot depose of his own knowledge to the bribery of John Rus and
the others. He says John Rus was not present in the manor on the said
Saturday, having to be at Yarmouth to provide victuals for the
household. About eight A.M. witness conveyed to the said manor some
linen, which his mother had washed, for she was Sir John's washerwoman,
and waited there, sometimes in the hall and sometimes in Sir John's
chamber, till after midday, but did not see John Rus or any of the
others named, as he would have done if they had been present.

X. Thomas Hert of Caister, _agricultor_, who has lived there from his
birth, illiterate, of free condition, twenty-three years old. Cannot
depose to bribery except from hearsay. Was sent to Caister by his father
on the Saturday before Fastolf's death with capons to be sold to John
Rus, purveyor of victuals for the household, but on inquiring for him,
found he was absent, and delivered the capons to Sir Thomas Howes.
Waited till nine A.M. and saw neither Rus, Cutteler, Boteler, nor Robert
Hert, but was told Rus was at Yarmouth, and Boteler sick in his chamber.
John Symmys had nothing to do with the shoeing of Sir John's horses that
day. Was asked to bear witness in this cause a fortnight ago by Sir
William Yelverton's servant at Caister.

XI. William Shave, roper of Yarmouth, illiterate, of free condition,
fifty-eight years old. On the Saturday before Fastolf's death, was at
the house of John Balle, at the sign of the Cock, in Yarmouth, in a
parlour near the public street, when Sir Thomas Howes informed John Rus,
there present, that he had been desired by John Paston to remit to him
L20 of the price of a house sold to Rus by the said Thomas, and
thereupon he remitted to him the said L20 and 5 marks, in which he was
bound to Sir John Fastolf. He also promised him the lands of Akethorp
Hall for 40 marks less than any other, provided he would favour the
intention of Howes and Paston. [It is remarked in the margin that
witness does not say what intention.] William Lynde, a servant of Sir
John Fastolf, was present, besides others. He saw Russ and Cutteler that
Saturday at Yarmouth, between nine and twelve A.M., and spoke with them
and drank in the house of Thomas Lounde. As to Thomas Torald, witness
was at Yarmouth one Saturday, when he heard Robert Cutteler and Torald
conversing; and the former told the latter that Sir Thomas Howes loved
him well, and that John Paston could do him much good, and in the name
of Paston and Howes he promised Torald 20_s._ for his labour, besides
expenses, if he would depose for them. Knows that on the Saturday before
Fastolf's death Bartholomew Elys was in Yarmouth from half-past eight to
eleven A.M., for he and witness bought fish called roches together, sold
some, and divided others in Elys's house. That day he saw John Rus in
Yarmouth several times every hour from seven to eleven A.M., for he was
in the market-place all that time on his business, and at vespers he saw
John Rus in the parish church of the said town. Next day, Sunday, he
also saw him there at matins and at mass.

XII. Nicholas Chirche of Yarmouth, merchant, _literatus_, of free
condition, forty years old and more. Testifies concerning a conversation
held in John Balle's parlour at the Cock in Yarmouth after the Christmas
following Fastolf's death, with Sir Thomas Howes, John Paston, John Rus,
Friar Clement Felmyngham, Dan Robert Cutteler, Robert Boteler, Thomas
Neve, and others, when Howes remitted to John Rus L20 of the price of a
house he had sold him, and 5 marks of the arrears of his accounts. He
also testifies to other acts of the same nature on that occasion, and to
the absence of Rus and Cutteler at Yarmouth on the Saturday above
referred to, &c.

[In the margin it is remarked that this witness has been proved corrupt
by three others.]

On the 22d May John Naseby, proctor for Yelverton and Howes, produced as
a witness one John Rugge, in presence of Master Robert Kent, Paston's
proctor.

XIII. Thomas Newton of Burgh, _agricultor_, illiterate, of free
condition, fifty years old and more.

XIV. Thomas Spycer of Southtown, by Yarmouth, tailor, illiterate, of
free condition, fifty years old and more.

XV. Thomas Neve of Jernemuth [_Yarmouth_], merchant, _literatus_, of
free condition, forty years old and more.

XVI. John Rugge, mariner, of Yarmouth, illiterate, of free condition,
fifty years old.

XVII. John Clerke of Gorlaston, _agricultor_, illiterate, of free
condition, fifty years old. Heard Clement Felmyngham report to him at
the Austin Friars in Southtown that Paston and Howes had given him a
pension of 8 marks a year for life, and 40_s._ for his servant, to say
masses for the soul of Sir John Fastolf. Cannot witness of bribery
otherwise. A little after Michaelmas, two years before Fastolf's death,
William Worceter in Fastolf's name delivered possession of six of his
manors in Lodylond, viz. Spytlyng in Gorlaston, Bradwell Hall in
Bradwell, Hadlounde in Bradwell, Calcotes in Freton, Beytons in Belton,
and Akethorpe in Leystoft, to Sir Thomas Howes and others, his
co-feoffees named in a charter of enfeoffment, to the use of Sir John
during his life, and to execute his will afterwards. This he knows,
because he rode with Howes to the said manors when he took possession,
and saw and heard Worceter deliver possession thereof. Thomas Torald
reported to witness in Lent last that Paston and Howes had promised and
paid him 20_s._, besides his expenses, to give evidence in the proving
of Fastolf's will, and had given each of his fellow-witnesses as much.

XVIII. Robert Bunche of Yarmouth, mariner, _literatus_, of free
condition, fifty years old. Swears to having seen John Rus that Saturday
at Yarmouth between seven and eight. [A marginal note says that being
afterwards produced as a witness by Paston, he admitted having been
suborned, and having deposed falsely.]

On the 22d July Yelverton's proctor, Naseby, produced in presence of
Paston's proctor, Kent, two witnesses, viz.--Stephen Scrope, Esq., and
Richard Fastolf.

XIX. Stephen Scrope, Esq., of free condition, seventy years old or
about. Says he was several times with Sir John Fastolf in his manor of
Caister within the two years before his death, when Sir John told him he
had made his will, and had ordered his executors to erect a college of
six or seven monks and seven poor men at Caister, and that they should
have lands and goods to the value of 300 marks a year, if a license
could be obtained from the King to that effect; otherwise that the
number of monks at St. Benet's should be increased, and seven poor men
supported in the monastery. [In the margin it is remarked that this
witness proves nothing against the accused witnesses, but only
endeavours to depose concerning the will of the deceased.]

XX. Richard Fastolfe, of the parish of St. Mary Eldermary, in London,
tailor, where he has lived for two years, and before that in the parish
of St. Michael, Crokydlane, London, for a quarter of a year, formerly
with the Duke of York, _literatus_, of free condition, thirty-two years
old. Went to Caister about the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross
preceding Fastolf's death, along with one Thomas Plummer, _scriptor_, of
London, now deceased. Found Sir John walking about his chamber led by
two servants, when Plummer petitioned him to help deponent with goods
that he might marry, as he was one of Sir John's relations. To this Sir
John made answer that he had within a few [days] preceding made his
will, which he would not alter, and that he had made mention of deponent
therein. He also said to Plummer that if he had come in good time, he
should have written his will.

  [Throughout all the above depositions will be found marginal
  comments in another hand, a few of which we have noticed
  incidentally, tending to show that the testimony given is
  insufficient to prove the bribery of Paston's witnesses, or to
  invalidate their statements.]

EDWARD IV. TO THE BAILIFFS OF YARMOUTH[246.1]

BY THE KINGE (EDWARD THE FOURTH)[246.2]

[Sidenote: 1466 / JULY 17]

Trusty and welbeloved, we greet yow well, letting yow wete that our
trusty and welbeloved knight Sir John Paston, our welbeloved William
Paston, and Clement Paston, with other, have been before us and our
councell worshipfully declared of the surmise of great charge that was
laid on our behalfe unto John Paston deceased and them, jointly and
severally; so that we hold them and every of them sufficiently declared
in that matter, and take and repute them as gentlemen descended lineally
of worshipfull blood sithen the Conquest hither; and over that, have
commanded that plenare restitution of the manner of Castor, and of all
other lands and tenements, with goods and cattell, that the said John
Paston deceased had of the gift and purchase of Sir John Fastolfe,
Knight, shall wholly be restored unto our said Knight Sir John Paston,
like as the said John Paston deceased had in any time of his daies.
Wherefore, in as much as our said Knight intendeth to make his abideing
in Castor, we desire and pray yow that, for our sake and contemplation,
ye will be friendly and neighbours unto him in his right; and such other
things as may be to his profitt and ease, wherein ye shall do unto us
full and good pleasure. Yeaven under our signet in our Castle at
Windsore the xvij^th day of July.

  Subjoined to the above in Sandford's Genealogy is 'the coppie of a
  warrant sent from Kinge Edward the Fourth to restore Sir John Paston
  to the lands and possessions which he purchased of Sir John
  Fastolfe, whereof the originall remaineth in the custody of Edw.
  Paston, Esq.' It is addressed 'To all tenaunts, fermors, or
  occupiers of all the lands and tenements, and of every part of them,
  that late were John Paston's, Esq., now deceased, by way of
  inheritance, or Agnes Paston, Margaret Paston, William Paston, and
  Clement Paston, or any of them, and to all such persons what so they
  be, now being in the manner or place of Castor, or in any lifelode
  that was the said John Paston, Esq., by way of gifte or purchase of
  late Sir John Fastolfe, or of any other, within our counties of
  Norff., Suff., and Norwich, and to all the tenants, fermors,
  baylies, or occupiers of the same, and of every part thereof; and to
  all mayers, shreves, eschetors, bayliffs, and other our officers, as
  well within franchise as without our counties aforesaid, hereing or
  seeing these our letters.' The King mentions in this warrant that
  'great part of the said lands, tenements, and manors had been seized
  into our hands'; and the tenants, farmers, bailiffs, and occupiers
  of the said lands are charged thenceforth to pay the whole issues
  and profits thereof to Sir John Paston; and the mayors, sheriffs,
  escheators, and others the King's officers are charged to be
  'assisting, helping, and strengthening.' The warrant is 'Yeven under
  our signet at Windsore, the xxvj^th day of July, the sixth yeare of
  our reigne.'

    [Footnote 246.1: This letter is reprinted from the _Norfolk
    Archaeology_, where it was first published by Mr. Worship from a
    transcript made by Sandford in his MS. Genealogy of the Paston
    family, compiled in 1674. Sandford states that 'the originall
    under the King's seale remaineth in the custody of Edward Paston,
    Esq.' The date is rendered certain by the warrant subjoined.]

    [Footnote 246.2: We have placed the words 'Edward the Fourth' in

Latter clause of a writ of _supersedeas_ to an escheator directing him
not to make inquisition _post mortem_ on the lands of John ----, until
further notice.

Westminster, 20 July.

  [From the time of year at which this writ is dated, it may have been
  issued after the death of John Paston, who died in May 1466, the
  inquisition on his lands not having been taken till October
  following. But it may possibly have applied to the lands of Sir John
  Fastolf, who died in November 1459, the inquisition after his death
  not having been taken till October 1460.]

ANCESTRY OF THE PASTONS

  The following document is derived from a transcript made by Sandford
  in the Genealogy mentioned in No. 641, and some previous papers, and
  is likewise reprinted from Mr. Worship's article. Prefixed to it in
  Sandford's MS. are these words:-- 'The Briefe followinge was
  delivered to Edward Paston, Esq., amonge other evidence, by his
  uncle Clement Paston, and it is written in an old hand.' It would
  appear, however, from the wording, not to be a 'brief' or abstract,
  as Sandford considered it, but an extract from some certificate made
  in the King's name in behalf of Sir John Paston, setting forth what
  had been proved on examination as to the gentility of his ancestry.

They shewed divers great evidences and court rolles, how that they and
their ancetors had been possessed of a court and seniory in the town of
Paston, and of many and sundry bondmen, sithen the time that no mind is

Paston, father to the said John, William, and Clement, in title of her
dower, is in possession of bondholders, and also of bondmen, whose

sithen the time that no minde is to the contrary. And they shewed divers
fines, some leavyed in the time of the begining of the reigne of our

John, of liveloude whereof they and theire ancetors have been possessed
ever since to this day.

Also they shewed divers inquests which is matters of record. Also they
shewed divers deeds and grants before time of mind, how that their
ancetors had licence to have a chaplen and have divine service within

of religion to be prayed for, and confirmacions under the Great Seale of
our noble ancestor Kinge Henry the Third, son of Kinge John, confirming
the same grants.

Also they shewed divers old deeds, some without date, insealed under
autenticke seales, of divers particular purchases in the town of Paston,
reciting in the said deeds that the land was holden of the ancetors of
the said . . . . . Paston, as of the chiefe lord of the fee, and by
homage, and had ward, marriage and reliefe. Also they shewed how their
ancestors were infeoffed in divers men's mannors and lands in trust.
Also they shewed a great multitude of old deeds, without date and with

and wills of their ancestors under seale; and made open by evident

    [Footnote 254.3: [From Fenn, iv. 272.] The date of this letter is

ABSTRACT[256.1]

SIR JAMES GLOYS TO SIR JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1466(?) / NOV. 10]

Was at Snaylwell on Sunday, but could get no money. Most of the tenants
away at Canterbury or elsewhere. The rest said when you were there last
you had given them till Candlemas, 'so that thei myght malt ther corn
and brynge it to the best preffe.' Warned them to be ready by Tuesday
before St. Edmond the King, when Richard Calle would visit them.
A thrifty man beside Bery is willing to take the farm; but every one
says the last farmer was undone by it. Advises Paston not to overcharge
his farms. I have seen Catelyn's corn, and your tenants say it is
sufficient to content you. Your shepherd wishes to know if you will
continue him, for no one has spoken to him since my master your father
died. Men of Fordham have occupied your ground these two years that my
master has been in trouble. I think you should speak to my Lord of
Worcester, as he and Woodhous are lords of the town. I have bid the
farmers at Snaylwell sow some wheat land, and have warned the tenants at
Sporle, Pagrave, and Cressingham to be ready to pay. Advises him to keep
up his place at Langham's. If 'my master' had lived he would have
exchanged it for the parsonage. Supped on Monday night at a place of the
Duke of Suffolk's with the parson of Causton, a chaplain of the Duchess,
'and they talked sore of my Lady's bargain, and were right sorry that
she should forsake it.' The parson asserted that the feoffees had put
her in possession of the manors. Talk over this with your counsel; for
if the feoffees be compelled to release in Chancery it will be nought,
because of the estate they made before; so when you expect to be most
quiet you will be most troubled. There was also the parson of Brampston,
and he said W. Yelverton had sent a letter to the bailiff he has set at
Guton, but what it meant I could not find out. W. Yelverton has put the
parson of Heynford out of his farm. I did not speak with your mother
before writing this, as she was at Caister.

Norwich, St. Martin's Even.

  From the mention of John Paston the father as dead, and the trouble
  he had been in for two years, it would appear that this letter must
  have been written in 1466, the year of his death. The letter is
  endorsed in a contemporary hand: 'Literae anno vj. et vij. Edwardi
  iiij^ti.'

THOMAS GRENE TO WILLIAM YELVERTON, ESQ.

[Sidenote: 1466 / DEC. 22]

Desires his favour for Frere John Chesteyn and John Russe of Yarmouth,
who are suspected by Lord Scales of having treasures or jewels of my
Master Paston's. He never trusted them with any, knowing they were
familiar with William Jenney and Sir Thomas Howes. Is sure he put no
treasure into any place in that town, religious or other, for he often
said he wondered any thrifty man would live in it, 'there were so much
riotous people therein.' Begs his favour for my mistress Paston, 'which
is now under your governance.' Hopes to see her hereafter 'as worshipful
and well at ease as ever she was, and a great deal better when these
troubles be passed; for I am sekir whan God woll that she be passed them
she would not suffer them again for right great riches.'

Norwich, morrow of St. Thomas Apostle.

  [This letter has a great appearance of having been written shortly
  after John Paston's death. We place it therefore in the year in
  which he died.]

    [Footnote 267.1: [From Fenn, iv. 172.] The precise date of this
    letter is by no means certain. Fenn dates it merely between 1463
    and 1469; but if it be 'my Lady of Oxford,' and not 'my Lord,' who
    is spoken of near the end (_see_ page 268, footnote 2), it may be
    many years later. The Earl of Oxford was committed to the Tower in
    the latter part of the year 1468. In 1470 he took part in the
    brief restoration of Henry VI., and on the return of Edward IV. he
    was obliged to quit the country. If the Earl, therefore, is
    alluded to as living in England, the date cannot well be later
    than 1468. Probably it is about the year 1467. In that year the
    29th January fell on a Thursday, which would allow a reasonable
    time for the writer to suggest to Sir John Paston the expediency
    of his being in London on Monday or Tuesday following.]

    [Footnote 267.2: The words 'and maimed' are inserted from the
    right-hand copy in Fenn. They are not in the left-hand copy,
    having been overlooked, apparently, by the transcriber.]

    [Footnote 268.1: Who my Lady Anne P. was I cannot tell. The
    expression 'as white as whale's bone' is rather a strange one.]

    [Footnote 268.2: The modern version in Fenn reads 'my Lady of
    Oxford,' but 'my Lord of Oxford' is right.]

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[268.4]

[Sidenote: 1467 / FEB. 7]

Syr, it is so that thys Saterday John Rus sent me word by Robert Botler,
that William Yelverton hathe ben thys iij. dayis in Yermothe for to get
new wytnessys up to London; and, as it is thowt by the seid John Rus and
Robert Botler, ther wytnessyng is for to prove that it was Sir John
Fastolfs wyll that ther schold be morteysyd iij.^c. mark by yer to the
colage, and also that syche astat as my fadyr took her at Caster at
Lames next befor that Sir John Fastolf dyid, was delyveryd to my fadyr
to the intent for to perform the seyd wyll.

Bartholomew Elys, John Appylby, and John Clerk ar the wytnessys; and as
for Barthew Elys, he is owtlawyd, and also men say in Yermowthe that he
is bawde betwyx a clerk of Yermowthe and hys owne wyfe; and as for John
Appylby, he is half frentyk, and so take in the towne, notwithstandyng
he is an attorny, as Barthew Elys is, in the Baylys Coort of Yermowthe;
and as for John Clerk of Gorleston, he is owtlawyd at Sir John Fastolfys
swte, and at dyvers othyr menys, notwithstandyng he is thorow with Sir
T. Howys[269.1] for Sir John Fastolf, for thys cause, that the seyd
Clerk was on of Sir T. Howys[269.1] last wytnessys befor thys.

I trow John Loer shall be anothyr wyttnesse. As for Barthew Elys and
John Appylby, they lye thys nyht at Blyborowgh onward on her wey to
Londonward. Make good weche on hem.

I pray yow send us some good tydyngs. Wretyn the Saterday, lat at nyght,
next aftyr Kandylmas Day.


I pray yow remembyr John Grey and John Burgeys. We have hom the most
part of your barly, save fro Wynterton, and that I trost to have this
next wek, or ellys we wyll strat [_distrain ?_] for it by the grace of
God, whom I beseche mak yow good.

I thynk ther comyng up is for to dysprove your wyttnessys that he had in
to the Chancery.

  J. P.[269.2]

    [Footnote 268.4: [From Fenn, iv. 276.] This letter must have been
    written in February 1467. It was evidently after Sir John Paston
    had succeeded to his father's estates, but before any arrangement
    had been come to between him and Yelverton. It will be found
    hereafter that on the 11th January 1468 Sir John Fastolf's
    executors, including Yelverton, released their rights in Caister
    and other manors to Sir John Paston. On the back of this letter,
    Fenn says, is written in an ancient hand, 'Testes idonei ad
    negandum veritatem, ut patet infra.']

    [Footnote 269.1: Fenn has 'Sir Thowys' in his left-hand copy,
    which we cannot help thinking a misreading of 'Sir T. Howys.']

Bernard. And as for Robert Inglouse, I have spoken with hym, and I fynde

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[275.2]

[Sidenote: 1467]

Syr, plesyth yow to weet that my modyr and I comonyd this day with Freyr
Mowght to undyrstand what hys seying shall be in the coort when he
cometh up to London, wheche is in this wyse:-- He seyth at syche tyme as
he had shrevyn Master Brakley, and howsyllyd hym bothe, he let hym wet
that he was enformyd by dyvers personys that the seyd Master Brakley owt
for to be in gret consyens for syche thyngys as he had doone and seyd,
and causyd my fadyr, whom God asoyle, for to do and seye also, in
proving of Sir John Fastolfys wyll. To whom the seyd Mastyr Brakley
answerd thus agayne: 'I am ryght glad that it comyth to yow in mynd for
to meve me with thys mater in dyschargyng of my consyens ayenst God,'
seying ferther mor to the seyd Freyr Mowght, be the wey that hys sowle
shold to, that the wyll that my fadyr put into the coort was as veryly
Syr John Fastolfys wyll as it was trew that he shold onys deye. This was
seyd on the Sonday when the seyd Brakley wend to have deyid then. On the
Monday he revyvyd a yen, and was well amendyd tyll on the Wednysday, and
on the Wednysday he sekyned a yen, supposyng to have dyeyd forthe with.
And in hys syknes he callyd Freyr Mowght, whyche was confessor on to
hym, of hys owne mosyon, seyng on to hym in thys wyse:-- 'Syr, wher as
of your owne mosyon ye mevyd me the last day to tell you aftyr my
consyens of Sir John Fastolfys wyll lyek wyse as I knew, and now of myn
owne mocyon, and in dischargyng of my sowle, for I know well that I may
not askape, but that I must dye in hast, wharfor I desyr you that wyll
report after my dethe, that I took it upon my sowle at my dying that
that wyll that John Paston put in to be provyd was Syr John Fastolfys
wyll.' And the seyd Brakley dyid the same Wednesdaye.

And wher as ye wold have had Rychard Calle to yow as on Sonday last
past, it was thys Twyisday or I had your lettyr; and wher as it plesyth
yow for to wyshe me at Eltam, at the tornay, for the good syth that was
ther, by trowththe I had lever se yow onys in Caster Hall then to se as
many Kyngs tornay as myght be betwyx Eltam and London.

And, syr, whar as it lyekyth yow to desyir to have knowlage how that I
have don with the Lady Boleyn,[276.1] by my feythe I have don nor spokyn
nowght in that mater, nor not wyll do tyll tyme that ye com hom, and ye
com not thys vij. yer. Not withstandyng, the Lady Boleyn was in Norwyche
in the week aftyr Estern, fro the Saterday tyll the Wednysday, and
Heydons wyfe[276.2] and Mastras Alys[276.3] bothe, and I was at Caster,
and wyst not of it. Hyr men seyd that she had non othyr erend to the
towne but for to sport hyr; bot so God help me, I suppose that she wend
I wold have ben in Norwyche for to have sen hyr dowghter. I beseche yow
with all my hart hye yow hom, thow ye shold tery but a day; for I
promyse yow your folk thynk that ye have forgetyn hem, and the most part
of them must depart at Whytsontyd at the ferthest, they wyll no lenger
abyd. And as for R. Calle, we can not get half a quarter the mony that
we pay for the bare housold, besyd menys wagys. Daube nor I may no mor
with owt coynage.

[Sidenote: 1467 / MAY 1]

'Bill indented' 1 May, 7 Edw. IV., between Sir John Paston and Thomas
Lomnor, whereby the latter sells to the former an ambling horse 'upon
this condition, that if the marriage betwixt the Lord Charles, son and
heir to the Duke of Burgon, and the Lady Margaret, sister to our
Sovereign Lord the King' take effect within two years, Sir John agrees
to pay 6 marks for the horse on the day of the marriage; but if it do
not take effect within that period he will pay only 40 shillings.

  attached to it when the transcript was made. It has been since
  removed at some time or other.]

JAMES GRESHAM TO SIMON DAMME[280.2]

_To my worshipfull cosyn, Symond Damme, [at] Lyncoln Inne, at London,
[be] this delyvered._

[Sidenote: 1467(?) / JULY 2]

Right worshipfull sir, and as in my trost my veray speciall good
maister, I recomande me to you with al the servyce I can and may. Lyke
it you to wytte that I have do my bysynes to enquere for suyche dedes as
ye wrot for on to me, and, so God me helpe, I can not wytte where I
shuld spede to have ony suyche dedes. I spak to a persone that is your
good lover, the whiche tolde me that ther was a gret plee bytwene my
Lord of Suffolk and Sir John Fastolf for the maner of Drayton, for
whiche matier William Wysetre was sent to enquere for evydencez touchyng
the Pooles lyvelond in suyche places as thei were lords of in their
dayes. And the seid Wysetre fonde evydencez that touched a maner called
Mundham maner, sum tyme longyng to the Pooles that were owenners of
Drayton, the whiche evydences eased meche Sir John Fastolf; but the seid
persone that enfourmed me of this can not telle the armes, ne what
evydencez tho shuld be in certeyn, savyng he thynkyth indoubted that
William Worcetre shuld not be unremembred of this. Wherfore it is
thought to the same persone that enfourmed me of this and by me also,
that it shuld be expedyent for you to comune of this matier by your
wysdam with the same William Wysetre, now beyng at London, for he by
lyklyhod can telle you a certeynte. And as touchyng my maister, Sir
Thomas Mongomery, I trost veryly that he nothyr hath ne shall have cause
of grudger by my defaut, for I can not understond ony cause of grudger;
for ever whanne my cosyn Damme[281.1] hath spoken with my seid maisters
attourne to have knowelage by writyng of what thyng shuld be the cause
of callyng on you, he answerith that my maister, W. Paston, hath a bille
therof, but my cosyn can non gete. Wherfor I deme that the seid attourne
meneth not weel. I entende noon other but in als meche as in me is to se
your indempnyte with the grace of God, who ever mote be your guyde and
protector. Wretyn at Norwich the ij. day of Juylle.

  Your servaunt in that he can and may to his powar,

  I, JAMES GRESHAM.

Cosyn, an noon after this was wretyn, had I knowelage of the massageris
comyng to London berar of this, and I had thought to have wretyn the
letter above wretyn newe, by cause of the foule wrytyng and
interlynyeng, but now I lakke leyser. Wherfor I pray you understond the
pyth of my seid wrytyng, and enfourme my seid maister Sir John P. of the
same, for I wold fayne do that shulde please hym, &c. And the persone
that enfourmed me dar not be a knowe of his name, ne he wold not it
shuld be understond to them that be of counsell ageyn my maister. It was
the parson of Heylesdon, &c. More over, as I have wretyn to you of late,
Palmer, undershireve of Norffolk, hath sent his letter to his depute to
acomplyssh our entent for Chyldes matier as ye and I were accordet. This
told Wykes me for verray certeyn, &c., the ij. day of Juylle.

  On the back of this letter are some scribblings in another hand,
  viz.:--First, a partial copy of the address; second, the name 'John
  Dode'; third, the following inscription, 'Orate pro anima Johnnes
  (_sic_) de Boys _armenger_ de Londonn.'

    [Footnote 280.2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] As this letter has
    reference to the disputes between the Duke of Suffolk and the
    Paston family about Drayton, it might be supposed to have been
    written about the year 1464, but that the entire absence of any
    mention of John Paston the father makes it probable that the true
    date is after his death. It is therefore not unlikely to be of the
    same year as No. 671, in which Margaret Paston mentions the
    probability of Hellesdon being taken again out of their hands, and
    also desires an answer to a letter that she had sent to her son,
    Sir John, 'by James Gresham's man.']

    [Footnote 281.1: As it appears by the postscript that this letter
    was hurriedly despatched, we may perhaps presume that it was
    intended in the first instance for Sir John Paston, but that as
    'my cousin Damme' required to be informed of the same particulars,
    it was afterwards addressed to him, with instructions to
    communicate the contents to Sir John.]

MARGARET PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[282.1]

_To Sir John Paston, Knyght, be this delivered in hast._

[Sidenote: 1467 / JULY 11]

I grete you wele, and send you Godds blissyng and myn, letyng you wete
that Blykklyng of Heylesdon came fro London this weke, and he is right
mery, and maketh his bost that with in this fourtnyght at Heylesdon
shuld be bothe new lords and new officers. And also this day was brought
me word fro Caystr that Rysyng of Freton shuld have herd seid in diverse
places, ther as he was in Suffolk, that Fastolf of Coughawe maketh all
the strenght that he may, and proposith hym to assaught Caystr, and to
entre ther if he may, in samych that it is seyd that he hath a v. score
men redy, and sendyth dayly aspies to understand what felesshep kepe the
place. Be whos power, or favour, or supportacion that he wull do this,
I knowe not; but ye wote wele that I have ben affrayd ther befor this
tyme, whan that I had other comfort than I have now, and I can not wele
gide ner rewle sodyours, and also thei set not be a woman as thei shuld
set be a man. Therfor I wold ye shuld send home your brothers, or
ell[es] Dawbenye, to have a rewle, and to takyn in such men as wer
necessary for the saffegard of the place; for if I wer ther withought I
had the mor sadder or wurchepfull persones abought me, and ther comyn a
meny of knavys, and prevaylled in ther entent, it shuld be to me but a
vylney. And I have ben abought my liffelode to set a rewle ther in, as I
have wretyn to you, which is not yet all performed after myn desyre, and
I wuld not goo to Caystr till I had don. I wull no mor days make ther
abowtyn if I may; therfor in any wyse send sume body home to kepe the
place, and whan that I have do and performed that I have be gunne,
I shall purpose me thederward if I shuld do ther any good, and ell[es]
I had lever be thens.

I have sent to Nicholas, and such as kepe the place, that thei shuld
takyn in sume feles [_fellows_] to assiste and strengh them till ye send
hame sume other word, or sume other man to governe them that ben therin,
&c.

I marvayll gretly that ye send me no word how that ye do, for your
elmyse [_enemies_] begynne to wax right bold, and that puttith your
frends bothyn in grete fere and dought. Therfor purvey that thei may
have sume comfort, that thei be no more discoraged; for if we lese our
frends, it shall hard in this troubelous werd [_world_] to kete them
ageyn.

The blissid Trynyte spede you in your mater, and send you the victory of
your elmyse, to your herts eas and ther confusyon. Wretyn at Norwich,
the Saterday next befor Relyke Sonday,[283.1] in hast.

I pray you remembre wele the maters that I wrote to you for in the
letter that ye had be James Greshames man, and send me an answer ther of
be the next man that comyth, &c.

  Be your moder,

  M. P.

    [Footnote 282.1: [From Fenn, iv. 294.] This letter must have been
    written some time after Sir John Paston had obtained possession of
    Caister by virtue of the King's warrant of the 17th July 1466
    (No. 641), and before the Duke of Norfolk laid claim to it again
    in 1469. Thus the date is certainly either 1467 or 1468. But in
    the latter year Sir John Paston and his brother were both in
    Flanders at the marriage of the Princess Margaret to the Duke of
    Burgundy; and Daubeney could not have been with them, as he was
    when this letter was written, for John Paston the younger says he
    had sent him five shillings by Calle's man. Thus 1467 appears to
    be the only year possible.]

    [Footnote 287.1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 196.] The date of this
    letter is difficult to fix, but from the two brothers being
    together (which was rather a rare occurrence), and both in good
    health, the summer of 1467 seems not improbable. (_See_ No. 671.)
    The date must at least be earlier than Nov. 1469, when Sir John
    Paston, as we shall hereafter find, actually executed an indenture
    for the sale of East Beckham. It seems quite impossible, moreover,
    that this letter can be of the year 1469.]

ABSTRACT[289.1]

[Sidenote: 1467 / AUG. 31]

A small slip of paper close written on both sides with accounts of
wages. In the margin on one side is the name John Braham, with the
memorandum, 'Thys wrytynge, made the iiij^th yere of Kynge Edward the
iiij^th, and in the monyth of Novembre, wytnessez of the wagez that my
master payith to his men.' A blank seems to have been left below this at
first, but it was afterwards filled up in a different hand: 'Memorandum
that the v^e yer of Kyng Edward the iiij^e I rekenyd wyth my master at
Stoke; and on the v. day of Aprylle for the yerys that I have be wyth my
mastyr, whesche shal be at Hocke Monday next cumyng v^e yer and an
halfe; for the whesche yerys I have reseyvyd at sondery tymeys v_li._
and iiij_s._, and thys seyd v. day I reseyvyd of my master v. marcs.'

On the other side, in the first hand, is an account extending from the
11th April, 5 Edw. IV. (1465) to the last day of August, 7 Edw. IV.
(1467), of payments to a female named Rose,[289.2] for wages by 'my
master,' Braham and Thorpe. These sums vary from 3_s._ 4_d._ to 8_s._
4_d._, at a time; but there are also two items for presents made to her,
viz. for 4 ells of Holland cloth at 8-1/2_d._ the ell, 2_s._ 10-1/2_d._,
and for a pair of hosen, 12_d._ On the 7th Oct. 6 Edw. IV. (1466) it is
said, 'My master toke her for wages at Stoke, 5_s._'

ABSTRACT[290.1]

PETITION OF JOHN HERLYNG OF BASYNGHAM TO 'LADY' PASTON

[Sidenote: 1467 or later]

Requests 'her Highness' to confirm some grants of her late husband to
him of land at Basyngham. William Swan claims, and has taken from him 2
perches of ground in breadth near his (Swan's) gate, which has always
been parcel of Herlyng's tenement of Greyve's during his and his
father's time. John Pykerell, too, has made mean to the Abbot of St.
Benet's to remove a boundary stone which has stood there sixty years.
Pykerell also took the writer's horse and used it in his field without
leave, on Friday before the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, 6 Edw. IV.,
which made the beast unserviceable till Fastegong next following.
Pykerell has also done him other injuries.

  [As this petition refers to the 'Fastegong' or Shrovetide after
  Holy-Rood Day 6 Edw. IV. as a past date, it cannot have been drawn
  up earlier than the year 1467. The manor of Basingham, in Norfolk,
  belonged to the Mauteby family, and came to John Paston by marriage.
  This paper, therefore, was addressed to his widow Margaret.]

Ryght worchypfull maistras, aftyr dew recomendacion, please your gode

myght ben at Cambrygge, yn case hyt shall nat bee at Castre, nether at
Seynt Benetts, because that Universyte lyeth neere the cuntree of

London, my Lord Wynchester called me to hym yn presence of Sir John, and
desyrid hym effectually to be my gode wyller; and maister wold hafe no
wordes rehersed on my behalf, and he seyd full welle. Wold Jesu,
Maistras, that my gode maister that was som tyme your husbond, yn my
seyd Maister Fastolf lyfe dayes, as he shewed to me, their coude hafe
founded yn hys hert to hafe trusted and lovyd me as my Maister Fastolf
dyd, and that he wold not hafe geven credence to the malyciouse
contryved talys that Frere Brakley, W. Barker, and othyrs ymagyned
ontruly, savyng your reverence, of me. And now ye may opynly ondrestand
the sothe, and your son Sir John also; and yhyt for all that I put nevyr
my Maister Fastolf lyfelode yn trouble, for alle the unkyndnesse and
covetuse that was shewed me, as I hafe declared to the berer heroff,
that I know ye trust welle, to whom yn thys ye may gefe credence at thys
tyme.

God amend J. Russe. I wold he had ben at Irland for one day ys sake.

  Your,

  W. W.

And I thank you hertly for my pore woman, she shuld com to you at your
commaundment late or rathe, but for gelosye and mysdemyng of peple that
hafe me yn greete awayt; and ye know welle, maistras, better ys afrende
unknow then knowen; the world ys to mysdemyng and redy to make dyvysyon
and debate that comyth of an envyouse disposicion. And I am ryght glad
that Castr ys and shall be at your comaundment, and yowres yn

John Smyth, that Sir Thomas Howys seyd to me, was none holsom counceller
yn the reformacion of the last testament made but ij. executors to hafe
the rule allone. I wold he had nevyr medled of yt, that councell made

you and Sir Jamys, and also yn R. Toly that I undrestand hym close and
just.

I had no tyme to speke withyn now late, when I was but one day at
Norwych. W. Barker sclaundred me yn certeyn maters of gode to the some
of v^c. mark that Reynold Harneys shuld kepe and take me half. Wold Jesu
B[a]rker had seyd true, hyt myzt hafe do me moch gode! And, Maistras, as
I dar desyre you, I pray you recomaund me to my best maistras, your
moder Agnes, for she favorued me and dyd me grete cherytee, to be the
better disposed to hyr son, Maister John, and by my soule yt made me the
hertyer to safe the lyfelode fro trouble or from claymes, as I support

    [Footnote 293.1: [From Fenn, iv. 280.] It seems probable that this
    letter was written about the beginning of the year 1468. As to the
    time of year, we may judge by one expression that it was not very
    long after Christmas; and as the writer congratulates Margaret
    Paston that Caister is to be at her command, we may with great
    probability suppose the date to be about the same as that of the
    preceding document.]

HUGH FENN TO SIR JOHN PASTON[295.1]

landes. I sent my clerk to my mastresse, your moder, and the seid John
with hym therfor; and my mastresse wold hym come ageyn a nother day, for
Pecok was not thanne at home; so he ded, and can not have it, as he
seith, but that ye wold I shuld speke with you at Castr therof, and of
other maters he tolde me this day. And by cause of my moders yereday
holden this day, God have hir sowle, and to morwe shal be a good day,

tymes. I am the same man; I have sith I cam geten th'evidences in to myn

Sir J. Fastolf myght as wele a solde hym your lande or myn; and if the
sale be lawfull, I shal leve my hands at the first as I said at London.
The distresse to be kept for that, I wisse it nede not, and it was
unlawfully taken. Like it you to do delyvere the pore man his goods
ageyn, I am redy to answer you for elde and new as right wol. I shal

God ye do, and have you in His blissed governaunce. Wretyn at the hede
town of Norffolk this Tuysday.

    the other executors of Fastolf had released to Sir John Paston.
    The date could hardly be later than 1469, when Sir John was driven
    out of Caister by the Duke of Norfolk; and in 1469 he does not
    seem to have been residing there about Easter.]

JOHN PASTON THE YOUNGER TO MARGARET PASTON[297.2]

_To my ryght reverend and worchepfull modyr, Margaret Paston, dwellyng
at Caster, be thys delyveryed in hast._

[Sidenote: 1468 / JULY 8]

Ryth reverend and worchepfull modyr, I recomaund me on to you as
humbylly as I can thynk, desyryng most hertly to her of your welfare and
herts ese, whyche I pray God send yow as hastyly as my hert can thynk.
Ples yt yow to wete, that at the makyng of thys byll, my brodyr and I,
and all our felawshep, wer in good helle, blyssyd be God. As for the
gydyng her in thys contre, it is as worchepfull as all the world can
devyse it, and ther wer never Englyshe men had so good cher owt of
Inglong that ever I herd of.

As for tydyngs her, but if it be of the fest, I can non send yow; savyng
my Lady Margaret[297.3] was maryd on Sonday[297.4] last past, at a towne
that is callyd the Dame, iij. myle owt of Brugys, at v. of the clok in
the mornyng; and sche was browt the same day to Bruggys to hyr dener;
and ther sche was receyvyd as worchepfully as all the world cowd devyse,
as with presession with ladys and lordys, best beseyn of eny pepyll,
that ever I sye or herd of. Many pagentys wer pleyed in hyr wey in
Bryggys to hyr welcomyng, the best that ever I sye. And the same Sonday
my Lord the Bastard,[298.1] took upon hym to answere xxiiij. knyts and
gentylmen, with in viij. dayes at jostys of pese; and when that they wer
answeryd, they xxiiij. and hym selve schold torney with othyr xxv. the
next day aftyr, whyche is on Monday next comyng; and they that have
jostyd with hym into thys day, have ben as rychely beseyn, and hymselve
also, as clothe of gold, and sylk and sylvyr, and goldsmyths werk, myght
mak hem; for of syche ger, and gold, and perle, and stanys, they of the
Dwkys coort, neythyr gentylmen nor gentylwomen, they want non; for with
owt that they have it by wyshys, by my trowthe, I herd nevyr of so gret
plente as ther is.

Thys day my Lord Scalys[298.2] justyd with a Lord of thys contre, but
not with the Bastard; for they mad promyse at London that non of them
bothe shold never dele with othyr in armys; but the Bastard was one of
the Lords that browt the Lord Scalys in to the feld, and of mysfortwne
an horse strake my Lord Bastard on the lege, and hathe hurt hym so sore,
that I can thynk he shalbe of no power to acomplyshe up hys armys; and
that is gret pete, for by my trowthe I trow God mad never a mor
worchepfull knyt.

And as for the Dwkys coort, as of lords, ladys and gentylwomen, knyts,
sqwyers, and gentylmen, I hert never of non lyek to it, save Kyng
Artourys cort. And by my trowthe, I have no wyt nor remembrans to wryte
to yow, half the worchep that is her; but that lakyth, as it comyth to
mynd I shall tell yow when I come home, whyche I tryst to God shal not
be long to; for we depart owt of Brygys homward on Twysday next comyng,
and all folk that cam with my Lady of Burgoyn owt of Inglond, except
syche as shall abyd her styll with hyr, whyche I wot well shall be but
fewe.

We depart the soner, for the Dwk[299.1] hathe word that the Frenshe
Kyng[299.2] is purposyd to mak wer upon hym hastyly, and that he is with
in iiij. or v. dayis jorney of Brugys, and the Dwk rydyth on Twysday
next comyng, forward to met with hym; God geve hym good sped, and all
hys; for by my trowthe they are the goodlyest felawshep the ever I cam
among, and best can behave them, and most lyek gentylmen.

Othyr tydyngs have we non her, but that the Dwke of Somerset,[299.3] and
all hys bands depertyd welbeseyn owt of Brugys a day befor that my Lady
the Dwches cam thedyr, and they sey her, that he is to Qwen Margaret
that was, and shal no more come her ayen, nor be holpyn by the Dwk. No
more; but I beseche yow of your blyssyng as lowly as I can, whyche I
beseche yow forget not to geve me ever day onys. And, modyr, I beseche
yow that ye wolbe good mastras to my lytyll man, and to se that he go to
scole.

I sent my cosyn Dawbeney v_s._ by Callys man, for to bye for hym syche
ger as he nedyth; and, modyr, I pray yow thys byll may recomend me to my
sustyrs bothe, and to the mastyr, my cosyn Dawbeney, Syr Jamys,[299.4]
Syr John Stylle, and to pray hym to be good mastyr to lytyll Jak, and to
lerne hym well; and I pray yow that thys byll may recomand me to all
your folkys, and my wellwyllers. And I pray God send yow your herts
desyr.

SIR JOHN PASTON TO MRS. ANNE[300.2]

[Sidenote: 1468 / JULY 22]

Rythe it is so that I may not, as oft as I wold, be ther as [_i.e._
where] I might do my message myselff, myn owne fayir Mastresse Annes,
I prey yow to accept thys byll for my messanger to recomand me to yow in
my most feythfull wyse, as he that faynest of all other desyreth to

And, mastresse, thow so be that I as yet have govyn yow bot easy [_i.e._
little] cause to remembyr me for leke of aqweyntacion, yet I beseche
yow, let me not be forgotyn when ye rekyn up all yowr servaunts, to be
sett in the nombyr with other.

And I prey yow, Mastresse Annes, for that servyse that I owe yow, that
in as short tyme as ye goodly may that I myght be assarteynyd of yowr
entent and of your best frends in syche maters as I have brokyn to yow
of, whyche bothe your and myn ryght trusty frends John Lee, or ellys my
mastresse hys wyff, promysyd befor yow and me at our fyrst and last
being togedyr, that as sone as they or eyther of theym knewe your entent

that ye shalbe more aqweyntyd with it, or ellys it shalbe ayenst my
wyll; but yet, and when ye have red thys byll, I prey yow brenne it or
kepe it secret to yoursylff, as my feythefull trust is in yow.

    [Footnote 300.2: [From Fenn, ii. 294.] The Mrs. Anne to whom this
    letter was addressed seems to have been a Mrs. Anne Haute, to whom
    Sir John was for a long time engaged. That it was written before
    the year 1469 will appear probable on referring to Margaret
    Paston's letter written on Easter Monday (3rd April) in that year,
    in which she wishes to know for certain if he be engaged; and we
    have therefore little difficulty in referring it to the year 1468,
    when Sir John was over in Flanders at the marriage of the Princess
    Margaret to Charles of Burgundy. Mrs. Anne appears to have been a
    lady of English extraction, who was either born abroad or had
    passed most of her life on the Continent. She was, moreover,
    related to Lord Scales, and is therefore not unlikely to have been
    the daughter of one William Haute of Kent, who married at Calais,
    in 1429, the daughter of a certain Richard Wydeville. (See
    _Excerpta Historica_, p. 249.) But she could speak and even read
    English; and Sir John, who was now returning homewards to England,
    designed in this letter to open a correspondence with her. He
    appears, however, not to have despatched it, as the original
    remained among the papers of the Paston family; or else perhaps it
    was returned to him on the breaking off of the engagement.]

ABSTRACT[303.1]

[_Circa_ 1468.] Long declaration in English (on a paper roll) by Thomas
Howes, 'for the discharge of his conscience,' impugning the authenticity
of the will nuncupative, said to have been made by Sir J. Fastolf on the
day of his death, and propounded by John Paston and the said Thomas in
opposition to an earlier will propounded by Sir W. Yelverton and
W. Worcetyr; containing details intended to prove that the alleged will
was fabricated by Paston. Amongst other things, Howes says that at
Paston's desire he did, a year before Fastolf's death, move Fastolf that
Paston might buy three of his manors and live in his college, 'and the
seyd Fastolf, mevyd and passyoned gretely in his soule, seyd and swar by
Cryst ys sides, "And I knewe that Paston woolde by ony of my londes or
my godes he shulde nevyr be my feffe, nother myn executor." Albeyt he
seyde that he wolde suffer that the said Paston for terme of hys lyf
shall have a loggyng yn a convenyent place yn the seyd maner of Castre
withoute denyance of ony havyng intrest yn the seyd maner.

sodenly. She taryeth but of tythynges fro London. He spak nat with hyr.
I pray you speke to my Lorde of Zorke[304.2] for the subpena in the
Chanceri ayen William Paston that he take noon hurte. He desyrith to
write to yow for it. My Lorde of Northfolk men have warnid the tenantis
to pay you no mony, and thai speke alle in the Kynges name. Ye may tell
my Lorde of Yorke that it is open in every mannys mouth in this contre
the language that my Lorde of Yorke and my Lord of Warwik had to my

for ther bargans ar made condicionall, to holde and nat holde as afftir

ELIZABETH POYNINGS TO SIR JOHN PASTON[308.1]

_To the worshipful Sir John Paston, Knyght, be thys delveryd in hast._

[Sidenote: 1468(?) / DEC. 15]

Worshipfull and with all myn hert interly wilbeloved nevoue,
I recomaunde me to yow, desyryng to here of your prosperite and
wilefayr, which I pray All mighti God maynteyn and encres to His plesour
and your herts desir, thankyng God of your amendyng and helth;
furthermore, certefying yow that Sir Robert Fenys hath doon grete hurte
in the lyvelode whiche perteyned to my husbond and me in the Shire of
Kent, wherein William Kene and other persones arn enfeffid, and gretly
troubleth hit, and receyveth the issuez and profitez of gret part of
theym. And as of my seid husbonds lyvelode, aswell in the same shire as
in other shirez, besyde myn jounter, my seid husbond, whan he departyd
towarde the feld of Saint Albons, made and ordeyned his wille, that I
shuld have the rewell of all his lyvelode, and of Edwarde his soon and
myn, and to take the issuez and profitez of the seid lyvelode, to the
fyndyng of his and myn seid son, to paie his dettez, and to kepe the
right and title of the same lyvelode, which I myght nat accordyng
occupie for Sir Edwarde Ponyngs, myn seid husbonds brother; and so sith
myn seid husbonds departyng, I assigned that the seid Sir Edwarde for
certeyn yereez shuld have and take the revenuez of the maners of
Westwode, Estwell, Levelond, Horsmonden, Totyndon, Eccles, Staundon, and
Combesdon, parcell of the seid lyvelode, which arn clerely yerely worth
lxxvj_li._ xiij_s._ iiij_d._, to the entent that the seid Sir Edwarde
shuld paye myn husbonds dettez, for he wold not suffer me to be in rest
without that he myght have a rewell in the lyvelode; and after the seid
assignement made, the seid Robert Fenes, contrary to trowth, and
withoute cause of right, interupted me and the seid Sir Edwarde, aswell
of and in the seid maners as of other maners undirwretyn; wher uppon the
same Sir Edwarde suet unto the Kyngs Highnesse, and hade the Kyngez
honorable lettres undir his signet, directed to the said Sir Robert
Fenys, the tenour wherof I send unto yow herin inclosid; and as for
residue of the lyvelode of myn seid husbonds and myn, within the same
shire of Kent, wherin the said William Kene and other arn enfeffed, that
is to say, the maner of Tyrlyngham, Wolverton, Halton, Newyngton,
Bastram, Rokesley, and Northcray, with th'appurtenauncez, I of them, by
myn seid husbonds wille, shuld have residue, and take the issuez and
profitez of theym, contrarye to right and conciens, takyng away my
ryght, and brekyng my said husbonds wille, the seid Robert Fenys hath
doon gret wast and hurte ther, and long tym hath take upe the revenuez
and profitez of the same, wher thorough I have not my ryght, and the
seid wille may not be performed.

Wherfor I hertely pray yow that ze will labour unto the Kynges Highnes,
at yt lyketh hym addres his honorable lettres to be directed to the seid
Robert Fenys, dischargyng hym utterly of the menuraunce, occupacion, and
receyt of the revenuez of the said maners of Tyrlyngham and other,
accordyng to the tenour of the lettres labored by Sir Edwarde, for the
maners assigned to hym from the Kyngs Highnes, directyd to the same
Robert Fynes, or strayter if hit may be, and that I and myn assignez may
peasseble rejoie theym; and if eny person wold attempt to do the
contrarye, that a comaundement, yf it ples the Kyngs Hignes, by hym
myght be yevyn to my Lorde Chaunceller to seall writtyngs sufficiaunt
with his gret seall, in eydyng and assisting me and myn assignez in this
same.

And as for the maners of Esthall, Faukham, Asslie, and Chelsfeld, with
th'appurtenauntez in the seid schire of Kent, whereof my hysbond at his
departur was seassed, and my son sethens, unto the tyme that the Erle of
Kent[310.1] without eny inquission or title of right for the Kyng, by
colour of the Kynges lettres patentes, entret into theym, and hym therof
put owte, and now my Lorde of Essex[310.2] occupieth them in lyke maner
and forme; yf eny remedy therin wilbe hade, I pray yow attempt hit.

Also, forther more, I hertely pray yow that if eny generall pardon be
grauntyd, that I may have on for John Dane my servaunt, whom the said
Robert Fenys of gret malice hath endyted of felonye, and that ze
secretly labour this, and send me an aunswer in writtyng in as godly
hast as ze may. As soon as that may ples yow to send me passels of
costes and expences ze bere and pay for the said causez, I will truely
content yow hit of the same, and over that rewarde yow to your plessour
by the grace of Jesu, quo have yow in His blessed keping. Wrettyn in
Suthwerk the xv^th daie of Decembyr.

  Be your awnt,

  ELIZABETH PONYNGS.

    [Footnote 308.1: [From Fenn, iv. 266.] Elizabeth Paston, as we
    have seen (No. 374), had married Robert Poynings by the beginning
    of January 1459. We must, however, correct a slight inaccuracy in
    the preliminary note to that letter, where it is said that by the
    year 1470 they must have been married several years. Their union,
    in fact, lasted little more than two years; for Robert Poynings
    was slain at the second battle of St. Albans on the 17th February
    1461. The inquisition _post mortem_, taken some years afterwards
    (9 and 10 Edw. IV., No. 49), gives that day as the date of his
    death. His son and heir, Edward, named in this letter (who was
    afterwards Lord-Deputy of Ireland in the reign of Henry VII.), was
    probably born towards the close of the year 1459, for he is
    mentioned at the date of the inquisition (31st Jan. 49 and 1 Hen.
    VI., _i.e._ 1471) as eleven years old and over. Elizabeth Poynings
    must have remained a widow some years; but before 1472 she had
    married Sir George Browne of Betchworth, Surrey. This letter is
    certainly of later date than No. 627, for the lands which she was
    then endeavouring to recover from the Earl of Kent were now
    occupied by the Earl of Essex. It may perhaps have been a year or
    two after 1466, but it was probably not later than 1469, as in
    1470 Henry VI. was restored, and Essex, being a Yorkist, would not
    have been so powerful. The year 1468 must be a tolerable
    approximation to the true date.]

THE KING TO SIR ROBERT FYNYS

Commanding him not to levy the rents of Westwode, Estwell, Levelond,
Horsmonden, Totyngdon, Eccles, Stondon, and Comebesdane in Kent.

  Poynings referred to in the preceding letter. Below is written, 'The

    [Footnote 311.2: [From Fenn, iv. 100.] The writer of this brief
    and enigmatical letter was the second husband of Elizabeth Paston,
    as mentioned in the preliminary note to No. 692 preceding. If the
    John Paston, Esquire, to whom it is addressed be the first of that
    name, that is to say, Elizabeth Paston's brother, the date is not
    later than 1466; but as it was certainly some years later before
    the writer became connected with the Pastons by marriage, the
    person addressed is more probably John Paston the youngest,
    brother of Sir John. The date of this communication, however, is
    unimportant. Its purport, of which Fenn has suggested rather a
    complicated explanation, appears to me simply a promise of secrecy
    on some subject: '_Loyaute, aime_ (_i.e._ Honour bright, my dear
    friend). It shall never come out for me.']

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
