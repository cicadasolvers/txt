THE TRIAL AND EXECUTION

OF

MARK AND PHILLIS,

IN 1755.


     [The following pages are, with slight changes, a reprint
     from the Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical
     Society, of a paper read before that Society, March 8, 1883,
     in answer to a question propounded at a previous meeting,
     relative to the authenticity of the tradition that a woman
     was burned to death in Massachusetts in the year 1755. As
     this case is the only known instance of the infliction of
     the common-law penalty for petit treason, in New England,
     and is not known to have been elsewhere reported, the
     printers have, at the author's request, struck off, in
     pamphlet form, a limited number of impressions for the use
     of persons interested in the history of our criminal
     jurisprudence, who may not have convenient access to the
     serial from which it is taken, or who may desire to preserve
     it separately.]

It is not surprising that the execution of a woman, by burning, so
lately as when Shirley was governor,--a period when the province had
greatly advanced in culture and refinement,--should seem to any one
incredible. Indeed, even so critical and thorough a student of our
provincial history as our late distinguished associate, Dr. Palfrey,
once wrote to me inquiring if the rumor of such a proceeding had any
foundation in fact, and if so, whether the execution took place
according to law, or by the impulse of an infuriated mob. It gave me
great satisfaction to be able to settle his doubts on this subject by
referring him to the records of the Superior Court of Judicature,
where the judgment, from which I shall presently read to you, and a
copy of which I sent to him, appears at length.

The subject is important at this day only as serving to define the
nature of the "cruel and unusual punishments" prohibited by the
thirty-first article of the Declaration of Rights, in our state
Constitution, since this mode of punishment, having continued after
the adoption of the Constitution, cannot have been considered by the
framers of that instrument either as "cruel" or "unusual" in the sense
in which they used these words.

The particulars of the crime for which the malefactors, Mark and
Phillis, were executed are briefly as follows: Captain John Codman, a
thrifty saddler, sea-captain, and merchant, of Charlestown, was the
owner of several slaves whom he employed either as mechanics, common
laborers, or house servants. Three of the most trusted of these, Mark,
Phillis, and Phebe,--particularly Mark,--found the rigid discipline of
their master unendurable, and, after setting fire to his workshop some
six years before, hoping by the destruction of this building to so
embarrass him that he would be obliged to sell them, they, in the year
1755, conspired to gain their end by poisoning him to death.

In this confederacy some five or six negroes belonging to other owners
were more or less directly implicated. Mark, the leader, was able to
read, and signed his examination, hereafter referred to, in a bold,
legible hand. He professed to have read the Bible through, in order to
find if, in any way, his master could be killed without inducing
guilt, and had come to the conclusion that according to Scripture no
sin would be committed if the act could be accomplished without
bloodshed. It seems, moreover, to have been commonly believed by the
negroes that a Mr. Salmon had been poisoned to death by one of his
slaves, without discovery of the crime. So, application was made by
Mark, first to Kerr, the servant of Dr. John Gibbons, and then to
Robin, the servant of Dr. Wm. Clarke, at the North End of Boston, for
poison from their masters' apothecary stores, which was to be
administered by the two women.

Essex, the servant of Thomas Powers, had also furnished Mark with a
quantity of "black lead" for the same purpose. This was,
unquestionably, not the harmless plumbago to which that name is now
usually given, but galena, or _plumbum nigrum_, a native sulphuret of
lead, probably used for a glaze by the potters of Charlestown.

Kerr declined to have any hand in the business; but Robin twice
obtained and delivered to Mark a quantity of arsenic, of which the
women, Phebe and Phillis, made a solution which they kept secreted in
a vial, and from time to time mixed with the water-gruel and sago
which they sometimes gave directly to their victim to eat, and at
other times prepared to be innocently administered to him by one of
his daughters. They also mixed with his food some of the "black lead,"
which Phillis seems to have thought was the efficient poison, though
it appeared from the testimony that he was killed by the arsenic.

The crime was promptly traced home to the conspirators; and on the
second day of July, the day after Captain Codman's death, a coroner's
jury found that he died from poison feloniously procured and
administered by Mark. Ten days later, Quaco,--the nominal husband of
Phebe, and one of the negroes implicated,--who was the servant of Mr.
James Dalton, of Boston, was examined before William Stoddard, a
justice of the peace, and on the same day Robin was arrested and
committed to jail. The examination of Quaco was followed by the
examination of Mark, and of Phillis, later in the month. These last
were taken before the Attorney-General and Mr. Thaddeus Mason.

At the term of the "Superiour Court of Judicature, Court of Assize,
and General Goal Delivery," held at Cambridge on the second Tuesday of
August following, the grand jury found a true bill for petit treason
against Phillis, and against Mark and Robin as accessories before the
fact. As this is the only indictment for this offence known to have
been found in Massachusetts, and was drawn by that eminent lawyer,
Edmund Trowbridge, then Attorney-General, it is worthy of being
preserved in print, in connection with the coroner's verdict and the
examinations of the suspected parties, which are as follows:--

Porringer that my Master's Sagoe was in, he complain'd it was gritty;
and that made Miss Molly look into the Porringer, and finding the Lead
there, she ask'd me what it was, I told her I did not know.--I
cleaned the Skillet the Sagoe was boiled in and found some of the same
stuff in the bottom of the skillet that was in the bottom of the
Porringer. And presently after Mark was carried to Goal, Tom brought a
Paper of the Potter's Lead out of the Blacksmith's Shop, which he said
he found there; and I saw it and am sure it was the same with that

_Quest._ How much Powder was there in the Paper?

_Answr._ There was a good deal of it I believe near an ounce.

_Quest._ Did you put all that Powder into the Vial?

_Answr._ No, I put in but a little of it, only so much as lay on
the Point of a narrow Piece of flat Iron, with which I put it in,
which Iron Mark made & gave it to me to give to Phebe, Mark gave me
the sd Iron the Saturday before the Sabbath aforesd. I ask'd him
what it was for, he would not tell me; he said Robbin gave him one,
and he had lost it; and that he himself went into the shop and made
this. I gave the sd Iron to Phoebe that same afternoon, in the
Kitchen; and the next morning she gave it to me in the Garret, and
Quaco was there with her; she whisper'd to me and told me to take the
Paper of Powder which was in the hollow over the Window, and the flat
Iron which was with it and put some of it into the Vial with the Iron
which I did; and she bid me put some water into it, but I did not; but
she afterwards put some in herself, as she told me, and she put it
into the Closet in the Kitchen in a Corner behind a black Jug; and the
same Vial was kept there untill my master dyed.

Chocalate?

_Answr._ Phoebe did, and Master afterwards eat it.

_Quest._ Who pour'd it into his barly Drink?

_Answr._ I did it myself; I pour'd a drop out of the Vial into the
barly Drink, & I felt ugly, and pour'd the Water out of the mug again
off from the Barly, and put clean Water into the mug again & cover'd
it over that it might boil quick.

_Quest._ Who pour'd the Water out of the Vial into the Infusion?

_Answr._ Phoebe did.

_Quest._ How do you know it?

_Quest._ Who got this last Powder?

_Answr._ Mark got it.

_Quest._ What did he do with it?

_Answr._ He gave it to me; in our little House.

_Quest._ What Sort of Powder was it that Mark gave You?

_Answr._ I[t?] was white the same as the first.

_Quest._ What was it in?

_Answr._ In a Peice of Paper; he had more of that Powder than he
gave me, it was in a Paper folded up in a long Square, he tore off
Part of that Paper, and put Some of the Powder into it, and gave it to
me and kept the rest himself. and at the same time that he gave it to
me he told me that Robbin said we were damn'd Fools we had not given
Master that first Powder at two Doses, for it wou'd have killed him,
and no Body would have known who hurt him, for it was enough to kill
the strongest man living; upon which I ask'd Mark how he knew, it
would not have been found out, he said that Mr. Salmon's Negros
poison'd him, and were never found out, but had got good masters, & so
might we.

_Quest._ What did you do with that Powder which Mark gave you?

_Answr._ I put it into the Vial, & set it in the Same Place it was
in before, there was some of the first Powder & Water remaining in the
Vial when I put this last in.

_Quest._ Do you know that any of the Water that was in the Vial after
you put this last Powder in was given to your Master?

_Answr._ No, he never had a drop of it. The next Day after Master
died Mark came into the Closet where I was eating my Dinner and ask'd
me for that Bottle. I ask'd him what he wanted it for, and he would
not tell me, but insisted upon having it, upon which I told him that
it was there behind the Jugg, and he took it and went directly down to
the Shop in the yard, and I never saw it afterwards 'till Justice
Mason shew it to me, on the Fast Day night.

_Quest._ Do you know where Mark got that Powder which he gave to you?

_Answr._ He had it of Robbin, Doctr Clark's Negro; that liv'd
with Mr. Vassall.

_Quest._ How do you know that Mark had that Powder of Robbin?

_Answr._ The Thursday night before my master died Mark told me he
was going over to Boston to Robbin to get some more Powder for he
sd: Phoebe told him yt the other was all out; and Mark went
over to Boston, and return'd again about nine o'Clock; and I ask'd
Mark if he had got it, and he told me no, he had not, but Robbin was
to bring it over the next night; and between 8 & 9 o'Clock that next
night, a negro Fellow came to me in our Yard & ask'd me for Mark, And
I ask'd him his name but he would not tell me, and I said to him,
Countryman, if you'l tell me your name I'll call Mark, for I know
where he is, but he would not, I then askt him if he was not Robbin
Vassall, (for I mistrusted it was he) and upon that he laughed and
said his name was not Robbin Vassall, but he came out of the Country
and wanted to see Mark very much about his Child; and upon my refusing
to tell him where Mark was the negro went away down to the Ferry, and
I followed him at some distance & saw him go into the Ferry Boat, and
the Boat put off, with him in it. That same Fryday, in the afternoon,
Mark told me, if any Negro Fellow shou'd come; & say that he came out
of the Country to call him, I ask'd him what negro it was that he
expected wou'd come; he told me it was Robbin, and that he was to say
that he came out of the Country to speak with Mark about his Child,
and bid me tell no Body about it.

_Quest._ Do you know Robbin Doctr. Clark's negro?

_Answr._ I do, and have known him for many years.

_Quest._ How then happen'd it that you cou'd not certainly tell
whether the negro aforesd. that askt for Mark was Robbin or not?

_Answr._ Because it was dark, So dark I cou'd not see his Face so
as certainly to know him, but I am fully satisfyed it was Robbin.

_Quest._ What Reason have you to be satisfyed it was Robbin?

_Answr._ That same night I told Mark that a negro Fellow had been
there and ask'd for him & wanted him, he ask'd me why I did not call
him, I told him our Folks called me and I could not, Mark told me he
was very Sorry I did not, and asked me if he gave me any Thing, I told
him he did not, he said he was very sorry he did not; then I ask'd him
who it was, and he said it was Robbin, and then he told me that he
thought Robbin & he had been playing blind-mans Buff, for they had
been over the Ferry twice that night and mist one another; and that
Elijh Phipps & Timo Rand told him that a negro Fellow had been over
the Ferry to speak with him about his Child. And then Mark told me he
would the next Night go over to Robbin and get some more of the same
Powder, and would bring it over on the Sabbath Day, & he went to
Boston on the Saturday night, but did not return till Monday morning,
when he brought it and gave it to me in the little House, as I told
you before.

_Quest._ Did you see Robbin at Charlstown in the Time of your master's
sickness or about the Time of his Death?

_Answr._ Yes, I saw him on ye Tuesday the Ship was launched,
when my master catch'd Mark buying Drink at Mrs Shearman's to treat
him with, & drove him away; and I saw him at Charlstown on the
Saturday after my Master was buried; but I did not speak with him at
either of those Times. The Tuesday he was before our Shop Door, in the
Street, with Mark and had a Bag upon his shoulder; and on the Saturday
in the afternoon I saw him going up the Street by our House, while
Phoebe and I were washing in the back yard; I told Phoebe there
was Robbin a going along this minit, and she said is he? and ask'd me
what Cloaths he had on; I told her he had a bluish Coat on lined with
a straw coloured or yellow lining and the Cuffs open & lined with the
said Yellow lining, and that he had a black wigg on; and I told
Phoebe I believed he was gone up to Mark to tell him not to own that
he had given any Thing to him, and Phoebe said she believed so to;
and I went into the street to the Pump with a Pail to get some Water,
designing to see whether he went that Way, and I saw him go right up
the main street, and I could see him as far up as Mr. Eleazer
Phillips's, and I did not see him afterwards. I never see him with a
Wigg on before, but as he went by us he look'd me full in the Face and
I knew it was Robbin. When I told Phoebe that Robbin was going by, I
thought she saw him, but she questioned whether it was he, and I told
her I was sure it was he, for I had known him ever since he was a boy,
and I told her I would lay a mug of Flip that it was he, but she wou'd
not; and then it was that I told her I believed he was gone up to Mark
&c.

_Quest._ Do you know what Powder that was which Mark & Phoebe gave
you, and you put into the Vial?

_Answr._ Mark told me it was Ratsbane, but I told Phoebe I
believed Mark lied & that it was only burnt allom, for I told her,
that upon taking Ratsbane they would directly swell, and Master did
not swell; and she said she believed so to.

_Quest._ How many Times was any of that Water, which was in the Vial
aforesd., put into your master's victuals?

_Answr._ Not above Seven Times.

_Quest._ When was the first Time?

_Answr._ The next Monday morning after Phoebe gave me the first
Powder. then it was put into his Chocalate, by Phoebe. The next was
also put in to his Chocalate by Phoebe on the next Wednesday
morning, and I thinking she put in more than she should, told her her
hand was heavy, and there was no more put in, that, I know of till the
next Fryday, when Phoebe put some into his Chocalate, and my Master
eat the Chocalate all the three times aforesaid in the Kitchen, and I
was there & saw him; The next was on the Saturday following, when I
put Some into his Watergruel, but I felt ugly and threw it away, and
made some fresh, and did not put any into that. The next was on the
afternoon of the same Saturday, I made him some more Watergruel &
pour'd some of the Water out of the Vial into it, and it turned
yellow, and Miss Betty, ask'd me what was the matter with the
Watergruel and I gave her no answer; but that was thrown away, and
more fresh made, and Miss Molly was going to put the same Plumbs in
again, and Phoebe told her not to do it, but she had better put in
some fresh Plumbs, and she did; and no Poison was put into that; It
was by Phoebe's advice that I put it into the first this afternoon.
And he had no more, that I know of 'till the next Monday night, when
Mark put some of the Potter's Lead into Masters Sagoe.

_Quest._ How do you know that Mark put any of the Potter's Lead into
the Sagoe?

_Answer._ When I went out of the Kitchen I left the Sagoe in the
little Iron Skillet on the Fire, and no body was in the Kitchen then,
but when I returned, Mark was Sitting on a Form in the Corner, and I
afterwards found Some of that Lead in the Skillet, and neither
Phoebe nor I had any Such Lead.

_Quest._ Do you know of any other Poison prepar'd for, or given to
your Master?

_Answr._ No, I do not.

_Quest._ Who was it that first contrived the poisoning your Master
Codman?

_Answr._ It was Mark who first contrived it, He told Phoebe and I
that he had read the Bible through, and that it was no Sin to kill him
if they did not lay violent Hands on him So as to shed Blood, by
sticking or stabbing or cutting his Throat.

_Quest._ When was it that Mark first proposed the poisoning his
Master?

_Answr._ Some time last Winter; he proposed it to Phoebe and I,
but we would not agree to it, and told him No Such Thing should be
done in the House; This before my Master brought him home from Boston.

_Quest._ Did he ever afterwards propose the poisoning his sd
Master?

_Answr._ Yes he did, a Week or a Fortnight after my Master brought
him home from Boston, he proposed it to me first, and I would not
agree to it, and then he proposed it to Phoebe.

_Quet._ What Reason did Mark give for poisoning his Master?

_Answ._ He said he was uneasy and wanted to have another Master, and
he was concerned for Phoebe and I too.

_Quest._ Do you know how your Master's Work house that was burnt down
came on Fire?

_Answr._ Yes I do.

_Quest._ How came it on fire?

_Answr._ I set it on fire, but it was thro' Mark's means, he gave
me no rest 'till I did it.

_Quest._ How did you Set your Master's Work House on fire?

_Answr._ I threw a Coal of Fire into some Shavings between the
Blacksmith's Shop & the Work House, and I went away & did not see it
kindle.

_Quest._ Who put the Shavings there?

_Answr._ Mark did.

_Quest._ Was any Body concern'd in the burning the Work house
besides Mark and you?

_Answr._ Yes, Phoebe knew about it as well as I.

_Quest._ Where was Phoebe & Mark when you put the Coal of Fire into
the Shavings?

_Answr._ The were up Garret in bed.

_Quest._ Who first proposed the Setting the Workhouse on fire? and
what reason was given for doing it?

_Answr._ Mark first proposed it, to Phoebe and I; and the Reason
he gave us was that he wanted to get to Boston, and if all was burnt
down, he did not know what Master could do without selling us.

_Quest._ Why did you, when Phoebe pour'd Some of the Water out of
the Vial into the Chocalate tell her, "her hand was heavy?"

_Answr._ I thought she pour'd in too much, more than she should I
felt ugly and I wan't willing she shou'd put in so much and that he
should be kill'd so quick. Mark's orders were to give it in two Doses,
that was the Directions Robbin gave to Mark, as Mark told me, and Mark
Said Robbin told him there was no more taste in it than in Cold Water.

_Quest._ Why did you not tell your Master or some of the Family that
Phoebe had poisoned the Chocalate, and thereby prevent your Master's
eating it?

_Answr._ I do not know why I did not tell.

The mark of X Phillis.

little below Mr. Waite's Slaughter house; And they went with me
into the Lane leading from the market Place to the long Wharffe near
Mrs. Shearman's, while I went into Mrs. Shearmans and got a mug
of Toddy, in the mug I brought from Mr. Harris's Work house, and I

any Thing.

did you call him back?

have any more Drink?

_Answr._ Yes, my master told her not to sell any Drink to any of
his Servants.

_Quest._ Did Robbin know of it?

_Answr._ Not that I know of; he see master go into Mrs.
Shearman's Shop, and pass'd by Robbin in the Lane as Robbin told me.

_Quest._ Did you ever apply to any body else, besides Robbin for
Poison?

_Answr._ No, only to Carr, Doctr. Gibbon's negro man, and then
Phoebe sent me for it. She had been with Carr before on the same
account, & he told her he cou'd not get her any then, as she told me;

_Quest._ Did you get any Poison of Carr?

_Ansr._ No, he told me he wou'd not let me have any, untill he had

you but wou'd not take it, and now he shou'd not have a farthing or

some more Poison, and that he came over the Ferry in another Boat and
so you mist each other and that he Robbin pretended to the Ferry-man
that he was a Country negro and wanted to see you about your Child, or
Words to that Effect?

_Answr._ I never told them or either of them so.

_Quest._ How came that Viall buried near your Forge in the
Black-Smith's Shop, that you told Mr. Kettell of, and he found
there?

_Answr._ I buried it there.

_Quest._ When did you bury it there?

_Answr._ In the afternoon of that Day that master dyed.

_Quest._ Where did you get that Vial?

_Answr._ I took it from Phillis that same Afternoon.

_Answr._ No. When I took it from Phillis she own'd that Phoebe
had given the first Poison that I brought to master; and that she and
Phoebe had given him all the Rest saving what was then in the
Bottle. and thereupon I went to Phoebe and charged her with it, she
at first deny'd it, but at last own'd it it and begg'd me to say
nothing about it; I told her if I had known she wou'd have put it to
that use I would not have got it for her; then I call'd Pompey to go
down to the shop with me for I wanted to speak with him, intending to
shew him the Vial, and he came into the shop but before I had an
opportunity to speak to him Mr. Kettell took me.

_Quest._ Where was the Vial when you talked with Phoebe as
aforesd?

_Answr._ I had it in my Pocket, and told her so, then I went into
the shop and buried it, then I went into the House immediately to call
Pompey to shew it to him.

_Quest._ Why did you bury the Vial before you called Pompy? or shew it
to any body?

_Answr:_ I buried it because I did not want any body should see it
before I shewed it to him.

_Questn._ Have you lately had any Potters powder'd Lead by you or
in your Possession?

_Answr._ Only that I had from Essex Powars; which was as I suppose
ground to Powder.

_Quest._ When did you get that powder'd Lead of Essex?

_Ansr:_ I had it of him that Day I went there for six butter Pots,
which my master's son Isaac sent me for.

_Quest._ What did you get that Lead for?

_Answr._ To see if it would melt in our Fire. upon a Dispute
between Tom and I about it; Tom said it would melt, and I told him I
did not believe it would; I carried it home and laid it upon the Wall
Plate in the Blacksmith's shop, and I never moved it afterwards or
thought any Thing about it, 'till it was show'd to me by the Justice.

_Quet._ Do you know that any Part of that Lead you had of Essex or any
Lead like unto it was given to your master or put into his Victuals or
Drink?

_Answr._ I do not.

_Quest._ Do you know of any Proposal made of poisoning your master?

_Answ._ No, I do not, nor ever heard any such Thing proposed by any
Body.

_Quest._ Do you know of any Cushoe nuts being procured for that
Purpose?

_Answr._ No; I have not seen a Cushoe nut since I have been in this
Country.

_Quest._ Do you know of any Copperas or Green stuff being provided for
that Purpose?

_Answr._ No I do not.

_Quest._ What Time on the Saturday before your master dyed was it that
you heard Phoebe ask Phillis, if she had given him enough, and
Phillis said she had, and would stick as close to him as his Shirt to
his Back?

_Answr._ In the afternoon about Dark; and before I went to Boston.

_Quest._ How came you, after you had heard this Talk between Phoebe
and Phillis, to get her sd. Phoebe more Poison?

_Answr._ I did not know what she meant by their Talk, nor who they
meant, by him.

_Quest._ Did you tell Carr that Phoebe sent you for that Poison you
applyed to him for?

_Answr._ She did not tell me it was Poison, but told me to ask Carr
for that Thing he had promised her; he said he knew what it was and
would not send it, 'till he had talked to Quaco, and did not know that
he should send it afterwards; and I said no more to Carr about it.

_Quest._ Did you ever ask Carr at any other Time for Poison?

_Ansr._ No.

_Quest._ Did you never ask him for something to Poison or kill a Dog?

_Answr._ No, not that I know of.

_Quest._ Was you ever bit by a Dog?

_Answr._ No. I never was.

_Quest._ Do you know any Thing more of your master's being poisoned
than you have before related?

_Ansr._ No, I do not.

The case was tried, at the same term at which the parties were
indicted, before Stephen Sewall, chief justice, and Benjamin Lynde,
John Cushing, and Chambers Russell, associate justices,--all fairly
read in the law, and the Chief Justice eminent in his profession.
Samuel Winthrop and Nathaniel Hatch, jointly, were clerks of the
court.[3]

[Footnote 3: This is assumed to be the case, since both these clerks
officially signed papers in this very case, though, from the loose
custom which gradually obtained with the clerks of our highest
judicial court, of not recording their appointments, it is impossible
to verify this statement by the record. Samuel Tyley, Jr., and
Benjamin Rolfe were sworn in as joint clerks of this court, Feb. 26,
1718, and Samuel Winthrop was clerk as early as June, 1745, and
Nathaniel Hatch as early as September, 1752.]

Mark and Phillis were convicted, and sentence of death was pronounced
upon them in strict conformity to the common law of England. On the
6th of September, a warrant for their execution was issued, under the
seal of the court, commanding Richard Foster, Sheriff of Middlesex, to
perform the last office of the law, on the 18th of the same month; and
upon this warrant the sheriff made return upon the day of the
execution.

The subpoenas to the witnesses against the accused, the caption and
conclusion of the record of the case, and the warrant for the
execution of the condemned are as follows:--

I Executed this warrant as above directed, by causing Phillis to be
burnt to Death, and Mark to be hang'd by the neck until he was dead,
between the hours of one and five a Clock of Said day--

RICHD. FOSTER _Sheriff_

       *       *       *       *       *

It is worthy of observation that no such process as a formal warrant
was required for a capital execution by the laws of England. In the
King's Bench, the prisoner was committed to the custody of the marshal
at the beginning of the trial, and an award of judgment upon the
record was all the authority that that officer had for the execution.
Formerly, it was customary in courts of oyer and terminer, and of jail
delivery, to authorize the execution by a precept under the hands and
seals of three or more commissioners, of whom one, at least, should be
of the quorum; but this custom had become obsolete at the time of this
trial, and only a calendar, or abstract of the record, subscribed by
the judge, was put into the hands of the sheriff for this purpose; and
such is the practice in England, I presume, to this day.

Even Blackstone, who is so blind to many gross imperfections in the
jurisprudence of his native country, is forced to remark, in view of
the looseness of procedure in capital cases,--

     "It may certainly afford matter of speculation that in civil
     causes there should be such a variety of writs of execution
     to recover a trifling debt, issued in the king's name, and
     under the seal of the court, without which the sheriff
     cannot legally stir one step; and yet that the execution of
     a man, the most important and terrible task of any, should
     depend upon a marginal note."[6]

[Footnote 6: Comm. book iv. ch. 32, p. 403.]

The courts and people of New England were always more mindful of the
sacredness of human life than those of other nations, save, perhaps,
the little community of the Netherlands. They also attached great
importance to the formal proceedings by which the ends of justice
were reached in criminal cases. This is well illustrated by an
incident that is recorded relative to the action of the judges of the
Superior Court of the Province when, after the conviction of
Richardson for the murder of the boy Sneider, in 1770, it became
evident to them that the cause of justice required that they should
intercede to prevent his execution. They were long in doubt as to the
sufficiency of a pardon obtained from the crown through the
recommendation of the Lieutenant-Governor upon their certificate of
its propriety, the only evidence of the pardon being its insertion in
the Newgate Calendar. Hutchinson relates that "they were at length
satisfied; and the prisoner having been brought into court early in
the morning, when scarcely anybody but the officers of the court were
present, pleaded his Majesty's pardon, and was discharged, and
immediately absconded."[7]

[Footnote 7: Hist. Mass. Bay, vol. iii. p. 287, n.]

But, to proceed with a definition of the crime committed by these
negroes, and a more particular account of the punishment for petit
treason:--

By the statute 25 Edw. III., this crime, which had had a wider
application, was restricted to three classes of cases: 1, where a
servant killed his master or mistress; 2, where a wife killed her
husband; 3, where a clergyman killed his prelate, or the superior to
whom he owed canonical obedience. The sentence in the case of a woman
was, that she be burned to death, and in the case of a man, that he be
drawn to the place of execution and there hanged by the neck until he
be dead.[8] To mitigate the sufferings of felons at the stake, the
executioner usually fastened one end of a cord to the stake, and
bringing this cord around the neck of the woman, pulled it tightly the
moment the torch was applied, and continued the strain until life was
extinct, which, unless the cord was sooner burnt asunder, generally
happened before the condemned had suffered much from the intensity of
the flames.

[Footnote 8: By stat. 22 Hen. VIII. ch. 9, a person of either sex, who
was convicted of murdering another by poison, was to be boiled to
death, and the offence was, by the same act, declared high treason;
but this act was repealed by 1 Edw. VI. ch. 12, after several
executions under it, including that of Margaret Davy, who poisoned her
mistress. Though by the common law poisoning was deemed a most
atrocious circumstance, it did not alter the punishment of the
principal crime involved. The law considered only the crime, and not
the manner in which it was committed.]

In cases of high treason, other barbarities were practised upon the
bodies of the criminals, but these were frequently, and in cases of
persons of distinction, generally, remitted. Indeed, even the hanging
was dispensed with in these latter cases; and hence we read of the
execution of great prisoners of state, male and female, by beheading,
which, strictly, is a manner of death unknown to the laws of England,
except as an incident to the principal penalty by hanging or burning.
After the hanging, the body, according to rule, was to be cut down (if
possible, while yet alive) to be eviscerated, then beheaded, and the
trunk and limbs divided into four parts, to be disposed of as the
sovereign should order. By special writ, under the privy seal, all
these circumstances, except decapitation, were, as I have already
said, usually omitted.

All male persons convicted whether of high treason or of petit treason
were, unless specially exempted in the manner I have stated, _drawn_
to the place of execution. This was originally an ignominious incident
of the terrible penalty, and required that the criminal should be
rudely pulled along over the ground, behind a horse; later, however, a
hurdle or wicker frame, or a sledge,--that is, as we call it, a
sled,--was used, either from motives of humanity, or in order to
prolong the life of the traitor through subsequent stages of the
punishment. According to Sir Matthew Hale, women were not to be drawn,
in cases of petit treason, although the practice of later times,
certainly, was to the contrary.[9] However, after the repeal in 1790,
of the law for burning women, for which drawing and hanging were then
substituted, women as well as men were sentenced to be drawn to the
place of execution.

[Footnote 9: The law was uncertain; but Hale appears to be the safest
authority. Wood, in his Institutes,--at the time of this trial the
most recent and popular treatise upon the laws of England,--states
that women were to be drawn, in petit treason; as, indeed, do most, if
not all, succeeding writers. They follow Coke, 3 Inst. 211; but
neither the statutes referred to, nor the case cited from 12 Ass. 30,
by the latter, support his statement. The report runs thus: "Alice _de
W, qui fuit de l'age de xiij ans, fuit arse per judgment, pur ceo que
el'avoit tue sa Maistres, & pur tant ceo fuit adjudge treason, &c._;"
and it appears that the case turned upon the question of
accountability, by reason of the tender age of the culprit. No mention
of drawing is made in the judgment. Compare H.P.C., i. p. 382, and
note, with Hawk. P.C., b. 2, ch. 48, Sec. 6, and authorities there
referred to, and Coke, _ut supra_. Also, see 4 Black. Comm. 204. It
will have been noticed that though the judgment against Phillis was
that she _go_ to the place of execution, the warrant required that she
be drawn thither. The practice of drawing, in such cases, would have
been challenged, probably, if the cruelties anciently incident thereto
had not become obsolete.]

Another incident to this punishment, though not peculiar to it, since
it applied to all atrocious felonies, was the gibbeting, or hanging in
chains. This was no part of the sentence, but was performed in
accordance with a special order or direction of the court, given,
probably, in most cases, verbally to the sheriff. After execution,
the body of the felon was taken from the gallows and hung upon a
gibbet conveniently near the place where the fact was committed, there
to remain, until, from the action of the elements, or the ravages of
birds of prey, it disappeared. Of the object of this ghastly feature
of capital punishment it is alleged, "besides the terror of the
example," "that it is a comfortable sight to the friends and relations
of the deceased"; but the obviousness of this reason is somewhat
lessened by the doubt in which we are left as to which deceased
person, the criminal or his victim, is referred to. In the case of
Mark it is noticeable that no sentence to the gibbet appears in the
record, and I have found no order for it, or mention of it, in the
papers on file.

Phillis and Mark were executed at the usual place of execution in
Cambridge; and the following account of the affair is taken from the
Boston "Evening Post," of Sept. 22, 1755:--

     "Thursday last, in the Afternoon, _Mark_, a Negro Man, and
     _Phillis_, a Negro Woman, both Servants to the late Capt.
     _John Codman_, of _Charlestown_, were executed at
     _Cambridge_, for poisoning their said Master, as mentioned
     in this Paper some Weeks ago. The Fellow was hanged, and the
     Woman burned at a Stake about Ten Yards distant from the
     Gallows. They both confessed themselves guilty of the Crime
     for which they suffered, acknowledged the Justice of their
     Sentence, and died very penitent. After Execution, the Body
     of _Mark_ was brought down to _Charlestown_ Common, and
     hanged in Chains, on a Gibbet erected there for that
     Purpose."

Frothingham, in his "History of Charlestown,"[10] quotes this item
from the "Post," and adds, from Dr. Josiah Bartlett's account of
Charlestown,[11] that "the place where Mark was suspended in irons was
on the northerly side of Cambridge Road, about one fourth of a mile
above our peninsula." He also adds, from the same authority, that
"Phebe, who was the most culpable," became evidence against the
others, and that she was transported to the West Indies.

[Footnote 10: Page 264.]

[Footnote 11: 2 Mass. Hist. Coll., vol. ii. p. 166, and note.]

It is very likely that Phebe was transported, as described by Dr.
Bartlett, but there is nothing on record to show that she was used as
a principal witness. Indeed, the answers of Phillis and Mark on their
examination are mutually recriminative, and amount to a plenary
confession of the crime of each. Besides, as neither the governor nor
the court had any authority to grant a pardon for murder,[12] it is
not likely that any favor was shown to her in accordance with a
promise from either, nor is there any evidence that any lenity was
actually extended to her, except the negative circumstance that she
was not included in the indictment.

[Footnote 12: See Hutchinson's Hist. Mass. Bay, vol. iii. p. 287, n.
Instances of pardons and reprieves occur in our judicial history, but
they were invariably granted in the name of the king, by the
commander-in-chief; and, if for a graver offence than manslaughter, it
seems to have been understood that a pardon was not to be granted
without previous express direction from the king. This was in
compliance with a clause in the royal instructions, issued to all the
governors, by which they were enjoined not to remit any fines or
forfeitures above L10 in amount, or to dispose of escheats, without
the royal sanction; forfeiture of lands and chattels being a
consequence of attainder upon conviction of the higher class of
felonies. The commission to Andros expressly excepted treason and
murder from the offences which he was authorized to pardon.]

This completes the narrative of this remarkable case. The body of Mark
is said by Dr. Bartlett to have remained on the gibbet "until a short
time before the Revolution." Certain it is that when Dr. Caleb Rea
passed through Charlestown on the first day of June, 1758, on his way
from Danvers to join the regiment, of which he had been chosen
surgeon, in the expedition against Ticonderoga, he found the body
hanging, and, having examined it, recorded in his journal that "his
[Mark's] skin was but very little broken, although he had hung there
near three or four years."[13]

[Footnote 13: Hist. Coll. Essex Inst., vol. xviii. p. 88, n.]

Finally, another patriot,--Paul Revere,--in describing his famous ride
on the 18th of April, 1775, on a still more important errand, says,
"After I had passed Charlestown Neck, and got nearly opposite where
_Mark was hung in chains_, I saw two men on horseback under a
tree,"[14] &c.; thus alluding to the site of the gibbet as a place
well known at that time,--as undoubtedly it was, to all the country
round.

[Footnote 14: Letter of Colonel Revere to Cor. Sec. of Mass. Hist.
Soc., Jan. 1, 1798: 1 Mass. Hist. Coll., vol. v. p. 107.]

I have said that this is the only case of petit treason to be found in
our records. There was, indeed, an earlier case in which the penalty
of death by burning was inflicted; but in regard to that case there is
no suggestion anywhere to my knowledge that the crime of petit treason
had been committed, nor any allegation to that effect in the charge or
indictment, nor even a hint that any life was lost by the misconduct
of the condemned.[15] This was the case of Maria, a negress, who was
executed at Roxbury in 1681. Perhaps it will be well to give the story
of this case as it appears on the records of the Court of
Assistants.[16]

[Footnote 15: Although the record contains no allegation of loss of
life, Increase Mather states in his diary, under date of Sept. 22,
1681, that a child was burnt to death in one of the houses set on fire
by this negress. Even if this were true, it is not probable that the
relation of master and servant subsisted between the deceased and
Maria, and neither this relation, nor the fact of treason, is averred
in the indictment. See Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc., vol. iii. p. 320.]

[Footnote 16: Boston, Sept. 6, 1681.]

     "Marja[17] Negro Servant to Joshua Lambe of Roxbury in the
     County of Suffolk in New England being presented by the
     Grand Jury was Indicted by the name of Marja Negro for

     sd ye Gov."

[Footnote 17: I have followed Secretary Rawson in his peculiar use of
the letter j. See many similar instances in the Mass. Colony Records.]

The case was capital under the act referred to in the record. The act
reads as follows:--

     [Sidenote: Burning Houses.]

     [Sidenote: Capital.]

     And if any person of the age aforesaid, [16 years and
     upwards] shall after the publication hereof, wittingly and
     willingly, and felloniously, set on fire any _Dwelling
     House_, _Meeting House_, _Store House_, or shall in like
     manner, set on fire any _out-House_, _Barn_, _Stable_,
     _Leanto_, _Stack of Hay_, _Corn or Wood_, or any thing of
     like nature, whereby any _Dwelling House_, _Meeting House or
     Store House_ cometh to be burnt, the party or parties
     vehemently suspected thereof, shall be apprehended by
     Warrant from one or more of the Magistrates, and committed
     to Prison, there to remain without Baile, till the next
     Court of Assistants, who upon legal conviction by due proof,
     or confession of the Crime, shall adjudge such person or
     persons to be put to death, and to forfeit so much of his
     Lands, Goods or Chattels, as shall make full satisfaction,
     to the party or parties damnified. [1652.][18]

[Footnote 18: Mass. Colony Laws, ed. 1672, p. 52.]

It will be observed that the law prescribes no such punishment as was
ordered by the Assistants, and how the court were satisfied of the
legality of their sentence is to me inexplicable, except upon the
possible claim that they might rightfully exercise the expansive
discretion which they applied to the case of the first Quakers, and so
supply a deficiency in the ordinances of the General Court, by
administering the _lex talionis_[19] in this particular instance as a
necessary terror to evil-doers.

[Footnote 19: Exodus xxi. 25. "In all criminall offences, where the
law hath prescribed no certaine penaltie, the judges have power to
inflict penalties, according to the rule of God's word."--Declaration
of the General Court: Hutch. Coll. Papers, p. 207. And see the first
article of the Colonial "Liberties," in Mass. Hist. Coll., vol. viii.
p. 216.]

The public opinion which permitted the colonial magistrates to
exercise, unchallenged, a discretion not given to them by positive
law, as in this case and that of the first Quakers, and in the
instance of their conviction of a capital crime, of Tom, the Indian,
in 1674,[20] of whose guilt the jury were doubtful, cannot be deemed
to have enlarged their authority, by _custom_, without a perversion of
language and a disregard of fundamental distinctions relative to the
nature and source of law.[21]

[Footnote 20: Records of the Court of Assistants, 1674, p. 14.]

[Footnote 21: By the stat. 8 Hen. VI. ch. 6, the burning of houses,
after a threat to do so if money be not paid, &c., was made high
treason, and the incendiary suffered as any other traitor; that is, if
a woman, she was burned to death. But this statute was repealed in the
reign of Edward VI., as regards the treason, and the offence remained
felony as at the common law, and punishable by hanging only.

That mistaken notions as to the nature of penalties to be inflicted in
criminal cases, and as to the authority of the bench to impose unusual
punishments, were not solely entertained in this distant colony, and
among men not bred to the law, may be shown by many instances in the
English law-books. One of the most notable is Sir Edw. Coke's
reference to the case of Peter Burchet, a prisoner in the Tower,--who
slew his keeper with a billet of wood, which drew blood,--as an
authority for inflicting the additional punishment of cutting off the
hand (under the stat. 33 Hen. VIII.) in the case of murder perpetrated
in the king's palace, when attended with bloodshed. In Elderton's
case, Chief Justice Holt, whose habits of thorough research were not
less remarkable than his absolute fairness and honesty, said, "I have
searched for the case cited [as Jones's case] about killing a man in
the Tower. It is Burdelt and Muskett's case. Being dissatisfied with
my Lord Coke's report of it, therefore I sent for the record, ... and
there is judgment of death given, but no judgment that his right hand
should be cut off. It is indeed so related in Stowe's Chronicle, and
in fact his hand was cut off, but there was no judgment for it."
Compare 3 Inst., ch. 65 (p. 140 [Symbol: dagger]) with 2 Ld. Raym.,

     The like Judgment & sentenc was declard against James
     Pemberton's negro in all respects as agt Chessaleer
     negro &c.[22]

[Footnote 22: Record of the Court of Assistants, _ubi supra_, pp. 138,

Still another negro was convicted, at the same term of the court, of
the crime of arson, and ordered to be hanged, and afterwards consumed
to ashes in the same fire with Maria, as appears by the following
record:--

     [Sidenote: Jack negro Jndicted & sentenc]

     dead & then taken doune & burnt to Ashes in the fier wth
     Marja Negro--The Lord be mercifull to thy soule sajd the
     Gouernor"[23]

[Footnote 23: _Ibid._]

There was some excuse for the latter part of this sentence, for since
the offence was an atrocious felony, such as in England would subject
the offender to an infamous punishment, it seemed proper to attach
something more of ignominy to his sentence than the mere execution by
hanging.

Our forefathers of the colonial period regarded the Mosaic law as of
too sacred obligation to be impaired in the least degree; much more to
be expressly contravened by the courts of justice in respect to the
command,--

     "And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he
     be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree, his body
     shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in
     any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is
     accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the
     Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."[24]

[Footnote 24: Deut. xxi. 22, 23.]

--they, therefore, by an ordinance passed in 1641, had required that
the body of every executed criminal should be buried within twelve
hours after death, except in cases of anatomy, which prevented the
possibility of hanging in chains after the English fashion; and the
only way in which they could set a mark of infamy upon the deceased
criminal, without a breach of the colonial ordinance as well as of the
divine law, was to burn the body.[25]

[Footnote 25: The ordinary punishment for all capital felonies during
the colonial regime seems to have been simply hanging. Heretics and
witches were subjected to no severer penalty; and in 1674, Robert
Driver, who was convicted of murdering his master, Robert Williams of
Piscataqua, and who thus incurred the penalty for petit treason, was
sentenced to be "hanged by the neck until he be dead."--See Records of
the Court of Assistants.]

But this tendency to a strict adherence to the laws of Israel
disappeared early in the provincial period, under the operation of the
same causes which led to the abandonment of those rugged metaphrases
of the Psalms of David, and of the song of Deborah and Barak, &c.,
contained in the Bay Psalm-Book, for the smoother though less literal
version of Tate and Brady and the presumptuous "Imitations" of Dr.
Watts. When, therefore, under the new charter the offence called for
it according to the custom of England, the gibbet was erected; and
though the occasions for its employment were very rare, the report of
sundry instances of its use has come down to us, as in the case of the
pirates whose bodies hung in chains, from time to time, on the now
vanished Bird Island in Boston Harbor, a locality as near the place
where the fact was committed as could conveniently be used. I confess
I find it impossible to understand whence the provincial judges
claimed to derive their authority for ordering the bodies of criminals
to be hung in chains. We have seen that, even if our fathers brought
with them the right to exercise this authority, they soon enacted
provisions entirely inconsistent with the practice; and I am not aware
of any subsequent act of parliament, extending to the Colonies, that
restored the authority; and certainly there was no law of the Province
to that effect.

I ought not to dismiss this subject without adding something to the
brief allusion already made to the comparative mildness of the laws of
Massachusetts in respect to capital punishment. The execution of Mark
and Phillis took place just about the time that Blackstone was
delivering his lectures at Oxford, which have since given him an
enduring and world-wide fame as a commentator on the laws of England.
This elegant defender and apologist for English laws and customs, in
his commentaries, admits, seemingly with reluctance and regret, that
there then existed on the statute-books of England no less than one
hundred and sixty capital offences. At that time the number of capital
offences in Massachusetts was less than one-tenth this number, if we
exclude those made so by the acts relating to military offenders in
actual service, and felonies on the high seas, and a few others,
which, like the latter, were created by including among capital crimes
certain offences which, though theretofore exempt from the death
penalty by special circumstances and technical rules, had always been
capitally punished when committed under other and not less justifiable
circumstances.

Said Isaac Backus, whom I find to be a very trustworthy authority, in
a letter to this Society, under date of Feb. 20, 1794, "There has not
been any person hanged in Plymouth County for above these sixty years
past."[26] More than a century earlier, John Dunton mentions a sermon
of Mather's, preached at the execution of "Morgan, the only person
executed in that country [Massachusetts] for near seven years."[27] He
must, however, I think, have forgotten the case of Maria, the negro
woman.

[Footnote 26: 1 Mass. Hist. Coll., vol. iii. p. 152.]

[Footnote 27: _Ibid._, 2d series, vol. ii. p. 102.]

Again, when the English riot act (1 Geo. I. stat. 2, ch. 5) was
substantially adopted by the Province in 1751, the legislature
studiously avoided the harshness of the former act by substituting
forfeiture of lands and chattels, and whipping and imprisonment, for
the death penalty.[28]

[Footnote 28: Compare provincial statute 1750-51, ch. 17 (Prov. Laws,
vol. iii. p. 540), with the act of parliament referred to.]

In 1761 Governor Bernard vainly labored with his utmost zeal to secure
the passage of an act or acts making it felony, without benefit of
clergy, to forge public and private securities or vouchers for money,
or to coin or counterfeit the current money of the Province. He sent a
special message upon the subject to the Assembly, in which he
stated:--

     "In regard to the popular prejudices against capital
     punishments which have hitherto prevailed in this country, I
     shall only say that at present they are very ill-timed.
     Whilst the people of this country lived from hand to mouth,
     and had very little wealth but what was confined among
     themselves, a simple system of laws might be proper, and
     capital punishments might in a great measure be avoided; but
     when by the acquisition, diffusion, and general intercourse
     of wealth, the temptations to fraud are abundantly
     increased, the terrors of it must be also proportionably
     enlarged; otherwise if, through a false tenderness for
     wicked men, the laws should not be sufficient to protect the
     property of the honest and industrious, the rights of the
     latter are given up to the former, and the undue mercy shown
     to the one becomes a real injury to the other. To instance
     this, I need only say that I have no doubt but that if these
     crimes had been capital some years ago, and usually punished
     as such, they would not have been committed at all at the
     present time."

The Governor's opinion, however, was not borne out by the experience
of the British government in its dealings with crime. There, it was
made a capital felony to steal in a dwelling-house to the amount of
40_s._, or, privately, in a shop, goods to the value of 5_s._, or to
counterfeit stamps that were used for the sale of perfumery, or such
as were used for the certificates of hair-powder; and yet,
notwithstanding this severity, all who considered the subject
thoughtfully found that the increase of capital crimes more than kept
pace with the increase of laws creating them; and this became so
alarmingly evident that at length the conservative opposition to
reform was overborne, and Sir Samuel Romilly and his coadjutors began
those changes which have continued in the same direction to the
present day. Before the reform was established, however, executions
became so frequent that it was not uncommon for citizens to avoid
certain parts of London and its environs on account of the intolerable
odor, there, of decaying human bodies, hung in chains by the highways
and before the doors of citizens.

Still the judges rode their circuits, leaving briefly minuted
"calendars" in the hands of the executioners, who erected close behind
them the gallows and the gibbet as monuments of their dispensation of
"justice." Barristers bandied repartees and cracked jokes over good
dinners, and serjeants hobnobbed with their brethren of the bench and
of the coif, apparently unconcerned at the responsible part they were
enacting in this awful drama; while the poor rabble put on their best
attire on the days of execution, and liberally patronized the venders
of cakes and ale who, near the gallows, erected booths as on other
gala days,--many of the spectators, no doubt, thinking that it would
not be so bad a thing, after all, if it came their turn next to better
their desperate condition by swinging on the newly contrived gallows,
on which ten criminals could be hanged together.[29]

[Footnote 29: See a picture of the new gallows, in the illustrated
"Newgate Calendar."]

Alas! well may we ask with astonishment if it is possible that such a
state of society really existed in the England of Hannah More, of Sir
William Jones and Edmund Burke,--the land throughout which the Wesleys
were preaching and singing to eager multitudes of the free grace and
abounding mercy of God; where the pious Cowper was pleading for the
relief of "insolvent innocence," and Clarkson and Wilberforce and
Granville Sharp were rousing the public mind to the evils of slavery
in distant colonies!

The case of petit treason which we have been considering occurred nine
years before Beccaria startled all Europe with "the code of
humanity,"--his treatise on crimes and punishments; yet had he known
of our experience in this Province, he could have pointed to
Massachusetts as the strongest practical illustration of the truth of
his theory, that it is not necessary to multiply extreme penalties in
order to prevent crime, but that we are to look for the amelioration
of manners and the diminution of public and private wrongs to the
mental and moral education of the people rather than to the terrors of
the law.

In 1777, when the Revolutionary War was beginning to assume its
gravest aspect, and when the hopes of traitors were reviving, the
barbarous incidents of the punishment for treason were abolished by
the legislature of Massachusetts, and this crime was made punishable
simply by hanging. Eight years later the distinction between petit
treason and murder was abolished,--an improvement of the criminal code
in which we were followed by Great Britain five years later still.[30]

[Footnote 30: The Massachusetts act is as follows:--

"Whereas it does not appear reasonable any longer to continue the
distinction between the crimes of murder and petit treason:

"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives, in General
Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, That from and after
the passing of this act, in all cases wherein heretofore any person or
persons would have been deemed or taken to have committed the crime of
petit treason, such person or persons shall be deemed and taken to
have committed the crime of murder only, and indicted and prosecuted
to final judgment accordingly; and the same punishment only shall be
inflicted as in the case of murder.--[This act passed _March 16,
1785_.]"]

So that it was possible that our good city of Boston might have been
disgraced by one of these horrible executions as late as 1785, and
that a delicate woman could, with all the solemnity of legal forms,
have been publicly burned to death at Tyburn as late as 1790!

In point of fact such executions occurred in England long after the
burning of Phillis. A memorable case is that of Anne Beddingfield, who
was burned for petit treason at Rushmore, near Ipswich, in 1763.

In 1813 the last of the minor infamous punishments, such as whipping,
branding, the stocks, the pillory, cutting off ears, slitting noses,
boring tongues, &c., were abolished in this Commonwealth.

As for hanging in chains, I cannot find when the custom was
discontinued in Massachusetts. I do not remember to have read of an
instance of this kind since the adoption of the Constitution, though I
have made no special search for such an instance. Some of my hearers
may be able to refer me definitely to the time and reason of the
change.

In England, by the stat. 25 Geo. II., ch. 35 (1752), which was three
years before the execution at Cambridge, provision was made that
hanging in chains should be included in the sentence to be pronounced
by the court against all persons convicted of murder, and that the
sentence should be executed on the next day but one after it was
pronounced. This was changed by the stat. 9 Geo. IV., ch. 31, so as to
give the court a discretion to order hanging in chains or dissection;
and the next year this act was extended to Ireland. By the stat. 2 & 3
Wm. IV., ch. 75, the court was authorized to order the body to be hung
in chains or buried; and, finally, by the stat. 4 & 5 of Wm. IV., ch.
26 (July 25, 1834), all laws requiring bodies to be hung in chains
were repealed.

No such sudden punishment as that prescribed by the act of parliament
of the 25 Geo. II., could be legally inflicted here,--at least during
the colonial period; for the colonial ordinance of 1641 required that
four days at least should intervene between judgment and execution.

The only barbarous treatment of the bodies of criminals authorized by
law in Massachusetts since the adoption of the Constitution, that I am
aware of, was prescribed by the act of 1784, to discourage the
practice of duelling, which revived some of the provisions of a law of
the Province, passed in 1728, denying duellists the right to be buried
in a coffin, and requiring the coroner or executioner to see that
their bodies be interred near the place of execution, or in the public
highway, with a stake driven through them.[31]

[Footnote 31: Compare act of June 30, 1784, with Prov. Stat. 1728-29,
ch. 15: Prov. Laws, vol. ii. p. 516.]

Now, happily, capital punishment is restricted in this Commonwealth
and in England to two offences only; and while, here, even high
treason is punishable simply by imprisonment, in England, strong
efforts have been repeatedly made, and recently with a fair prospect
of ultimate success, to induce parliament to imitate our example and
take away the death penalty from this the highest crime known to the
common law.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
