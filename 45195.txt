PUBLISHERS' NOTE


The Bible for Young People tells the sweet and simple stories of the
Bible in the Bible language, omitting only genealogies and doctrines,
and whatever is generally regarded as unprofitable to young readers.
Moreover, it is so divided into subjects, forming complete stories,
that the child will be interested in every part of it. The life of
Jesus is put together in a continuous account taken from the four
Evangelists; and while there are omissions and changes, the wording and
spelling of the King James version remain the same.

Verse divisions have been disregarded, and a totally new system of
chapters introduced in place of the familiar ones, and it is hoped
that this novelty will give fresh interest to the old book. One of the
features which will be appreciated is the table of contents, giving the
subject of each book and its subdivisions, so that one may readily turn
to any Bible story of which he is in search.

With great discrimination and sympathy, the compiler, Mrs. Joseph B.
Gilder, has accomplished this task, and the book now stands as the
embodiment of what is universally considered the best in the Bible for
young people, "best" meaning here what is most suited to the minds of
girls and boys and appropriate to their moral range.

BOOK I--THE BEGINNINGS




CHAPTER I

THE CREATION OF THE WORLD


IN the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth
was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said,
Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it
was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called
the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and
the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and
let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament,
and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters
which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the
firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God
called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters
called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the
earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree
yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth:
and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding
seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening
and the morning were the third day.

And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years: and let them be for lights in the
firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and
the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set
them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and
to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from
the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the
morning were the fourth day.

And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature
that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open
firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living
creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after
their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it
was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And
the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

[Sidenote: Genesis 1]

And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his
kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his
kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon
the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God said,
Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in
the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And
God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the
fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given
you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth,
and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed;
to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to
every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it
was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

[Sidenote: Genesis 2]

Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he
rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God
blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had
rested from all his work which God created and made.




CHAPTER 2

THE CREATION OF ADAM AND EVE


THESE are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
heavens, and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused
it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of
the ground. And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the LORD God
to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;
the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
knowledge of good and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the
garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to
dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of
every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day
that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I
will make him an help meet for him. And out of the ground the LORD God
formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought
them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam
called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave
names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of
the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.

And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept:
and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
and the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman,
and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she
was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.




CHAPTER 3

THE SIN OF ADAM AND EVE


NOW the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the
LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the
trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst
of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
touch it, lest ye die.

And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God
doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she
took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband
with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and
they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and
made themselves aprons.

And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the
cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence
of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

[Sidenote: Genesis 3]

And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because
I was naked; and I hid myself.

And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the
tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me
of the tree, and I did eat.

And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done?
And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this,
thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
his heel.

Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also
and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb
of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all
living.

Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins,
and clothed them.

And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know
good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of
the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: therefore the LORD God
sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence
he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way,
to keep the way of the tree of life.




CHAPTER 4

THE MURDER OF ABEL


[Sidenote: Genesis 4]

AND Eve bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. And she
again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain
was a tiller of the ground.

And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit
of the ground an offering unto the LORD. And Abel, he also brought
of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD
had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his
offering he had not respect.

And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and
if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they
were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew
him. And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?

And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood
crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth,
which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy
hand; when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto
thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the
earth. And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of
the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive
and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one
that findeth me shall slay me. And the LORD said unto him, Therefore
whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And
the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land
of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain's wife bare Enoch: and he builded
a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son,
Enoch. And from Enoch was descended Lamech.

And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and
the name of the other Zillah. And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of
such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. And his brother's
name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and
organ. And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every
artificer in brass and iron.

And Eve again bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she,
hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. And to
Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos.
And from Enos was descended Enoch. And Enoch walked with God: and he
was not; for God took him. And from Enoch was descended Methuselah, who
lived nine hundred sixty and nine years, and had a son Lamech, whose
son was Noah.




CHAPTER 5

THE FLOOD


AND it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
earth, that GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually. And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the
earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the LORD said, I will
destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man,
and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it
repenteth me that I have made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of
the LORD.

[Sidenote: Genesis 6]

Noah was a just man and walked with God. And Noah begat three sons,
Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with
violence. And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the
earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy
them with the earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou
make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And
this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark
shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the
height of it thirty cubits. A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in
a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou
set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt
thou make it.

And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to
destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven;
and every thing that is in the earth shall die. But with thee will I
establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy
sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.

And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou
bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male
and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind,
of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort
shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. And take thou unto thee of
all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall
be for food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to all
that God commanded him, so did he. And the LORD said unto Noah, Come
thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous
before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to
thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not
clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by
sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of
all the earth. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon
the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that
I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah
did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. And Noah was six
hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

[Sidenote: Genesis 7]

And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with
him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts,
and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that
creepeth upon the earth, there went in two and two unto Noah into the
ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.

And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were
upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second
month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were
opened. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the
sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with
them, into the ark; they, and every beast after his kind, and all the
cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of
every sort. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
flesh, wherein is the breath of life. And they that went in, went in
male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD
shut him in.

And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased,
and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. And the waters
prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went
upon the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon
the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven,
were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
mountains were covered.

And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth, and every man: all in whose nostrils was the breath of life,
of all that was in the dry land, died. And every living substance was
destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle,
and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were
destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
were with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth an
hundred and fifty days.




CHAPTER 6

THE ARK RESTS ON ARARAT


AND God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the
earth, and the waters asswaged; the fountains also of the deep and
the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was
restrained; and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased
continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day
of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.

And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
window of the ark which he had made: and he sent forth a raven, which
went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the
earth. Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground; but the dove found no rest for
the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the
waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his
hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

[Sidenote: Genesis 8]

And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove
out of the ark; and the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in
her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters
were abated from off the earth. And he stayed yet other seven days; and
sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.

And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first
month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off
the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and,
behold, the face of the ground was dry. And in the second month, on the
seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.

And God spake unto Noah, saying, Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy
wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. Bring forth with
thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl,
and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful,
and multiply upon the earth. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his
wife, and his sons' wives with him: every beast, every creeping thing,
and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their
kinds, went forth out of the ark.

And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast,
and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart,
I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the
imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again
smite any more every thing living, as I have done. While the earth
remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.

[Sidenote: Genesis 11]

And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth. And the fear of you and the dread
of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of
the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes
of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that
liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given
you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood
thereof, shall ye not eat.

And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the
earth, and multiply therein.

And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I,
behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after
you; and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of
the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go
out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my
covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the
waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy
the earth.

And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between
me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual
generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token
of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass,
when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the
cloud: and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and
every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become
a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I
will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between
God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And
God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have
established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham,
and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. These are the three sons
of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.

And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. And all
the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.




CHAPTER 7

THE TOWER OF BABEL


AND the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came
to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in
the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another,
Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick
for stone, and slime had they for morter. And they said, Go to, let us
build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let
us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the
whole earth.

[Sidenote: Genesis 11]

And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one,
and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now
nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may
not understand one another's speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad
from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build
the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD
did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did
the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

BOOK II--ABRAHAM AND ISAAC




CHAPTER 8

THE CALL OF ABRAM


AND Abram was the son of Terah, who was descended from Shem. Terah
begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. And Abram and Nahor
took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of
Nahor's wife, Milcah. But Sarai had no child. And Terah took Abram his
son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in
law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the
Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
dwelt there. And Terah died in Haran.

Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from
thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew
thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless
them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee
shall all families of the earth be blessed.

So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with
him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of
Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and
into the land of Canaan they came.

And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the
plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. And the LORD
appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and
there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. And he
removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched
his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he
builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to
sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. And it came
to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto
Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look
upon: therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but
they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that
it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of
thee.

And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair: and the woman was
taken into Pharaoh's house. And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house
with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. And Pharaoh called
Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst
thou not tell me that she was thy wife? Why saidst thou, She is my
sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold
thy wife, take her, and go thy way. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he,
and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. And he went
on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto the place of the
altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on
the name of the LORD.

[Sidenote: Genesis 12]

And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
And the land was not able to bear them: for their substance was great,
so that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between
the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. And
Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me
and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.
Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from
me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or
if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. And Lot
lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was
well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou
comest unto Zoar. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot
journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of
the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. But the men of Sodom were
wicked and sinners before the LORD.

[Sidenote: Genesis 13]

And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land
which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And
I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can
number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of
it; for I will give it unto thee. Then Abram removed his tent, and came
and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an
altar unto the LORD.

[And it came to pass that there was a battle in the vale of Siddim, by
the Dead Sea: four kings fought against five. And among the five were
the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, where Lot dwelt.]

And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom
and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to
the mountain. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
all their victuals, and went their way. And they took Lot, Abram's
brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew. And
when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his
trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen,
and pursued them unto Dan. And he divided himself against them, he and
his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah,
which is on the left hand of Damascus. And he brought back all the
goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the
women also, and the people.

And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the
slaughter of the kings. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth
bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he
blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor
of heaven and earth: and blessed be the most high God, which hath
delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take
the goods to thyself. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift
up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven
and earth, that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet,
and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest
say, I have made Abram rich: save only that which the young men have
eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and
Mamre; let them take their portion.

After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision,
saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
reward.

And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless?

And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and
tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him,
So shall thy seed be. And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it
to him for righteousness.

And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of
the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. And he said, Lord
GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? And he said unto
him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three
years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young
pigeon. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo,
an horror of great darkness fell upon him. And he said unto Abram, Know
of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not
their's, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred
years; and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
afterward shall they come out with great substance. And thou shalt go
to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. But in
the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity
of the Amorites is not yet full. And it came to pass, that, when the
sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning
lamp that passed between those pieces. In the same day the LORD made a
covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from
the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid,
an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar
her maid the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his
wife. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

[Sidenote: Genesis 15]

And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. And he said, Hagar,
Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she
said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. And the angel of the
LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under
her hands. I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not
be numbered for multitude. Behold, thou shalt bear a son, and shalt
call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. And
he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every
man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his
brethren.

And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest
me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? And
Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar
bare, Ishmael.

And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to
Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and
be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and
will multiply thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God
talked with him, saying, As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee,
and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any
more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of
many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful,
and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And
I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after
thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto
thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy
seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of
Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

[Sidenote: Genesis 18]

And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call
her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. And I will bless her, and
give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a
mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her. Then Abraham fell
upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be
born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is
ninety years old, bear? And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might
live before thee!

And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou
shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him
for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. And as for
Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make
him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall
he beget, and I will make him a great nation. But my covenant will I
establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set
time in the next year.




CHAPTER 9

DESTRUCTION OF SODOM


AND the LORD appeared unto Abraham in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
in the tent door in the heat of the day; and he lift up his eyes and
looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran
to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
and said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not
away, I pray thee, from thy servant: let a little water, I pray you, be
fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: and I
will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that
ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they
said, So do, as thou hast said.

And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the
hearth. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. And he
took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it
before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham
went with them to bring them on the way. And the LORD said, Shall I
hide from Abraham that thing which I do; seeing that Abraham shall
surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the
earth shall be blessed in him? For I know him, that he will command
his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way
of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

[Illustration: THE FLIGHT OF LOT, BY RUBENS

IN THE LOUVRE, PARIS]

And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and
because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether
they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
unto me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned their faces from
thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous
with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city:
wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous
that are therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to
slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth
do right?

And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to
speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there
shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city
for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will
not destroy it. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure
there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
forty's sake. And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and
I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

[Sidenote: Genesis 19]

And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord:
Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not
destroy it for twenty's sake.

And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but
this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will
not destroy it for ten's sake. And the LORD went his way, as soon as he
had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of
Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself
with his face toward the ground; and he said, Behold now, my lords,
turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night,
and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways.
And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. And he
pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered
into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened
bread, and they did eat.

And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and
thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,
bring them out of this place: for we will destroy this place, because
the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the
LORD hath sent us to destroy it. And Lot went out, and spake unto his
sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of
this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one
that mocked unto his sons in law.

[Sidenote: Genesis 21]

And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou
be consumed in the iniquity of the city. And while he lingered, the men
laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the
hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they
brought him forth, and set him without the city. And it came to pass,
when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy
life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape
to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: behold now, thy servant
hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which
thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the
mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: behold now, this city is
near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither,
(is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. And he said unto
him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will
not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. Haste thee,
escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither.
Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. The sun was risen upon
the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. Then the LORD rained upon Sodom
and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; and
he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants
of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked
back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood
before the LORD: and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward
all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
country went up as the smoke of a furnace. And it came to pass, when
God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham,
and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the
cities in the which Lot dwelt.




CHAPTER 10

HAGAR AND ISHMAEL


AND the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and she bare Abraham a son
in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. And
Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah
bare to him, Isaac. And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son
Isaac was born unto him. And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh,
so that all that hear will laugh with me. And the child grew, and was
weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was
weaned.

[Illustration: THE BANISHMENT OF HAGAR, BY GUERCINO

IN THE BRERA, MILAN]

And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto
Abraham, mocking. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this
bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be
heir with my son, even with Isaac. And the thing was very grievous in
Abraham's sight because of his son.

And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because
of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said
unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be
called. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
because he is thy seed.

And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle
of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and
the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the
wilderness of Beer-sheba. And the water was spent in the bottle, and
she cast the child under one of the shrubs. And she went, and sat her
down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she
said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against
him, and lift up her voice, and wept. And God heard the voice of the
lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto
her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice
of the lad where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine
hand; for I will make him a great nation. And God opened her eyes, and
she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with
water, and gave the lad drink.

[Sidenote: Genesis 22]

And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
and became an archer. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his
mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.




CHAPTER 11

ABRAHAM'S SACRIFICE


AND it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and
said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said,
Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee
into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon
one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took
two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood
for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which
God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and
saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye
here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and
come again to you.

And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac
his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went
both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and
said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold
the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

[Sidenote: Genesis 23]

And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
offering: so they went both of them together.

And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built
an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son,
and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his
son.

And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said,
Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine
hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know
that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine
only son from me.

And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram
caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram,
and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. And
Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to
this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.

And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second
time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only
son: that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which
is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his
enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
because thou hast obeyed my voice.

So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went
together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.




CHAPTER 12

THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF SARAH


AND Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the
years of the life of Sarah. And Sarah died in Hebron in the land of
Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons
of Heth, saying, I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a
possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of
my sight.

And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, Hear us,
my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our
sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his
sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
even to the children of Heth. And he communed with them, saying, If it
be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and
intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, that he may give me the
cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for
as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a
buryingplace amongst you. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth:
and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, saying, Nay, my lord, hear me:
the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in
the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. And he
spake unto Ephron, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear
me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will
bury my dead there.

And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, My lord, hearken unto me:
the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt
me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. And Abraham hearkened unto
Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in
the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver.

And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before
Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees
that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were
made sure unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field
of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.




CHAPTER 13

HOW REBEKAH BECAME ISAAC'S WIFE


[Sidenote: Genesis 24]

AND Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed
Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his
house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand
under my thigh: and I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of
heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto
my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: but thou
shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my
son Isaac.

And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again
unto the land from whence thou camest? And Abraham said unto him,
Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. The LORD God of
heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my
kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto
thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee,
and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. And if the woman
will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this
my oath: only bring not my son thither again. And the servant put his
hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning
that matter.

[Sidenote: Genesis 24]

And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he
arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. And he made his
camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time
of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. And he
said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed
this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I stand
here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city
come out to draw water: and let it come to pass, that the damsel to
whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink;
and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and
thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.

And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah
came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor,
Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. And the damsel
was very fair to look upon: and she went down to the well, and filled
her pitcher, and came up. And the servant ran to meet her, and said,
Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher
upon her hand, and gave him drink. And when she had done giving him
drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they
have done drinking. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the
trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
camels. And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the
LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took
a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her
hands of ten shekels weight of gold; and said, Whose daughter art thou?
tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to
lodge in?

And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah,
which she bare unto Nahor. She said moreover unto him, We have both
straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. And the man bowed
down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath
not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in
the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren. And
the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things. And
Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto
the man, unto the well. And it came to pass, when he saw the earring
and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came
unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. And
he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou
without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave
straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the
men's feet that were with him. And there was set meat before him to
eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he
said, Speak on.

And he said, I am Abraham's servant. And the LORD hath blessed my
master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks,
and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and
camels, and asses. And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master
when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. And my
master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of
the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: but thou shalt
go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my
son. And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow
me. And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his
angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my
son of my kindred, and of my father's house: then shalt thou be clear
from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not
thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. And I came this day unto
the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do
prosper my way which I go: behold, I stand by the well of water; and it
shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water,
and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher
to drink; and she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for
thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out
for my master's son. And before I had done speaking in mine heart,
behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she
went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
drink, I pray thee. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from
her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:
so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. And I asked her, and
said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel,
Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her
face, and the bracelets upon her hands. And I bowed down my head, and
worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham,
which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's
daughter unto his son. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with
my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right
hand, or to the left.

[Sidenote: Genesis 24]

Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the
LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before
thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the
LORD hath spoken.

And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words,
he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. And the servant
brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and
gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother
precious things. And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were
with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and
he said, Send me away unto my master. And her brother and her mother
said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after
that she shall go. And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the
LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. And
they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And
she said, I will go.

[Sidenote: Genesis 25]

And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's
servant, and his men. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou
art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and
followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in
the south country. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the
eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
were coming.

And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off
the camel. For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that
walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my
master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

And Abraham lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years. Then Abraham
gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of
years; and was gathered to his people.

And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
in the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was
Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. And it came to pass after the death
of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well
Lahai-roi.

BOOK III--JACOB AND JOSEPH




CHAPTER 14

JACOB AND ESAU


AND Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife: and Rebekah
bare twins. And the first was red, all over like an hairy garment; and
they called his name Esau; and his brother was called Jacob.

And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field;
and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. And Isaac loved Esau,
because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.

And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob
said, Sell me this day thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I am at
the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? And
Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold
his birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of
lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus
Esau despised his birthright.

And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was
in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
Philistines unto Gerar.

And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: sojourn in this land,
and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto
thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the
oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; and I will make thy seed
to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all
these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed; because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

[Sidenote: Genesis 27]

Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. And the man waxed great,
and went forward, and grew until he became very great: for he had
possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of
servants: and the Philistines envied him. For all the wells which his
father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the
Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.

And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier
than we. And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the
valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. And Isaac digged again the wells of
water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for
the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he
called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of
springing water.

And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying,
The water is our's: and he called the name of the well Esek; because
they strove with him. And they digged another well, and strove for
that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. And he removed from
thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he
called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath
made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. And he went
up from thence to Beer-sheba. And the LORD appeared unto him the same
night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am
with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
Abraham's sake. And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name
of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
digged a well.

And it came to pass, that Isaac's servants came, and told him
concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have
found water. And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
Beer-sheba unto this day.

And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter
of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,
so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto
him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. And he said,
Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: now therefore
take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to
the field, and take me some venison; and make me savoury meat, such as
I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee
before I die. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And
Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, Bring me venison, and make
me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before
my death. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which
I command thee. Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good
kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
such as he loveth: and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may
eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.

And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a
hairy man, and I am a smooth man: my father peradventure will feel me,
and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon
me, and not a blessing. And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy
curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his
mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. And Rebekah took
goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the
house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: and she put the skins
of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his
neck: and she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

[Sidenote: Genesis 27]

And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
am I; who art thou, my son? And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau
thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray
thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. And Isaac
said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my
son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. And Isaac
said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son,
whether thou be my very son Esau or not. And Jacob went near unto Isaac
his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but
the hands are the hands of Esau. And he discerned him not, because his
hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. And
he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. And he said,
Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul
may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he
brought him wine, and he drank. And his father Isaac said unto him,
Come near now, and kiss me, my son. And he came near, and kissed him:
and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said,
See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath
blessed: therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: let people serve thee,
and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy
mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee,
and blessed be he that blesseth thee. And it came to pass, as soon as
Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone
out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came
in from his hunting.

[Sidenote: Genesis 28]

And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father,
and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's
venison, that thy soul may bless me. And Isaac his father said unto
him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. And
Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath
taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou
camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. And when
Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding
bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my
father. And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
away thy blessing. And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he
hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,
behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not
reserved a blessing for me? And Isaac answered and said unto Esau,
Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to
him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what
shall I do now unto thee, my son?

And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father?
bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and
wept.

And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling
shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
and by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it
shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt
break his yoke from off thy neck. And Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart,
The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
brother Jacob. And these words of Esau her elder son were told to
Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto
him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself,
purposing to kill thee. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and
arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; and tarry with him a few
days, until thy brother's fury turn away; until thy brother's anger
turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him:
then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived
also of you both in one day?




CHAPTER 15

JACOB AND RACHEL


AND Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto
him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go
to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take
thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; and give thee the
blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou
mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave
unto Abraham.

[Illustration: JACOB'S LADDER, BY MURILLO

IN THE HERMITAGE MUSEUM, ST. PETERSBURG]

And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of
Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. And he
lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the
sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them
for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed,
and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to
heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of
Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest,
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the
dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the
east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed
shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither
thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not
leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. And
Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this
place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is
this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the
gate of heaven.

[Sidenote: Genesis 29]

And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had
put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon
the top of it. And he called the name of that place Beth-el. And Jacob
vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this
way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so
that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be
my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's
house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth
unto thee. Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of
the people of the east. And he looked, and behold a well in the field,
and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that
well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
mouth. And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone
again upon the well's mouth in his place.

And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of
Haran are we. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?
And they said, We know him. And he said unto them, Is he well? And they
said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the
sheep. And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed
them. And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we
water the sheep.

[Sidenote: Genesis 30]

And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep:
for she kept them. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the
daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his
mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the
well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. And
Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. And Jacob told
Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son:
and she ran and told her father.

And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's
son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and
brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. And Laban
said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with
him the space of a month.

And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest
thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the
name of the younger was Rachel. Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was
beautiful and well favoured. And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will
serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And Laban said,
It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to
another man: abide with me. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel;
and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled.
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,
and brought her to him. And it came to pass, that in the morning he
said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve
with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? And Laban
said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before
the firstborn. We will give thee Rachel also for the service which
thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. And Jacob did so: and
he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. And Jacob loved also
Rachel more than Leah. And Leah had four sons, Reuben, Simeon, Levi,
and Judah. And Rachel envied her sister, and said, Give me children,
or else I die. And Jacob was angry with her, and said, Am I in God's
stead, who hath withheld children from thee? And she gave him her maid
Bilhah to wife: and Bilhah bare Jacob Dan and Naphtali. Then Leah gave
Zilpah her maid to Jacob to wife: and she bare him two sons, Gad and
Asher. And Leah bare Issachar and Zebulun, and a daughter whom she
called Dinah.

And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her. And she bare a
son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: and she called his name
Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.




CHAPTER 16

JACOB AND LABAN


AND it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto
Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my
country. Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine
eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath
blessed me for thy sake. And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will
give it. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
how thy cattle was with me. For it was little which thou hadst before
I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath
blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
house also? And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will
again feed and keep thy flock. I will pass through all thy flock to
day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all
the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among
the goats: and of such shall be my hire. So shall my righteousness
answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before
thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats,
and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me. And
Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. And he
removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and
all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that
had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them
into the hand of his sons.

[Sidenote: Genesis 30]

And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed
the rest of Laban's flocks. And the LORD caused the stronger cattle
to bear cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted, and the feebler
to bear brown cattle: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger
Jacob's. And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away
all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he
gotten all this glory. And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and,
behold, it was not toward him as before. And the LORD said unto Jacob,
Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be
with thee.

And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not
toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. And ye
know that with all my power I have served your father.

And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;
but God suffered him not to hurt me. If he said thus, The speckled
shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said
thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle
ringstraked. Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and
given them to me.

[Sidenote: Genesis 31]

And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? are we not counted
of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our
money. For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
is our's, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto
thee, do.

Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; and he
carried away all his cattle, and all his goods, for to go to Isaac his
father in the land of Canaan. And Laban went to shear his sheep: and
Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. And Jacob stole
away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he
fled. So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over
the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. And he took
his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and
they overtook him in the mount Gilead. And God came to Laban the Syrian
in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not
to Jacob either good or bad.

Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount:
and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. And Laban
said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares
to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and
didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and
with songs, with tabret, and with harp? and hast not suffered me to
kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so
doing. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou
speak not to Jacob either good or bad. And now, though thou wouldest
needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet
wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said,
Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. With
whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren
discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew
not that Rachel had stolen them. And Laban searched, but found not the
images. And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast
so hotly pursued after me? Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff,
what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my
brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. This
twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not
cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. That
which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of
it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen
by night. Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. Thus have I been twenty
years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters,
and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac,
had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath
seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee
yesternight.

And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my
cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day
unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it
be for a witness between me and thee. And Jacob took a stone, and set
it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones;
and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon
the heap. And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; and Mizpah; for
he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one
from another. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt
take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is
witness betwixt me and thee. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap,
and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; this
heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over
this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this
pillar unto me, for harm. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the
God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of
his father Isaac.

[Sidenote: Genesis 32]

Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to
eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his
daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his
place.




CHAPTER 17

MEETING OF JACOB AND ESAU


AND Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. And when
Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of
that place Mahanaim.

And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land
of Seir, the country of Edom. And he commanded them, saying, Thus
shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have
sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: and I have oxen, and
asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to
tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

[Sidenote: Genesis 32]

And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother
Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people
that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two
bands; and said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
the other company which is left shall escape.

And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac,
the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy
kindred, and I will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the least
of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto
thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am
become two bands. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother,
from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
and the mother with the children. And thou saidst, I will surely do
thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be
numbered for multitude.

And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to
his hand a present for Esau his brother; two hundred she goats, and
twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, thirty milch camels
with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten
foals. And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove
by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put
a space betwixt drove and drove.

And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth
thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou?
and whose are these before thee? Then thou shalt say, They be thy
servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold,
also he is behind us. And so commanded he the second, and the third,
and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
unto Esau, when ye find him. And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant
Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present
that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure
he will accept of me. So went the present over before him: and himself
lodged that night in the company. And he rose up that night, and took
his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and
passed over the ford Jabbok. And he took them, and sent them over the
brook, and sent over that he had.

And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the
breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him,
he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh
was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. And he said, Let me go, for
the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou
bless me. And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for
as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he
said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed
him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have
seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. And as he passed over
Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. Therefore
the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon
the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow
of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and
with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and
unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. And he put the handmaids and
their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel
and Joseph hindermost.

And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven
times, until he came near to his brother. And Esau ran to meet him, and
embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and
said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath
graciously given thy servant. Then the handmaidens came near, they
and their children, and they bowed themselves. And Leah also with her
children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near
and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. And he said, What meanest thou
by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in
the sight of my lord. And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep
that thou hast unto thyself. And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now
I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand:
for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of
God, and thou wast pleased with me. Take, I pray thee, my blessing that
is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and
because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

[Sidenote: Genesis 35]

And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go
before thee. And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children
are tender, and the flocks and herds are with me: and if men should
over-drive them one day, all the flock will die. Let my lord, I
pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly,
according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able
to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. And Esau said, Let me
now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said,
What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. So Esau
returned that day on his way unto Seir. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth,
and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle. And Jacob came
to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he
came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.




CHAPTER 18

THE BIRTH OF BENJAMIN


AND God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there:
and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou
fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

[Sidenote: Genesis 36]

Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put
away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change
your garments: and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make
there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and
was with me in the way which I went. And they gave unto Jacob all the
strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which
were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by
Shechem. And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of
Jacob.

So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el,
he and all the people that were with him. And he built there an altar,
and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him,
when he fled from the face of his brother. But Deborah Rebekah's
nurse died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el under an oak. And God
appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed
him. And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his
name Israel. And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings
shall descend from thee; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac,
to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the
land. And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a
pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured
oil thereon. And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake
with him, Beth-el.

And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come
to Ephrath: and Rachel bare a son. And it came to pass, as her soul was
in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his
father called him Benjamin. And Rachel died, and was buried in the way
to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave:
that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.

And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and
Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun, and Dan, and
Naphtali, and Gad, and Asher, and the sons of Rachel, Joseph and
Benjamin.

And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of
Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. And the
days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. And Isaac gave up
the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and
full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. And Esau took
his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his
house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which
he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the
face of his brother Jacob. For their riches were more than that they
might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could
not bear them because of their cattle. Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir:
Esau is Edom.




CHAPTER 19

JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN


AND Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the
land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being
seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren: and
Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. Now Israel loved
Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old
age: and he made him a coat of many colours. And when his brethren saw
that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him,
and could not speak peaceably unto him.

And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated
him yet the more. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream
which I have dreamed: for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the
field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold,
your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. And his
brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou
indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his
dreams, and for his words.

[Sidenote: Genesis 37]

And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the
moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. And he told it to his
father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto
him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother
and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the
earth? And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. And
Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem?
come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy
brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent
him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the
field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? And he said, I
seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let
us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in
Dothan.

And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them,
they conspired against him to slay him. And they said one to another,
Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come now therefore, and let us slay him,
and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath
devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. And
Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let
us not kill him. And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him
into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that
he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.

[Sidenote: Genesis 39]

And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they
stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on
him; and they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty,
there was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread: and they
lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites
came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
going to carry it down to Egypt. And Judah said unto his brethren, What
profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? Come, and
let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him;
for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted
up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty
pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the
pit; and he rent his clothes. And he returned unto his brethren, and
said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? And they took
Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in
the blood; and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it
to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be
thy son's coat or no.

And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath
devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. And Jacob rent
his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son
many days. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort
him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down
into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was
in the house of his master the Egyptian. And his master saw that the
LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in
his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and
he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into
his hand.

And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his
house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's
house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that
he had in the house, and in the field. And he left all that he had in
Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he
did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. And it
came to pass after these things, that his master's wife tempted Joseph
to sin. But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed
all that he hath to my hand; there is none greater in this house than
I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me: how then can I do
this great wickedness, and sin against God? And it came to pass, as
she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her. And
she spake unto her lord according to these words, saying, The Hebrew
servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me.
And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, that
his wrath was kindled. And Joseph's master took him, and put him into
the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was
there in the prison.

[Illustration: JOSEPH CONDUCTED TO PRISON, BY JACOPO CARRUCCI (CALLED
JACOPO DA PONTORMO)

IN THE UFFIZI GALLERY, FLORENCE]

But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour
in the sight of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison
committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison;
and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. The keeper of the
prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the
LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king
of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. And
Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the
butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. And he put them in ward
in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place
where Joseph was bound. And the captain of the guard charged Joseph
with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.

[Sidenote: Genesis 40]

And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night,
each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and
the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. And
Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and,
behold, they were sad. And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with
him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly
to day? And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is
no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. And the chief butler told
his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was
before me; and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought
forth ripe grapes: and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the
grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
Pharaoh's hand.

And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three
branches are three days: yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up
thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver
Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast
his butler. But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,
and bring me out of this house: for indeed I was stolen away out of the
land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they
should put me into the dungeon.

[Sidenote: Genesis 41]

When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto
Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets
on my head: and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of
bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket
upon my head. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
thereof: The three baskets are three days: yet within three days shall
Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree;
and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that
he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of
the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. And he
restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the
cup into Pharaoh's hand: but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had
interpreted to them. Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but
forgat him.




CHAPTER 20

JOSEPH BEFORE PHARAOH


AND it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
and, behold, he stood by the river. And, behold, there came up out of
the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a
meadow. And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon
the brink of the river. And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did
eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. And he
slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came
up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold, seven thin ears and
blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. And the seven thin
ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and,
behold, it was a dream. And it came to pass in the morning that his
spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream;
but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
faults this day: Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in
ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man
according to the interpretation of his dream. And there was there with
us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we
told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to
his dream he did interpret. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to
us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out
of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and
came in unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a
dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of
thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. And Joseph
answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an
answer of peace.

And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the
bank of the river: and, behold, there came up out of the river seven
kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: and,
behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured
and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for
badness: and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
seven fat kine: and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known
that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the
beginning. So I awoke.

And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
full and good: and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted
with the east wind, sprung up after them: and the thin ears devoured
the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was
none that could declare it to me.

And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath
shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good kine are seven
years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. And
the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven
years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be
seven years of famine. This is the thing which I have spoken unto
Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. Behold, there
come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
consume the land; and the plenty shall not be known in the land by
reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. And
for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the
thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set
him over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint
officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt
in the seven plenteous years. And let them gather all the food of those
good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and
let them keep food in the cities. And that food shall be for store to
the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land
of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.

[Sidenote: Genesis 41]

And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all
his servants.

And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this
is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet
and wise as thou art: thou shalt be over my house, and according unto
thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be
greater than thou. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee
over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his
hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of
fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; and he made him to
ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow
the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh
said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up
his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Joseph's
name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of
Potipherah priest of On.

[Sidenote: Genesis 41]

And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went
throughout all the land of Egypt.

And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the
land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the
field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. And
Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left
numbering; for it was without number.

And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,
which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. And
the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be
fruitful in the land of my affliction.




CHAPTER 21

THE FAMINE


AND the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,
were ended. And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land
of Egypt there was bread. And when all the land of Egypt was famished,
the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the
Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. And the famine was
over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses,
and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of
Egypt. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his
sons, Why do ye look one upon another? And he said, Behold, I have
heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us
from thence; that we may live, and not die.

And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. But Benjamin,
Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest
peradventure mischief befall him. And the sons of Israel came to buy
corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to
all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down
themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange
unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence
come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. And Joseph
knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said
unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants
come. We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
spies. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come. And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons
of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day
with our father, and one is not.

And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye
are spies: hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall
not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. Send one
of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison,
that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or
else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. And he put them all
together into ward three days.

[Sidenote: Genesis 42]

And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear
God: if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house
of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: but
bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified,
and ye shall not die. And they did so.

And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us,
and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. And
Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin
against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his
blood is required. And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for
he spake unto them by an interpreter. And he turned himself about from
them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and
took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore
every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the
way: and thus did he unto them. And they laded their asses with the
corn, and departed thence. And as one of them opened his sack to give
his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it
was in his sack's mouth. And he said unto his brethren, My money is
restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them,
and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God
hath done unto us?

[Sidenote: Genesis 43]

And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told
him all that befell unto them; saying, The man, who is the lord of
the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: we be twelve
brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day
with our father in the land of Canaan. And the man, the lord of the
country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave
one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your
households, and be gone: and bring your youngest brother unto me: then
shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every
man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their
father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. And Jacob their
father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is
not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these
things are against me. And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay
my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and
I will bring him to thee again. And he said, My son shall not go down
with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief
befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.




CHAPTER 22

BENJAMIN BROUGHT TO JOSEPH


AND the famine was sore in the land. And it came to pass, when they had
eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father
said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. And Judah spake unto
him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not
see my face, except your brother be with you. If thou wilt send our
brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: but if thou wilt
not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall
not see my face, except your brother be with you.

And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man
whether ye had yet a brother? And they said, The man asked us straitly
of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive?
have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of
these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
brother down?

And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we
will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,
and also our little ones. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt
thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before
thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: for except we had lingered,
surely now we had returned this second time.

And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this;
take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the
man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh,
nuts, and almonds: and take double money in your hand; and the money
that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: take also your brother,
and arise, go again unto the man: and God Almighty give you mercy
before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.
If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.

And the men took that present, and they took double money in their
hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood
before Joseph. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the
ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for
these men shall dine with me at noon.

And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
Joseph's house. And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned
in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek
occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our
asses.

And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed
with him at the door of the house, and said, O sir, we came indeed down
at the first time to buy food: and it came to pass, when we came to the
inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in
the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
again in our hand. And other money have we brought down in our hands to
buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. And he said,
Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath
given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought
Simeon out unto them. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house,
and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their
asses provender. And they made ready the present against Joseph came at
noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.

[Sidenote: Genesis 43]

And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in
their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well,
the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? And they answered, Thy
servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed
down their heads, and made obeisance.

And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's
son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me?
And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. And Joseph made haste;
for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep;
and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. And he washed his
face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.

And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
loveth him. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
that I may set mine eyes upon him. And we said unto my lord, The lad
cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father
would die. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. And it came
to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the
words of my lord. And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little
food. And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with
us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our
youngest brother be with us. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye
know that my wife bare me two sons: and the one went out from me, and I
said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: and if ye
take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my
gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Now therefore when I come to thy
servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is
bound up in the lad's life; it shall come to pass, when he seeth that
the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring
down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If
I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father
for ever. Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of
the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest
peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

[Sidenote: Genesis 45]

Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by
him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood
no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet
live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at
his presence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I
pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother,
whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with
yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you
to preserve life. For these two years hath the famine been in the
land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither
be earing nor harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve you a
posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me
a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout
all the land of Egypt.

Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son
Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry
not: and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and
thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: for the Egyptians,
which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not
eat bread with the Hebrews. And they sat before him, the firstborn
according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth:
and the men marvelled one at another. And he took and sent messes unto
them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any
of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.

[Sidenote: Genesis 44]

And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks
with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his
sack's mouth. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of
the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that
Joseph had spoken.

As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and
their asses. And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far
off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when
thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil
for good? is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. And they
said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that
thy servants should do according to this thing: behold, the money,
which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of
the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house
silver or gold? with whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let
him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. And he said, Now also
let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be
my servant; and ye shall be blameless. Then they speedily took down
every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. And he
searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the
cup was found in Benjamin's sack. Then they rent their clothes, and
laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.

And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet
there: and they fell before him on the ground.

And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye
not that such a man as I can certainly divine? And Judah said, What
shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear
ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold,
we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is
found. And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,
get you up in peace unto your father.

Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant,
I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger
burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. My lord asked
his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? And we said unto
my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age,
a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his
mother, and his father and there will I nourish thee; for yet there
are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that
thou hast, come to poverty. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of
my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. And
ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye
have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. And he
fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon
his neck. Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
after that his brethren talked with him.

[Sidenote: Genesis 46]

And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. And
Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your
beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; and take your father
and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of
the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Now thou art
commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for
your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is
your's.

And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for
the way. To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of
raiment. And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and
bread and meat for his father by the way. So he sent his brethren away,
and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by
the way.

And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto
Jacob their father, and told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he
is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for
he believed them not. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which
he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent
to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: and Israel
said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him
before I die.




CHAPTER 23

ISRAEL GOES DOWN INTO EGYPT


AND Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob,
Jacob. And he said, Here am I. And he said, I am God, the God of thy
father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee
a great nation: I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also
surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
eyes.

And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob
their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons
which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. And they took their cattle, and
their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into
Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: his sons, and his sons' sons
with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed
brought he with him into Egypt. And the sons of Joseph, which were born
him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob,
which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.

And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto
Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. And Joseph made ready
his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and
presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his
neck a good while. And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I
have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.

And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will
go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's
house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; and the men
are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have
brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. And it
shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is
your occupation? that ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about
cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers:
that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an
abomination unto the Egyptians.

Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren,
and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come
out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of
Goshen. And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
them unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your
occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds,
both we, and also our fathers. They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For
to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture
for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now
therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

[Sidenote: Genesis 47]

And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren
are come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of
the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen
let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them,
then make them rulers over my cattle. And Joseph brought in Jacob his
father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. And
Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? And Jacob said unto Pharaoh,
The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years:
few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not
attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
days of their pilgrimage. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from
before Pharaoh.

And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the
land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. And Joseph nourished his
father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread,
according to their families.

[Sidenote: Genesis 47]

And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore,
so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason
of the famine. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in
the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they
bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. And when
money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the
Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should
we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. And Joseph said, Give
your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. And
they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in
exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the
herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their
cattle for that year. When that year was ended, they came unto him the
second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how
that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there
is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our
lands: wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?
buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants
unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that
the land be not desolate. And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for
Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. And as for the
people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt
even to the other end thereof. Only the land of the priests bought he
not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did
eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not
their lands.

Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day
and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow
the land. And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for
seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,
and for food for your little ones. And they said, Thou hast saved
our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be
Pharaoh's servants. And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt
unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land
of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and
they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. And
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of
Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.




CHAPTER 24

THE DEATH OF JACOB


AND the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son
Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly
with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: but I will lie with my
fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their
buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. And he said,
Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the
bed's head.

And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and
Ephraim. And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. And
Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the
land of Canaan, and blessed me, and said unto me, Behold, I will make
thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude
of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
everlasting possession.

And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee
in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine;
as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. And thy issue, which thou
begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the
name of their brethren in their inheritance. And as for me, when I came
from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when
yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her
there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Beth-lehem.

And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? And Joseph
said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in
this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will
bless them. Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could
not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and
embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see
thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

[Sidenote: Genesis 48]

And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim
in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left
hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. And
Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head,
who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding
his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham
and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this
day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let
my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head
of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to
remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. And Joseph said
unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy
right hand upon his head. And his father refused, and said, I know it,
my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be
great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his
seed shall become a multitude of nations. And he blessed them that day,
saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim
and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

[Sidenote: Genesis 50]

And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you,
and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. Moreover I have
given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the
hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together,
and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. And he
charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people:
bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the
Hittite, in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought for a possession of
a buryingplace. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there
they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. The
purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the
children of Heth.

And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up
his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto
his people.




CHAPTER 25

THE BURIAL OF JACOB


AND Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed
him. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. And forty days were
fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are
embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the
house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, My father made me
swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the
land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I
pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.

And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee
swear.

And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the
servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the
land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his
father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their
herds, they left in the land of Goshen. And there went up with him both
chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. And they came
to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they
mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning
for his father seven days. And when the inhabitants of the land, the
Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is
a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was
called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan. And his sons did unto him
according as he commanded them: for his sons carried him into the land
of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which
Abraham bought.

[Sidenote: Genesis 50]

And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went
up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said,
Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all
the evil which we did unto him. And they sent a messenger unto Joseph,
saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, So shall ye say
unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren,
and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee,
forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And
Joseph wept when they spake unto him. And his brethren also went and
fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? But
as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good,
to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. Now
therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he
comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived
an hundred and ten years. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the
third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were
brought up upon Joseph's knees. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I
die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto
the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph
took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit
you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. So Joseph died, being
an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in
a coffin in Egypt.

BOOK IV

MOSES AND THE DELIVERANCE FROM EGYPT




CHAPTER 26

THE FINDING OF MOSES


NOW these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. Reuben, Simeon,
Levi, and Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, Dan, and Naphtali,
Gad, and Asher. And all the souls that came from Jacob were seventy
souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. And Joseph died, and all his
brethren, and all that generation.

And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with
them.

Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he
said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are
more and mightier than we: come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest
they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any
war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
them up out of the land. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters
to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure
cities, Pithom and Raamses. But the more they afflicted them, the more
they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children
of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
rigour: and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their
service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. And the king
of Egypt commanded that all the male children of the Hebrews be put
to death. But the Hebrew women did not as the king of Egypt commanded
them, but saved the men children alive: and the people multiplied, and
waxed very mighty.

And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
of Levi. And the woman bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a
goodly child, she hid him three months. And when she could not longer
hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with
slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the
flags by the river's brink. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what
would be done to him.

And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river;
and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the
ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. And when she had
opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had
compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. Then
said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee
a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called
the child's mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this
child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And
the woman took the child, and nursed it. And the child grew, and she
brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she
called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the
water.

[Sidenote: Exodus 2]

And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went
out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an
Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. And he looked this
way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the
Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. And when he went out the second day,
behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that
did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? And he said, Who made
thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou
killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is
known. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:
and he sat down by a well.

Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew
water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. And the
shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them,
and watered their flock. And when they came to Reuel their father,
he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? And they said,
An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also
drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. And he said unto his
daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call
him, that he may eat bread. And Moses was content to dwell with the
man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. And she bare him a son,
and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in
a strange land.

[Sidenote: Exodus 3]

And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died:
and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they
cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. And God
heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham,
with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel,
and God had respect unto them.




CHAPTER 27

THE BURNING BUSH


NOW Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of
Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to
the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the LORD appeared
unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked,
and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why
the bush is not burnt. And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to
see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses,
Moses. And he said, Here am I. And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put
off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his
face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which
are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters;
for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of
the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto
a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. Now
therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me:
and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress
them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and
that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token
unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the
people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children
of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name
for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. Go, and gather
the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me,
saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you
in Egypt: and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
Egypt, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. And they shall hearken
to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto
the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the
Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three
days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD
our God.

And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by
a mighty hand. And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with
all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he
will let you go. And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not
go empty: but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her
that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters;
and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor
hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared
unto thee. And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And
he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on
the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the
tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in
his hand: that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared
unto thee.

[Sidenote: Exodus 4]

And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out,
behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And he said, Put thine hand
into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and
plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his
other flesh. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe
the voice of the latter sign. And it shall come to pass, if they will
not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that
thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry
land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
blood upon the dry land.

And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow
of speech, and of a slow tongue. And the LORD said unto him, Who hath
made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing,
or the blind? have not I the LORD? Now therefore go, and I will be
with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. And he said, O my
Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. And
the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not
Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also,
behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will
be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in
his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will
teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the
people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth,
and thou shalt be to him instead of God. And thou shalt take this rod
in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

[Sidenote: Exodus 5]

And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto
him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in
Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses,
Go in peace. And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into
Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. And Moses took
his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the
land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. And the LORD
said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do
all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but
I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. And thou
shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my
firstborn: and I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me:
and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy
firstborn.

And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. And
Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all
the signs which he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron went and
gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: and Aaron
spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the
signs in the sight of the people. And the people believed: and when
they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that
he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and
worshipped.




CHAPTER 28

THE ISRAELITES IN BONDAGE


AND afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the
LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto
me in the wilderness.

And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let
Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.

And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we
pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto
the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the
sword. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. And
Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make
them rest from their burdens. And Pharaoh commanded the same day the
taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, Ye shall no more
give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and
gather straw for themselves. And the tale of the bricks, which they did
make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought
thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and
sacrifice to our God. Let there more work be laid upon the men, that
they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.

And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and
they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give
you straw. Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought
of your work shall be diminished. So the people were scattered abroad
throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily
tasks, as when there was straw. And the officers of the children of
Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and
demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick
both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? There
is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick:
and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own
people. But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let
us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. Go therefore now, and work; for
there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of
bricks. And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from
your bricks of your daily task.

[Sidenote: Exodus 6]

And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth
from Pharaoh: and they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and
judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand
to slay us. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore
hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent
me? for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil
to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong
hand shall he drive them out of his land. And God spake unto Moses, and
said unto him, I am the LORD: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac,
and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was
I not known to them. And I have also established my covenant with them,
to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
they were strangers. And I have also heard the groaning of the children
of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my
covenant. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD,
and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and
I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a
stretched out arm, and with great judgments: and I will take you to me
for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am
the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the
Egyptians. And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which
I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will
give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

[Sidenote: Exodus 7]

And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not
unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. And the LORD
spake unto Moses, saying, Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt,
that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. And Moses
spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have
not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me? And the LORD
said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron
thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command
thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the
children of Israel out of his land. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh
shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and
bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of
the land of Egypt by great judgments. And the Egyptians shall know that
I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring
out the children of Israel from among them. And Moses and Aaron did as
the LORD commanded them, so did they. And Moses was fourscore years
old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto
Pharaoh.

And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, When Pharaoh
shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt
say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall
become a serpent.

And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD
had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before
his servants, and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the
wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did
in like manner with their enchantments. For they cast down every man
his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their
rods. And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them;
as the LORD had said.




CHAPTER 29

THE PLAGUES OF BLOOD AND FROGS


AND the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth
to let the people go. Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he
goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink
against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou
take in thine hand. And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the
Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may
serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not
hear. Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:
behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. And the fish
that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the
Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,
upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools
of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood
throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in
vessels of stone. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded;
and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river,
in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the
waters that were in the river were turned to blood. And the fish that
was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could
not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout
all the land of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their
enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken
unto them; as the LORD had said.

And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his
heart to this also. And all the Egyptians digged round about the river
for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

[Sidenote: Exodus 8]

And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the
river.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus
saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. And if thou
refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and
come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and
into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine
ovens, and into thy kneedingtroughs: and the frogs shall come up both
on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand
with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and
cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out
his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered
the land of Egypt. And the magicians did so with their enchantments,
and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD,
that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will
let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. And Moses
said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and
for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee
and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? And he said,
To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest
know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. And the frogs shall
depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from
thy people; they shall remain in the river only. And Moses and Aaron
went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the
frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. And the LORD did according
to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the
villages, and out of the fields. And they gathered them together upon
heaps: and the land stank. But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite,
he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had
said.




CHAPTER 30

THE PLAGUES OF LICE, FLIES, MURRAIN, AND BOILS


[Sidenote: Exodus 8]

AND the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and
smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the
land of Egypt. And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with
his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man,
and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the
land of Egypt. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to
bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and
upon beast. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger
of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto
them; as the LORD had said.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand
before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him,
Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. Else,
if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies
upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy
houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of
flies, and also the ground whereon they are. And I will sever in that
day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of
flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD
in the midst of the earth. And I will put a division between my people
and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. And the LORD did so; and
there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and
into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was
corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice
to your God in the land. And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for
we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our
God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before
their eyes, and will they not stone us? We will go three days' journey
into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall
command us. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice
to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far
away: intreat for me. And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I
will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh
deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to
the LORD. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. And
the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms
of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there
remained not one. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also,
neither would he let the people go.

Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus
saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may
serve me. For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,
upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and
upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. And the LORD
shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and
there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel. And
the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this
thing in the land. And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all
the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
died not one. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the
cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
and he did not let the people go.

[Sidenote: Exodus 9]

And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in
the sight of Pharaoh. And it shall become small dust in all the land
of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and
upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. And they took ashes of
the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward
heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and
upon beast. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because
of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
Egyptians. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.




CHAPTER 31

THE PLAGUE OF HAIL


AND the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand
before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the
Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. For I will at this
time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and
upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in
all the earth. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite
thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the
earth. And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all
the earth. As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou
wilt not let them go?

[Sidenote: Exodus 10]

Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation
thereof even until now. Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and
all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which
shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail
shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made
his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: and he that regarded
not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven,
that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon
beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent
thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD
rained hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail, and fire mingled
with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the
land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail smote throughout
all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast;
and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the
field. Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
was there no hail.

And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my
people are wicked. Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be
no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
shall stay no longer. And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone
out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the
thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou
mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S. But as for thee and thy
servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. And the flax
and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax
was bolled. But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were
not grown up. And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread
abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and
the rain was not poured upon the earth. And when Pharaoh saw that the
rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and
hardened his heart, he and his servants. And the heart of Pharaoh was
hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD
had spoken by Moses.




CHAPTER 32

THE PLAGUES OF LOCUSTS AND DARKNESS


AND the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened
his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my
signs before him: and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son,
and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my
signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the
LORD. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to
humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I
bring the locusts into thy coast: and they shall cover the face of the
earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the
residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the
hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
and they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and
the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy
fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth
unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a
snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God:
knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? And Moses and Aaron were
brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD
your God: but who are they that shall go? And Moses said, We will go
with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters,
with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast
unto the LORD.

And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you
go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. Not so:
go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire.
And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

[Sidenote: Exodus 10]

And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of
Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt,
and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the
LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that
night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all
the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were
no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. For they
covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and
they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees
which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the
trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have
sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. Now therefore
forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your
God, that he may take away from me this death only. And he went out
from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. And the LORD turned a mighty
strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the
Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
children of Israel go.

[Sidenote: Exodus 11]

And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which
may be felt. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and
there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: they
saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days:
but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only
let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go
with you. And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. Our cattle also
shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof
must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we
must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see
my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. And
Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.




CHAPTER 33

THE TENTH PLAGUE: THE FIRSTBORN OF EGYPT SLAIN--THE PASSOVER


AND the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon
Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when
he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his
neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold.

And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians.
Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into
the midst of Egypt: and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall
die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even
unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all
the firstborn of beasts. And there shall be a great cry throughout all
the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like
it any more. But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog
move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the
LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. And all
these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves
unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and
after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that
my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD
hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of
Israel go out of his land.

And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the
first month of the year to you. Speak ye unto all the congregation of
Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them
every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for
an house: and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him
and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number
of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count
for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first
year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: and ye
shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the
whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the
evening. And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall
eat it. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,
and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat
not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his
head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. And ye shall let
nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it
until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your
feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it
is the LORD'S passover. For I will pass through the land of Egypt
this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
judgment: I am the LORD. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon
the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over
you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite
the land of Egypt. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and
ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye
shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. Seven days shall ye
eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out
of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day
until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. And in
the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh
day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall
be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be
done of you. And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in
this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance
for ever.

[Sidenote: Exodus 12]

In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye
shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
month at even. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your
houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul
shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
stranger, or born in the land. Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all
your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.

[Sidenote: Exodus 12]

Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them,
Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the
passover. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with
the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the
door of his house until the morning. For the LORD will pass through to
smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and
on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not
suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy
sons for ever. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land
which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye
shall keep this service. And it shall come to pass, when your children
shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? that ye shall say,
It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses
of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and
delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. And
the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded
Moses and Aaron, so did they.

And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn
in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his
throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and
all the firstborn of cattle. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and
all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in
Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.




CHAPTER 34

THE ISRAELITES GO UP OUT OF EGYPT


AND Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of
Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. Also take your flocks
and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. And
the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them
out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. And the
people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs
being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. And the children
of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the
Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and the
LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that
they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the
Egyptians.

And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six
hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. And a mixed
multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very
much cattle. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they
brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were
thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for
themselves any victual.

Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was
four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the end of the
four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass,
that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. It is
a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from
the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all
the children of Israel in their generations. And it came to pass the
selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the
land of Egypt by their armies.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Sanctify unto me all the
firstborn among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is
mine.

And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out
from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the
LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be
eaten. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk
and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. Seven days
thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a
feast to the LORD. And there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee,
neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. And
thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of
that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. And
it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial
between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with
a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. Thou shalt
therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.

[Sidenote: Exodus 13]

And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the
Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give
it thee, that thou shalt set apart unto the LORD every firstling that
cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD'S. And
every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and all the
firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.




CHAPTER 35

THE OVERWHELMING OF THE EGYPTIANS


AND it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led
them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although
that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when
they see war, and they return to Egypt: but God led the people about,
through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of
Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. And Moses took the
bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of
Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my
bones away hence with you.

[Sidenote: Exodus 14]

And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in
the edge of the wilderness. And the LORD went before them by day in
a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar
of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: he took not away
the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from
before the people.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of
Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol
and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by
the sea. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. And I will
harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be
honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may
know that I am the LORD. And they did so.

And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart
of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they
said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving
us? And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: and he
took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and
captains over every one of them. And the LORD hardened the heart of
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and
the children of Israel went out with an high hand. But the Egyptians
pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his
horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside
Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their
eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were
sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. And
they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou
taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus
with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we
did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the
Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than
that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people,
Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he
will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye
shall see them again no more for ever. The LORD shall fight for you,
and ye shall hold your peace.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: but lift thou up
thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and
the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the
sea. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they
shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all
his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. And the Egyptians
shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon
Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed
and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before
their face, and stood behind them: and it came between the camp of the
Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to
them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not
near the other all the night. And Moses stretched out his hand over the
sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all
that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry
ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and
on their left.

And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the
sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And
it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the
host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and
troubled the host of the Egyptians, and took off their chariot wheels,
that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee
from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the
Egyptians.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that
the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and
upon their horsemen. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea,
and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the
Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the
midst of the sea. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots,
and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
after them; there remained not so much as one of them. But the children
of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters
were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. Thus the
LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel
saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. And Israel saw that great
work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the
LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.




CHAPTER 36

THE SONG OF MOSES


[Sidenote: Exodus 15]

THEN sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD,
and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed
gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is
my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I
will exalt him.

The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen
captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

[Sidenote: Exodus 15]

Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O
LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that
rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them
as stubble.

And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,
the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in
the heart of the sea.

The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my
hand shall destroy them.

Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead
in the mighty waters.

Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,
glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed:
thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
inhabitants of Palestina.

Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
shall melt away.

Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they
shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till
the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine
inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to
dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established.

The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea
upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
the sea.

And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her
hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.

BOOK V--ISRAEL IN THE WILDERNESS




CHAPTER 37

THE ISRAELITES FED WITH MANNA


SO Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the
wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and
found no water. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of
the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it
was called Marah. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What
shall we drink? and he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him
a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he
proved them, and said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of
the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and
wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will
put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the
Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.

And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore
and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters. And they
took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children
of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and
Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing
out of the land of Egypt. And the whole congregation of the children
of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: and the
children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the
hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots,
and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth
into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

[Sidenote: Exodus 16]

Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every
day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.
And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather
daily. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the
land of Egypt: and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the
LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
are we, that ye murmur against us? And Moses said, This shall be, when
the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning
bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye
murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against
us, but against the LORD.

And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard
your murmurings. And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the
wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I have heard the murmurings of
the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat
flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall
know that I am the LORD your God. And it came to pass, that at even the
quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay
round about the host. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold,
upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small
as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children of Israel saw
it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it
was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath
given you to eat. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded,
Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them
which are in his tents.

And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had
nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered
every man according to his eating. And Moses said, Let no man leave of
it till the morning. Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses;
but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms,
and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. And they gathered it every
morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot,
it melted.

And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much
bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation
came and told Moses. And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD
hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD:
bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe;
and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the
morning. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. And Moses said, Eat
that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not
find it in the field. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh
day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

[Illustration: MOSES STRIKING THE ROCK, BY MURILLO

IN LA CARIDAD MUSEUM, SEVILLE]

And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the
seventh day for to gather, and they found none. And the LORD said unto
Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for
that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on
the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place,
let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested
on the seventh day.

And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like
coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with
honey.

And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an
omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread
wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth
from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put
an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be
kept for your generations. As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid
it up before the Testimony, to be kept. And the children of Israel did
eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did
eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.




CHAPTER 38

MOSES BRINGS WATER FROM THE ROCK--MOSES AND HIS FATHER IN LAW


[Sidenote: Exodus 17]

AND all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment
of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the
people to drink. Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said,
Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye
with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? And the people thirsted there
for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore
is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our
children and our cattle with thirst? And Moses cried unto the LORD,
saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone
me. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take
with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest
the river, take in thine hand, and go. Behold, I will stand before thee
there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and
there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses
did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. And he called the name of
the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children
of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among
us, or not?

[Sidenote: Exodus 18]

Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses said
unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to
morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine
hand. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:
and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. And it came
to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when
he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses' hands were heavy;
and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and
Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the
other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down
of the sun. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge
of the sword. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial
in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly
put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. And Moses built an
altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi: for he said, Because
the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from
generation to generation.

When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all
that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the
LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; then Jethro, Moses' father in
law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, and her
two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have
been an alien in a strange land: and the name of the other was Eliezer;
for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from
the sword of Pharaoh: and Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his
sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at
the mount of God: and he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am
come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and
kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came
into the tent. And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had
done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the
travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered
them. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done
to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of
the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know
that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they
dealt proudly he was above them. And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took
a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the
elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people:
and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. And
when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said,
What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou
thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?
And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me
to enquire of God: when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I
judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of
God, and his laws. And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing
that thou doest is not good. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and
this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee;
thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. Hearken now unto my
voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou
for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the
way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. Moreover
thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God,
men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be
rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and
rulers of tens: and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it
shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and
they shall bear the burden with thee. If thou shalt do this thing, and
God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this
people shall also go to their place in peace. So Moses hearkened to the
voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. And Moses
chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people,
rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers
of tens. And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

[Sidenote: Exodus 19]

And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his
own land.




CHAPTER 39

THE LAW GIVEN FROM MOUNT SINAI


IN the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of
the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of
Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped
before the mount. And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto
him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto
the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you
unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep
my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak
unto the children of Israel.

[Sidenote: Exodus 20]

And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before
their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. And all the
people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we
will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. And
the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that
the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.
And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them
to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, and be ready
against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the
sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. And thou shalt set bounds
unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye
go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth
the mount shall be surely put to death: there shall not an hand touch
it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast
or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall
come up to the mount.

And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the
people; and they washed their clothes. And he said unto the people, Be
ready against the third day.

And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were
thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the
voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was
in the camp trembled. And Moses brought forth the people out of the
camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended
upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a
furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the
trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God
answered him by a voice. And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on
the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the
mount; and Moses went up.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they
break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. And let
the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves,
lest the LORD break forth upon them. And Moses said unto the LORD, The
people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying,
Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. And the LORD said unto
him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with
thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up
unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. So Moses went down unto
the people, and spake unto them.

And God spake all these words, saying, I am the LORD thy God, which
have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage.

Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that
is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to
them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of
them that love me, and keep my commandments.

Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD
will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour,
and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD
thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

Thou shalt not kill.

Thou shalt not commit adultery.

Thou shalt not steal.

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy
neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox,
nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

[Sidenote: Exodus 24]

And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the
noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw
it, they removed, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, Speak
thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we
die. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove
you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. And
the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness
where God was.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of
Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. Ye shall
not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of
gold. An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and
thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee,
and I will bless thee.




CHAPTER 40

MOSES CALLED UP INTO THE MOUNT


AND he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab,
and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar
off. And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come
nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

[Sidenote: Exodus 25]

And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all
the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said,
All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. And Moses wrote all
the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded
an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve
tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of the children of Israel,
which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen
unto the LORD. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons;
and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. And he took the book
of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said,
All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient. And Moses took
the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood
of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these
words.

Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the
elders of Israel: and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under
his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were
the body of heaven in his clearness. And upon the nobles of the
children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat
and drink.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and
be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. And
Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the
mount of God. And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until
we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if
any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went
up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the
LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the
seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the
sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of
the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into
the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in
the mount forty days and forty nights.





CHAPTER 41

THE TABERNACLE AND THE PRIESTHOOD


AND the LORD commanded Moses to tell the children of Israel to bring
him offerings of gold, and silver, and brass, of blue, and purple,
and scarlet, and fine linen, of rams' skins, and badgers' skins, and
shittim wood, oil, spices, and sweet incense, and stones to be set in
the priests' garments.

And they were to make an ark of shittim wood overlaid with gold, with
gold rings in the four corners, and staves to put in the rings to bear
it with: and in the ark they were to put the testimony which God should
give them.

And they were to make a mercy seat of pure gold, with two cherubims,
one on each end, with their faces looking toward each other, and their
wings stretched out over the mercy seat. And the mercy seat was to rest
upon the ark.

And God said, There I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee
from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are
upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in
commandment unto the children of Israel.

And they were to make a table of shittim wood overlaid with gold, with
rings and staves to bear it, and dishes and spoons of pure gold: and on
the table was to be set the shewbread before God alway. And they were
to make a candlestick of pure gold, with six branches coming out of
the sides of it, three branches on each side: and its seven lamps were
to be kept lighted. And there were to be tongs and snuffdishes of pure
gold.

And the tabernacle was to be made with ten curtains of fine twined
linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, fastened with loops of blue
and gold. And over these were to be eleven curtains of goats' hair, and
these were to be covered with rams' skins dyed red, and over these a
covering of badgers' skins. And the boards and bars for the tabernacle
were to be made of shittim wood overlaid with gold, with fastenings of
silver. And they were to make a vail of fine twined linen, and hang it
upon four pillars of shittim wood, to divide between the holy place and
the most holy. And the ark of the testimony was to be brought within
the vail, and the mercy seat put upon it in the most holy place. But
the table and the candlestick were to be without the vail.

[Sidenote: Exodus 26]

And the hanging for the door of the tent was to be of blue, and purple,
and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework.

And they were to make an altar of shittim wood, with horns on the
corners, and staves to bear it, and to overlay it all with brass, and
to make vessels of brass for the altar.

And the tabernacle was to have a court round about it, enclosed by
linen curtains hung on pillars of brass. And the gate of the court was
to be hung with blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen,
wrought with needlework.

And the children of Israel were commanded to bring pure oil olive
beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always. And Aaron and
his sons were to order it from evening to morning before the LORD.

And Aaron and his sons were to minister unto the LORD in the priest's
office. And Moses was commanded to make holy garments for them; an
ephod of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, and on
the shoulders of the ephod were to be two onyx stones, with the names
of the children of Israel graven on them: six of their names on one
stone, and the other six names on the other stone, according to their
birth. And they were to make the breastplate of judgment with four rows
of stones set in it: the first row a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle;
the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; the third row
a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst; and the fourth row a beryl, and
an onyx, and a jasper. And the names of the twelve tribes of the
children of Israel were to be engraved on the stones. And God said unto
Moses, And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the
breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy
place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.

[Sidenote: Exodus 29]

And the robe of the ephod was to be made of blue, and upon the hem of
it pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and golden bells
between the pomegranates.

And God said, Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon
it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. And thou
shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the
forefront of the mitre it shall be. And it shall be upon Aaron's
forehead. And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory
and for beauty. And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his
sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify
them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

And they were to offer upon the altar two lambs of the first year
day by day; one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb at even; to
be a continual burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation before the LORD.

And God said, There I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. And I will sanctify the
tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also
both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.

And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them
forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the
LORD their God.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, When thou takest the sum of the
children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man
a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that
there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. This they
shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half
a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: an half shekel shall be
the offering of the LORD. Every one that passeth among them that are
numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto
the LORD. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give
less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to
make an atonement for your souls. And thou shalt take the atonement
money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service
of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto
the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your
souls.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, See, I have called by name
Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to
devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to
work in all manner of workmanship. And I, behold, I have given with him
Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts
of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
that I have commanded thee. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an
end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony,
tables of stone, written with the finger of God.




CHAPTER 42

THE PEOPLE WORSHIP THE GOLDEN CALF


AND when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the
mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said
unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this
Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not
what is become of him. And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden
earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of
your daughters, and bring them unto me. And all the people brake off
the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto
Aaron. And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These
be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made
proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. And they rose
up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace
offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to
play.

[Sidenote: Exodus 32]

And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which
thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:
they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have
sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have
brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold,
it is a stiffnecked people: now therefore let me alone, that my wrath
may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will
make of thee a great nation. And Moses besought the LORD his God, and
said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou
hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with
a mighty hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For
mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath,
and repent of this evil against thy people. Remember Abraham, Isaac,
and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and
saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven,
and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and
they shall inherit it for ever. And the LORD repented of the evil which
he thought to do unto his people.

[Sidenote: Exodus 32]

And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of
the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their
sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. And the
tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God,
graven upon the tables.

And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said
unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. And he said, It is not
the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of
them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I
hear.

And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he
saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast
the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. And he
took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground
it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of
Israel drink of it.

And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou
hast brought so great a sin upon them?

And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my LORD wax hot: thou knowest the
people, that they are set on mischief. For they said unto me, Make us
gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that
brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of
him. And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it
off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came
out this calf.

Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the
LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered
themselves together unto him. And he said unto them, Thus saith the
LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in
and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his
brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. And
the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell
of the people that day about three thousand men. For Moses had said,
Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son,
and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people,
Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD;
peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned
a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt
forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book
which thou hast written.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him
will I blot out of my book. Therefore now go, lead the people unto the
place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go
before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their
sin upon them. And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the
calf, which Aaron made.




CHAPTER 43

THE SECOND SET OF TABLES


AND the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the
people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto a land
flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee;
for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.

And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man
did put on him his ornaments.

And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar
off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation.
And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto
the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. And it
came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the
people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after
Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. And it came to pass, as
Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and
stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses.
And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door:
and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.
And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his
friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the
son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

[Sidenote: Exodus 33]

And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this
people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet
thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace
in my sight. Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace
in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.

And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.

And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up
hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so
shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are
upon the face of the earth.

And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast
spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.

And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will
proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom
I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. And
he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and
live.

And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt
stand upon a rock: and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth
by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee
with my hand while I pass by: and I will take away mine hand, and thou
shalt see my back: but my face shall not be seen.

[Sidenote: Exodus 34]

And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto
the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in
the first tables, which thou brakest. And be ready in the morning, and
come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to
me in the top of the mount. And no man shall come up with thee, neither
let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks
nor herds feed before that mount.

And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose
up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD
had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and
proclaimed the name of the LORD. And the LORD passed by before him,
and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious,
longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for
thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will
by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon
the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to
the fourth generation.

And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
worshipped. And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O
Lord, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked
people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine
inheritance.

And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will
do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any
nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of
the LORD. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare
in the midst of thee: but ye shall destroy their altars, break their
images, and cut down their groves: for thou shalt worship no other god:
for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the
tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did
neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the
words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the
two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the
mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he
talked with him. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw
Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come
nigh him. And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. And
afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in
commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.

And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took
the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the
children of Israel that which he was commanded. And the children of
Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and
Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with
him.




CHAPTER 44

THE SETTING UP OF THE TABERNACLE


AND Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, Take ye
from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing
heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD.

And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the
presence of Moses. And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up,
and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD'S
offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all
his service, and for the holy garments. And all the women that were
wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they
had spun. And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
goats' hair. And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones for the
ephod, and for the breastplate; and spice, and oil for the light, and
for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

[Sidenote: Exodus 35]

Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom
the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner
of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the
LORD had commanded. And they received of Moses all the offering, which
the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of
the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free
offerings every morning.

And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than
enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.

And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more
work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained
from bringing. For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work
to make it, and too much.

Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation
finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
commanded Moses, so did they. And Moses did look upon all the work,
and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had
they done it: and Moses blessed them.

And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the
first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. Then a
cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD
filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent
of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of
the LORD filled the tabernacle. And when the cloud was taken up from
over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their
journeys: but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
till the day that it was taken up. For the cloud of the LORD was upon
the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all
the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

[Sidenote: Leviticus 16]

And Moses consecrated Aaron and his sons, as God had commanded; and
Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded through
Moses.

And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and
came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering,
and peace offerings. And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of
the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory
of the LORD appeared unto all the people. And there came a fire out
from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering
and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on
their faces.

And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer,
and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire
before the LORD, which he commanded them not. And there went out fire
from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD. Then
Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will
be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I
will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.




CHAPTER 45

THE DAY OF ATONEMENT


AND the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
when they offered before the LORD, and died; and the LORD said unto
Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times
into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is
upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the
mercy seat. Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young
bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. He shall
put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon
his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen
mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall
he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on. And he shall take of
the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a
sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. And Aaron shall offer
his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an
atonement for himself, and for his house. And he shall take the two
goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one
lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall
bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him for a sin
offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat,
shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with
him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. And Aaron
shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and
shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill
the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself: and he shall
take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before
the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring
it within the vail: and he shall put the incense upon the fire before
the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that
is upon the testimony, that he die not: and he shall take of the blood
of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat
eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with
his finger seven times.

Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as
he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy
seat, and before the mercy seat: and he shall make an atonement for
the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel,
and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he
do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
in the midst of their uncleanness. And there shall be no man in the
tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement
in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for
himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make
an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and
of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round
about. And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
children of Israel. And when he hath made an end of reconciling the
holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he
shall bring the live goat: and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the
head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the
children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the
hand of a fit man into the wilderness: and the goat shall bear upon him
all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the
goat in the wilderness.




CHAPTER 46

THE PEOPLE ARE COMMANDED TO BE HOLY


[Sidenote: Leviticus 19]

AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto all the congregation
of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for
I the LORD your God am holy. Ye shall fear every man his mother, and
his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. [Sidenote:
Leviticus 23]

Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the
LORD your God.

And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap
the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of
thy harvest. And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor
and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.

And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane
the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him
that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.

Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the
blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect
the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in
righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither
shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.

Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise
rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy
people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.

Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the
old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.

But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born
among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in
the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or
in measure.

Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye
have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
Egypt.

Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and
do them: I am the LORD.




CHAPTER 47

THE FEASTS OF THE LORD


AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye
shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts. Six
days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest;
ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your
dwellings.

In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD'S passover.

And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened
bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. In the
first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile
work therein. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no
servile work therein.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give
unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a
sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall
wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow
after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. And ye shall offer that day
when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year
for a burnt offering unto the LORD. And ye shall eat neither bread,
nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have
brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever
throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from
the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths
shall be complete: even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall
ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the
LORD.

In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a
sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets. Ye shall do no servile work
therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of
atonement; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made
by fire unto the LORD. And ye shall do no work in that same day: for
it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD
your God. Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD
seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth
day shall be a sabbath. And ye shall take you on the first day the
boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick
trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
your God seven days. And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven
days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations:
ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. Ye shall dwell in booths
seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: that
your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell
in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD
your God. And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of
the LORD.

[Sidenote: Leviticus 24]

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel,
that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause
the lamps to burn continually.

And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two
tenth deals shall be in one cake. And thou shalt set them in two rows,
six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. And thou shalt put
pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a
memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

[Sidenote: Leviticus 25]

Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually,
being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. And
it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy
place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made
by fire by a perpetual statute.




CHAPTER 48

THE SEVENTH YEAR AND THE YEAR OF JUBILE


AND the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which
I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD. Six years
thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard,
and gather in the fruit thereof; but in the seventh year shall be a
sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt
neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. That which groweth of
its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the
grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout
all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile
unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye
shall return every man unto his family. Ye shall not sow, neither reap
that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy
vine undressed. For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye
shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.

The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are
strangers and sojourners with me. And if thy brother that dwelleth by
thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to
serve as a bondservant: but as an hired servant, and as a sojourner,
he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:
and then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with
him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of
his fathers shall he return. For unto me the children of Israel are
servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of
Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her
increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. And your
threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach
unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and
dwell in your land safely. And I will give peace in the land, and ye
shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil
beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the
sword. And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
be my people. But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all
these commandments, but break my covenant: I will set my face against
you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you
shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. And
if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish
you seven times more for your sins. And I will break the pride of your
power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield
her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies
shall eat you up. And they that are left of you shall pine away in
their iniquity in your enemies' lands.

If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and
that also they have walked contrary unto me: then will I remember my
covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my
covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will
not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly,
and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. But
I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom
I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen,
that I might be their God: I am the LORD. These are the statutes and
judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of
Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.




CHAPTER 49

THE NUMBERING OF THE PEOPLE


[Sidenote: Numbers 1]

AND the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month,
in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
saying, Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the
number of their names, every male by their polls; from twenty years old
and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and
Aaron shall number them by their armies.

And Moses and Aaron assembled all the congregation together on the
first day of the second month. And as the LORD commanded Moses, so he
numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai, every male from twenty years
old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war. All they that
were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty.

But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered
among them. For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying, Only thou
shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among
the children of Israel: but thou shalt appoint the Levites over the
tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over
all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all
the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp
round about the tabernacle.

[Sidenote: Numbers 7]

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Bring the tribe of Levi near,
and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto
him. And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they
are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel. And thou shalt
appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's
office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, And I, behold, I have taken the
Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn
among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;
because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the
firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in
Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.

And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their
families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number
them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he
was commanded.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto his
sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel,
saying unto them, The LORD bless thee, and keep thee: the LORD make his
face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the LORD lift up his
countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And they shall put my name
upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.




CHAPTER 50

THE OFFERINGS OF THE PRINCES--THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEY


AND it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the
instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and
had anointed them, and sanctified them; that the princes of Israel,
heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the
tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: and they
brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve
oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they
brought them before the tabernacle.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Take it of them, that they
may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and
thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his
service. And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
Levites.

And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each
prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

[And all the princes of Israel offered the same offering, each on his
day. They were twelve days offering.]

This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was anointed,
by the princes of Israel: twelve chargers of silver, twelve silver
bowls, twelve spoons of gold: each charger of silver weighing an
hundred and thirty shekels, each bowl seventy: all the silver vessels
weighed two thousand and four hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary: the golden spoons were twelve, full of incense, weighing ten
shekels apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary: all the gold of the
spoons was an hundred and twenty shekels. All the oxen for the burnt
offering were twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the lambs of the first
year twelve, with their meat offering: and the kids of the goats for
sin offering twelve. And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace
offerings were twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats
sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty. This was the dedication of
the altar, after that it was anointed. And when Moses was gone into the
tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the
voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon
the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake unto
him.

And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered
the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there
was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until
the morning. So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the
appearance of fire by night. And when the cloud was taken up from the
tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in
the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched
their tents. At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel
journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as
the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. And
when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the
children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.

[Sidenote: Numbers 11]

And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the
second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the
testimony. And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the
LORD by the hand of Moses.

And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and
the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days'
journey, to search out a resting place for them. And the cloud of the
LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp. And it came
to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD,
and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee
before thee. And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
thousands of Israel.




CHAPTER 51

THE PEOPLE MURMUR


AND when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD
heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt
among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the
camp. And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
LORD, the fire was quenched. And the children of Israel also wept
again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish,
which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and
the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: but now our soul is dried
away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes. And
the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour
of bdellium. And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it
in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes
of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

[Sidenote: Numbers 11]

And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon
it.

Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man
in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly;
Moses also was displeased. And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast
thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in
thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? Have
I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest
say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the
sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep
unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. I am not able to bear
all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. And if thou deal
thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour
in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,
and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
congregation, that they may stand there with thee.

And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the
spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall
bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself
alone. And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us
in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. Ye
shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days,
nor twenty days; but even a whole month, until it come out at your
nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised
the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came
we forth out of Egypt? And Moses said, The people, among whom I am,
are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them
flesh, that they may eat a whole month. Shall the flocks and the herds
be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be
gathered together for them, to suffice them? And the LORD said unto
Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my
word shall come to pass unto thee or not. And Moses gat him into the
camp, he and the elders of Israel.

And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the
sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this
side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about
the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.
And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the
next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered
ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about
the camp. And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the
LORD smote the people with a very great plague. And he called the name
of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people
that lusted. And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto
Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.




CHAPTER 52

MIRIAM'S LEPROSY


MIRIAM and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman
whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. And they
said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken
also by us? And the LORD heard it. (Now the man Moses was very meek,
above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.) And the LORD
spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye
three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the
door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came
forth. And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,
I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak
unto him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all
mine house. With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and
not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:
wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam
became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and,
behold, she was leprous. And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my LORD, I
beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly,
and wherein we have sinned. Let her not be as one dead, of whom the
flesh is half consumed.

[Sidenote: Numbers 12]

And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech
thee. And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from
the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again. And
Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed
not till Miriam was brought in again. And afterward the people removed
from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.




CHAPTER 53

THE SPIES SENT OUT


[Sidenote: Numbers 13]

AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Send thou men, that they may
search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel:
of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler
among them.

And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them,
Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain: and see the
land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they
be strong or weak, few or many; and what the land is that they dwell
in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell
in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; and what the land is, whether
it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of
good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the
time of the firstripe grapes.

So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto
Rehob, as men come to Hamath. And they ascended by the south, and came
unto Hebron; and they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between
two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the
figs. And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of
Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the
congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. And they told him,
and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it
floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. Nevertheless
the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled,
and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. The
Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the
Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites
dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

And Caleb [who was one of the twelve spies that went up] stilled the
people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it;
for we are well able to overcome it. But the men that went up with him
said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger
than we. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which
we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great
stature. And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of
the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we
were in their sight.




CHAPTER 54

THE ISRAELITES REBEL, AND ARE TURNED BACK TO WANDER IN THE WILDERNESS


AND all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the
people wept that night. And all the children of Israel murmured against
Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them,
Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had
died in this wilderness! And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto
this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should
be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? And they
said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into
Egypt. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
of the congregation of the children of Israel.

And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were
of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: and they spake unto
all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we
passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. If the LORD
delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a
land which floweth with milk and honey. Only rebel not ye against the
LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for
us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear
them not. But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And
the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation
before all the children of Israel.

[Sidenote: Numbers 14]

And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me?
and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which
I have shewed among them? I will smite them with the pestilence, and
disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier
than they.

And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for
thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) and they
will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that
thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face,
and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them,
by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations
which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, Because the
LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware
unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. And now,
I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou
hast spoken, saying, The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy,
forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the
guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto
the third and fourth generation. Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity
of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou
hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

[Sidenote: Numbers 14]

And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: but as truly
as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which
I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten
times, and have not hearkened to my voice; surely they shall not see
the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them
that provoked me see it: but my servant Caleb, because he had another
spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the
land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. To morrow turn
you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, How long shall I
bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard
the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken
in mine ears, so will I do to you: your carcases shall fall in this
wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole
number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against
me, doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and
Joshua the son of Nun. But your little ones, which ye said should be
a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye
have despised. But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
wilderness. After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities,
even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. I the LORD
have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that
are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be
consumed, and there they shall die.

And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and
made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a
slander upon the land, even those men that did bring up the evil report
upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. But Joshua the son
of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went
to search the land, lived still. And Moses told these sayings unto all
the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.

And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of
the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place
which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. And Moses said,
Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it
shall not prosper. Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be
not smitten before your enemies. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites
are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are
turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. But
they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the
covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. Then
the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill,
and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.




CHAPTER 55

THE REBELLION OF KORAH


NOW Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and
Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons
of Reuben, took men: and they rose up before Moses, with certain of
the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly,
famous in the congregation, men of renown: and they gathered themselves
together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take
too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of
them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
above the congregation of the LORD?

And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: and he spake unto Korah
and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who
are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him:
even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him. This
do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; and put fire therein,
and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that
the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much
upon you, ye sons of Levi.

[Sidenote: Numbers 16]

And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: seemeth
it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated
you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to
do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the
congregation to minister unto them? And he hath brought thee near to
him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the
priesthood also? For which cause both thou and all thy company are
gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
against him?

And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which
said, We will not come up: is it a small thing that thou hast brought
us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in
the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk
and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou
put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou
their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt
one of them. And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company
before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: and take every
man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD
every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and
Aaron, each of you his censer.

And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation with Moses and Aaron. And Korah gathered all
the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the
congregation. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume
them in a moment.

[Sidenote: Numbers 16]

And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits
of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the
congregation?

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the congregation,
saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram.

And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders
of Israel followed him. And he spake unto the congregation, saying,
Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch
nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. So they gat
up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side:
and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents,
and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. And Moses
said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these
works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. If these men die the
common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of
all men; then the LORD hath not sent me. But if the LORD make a new
thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that
appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye
shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.

And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words,
that the ground clave asunder that was under them: and the earth opened
her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men
that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that
appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed
upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. And all
Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they
said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the
people of the LORD. And it came to pass, when the congregation was
gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the
tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and
the glory of the LORD appeared. And Moses and Aaron came before the
tabernacle of the congregation. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in
a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off
the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation,
and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the
LORD; the plague is begun. And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran
into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun
among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
people. And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
was stayed.

Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven
hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah. And
Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation: and the plague was stayed.




CHAPTER 56

AARON'S ROD


AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of
Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of
their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their
fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. And
thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall
be for the head of the house of their fathers. And thou shalt lay them
up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I
will meet with you. And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom
I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their
princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to
their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was
among their rods. And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the
tabernacle of witness.

[Sidenote: Numbers 17]

And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle
of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was
budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded
almonds. And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto
all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the
testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt
quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. And Moses
did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he. And the children of
Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all
perish. Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD
shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their
land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and
thine inheritance among the children of Israel. And, behold, I have
given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance,
for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle
of the congregation.

Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle
of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. But the Levites
shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout
your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no
inheritance. But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer
as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to
inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel
they shall have no inheritance.

[Sidenote: Numbers 20]

Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the
desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and
Miriam died there, and was buried there.

And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. And the people
chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when
our brethren died before the LORD! And why have ye brought up the
congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle
should die there? And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of
Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or
of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water
to drink. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon
their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Take the rod, and gather thou
the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto
the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou
shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give
the congregation and their beasts drink. And Moses took the rod from
before the LORD, as he commanded him.

And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock,
and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out
of this rock? And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote
the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation
drank, and their beasts also.

And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to
sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall
not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. This
is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the
LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from
Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of
the land of Edom, saying, Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for
he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children
of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: and
strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.

And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor
in the sight of all the congregation. And Moses stripped Aaron of his
garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in
the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for
Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.




CHAPTER 57

THE BRAZEN SERPENT


AND they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass
the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged
because of the way. And the people spake against God, and against
Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our
soul loatheth this light bread. And the LORD sent fiery serpents among
the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we
have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,
that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the
people. And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is
bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent
of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a
serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he
lived.

And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or
into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but
we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.
And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon
gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the
wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. And Israel
smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon
unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the
children of Ammon was strong. And Israel took all these cities: and
Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all
the villages thereof. Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of
Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at
Edrei. And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered
him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land, and thou shalt do
to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at
Heshbon. So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.




CHAPTER 58

BALAK AND BALAAM


[Sidenote: Numbers 21]

AND the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of
Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

[Sidenote: Numbers 22]

And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
Amorites. And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were
many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. And
Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all
that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.
And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor,
which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to
call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:
behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against
me: come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they
are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite
them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom
thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and
spake unto him the words of Balak. And he said unto them, Lodge here
this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak
unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? And
Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent
unto me, saying, Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which
covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure
I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out. And God said unto
Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people:
for they are blessed.

And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak,
Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go
with you. And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak,
and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of
Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: for
I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever
thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would
give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word
of the LORD my God, to do less or more. Now therefore, I pray you,
tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say
unto me more.

And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come
to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall
say unto thee, that shalt thou do. And Balaam rose up in the morning,
and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.

And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD
stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon
his ass, and his two servants were with him. And the ass saw the angel
of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and
the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and
Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. But the angel of the
LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and
a wall on that side. And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she
thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the
wall: and he smote her again. And the angel of the LORD went further,
and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the
right hand or to the left. And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD,
she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he
smote the ass with a staff. And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass,
and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast
smitten me these three times? And Balaam said unto the ass, Because
thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now
would I kill thee. And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass,
upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I
ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the
LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed
down his head, and fell flat on his face. And the angel of the LORD
said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?
behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse
before me: and the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and
saved her alive. And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have
sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now
therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. And the
angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word
that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went
with the princes of Balak.

[Sidenote: Numbers 23]

And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him
unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the
utmost coast. And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto
thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able
indeed to promote thee to honour? And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am
come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word
that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. And Balaam went with
Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth. And Balak offered oxen and
sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. And
it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him
up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost
part of the people.

And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me
here seven oxen and seven rams. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken;
and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. And
Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go:
peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth
me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.

[Sidenote: Numbers 23]

And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars,
and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram. And the LORD
put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus
thou shalt speak. And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his
burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,
curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. How shall I curse, whom God hath
not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied? For
from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him:
lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the
nations. Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last
end be like his!

And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to
curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. And
he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD
hath put in my mouth? And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with
me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt
see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse
me them from thence. And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to
the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and
a ram on every altar. And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt
offering, while I meet the LORD yonder. And the LORD met Balaam, and
put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.
And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and
the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the
LORD spoken?

And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken
unto me, thou son of Zippor: God is not a man, that he should lie;
neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall
he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? Behold,
I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot
reverse it. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout
of a king is among them. God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it
were the strength of an unicorn. Surely there is no enchantment against
Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to
this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God
wrought! Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift
up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the
prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them
at all. But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto
another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse
me them from thence. And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor,
that looketh toward Jeshimon. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here
seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. And
Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every
altar. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his
tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
and the man whose eyes are open hath said: he hath said, which heard
the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a
trance, but having his eyes open: How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,
and thy tabernacles, O Israel! As the valleys are they spread forth, as
gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD
hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters. He shall pour the
water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his
king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. God
brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an
unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their
bones, and pierce them through with his arrows. He couched, he lay down
as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he
that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.

And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands
together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine
enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three
times. Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee
unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.
And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which
thou sentest unto me, saying, If Balak would give me his house full of
silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to
do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that
will I speak? And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and
I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the
latter days.

[Sidenote: Numbers 24]

And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
and the man whose eyes are open hath said: he hath said, which heard
the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw
the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes
open: I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh:
there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out
of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the
children of Sheth. And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a
possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. Out of Jacob
shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that
remaineth of the city. And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his
place: and Balak also went his way.




CHAPTER 59

THE ISRAELITES NUMBERED THE SECOND TIME


[Sidenote: Numbers 26]

AND it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar
the son of Aaron the priest, saying, Take the sum of all the
congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and
upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war
in Israel. And these were the numbered of the children of Israel, six
hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty. These are
they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered
the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the
priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the
wilderness of Sinai. For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely
die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb
the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and
see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. And when
thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as
Aaron thy brother was gathered. For ye rebelled against my commandment
in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me
at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh
in the wilderness of Zin.

And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, Let the LORD, the God of the
spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, which may go out
before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them
out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be
not as sheep which have no shepherd. And the LORD said unto Moses, Take
thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine
hand upon him; and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all
the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. And thou shalt
put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the
children of Israel may be obedient.

And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set
him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: and he
laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded
by the hand of Moses.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Avenge the children of Israel
of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto
the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of
Midian. And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
Moses; and they slew all the males. And they slew the kings of Midian:
Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.

Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great
multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land
of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle; the children
of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to
Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
If we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy
servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.

And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here
for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: but we ourselves will
go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought
them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced
cities because of the inhabitants of the land. We will not return unto
our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his
inheritance.

And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go
armed before the LORD to war, build you cities for your little ones,
and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your
mouth. And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. Our little
ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the
cities of Gilead: but thy servants will pass over, every man armed for
war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith. And Moses gave unto
them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and
unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon
king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land,
with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country
round about.

[Sidenote: Numbers 33]

And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
Jericho, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto
them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan; then
ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you,
and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images,
and quite pluck down all their high places: and ye shall dispossess
the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you
the land to possess it. And ye shall divide the land by lot for an
inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the
more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance:
every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth;
according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. But if ye
will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then
it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be
pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the
land wherein ye dwell. Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do
unto you, as I thought to do unto them.

And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
Jericho, saying, Command the children of Israel, that they give unto
the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in;
and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round
about them. And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites
there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the
manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and
two cities. So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall
be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

[Sidenote: Deuteronomy 1]

Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall
ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge, both
for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner
among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee
thither. And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in
judgment.




CHAPTER 60

THE DEATH OF MOSES


AND it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the
first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto
them. And Moses, after rehearsing to them the story of God's promises
and of his anger at their unbelief and disobedience; and how after
their wanderings they had conquered Sihon the Amorite, and Og the king
of Bashan, and taken possession of their lands, said,

I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that
the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do
unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. Ye shall not fear them: for
the LORD your God he shall fight for you. And I besought the LORD at
that time, saying, O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy
greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in
earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond
Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me:
and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me
of this matter. Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine
eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold
it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. But charge
Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over
before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which
thou shalt see.

Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD
my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go
to possess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom
and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and
understanding people. For what nation is there so great, who hath God
so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call
upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and
judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this
day? Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart
from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and
thy sons' sons; specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD
thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people
together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to
fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that
they may teach their children. And ye came near and stood under the
mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven,
with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. And the LORD spake unto you
out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw
no similitude; only ye heard a voice. And he declared unto you his
covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and
he wrote them upon two tables of stone. Take heed unto yourselves, lest
ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you,
and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the
LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. For the LORD thy God is a consuming
fire, even a jealous God.

When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall
have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make
a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in
the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: I call heaven
and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly
perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye
shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left
few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. And
there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone,
which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. But if from thence
thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him
with all thy heart and with all thy soul. When thou art in tribulation,
and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if
thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice:
(for the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee,
neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he
sware unto them.

[Sidenote: Deuteronomy 6]

Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD
he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none
else. Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with
thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the
earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.

And Moses rehearsed to the people the ten commandments, and said,

Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: and thou shalt love the
LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou
walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall
be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the
posts of thy house, and on thy gates.

[Sidenote: Deuteronomy 8]

And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee
these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove
thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep
his commandments, or no. And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to
hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did
thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live
by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
the LORD doth man live. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither
did thy foot swell, these forty years. Thou shalt also consider in
thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God
chasteneth thee. Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD
thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks
of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and
hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt
eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a
land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig
brass. When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the
LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. Beware that
thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments,
and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses,
and dwelt therein; and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and
thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is
multiplied; then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy
God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house
of bondage; who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there
was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not,
that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee
good at thy latter end; and thou say in thine heart, My power and the
might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. But thou shalt remember
the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth,
that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers,
as it is this day. And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD
thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them,
I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. As the
nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish;
because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.

Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in
his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his
judgments, and to hearken unto his voice: and the LORD hath avouched
thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and
that thou shouldest keep all his commandments; and to make thee high
above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in
honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God,
as he hath spoken.

And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, These shall stand
upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan;
Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
and these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher,
and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. And the Levites shall speak, and say
unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice, Cursed be the man that
maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the
work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place.
And all the people shall answer and say, Amen. Cursed be he that
setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall
say, Amen. Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And
all the people shall say, Amen. Cursed be he that maketh the blind to
wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen. Cursed be he
that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow.
And all the people shall say, Amen.

And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments
which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on
high above all nations of the earth: and all these blessings shall come
on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of
the LORD thy God. Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt
thou be in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the
fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy
kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy
store. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt
thou be when thou goest out.

[Sidenote: Deuteronomy 27]

If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are
written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful
name, THE LORD THY GOD; then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful.

And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee,
the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou
shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God
hath driven thee, and shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt
obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and
thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; that then
the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon
thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the
LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden
from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee,
in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

[Sidenote: Deuteronomy 31]

See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
in that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk
in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his
judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God
shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. But if
thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn
away, and worship other gods, and serve them; I denounce unto you this
day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your
days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess
it. I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have
set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose
life, that both thou and thy seed may live: that thou mayest love the
LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest
cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that
thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. And he said unto
them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go
out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go
over this Jordan. The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and
he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.

And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of
Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the
elders of Israel. And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every
seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of
tabernacles, when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God
in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all
Israel in their hearing. Gather the people together, men, and women,
and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may
hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe
to do all the words of this law: and that their children, which have
not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as
long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou
must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of
the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua
went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and
the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle. And the
LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, Get thee up into this
mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that
is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give
unto the children of Israel for a possession: and die in the mount
whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy
brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: because
ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of
Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not
in the midst of the children of Israel. Yet thou shalt see the land
before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give
the children of Israel.

[Sidenote: Deuteronomy 34]

And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to
the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed
him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of
Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,
and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm
trees, unto Zoar. And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I
sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it
unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou
shalt not go over thither.

So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,
according to the word of the LORD. And he buried him in a valley in
the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his
sepulchre unto this day.

And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was
not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the children of Israel wept
for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and
mourning for Moses were ended. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of
the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the
children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
Moses.

And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the
LORD knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the
LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his
servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all
the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

BOOK VI

JOSHUA AND THE CONQUEST OF PALESTINE




CHAPTER 61

RAHAB CONCEALS THE SPIES


NOW after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass,
that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister,
saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to
them, even to the children of Israel. There shall not any man be able
to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses,
so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Be
strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide
for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give
them. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou
shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do
according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make
thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I
commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither
be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest.

Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, Pass through
the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for
within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess
the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.

And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of
Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, Remember the word which Moses the
servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given
you rest, and hath given you this land. Your wives, your little ones,
and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this
side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the
mighty men of valour, and help them; until the LORD have given your
brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the
land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the
land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant
gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will
do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. According as we
hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only
the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. Whosoever he be
that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy
words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death.

And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly,
saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into
the house of a woman named Rahab, and lodged there. And it was told
the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night
of the children of Israel to search out the country. And the king of
Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to
thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search
out all the country. And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and
said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: and
it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was
dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue
after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them. But she had brought
them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of
flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. And the men pursued
after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which
pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.

[Sidenote: Joshua 2]

And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
and she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the
land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the
inhabitants of the land faint because of you. For we have heard how the
LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of
Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were
on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. And
as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did
there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD
your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.

Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have
shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's
house, and give me a true token: and that ye will save alive my father,
and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have,
and deliver our lives from death. And the men answered her, Our life
for your's, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when
the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly
with thee. Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for
her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. And she
said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you;
and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned:
and afterward may ye go your way. And the men said unto her, We will
be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear. Behold,
when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread
in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring
thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's
household, home unto thee. And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out
of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his
head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the
house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. And if
thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which
thou hast made us to swear. And she said, According unto your words,
so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the
scarlet line in the window. And they went, and came unto the mountain,
and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the
pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

[Sidenote: Joshua 3]

So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed
over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that
befell them: and they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered
into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
country do faint because of us.




CHAPTER 62

THE ISRAELITES PASS OVER JORDAN


AND Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim,
and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there
before they passed over. And it came to pass after three days, that
the officers went through the host; and they commanded the people,
saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and
the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your
place, and go after it. Yet there shall be a space between you and it,
about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye
may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way
heretofore. And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for
to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you. And Joshua spake unto the
priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before
the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before
the people.

And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in
the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses,
so I will be with thee. And thou shalt command the priests that bear
the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the
water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear
the words of the LORD your God. And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know
that the living God is among you. Behold, the ark of the covenant of
the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. Now
therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every
tribe a man. And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the
feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the
earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan
shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they
shall stand upon an heap.

And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass
over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the
people; and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the
water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an
heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those
that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed,
and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. And
the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on
dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over
on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.

[Sidenote: Joshua 4]

And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan,
that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, Take you twelve men out of the
people, out of every tribe a man, and command ye them, saying, Take you
hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests'
feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you,
and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.
Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children
of Israel, out of every tribe a man: and Joshua said unto them, Pass
over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and
take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto
the number of the tribes of the children of Israel. And the children
of Israel did so as Joshua commanded. And Joshua set up twelve stones
in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests
which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this
day. For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak
unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the
people hasted and passed over. And the children of Reuben, and the
children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed
before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them: about forty
thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to
the plains of Jericho.

[Sidenote: Joshua 6]

On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and
they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. And
the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, Command the priests that bear the
ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. Joshua therefore
commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. And it came to
pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests'
feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan
returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did
before.

And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first
month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. And
those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch
in Gilgal. And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean
these stones? then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came
over this Jordan on dry land. For the LORD your God dried up the waters
of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your
God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were
gone over: that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.

And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were
on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites,
which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of
Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over,
that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more,
because of the children of Israel. And the children of Israel encamped
in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at
even in the plains of Jericho. And they did eat of the old corn of the
land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched
corn in the selfsame day. And the manna ceased on the morrow after
they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children
of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land
of Canaan that year. And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho,
that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto
him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And he
said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And
Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto
him, What saith my lord unto his servant? And the captain of the LORD'S
host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place
whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.




CHAPTER 63

THE SIEGE OF JERICHO


NOW Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel:
none went out, and none came in. And the LORD said unto Joshua, See,
I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the
mighty men of valour. And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war,
and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. And
seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns:
and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the
priests shall blow with the trumpets. And it shall come to pass, that
when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the
sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout;
and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall
ascend up every man straight before him.

And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take
up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets
of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD. And he said unto the people,
Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before
the ark of the LORD. And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto
the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the
ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. And the armed men went
before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came
after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. And
Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make
any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your
mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout. So the ark
of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came
into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

[Sidenote: Joshua 6]

And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark
of the LORD. And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns
before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the
trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came
after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the
trumpets. And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
into the camp: so they did six days. And it came to pass on the seventh
day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed
the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they
compassed the city seven times.

And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the
trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given
you the city. And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that
are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab shall live, she and all that are
with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. And
ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make
yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the
camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. But all the silver, and gold,
and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they
shall come into the treasury of the LORD.

So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it
came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and
the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat,
so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before
him, and they took the city. And they utterly destroyed all that was
in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and
ass, with the edge of the sword. And Joshua saved Rahab alive, and her
father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel
even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent
to spy out Jericho.

[Sidenote: Joshua 7]

And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before
the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay
the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall
he set up the gates of it.

So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the
country.




CHAPTER 64

THE TRESPASS OF ACHAN


BUT the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed
thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, of the tribe of Judah, took of
the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
children of Israel. And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is
beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them,
saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people
go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai;
and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.
So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and
they fled before the men of Ai. And the men of Ai smote of them about
thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto
Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the
people melted, and became as water.

And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before
the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel,
and put dust upon their heads. And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD,
wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver
us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had
been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! O Lord, what shall
I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! For the
Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and
shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what
wilt thou do unto thy great name?

And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus
upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed
my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the
accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they
have put it even among their own stuff. Therefore the children of
Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs
before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be
with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. Up,
sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow:
for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in
the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies,
until ye take away the accursed thing from among you. In the morning
therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall
be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the
families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come
by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come
man by man. And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed
thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he
hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought
folly in Israel.

So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their
tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: and he brought the family
of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the
family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: and he brought
his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of
Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. And Joshua
said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of
Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast
done; hide it not from me. And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed
I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I
done: when I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two
hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight,
then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the
earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it
was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. And they took them out of
the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the
children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD. And Joshua, and
all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and
the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters,
and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that
he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor. And Joshua
said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day.
And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after
they had stoned them with stones. And they raised over him a great heap
of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of
his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of
Achor, unto this day.




CHAPTER 65

THE CAPTURE OF AI


[Sidenote: Joshua 8]

AND the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I
have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,
and his land: and thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof,
shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the
city behind it.

[Sidenote: Joshua 8]

So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and
Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them
away by night. And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in
wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the
city, but be ye all ready: and I, and all the people that are with me,
will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come
out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, (for
they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for
they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will
flee before them. Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon
the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. And it
shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on
fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have
commanded you.

Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and
abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged
that night among the people. And Joshua rose up early in the morning,
and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel,
before the people to Ai. And all the people, even the people of war
that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city,
and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between
them and Ai. And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie
in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city. And
when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north
of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua
went that night into the midst of the valley.

And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and
rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to
battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
city. And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. And all the people that
were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued
after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. And there was not a
man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they
left the city open, and pursued after Israel. And the LORD said unto
Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I
will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that
he had in his hand toward the city. And the ambush arose quickly out
of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand:
and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the
city on fire. And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw,
and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled
to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. And when Joshua and
all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke
of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the
midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they
smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. And the
king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. And it came to
pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai
in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they
were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed,
that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge
of the sword. And so it was, that all that fell that day were twelve
thousand, even all the men of Ai. For Joshua drew not his hand back,
wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed
all the inhabitants of Ai. Only the cattle and the spoil of that city
Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of
the LORD which he commanded Joshua. And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it
an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day. And the king of Ai
he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down,
Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree,
and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon
a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel,
as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole
stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered
thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.
And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he
wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. And all Israel, and
their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the
ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark
of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born
among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them
over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded
before, that they should bless the people of Israel. And afterward he
read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to
all that is written in the book of the law. There was not a word of all
that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation
of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that
were conversant among them.




CHAPTER 66

THE CRAFT OF THE GIBEONITES


[Sidenote: Joshua 9]

AND it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan,
in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great
sea over against Lebanon, heard thereof; that they gathered themselves
together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. And
when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho
and to Ai, they did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles,
old, and rent, and bound up; and old shoes and clouted upon their feet,
and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was
dry and mouldy. And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and
said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country:
now therefore make ye a league with us. And the men of Israel said unto
them, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league
with you? And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua
said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? And they said
unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of
the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and
all that he did in Egypt, and all that he did to the two kings of the
Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og
king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth. Wherefore our elders and all
the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with
you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are
your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. This our bread
we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came
forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: and
these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be
rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of
the very long journey. And the men took of their victuals, and asked
not counsel at the mouth of the LORD. And Joshua made peace with them,
and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the
congregation sware unto them.

And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a
league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and
that they dwelt among them. And the children of Israel journeyed, and
came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon,
and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim. And the children of
Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had
sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation
murmured against the princes. But all the princes said unto all the
congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now
therefore we may not touch them. This we will do to them; we will even
let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we
sware unto them; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water
unto all the congregation.

And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore
have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell
among us? Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for
the house of my God. And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it
was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded
his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid
of our lives because of you, and have done this thing. And now, behold,
we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto
us, do. And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
the children of Israel, that they slew them not. And Joshua made them
that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and
for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he
should choose.




CHAPTER 67

JOSHUA CONQUERS THE KINGS OF CANAAN


NOW it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard
how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; and how the
inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of
the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men
thereof were mighty. Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent unto
the kings of Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, saying, Come up unto
me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with
Joshua and with the children of Israel. Therefore the five kings of
the Amorites gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all
their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it. And
the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack
not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and
help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains
are gathered together against us. So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he,
and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered
them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all
night. And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with
a great slaughter at Gibeon. And it came to pass, as they fled from
before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD
cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they
died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
children of Israel slew with the sword.

[Sidenote: Joshua 10]

Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up
the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight
of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the
valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until
the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this
written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of
heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. And there was no
day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the
voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.

[Sidenote: Joshua 14]

And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave
at Makkedah. And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the
cave, and set men by it for to keep them: and stay ye not, but pursue
after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to
enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into
your hand. And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they
were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced
cities. And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five
kings unto me out of the cave. And they did so, and brought forth those
five kings unto him out of the cave. And it came to pass, when they
brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men
of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with
him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. And Joshua said
unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage:
for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on
five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. And
it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua
commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into
the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's
mouth, which remain until this very day.

So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and
of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none
remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
Israel commanded. And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto
Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. And all these
kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God
of Israel fought for Israel. And Joshua smote one and thirty kings
in all, and took the whole land, and gave it for an inheritance unto
Israel.




CHAPTER 68

JOSHUA DIVIDES THE LAND


THESE are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the
land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun,
and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel,
distributed for inheritance to them. By lot was their inheritance,
as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and
for the half tribe. For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes
and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he
gave none inheritance among them. For the children of Joseph were two
tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the
Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for
their cattle and for their substance. As the LORD commanded Moses, so
the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.

Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the
son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing
that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee
in Kadesh-barnea. Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the
LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
word again as it was in mine heart. Nevertheless my brethren that went
up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed
the LORD my God. And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land
whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.
And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty
and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while
the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am
this day fourscore and five years old. As yet I am as strong this day
as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even
so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in. Now
therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day;
for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that
the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me,
then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said. And Joshua
blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an
inheritance. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the
son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
followed the LORD God of Israel. And the name of Hebron before was
Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the
land had rest from war.

[Sidenote: Joshua 15]

This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their
families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward
was the uttermost part of the south coast. And their south border was
from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:
and the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan.
And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at
the uttermost part of Jordan: and the border went up by the valley of
the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is
Jerusalem: and the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about
according to their families. As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the
Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto
the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from
Jericho throughout mount Beth-el, and goeth out from Beth-el to Luz,
unto the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings
out thereof are at the sea. So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and
Ephraim, took their inheritance. And they drave not out the Canaanites
that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites
unto this day, and serve under tribute.

[Sidenote: Joshua 18]

And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together
at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the
land was subdued before them. And there remained among the children of
Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. And
Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to
possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them,
and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according
to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me. And they
shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast
on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on
the north. Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and
bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here
before the LORD our God. But the Levites have no part among you; for
the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben,
and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them. And
the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to
describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe
it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before
the LORD in Shiloh. And the men went and passed through the land, and
described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to
Joshua to the host at Shiloh. And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh
before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of
Israel according to their divisions.

When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their
coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son
of Nun among them: according to the word of the LORD they gave him
the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he
built the city, and dwelt therein. So they made an end of dividing the
country. Then the children of Israel appointed six cities of refuge,
three on each side of Jordan, as the LORD commanded. And forty and
eight cities with their suburbs they set apart by lot, out of the
inheritance of other tribes, for the tribe of Levi.

And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto
their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. And the LORD
gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their
fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them;
the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand. There failed not
ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of
Israel; all came to pass.

Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
tribe of Manasseh, and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the
servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that
I commanded you: ye have not left your brethren these many days unto
this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your
God. And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your
tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant
of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan. But take diligent heed
to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD
charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways,
and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him
with all your heart and with all your soul. So Joshua blessed them, and
sent them away: and they went unto their tents.




CHAPTER 69

THE PEOPLE RENEW THE COVENANT


AND it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest
unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old
and stricken in age. And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their
elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their
officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age: and ye
have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations
because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.
Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to
be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations
that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. And the LORD
your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out
of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God
hath promised unto you. Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to
do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn
not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; that ye come not
among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention
of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve
them, nor bow yourselves unto them: but cleave unto the LORD your God,
as ye have done unto this day.

[Sidenote: Joshua 23]

And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know
in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath
failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning
you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed
thereof. Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD
bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off
this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. When ye have
transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you,
and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them;
then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall
perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

[Sidenote: Joshua 24]

And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called
for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges,
and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. And
Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even
Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served
other gods. And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied
his seed, and gave him Isaac. And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and
I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children
went down into Egypt. I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt,
according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you
out. And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea;
and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen
unto the Red sea. And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness
between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and
covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and
ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season. And I brought you into the
land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they
fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess
their land; and I destroyed them from before you. Then Balak the son
of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and
called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: but I would not hearken
unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of
his hand. And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and
the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites,
and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand. And I sent the
hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two
kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. And I
have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye
built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which
ye planted not do ye eat.

Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth:
and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of
the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. And if it seem evil
unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve;
whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side
of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell:
but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. And the people
answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to
serve other gods. And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the
LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
your transgressions nor your sins. If ye forsake the LORD, and serve
strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after
that he hath done you good. And the people said unto Joshua, Nay;
but we will serve the LORD. And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are
witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve
him. And they said, We are witnesses. Now therefore put away, said he,
the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the
LORD God of Israel. And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God
will we serve, and his voice will we obey. So Joshua made a covenant
with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in
Shechem.

And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took
a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the
sanctuary of the LORD. And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold,
this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words
of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
unto you, lest ye deny your God. So Joshua let the people depart, every
man unto his inheritance.

And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the
servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old. And they
buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is
in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash. And Israel
served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders
that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD,
that he had done for Israel.

And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out
of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob
bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces
of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that
pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

[Sidenote: Judges 2]

And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and
there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor
yet the works which he had done for Israel.




CHAPTER 70

THE ISRAELITES FORSAKE GOD


AND the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
served Baalim: and they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which
brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves
unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. And they forsook the LORD,
and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And the anger of the LORD was hot
against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that
spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round
about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for
evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and
they were greatly distressed. Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges,
which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

[Sidenote: Judges 3]

And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the
judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by
reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them. And it came to pass,
when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves
more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to
bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from
their stubborn way.

And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because
that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded
their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; I also will not
henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua
left when he died: that through them I may prove Israel, whether
they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers
did keep it, or not. Therefore the LORD left those nations, without
driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand
of Joshua. Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove
Israel; namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from
mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. And they were to
prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the
commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the
hand of Moses. And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their
daughters to their sons, and served their gods. And the children of
Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their
God, and served Baalim and the groves. Therefore the anger of the LORD
was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the king of
Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served him eight years. And
when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a
deliverer, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's
younger brother. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he
judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered the king
of Mesopotamia into his hand. And the land had rest forty years. And
Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and
the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because
they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. And he gathered unto
him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and
possessed the city of palm trees. So the children of Israel served
Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. But when the children of Israel
cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son
of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded. And after him was Shamgar,
which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he
also delivered Israel.




CHAPTER 71

DEBORAH AND BARAK DELIVER ISRAEL


AND the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD,
when Ehud was dead. And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king
of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera.
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred
chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children
of Israel.

And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at
that time. And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah
and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
her for judgment. And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out
of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel
commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of
Zebulun? And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I
will deliver him into thine hand. And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt
go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I
will not go. And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding
the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the
LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose,
and went with Barak to Kedesh.

[Sidenote: Judges 4]

And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with
ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. Now Heber
the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of
Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent
unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh. And they shewed Sisera
that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. And Sisera
gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron,
and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles
unto the river of Kishon. And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is
the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not
the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor,
and ten thousand men after him. And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and
all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before
Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on
his feet. But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host,
unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon
the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left. Howbeit Sisera
fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite:
for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of
Heber the Kenite.

And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord,
turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the
tent, she covered him with a mantle. And he said unto her, Give me, I
pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened
a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. Again he said
unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man
doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that
thou shalt say, No. Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and
took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast
asleep and weary. So he died. And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera,
Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew
thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples. So God subdued on
that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. And
the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against
Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

[Sidenote: Judges 6]

Then sang Deborah on that day, saying, Blessed above women shall Jael
the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in
the tent. He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
butter in a lordly dish. She put her hand to the nail, and her right
hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera,
she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his
temples. At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead. The mother of
Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is
his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, Have
they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or
two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of
needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the
necks of them that take the spoil? So let all thine enemies perish, O
LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in
his might.

And the land had rest forty years.




CHAPTER 72

GIDEON IS SENT TO DELIVER ISRAEL


AND the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the
LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. And the hand
of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the
children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and
caves, and strong holds. And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the
Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east,
even they came up against them; and they encamped against them, and
destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left
no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. For they came
up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers
for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number:
and they entered into the land to destroy it. And Israel was greatly
impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel
cried unto the LORD.

And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD
because of the Midianites, that the LORD sent a prophet unto the
children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of
Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
house of bondage; and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
before you, and gave you their land; and I said unto you, I am the LORD
your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell:
but ye have not obeyed my voice. And there came an angel of the LORD,
and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the
Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide
it from the Midianites. And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him,
and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.
And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why
then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our
fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?
but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of
the Midianites. And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy
might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have
not I sent thee? And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I
save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least
in my father's house. And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be
with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. And he said
unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign
that thou talkest with me. Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come
unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he
said, I will tarry until thou come again.

[Sidenote: Judges 6]

And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an
ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in
a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did
so. Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was
in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there
rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened
cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. And when
Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas,
O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.
And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt
not die. Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.

Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the
east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley
of Jezreel. But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him. And he sent messengers
throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent
messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they
came up to meet them. And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save
Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, behold, I will put a fleece of
wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry
upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel
by mine hand, as thou hast said. And it was so: for he rose up early
on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out
of the fleece, a bowl full of water. And Gideon said unto God, Let not
thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me
prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry
only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. And God
did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was
dew on all the ground.

[Sidenote: Judges 7]

Then Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and
pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites
were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too
many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel
vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. Now
therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever
is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount
Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and
there remained ten thousand. And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people
are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them
for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This
shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I
say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto
Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog
lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth
down upon his knees to drink. And the number of them that lapped,
putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the
rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. And the
LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I
save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the
other people go every man unto his place. So the people took victuals
in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel
every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the
host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.

And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise,
get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.
But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to
the host: and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with
Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the
host. And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and
their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for
multitude. And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told
a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo,
a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a
tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay
along. And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the
sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand
hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the
interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host
of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your
hand the host of Midian. And he divided the three hundred men into
three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty
pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. And he said unto them, Look
on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the
camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. When I blow with a
trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also
on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of
Gideon.

So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had
but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the
pitchers that were in their hands. And the three companies blew the
trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left
hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they
cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. And they stood every man
in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and
fled. And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every
man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the
host fled. And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after
the Midianites. And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and
Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the
winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb
and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

[Sidenote: Judges 8]

Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou,
and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from
the hand of Midian. And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over
you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in
the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.

And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had
delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:
neither shewed they kindness to the house of Gideon, according to all
the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.




CHAPTER 73

JEPHTHAH AND HIS DAUGHTER


[Sidenote: Judges 10]

AND the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD,
and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods
of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon,
and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not
him. And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them
into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children
of Ammon. Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of
Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed. And the children of Israel
cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because
we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim. And the LORD said
unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians,
and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the
Philistines? The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,
did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their
hand. Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will
deliver you no more. Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let
them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou
unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray
thee, this day. And they put away the strange gods from among them, and
served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in
Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and
encamped in Mizpeh. And the people and princes of Gilead said one to
another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children
of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour. And it was so,
that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders
of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may
fight with the children of Ammon. And Jephthah said unto the elders
of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of
Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head? And
the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between
us, if we do not so according to thy words. Then Jephthah went with the
elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them:
and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah.

And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without
fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, then it shall be,
that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when
I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the
LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.

So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against
them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. And he smote them
from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and
unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus
the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. And
Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came
out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only
child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. And it came to pass,
when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter!
thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble
me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back. And
she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the
LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth;
forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies,
even of the children of Ammon. And she said unto her father, Let this
thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and
down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows. And
he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her
companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. And it came
to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father,
who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. And it was a
custom in Israel, that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament
the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

[Sidenote: Judges 13]

And Jephthah judged Israel six years, and he died. And after him were
three other judges in Israel.




CHAPTER 74

SAMSON


AND the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and
the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
whose name was Manoah; and his wife had no children. And the angel of
the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold, thou shalt
bear a son. Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: for the child shall be a
Nazarite unto God from his birth: and he shall begin to deliver Israel
out of the hand of the Philistines.

And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child
grew, and the LORD blessed him. And the Spirit of the LORD began
to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the
daughters of the Philistines. And he came up, and told his father and
his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters
of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. Then his
father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the
daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to
take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his
father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. But his father and
his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion
against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion
over Israel.

[Sidenote: Judges 14]

Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and
came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared
against him. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and
he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. And
he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and
honey in the carcase of the lion. And he took thereof in his hands, and
went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them,
and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out
of the carcase of the lion. So his father went down unto the woman:
and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. And it
came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to
be with him. And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle
unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of
the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and
thirty change of garments: but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall
ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said
unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. And he said unto
them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came
forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's
wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest
we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to
take that we have? is it not so? And Samson's wife wept before him, and
said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a
riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and
shall I tell it thee? And she wept before him the seven days, while
their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he
told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to
the children of her people. And the men of the city said unto him on
the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?
and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not
plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon,
and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change
of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was
kindled, and he went up to his father's house. But Samson's wife was
given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.

But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest,
that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to
my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.

And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated
her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger
sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. And
Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the
Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. And Samson went and caught
three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail,
and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails. And when he had
set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the
Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn,
with the vineyards and olives. Then the Philistines said, Who hath
done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite,
because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. And Samson
said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you,
and after that I will cease. And he smote them hip and thigh with a
great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

[Sidenote: Judges 15]

Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
themselves in Lehi. And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up
against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to
him as he hath done to us. Then three thousand men of Judah went to
the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the
Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto
us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto
them. And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto
them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. And they
spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver
thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound
him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock. And when he
came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit
of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his
arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from
off his hands. And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his
hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. And Samson said,
With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass
have I slain a thousand men. And it came to pass, when he had made an
end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and
called that place Ramath-lehi. And he was sore athirst, and called on
the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the
hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into
the hand of the uncircumcised? But God clave an hollow place that was
in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his
spirit came again, and he revived. And he judged Israel in the days of
the Philistines twenty years.

[Sidenote: Judges 16]

Then went Samson to Gaza. And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson
is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all
night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying,
In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him. And Samson lay till
midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the
city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put
them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill
that is before Hebron. And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a
woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. And the lords of
the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and
see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail
against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee
every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. And Delilah said to
Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and
wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. And Samson said unto
her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried,
then shall I be weak, and be as another man. Then the lords of the
Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been
dried, and she bound him with them. Now there were men lying in wait,
abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines
be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is
broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told
me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never
were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. Delilah
therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him,
The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait
abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a
thread.

And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told
me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto
her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. And she
fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon
thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the
pin of the beam, and with the web. And she said unto him, How canst
thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast
mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great
strength lieth. And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with
her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; that
he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a
razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my
birth: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall
become weak, and be like any other man. And when Delilah saw that he
had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the
Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his
heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought
money in their hand. And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she
called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of
his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of
his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake
myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.

But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him
down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind
in the prison house. Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again
after he was shaven. Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them
together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to
rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into
our hand. And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for
they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. And it came to pass,
when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that
he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison
house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that
I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean
upon them. Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords
of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three
thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. And
Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray
thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I
may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. And Samson
took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and
on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the
other with his left. And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.
And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the
lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he
slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. Then
his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him,
and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the
buryingplace of Manoah his father.




CHAPTER 75

THE STORY OF RUTH


[Sidenote: Ruth 1]

NOW it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there
was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went
to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two
sons. And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife
Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued
there. And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
two sons. And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of
the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled
there about ten years. And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them;
and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.

[Sidenote: Ruth 2]

Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from
the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that
the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread. Wherefore she
went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law
with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her
mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with
the dead, and with me. The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each
of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they
lifted up their voice, and wept. And they said unto her, Surely we
will return with thee unto thy people. And Naomi said, Turn again, my
daughters: why will ye go with me? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth
me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.

And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her
mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. And she said, Behold, thy
sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return
thou after thy sister in law. And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave
thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest,
I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be
my people, and thy God my God: where thou diest, will I die, and there
will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but
death part thee and me. When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to
go with her, then she left speaking unto her. So they two went until
they came to Beth-lehem.

And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the
city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? And she said
unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt
very bitterly with me. I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me
home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath
testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? So Naomi
returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which
returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the
beginning of barley harvest.

And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of
the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. And Ruth the Moabitess
said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn
after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go,
my daughter. And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto
Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. And, behold, Boaz came from
Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they
answered him, The LORD bless thee. Then said Boaz unto his servant that
was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? And the servant that
was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel
that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: and she said, I
pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves:
so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that
she tarried a little in the house.

Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by
my maidens: let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go
thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not
touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink
of that which the young men have drawn. Then she fell on her face,
and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found
grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing
I am a stranger? And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully
been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since
the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy
mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which
thou knewest not heretofore. The LORD recompense thy work, and a full
reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou
art come to trust. Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my
lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine
handmaidens. And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and
eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.

[Sidenote: Ruth 2]

And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and
she did eat, and was sufficed, and left. And when she was risen up
to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even
among the sheaves, and reproach her not: and let fall also some of the
handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them,
and rebuke her not. So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat
out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw
what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she
had reserved after she was sufficed. And her mother in law said unto
her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed
be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law
with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
to day is Boaz. And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be
he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and
to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us,
one of our next kinsmen. And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me
also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all
my harvest. And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good,
my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not
in any other field. So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean
unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with
her mother in law.

[Sidenote: Ruth 3]

Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not
seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? And now is not Boaz
of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth
barley to night in the threshingfloor. Wash thyself therefore, and
anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the
floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have
done eating and drinking. And it shall be, when he lieth down, that
thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and
uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
shalt do. And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her
mother in law bade her. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his
heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn:
and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. And it
came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself:
and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. And he said, Who art thou? And
she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt
over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman. And he said, Blessed
be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness
in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst
not young men, whether poor or rich. And now, my daughter, fear not; I
will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people
doth know that thou art a virtuous woman. And now it is true that I am
thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. Tarry this
night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto
thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if
he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part
of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one
could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came
into the floor. Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee,
and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley,
and laid it on her: and she went into the city. And when she came to
her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told
her all that the man had done to her. And she said, These six measures
of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother
in law. Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how
the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have
finished the thing this day.

Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold,
the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a
one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. And
he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here.
And they sat down. And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come
again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was
our brother Elimelech's: and I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy
it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou
wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell
me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee: and
I am after thee. And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself,
lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I
cannot redeem it.

[Sidenote: Ruth 4]

And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and
all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. Moreover
Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife,
to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of
the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of
his place: ye are witnesses this day. And all the people that were in
the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses.

So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and she bare a son. And the
women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee
this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. And
he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine
old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to
thee than seven sons, hath born him. And Naomi took the child, and laid
it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. And the women her neighbours
gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called
his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.

BOOK VII--SAMUEL AND SAUL




CHAPTER 76

SAMUEL


NOW there was a certain man of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah:
and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name
of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no
children. And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there. And when the
time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all
her sons and her daughters, portions: but unto Hannah he gave a worthy
portion; for he loved Hannah. And her adversary also provoked her sore;
therefore she wept, and did not eat. Then said Elkanah her husband to
her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy
heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?

So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had
drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of
the LORD. And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou
wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me,
and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man
child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,
and there shall no razor come upon his head. And it came to pass, as
she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. Now
Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was
not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. And Eli said
unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful
spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured
out my soul before the LORD. Count not thine handmaid for a daughter
of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I
spoken hitherto. Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God
of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. And she
said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her
way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. And they rose up
in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and
came to their house to Ramah; and the LORD remembered her. Wherefore it
came to pass, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying,
Because I have asked him of the LORD. And the man Elkanah, and all his
house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his
vow. But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not
go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he
may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. And Elkanah her
husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have
weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and
gave her son suck until she weaned him.

[Illustration: THE INFANT SAMUEL AT PRAYER,

BY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS

IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY, LONDON]

And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three
bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought
him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young. And
they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. And she said, Oh my
lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee
here, praying unto the LORD. For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath
given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore also I have lent
him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And
he worshipped the LORD there. And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 2]

Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. But
Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen
ephod. Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the
yearly sacrifice.

And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife. And the LORD visited Hannah, so
that she bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew
on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. And the
child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the
LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.

And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place,
and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; and ere the lamp
of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was,
and Samuel was laid down to sleep; that the LORD called Samuel: and
he answered, Here am I. And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for
thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he
went and lay down. And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel
arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. Now Samuel did
not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed
unto him. And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
perceived that the LORD had called the child. Therefore Eli said unto
Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt
say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down
in his place. And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other
times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
heareth.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 4]

And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at
which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. In
that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken
concerning his house. For I have told him that I will judge his house
for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
themselves vile, and he restrained them not. And Samuel lay until the
morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel
feared to shew Eli the vision. Then Eli called Samuel, and said,
Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. And he said, What is the
thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from
me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of
all the things that he said unto thee. And Samuel told him every whit,
and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what
seemeth him good.

And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his
words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba
knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. And the
LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel
in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.




CHAPTER 77

THE PHILISTINES TAKE THE ARK


AND the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against
the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the
Philistines pitched in Aphek. And the Philistines fought, and Israel
was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a
very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
Phinehas, were slain. And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army,
and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth
upon his head. And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man
came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. And when Eli
heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this
tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. Now Eli was ninety
and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. And
the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to
day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? And the
messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and
there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two
sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he
fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck
brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged
Israel forty years.

And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer
unto Ashdod. When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it
into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. And when they of Ashdod
arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to
the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him
in his place again. And when they arose early on the morrow morning,
behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark
of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to
him. Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this
day. But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod. And when
the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God
of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and
upon Dagon our god. They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of
the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of
the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel
be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of
Israel about thither. And it was so, that, after they had carried it
about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great
destruction. Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came
to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out,
saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us,
to slay us and our people. So they sent and gathered together all the
lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of
Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city;
the hand of God was very heavy there.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 5]

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 7]

And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven
months. And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we
shall send it to his place. And they said, If ye send away the ark
of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him
a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known
to you why his hand is not removed from you. Now therefore make a new
cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and
tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: and
take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels
of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by
the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. And see, if it
goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done
us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his
hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us. And the men
did so. And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh,
and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside
to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went
after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh. And they of Beth-shemesh
were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up
their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. And the cart came
into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there
was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered
the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD. And the Levites took down
the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the
jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of
Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same
day unto the LORD. And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen
it, they returned to Ekron the same day. And the men of Kirjath-jearim
came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the
house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep
the ark of the LORD. And it came to pass, while the ark abode in
Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and
all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.




CHAPTER 78

THE ISRAELITES DESIRE A KING


AND Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. And he went from
year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged
Israel in all those places. And his return was to Ramah; for there was
his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto
the LORD.

And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges
over Israel. Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of
his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. And his sons walked
not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and
perverted judgment. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves
together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto him, Behold,
thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to
judge us like all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel, when
they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.
And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in
all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they
have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. According to all
the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up
out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and
served other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now therefore hearken
unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them
the manner of the king that shall reign over them. And Samuel told all
the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. And he
said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He
will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots,
and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he
will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to
be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. And
he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to
his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your menservants,
and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses,
and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye
shall be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your
king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in
that day.

Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they
said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; that we also may be like
all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us,
and fight our battles. And Samuel heard all the words of the people,
and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. And the LORD said to
Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said
unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.




CHAPTER 79

SAUL ANOINTED KING


[Sidenote: I. Samuel 9]

NOW there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, a Benjamite, a
mighty man of power. And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice
young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel
a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher
than any of the people. And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost.
And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee,
and arise, go seek the asses. And he passed through mount Ephraim, and
passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then
they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and
he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring
for the asses, and take thought for us. And he said unto him, Behold
now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable
man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither;
peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. And they went
up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel
came out against them, for to go up to the high place. Now the LORD
had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, To morrow
about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and
thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may
save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked
upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. And when Samuel saw
Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of!
this same shall reign over my people. Then Saul drew near to Samuel
in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house
is. And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me
unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I
will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. And
as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on
them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is
it not on thee, and on all thy father's house? And Saul answered and
said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel?
and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?
wherefore then speakest thou so to me? And Samuel took Saul and his
servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the
chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty
persons. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 10]

And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel
communed with Saul upon the top of the house. And they arose early:
and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called
Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away.
And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to
Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand
thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God. Then Samuel
took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and
said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over
his inheritance? When thou art departed from me to day, then thou
shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to
seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses,
and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? Then shalt
thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of
Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el,
one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread,
and another carrying a bottle of wine: and they will salute thee, and
give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of
the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither
to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down
from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a
harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: and the Spirit of the LORD
will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be
turned into another man. And it was so, that when he had turned his
back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs
came to pass that day.

And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh; and
said, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of
Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you: and ye
have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your
adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but
set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by
your tribes, and by your thousands. And when Samuel had caused all the
tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. When
he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families,
the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and
when they sought him, he could not be found. Therefore they enquired
of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD
answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff. And they ran and
fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher
than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. And Samuel said
to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is
none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and
said, God save the king. Then Samuel told the people the manner of the
kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And
Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 15]

And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before
the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace
offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel
rejoiced greatly.

So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon,
and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the
Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them. And he
gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of
the hands of them that spoiled them. And there was sore war against the
Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or
any valiant man, he took him unto him.




CHAPTER 80

SAUL REJECTED FOR DISOBEDIENCE


SAMUEL also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king
over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice
of the words of the LORD. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that
which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when
he came up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all
that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. And Saul gathered the people
together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen,
and ten thousand men of Judah. And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and
laid wait in the valley. And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah
until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. And he took Agag
the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people
with the edge of the sword. But Saul and the people spared Agag, and
the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the
lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 15]

Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, It repenteth
me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from
following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved
Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. And Samuel came to Saul:
and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed
the commandment of the LORD. And Samuel said, What meaneth then this
bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I
hear? And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for
the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice
unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. Then
Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath
said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. And Samuel said,
When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head
of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy
the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be
consumed. Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD,
but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings
and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey
is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For
rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity
and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath
also rejected thee from being king.

And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the
commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people,
and obeyed their voice. Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and
turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. And Samuel said unto
Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of
the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt
of his mantle, and it rent. And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath
rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to
a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. And also the Strength
of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should
repent. Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with
me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. So Samuel turned again after
Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.

Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely
the bitterness of death is past. And Samuel said, As thy sword hath
made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And
Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of
Saul. And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had
made Saul king over Israel.




CHAPTER 81

DAVID CHOSEN KING


AND the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn
with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for
I have provided me a king among his sons. And Samuel did that which
the LORD spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town
trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves,
and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his
sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 16]

And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and
said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him. But the LORD said unto
Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;
because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for
man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the
heart. Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. And Samuel said
unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth
yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said
unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come
hither. And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said,
Arise, anoint him: for this is he. Then Samuel took the horn of oil,
and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the
LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went
to Ramah.

But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from
the LORD troubled him. And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now,
an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. Let our lord now command thy
servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning
player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from
God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
well. And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
play well, and bring him to me. Then answered one of the servants, and
said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is
cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and
prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 17]

Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David
thy son, which is with the sheep. And Jesse took an ass laden with
bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son
unto Saul. And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved
him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. And Saul sent to Jesse,
saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found
favour in my sight. And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God
was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.




CHAPTER 82

DAVID CONQUERS GOLIATH


NOW the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle. And Saul
and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the
valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel
stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between
them. And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. And he
had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of
mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
between his shoulders. And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's
beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and
one bearing a shield went before him. And he stood and cried unto
the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set
your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul?
choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. If he be able
to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but
if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants,
and serve us. And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel
this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. When Saul and all
Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and
greatly afraid.

Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose
name was Jesse. And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed
Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and
the third Shammah. And David was the youngest: and the three eldest
followed Saul. But David went and returned from Saul to feed his
father's sheep at Beth-lehem. And the Philistine drew near morning and
evening, and presented himself forty days. And Jesse said unto David
his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn,
and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren; and carry
these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy
brethren fare, and take their pledge.

And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a
keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to
the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for
the battle. And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of
the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard
them. And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
and were sore afraid. And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this
man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall
be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house
free in Israel.

And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be
done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the
reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he
should defy the armies of the living God? And the people answered him
after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth
him. And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed
them before Saul: and he sent for him.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 17]

And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy
servant will go and fight with this Philistine. And Saul said to
David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with
him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and
there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: and I
went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth:
and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote
him, and slew him. Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and
this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living God. David said moreover, The LORD that
delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the
bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul
said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee. And Saul armed David
with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he
armed him with a coat of mail. And David girded his sword upon his
armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it.

And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not
proved them. And David put them off him. And he took his staff in his
hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them
in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was
in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. And the Philistine
came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield
went before him. And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David,
he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair
countenance. And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh
unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. Then said
David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a
spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD
of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. This
day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee,
and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host
of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild
beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in
Israel. And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD'S, and he will give you
into our hands.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 18]

And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh
to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the
Philistine. And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a
stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the
stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.

So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone,
and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the
hand of David. Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine,
and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew
him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw
their champion was dead, they fled. And the men of Israel and of Judah
arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the
valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines
fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. And
the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and
they spoiled their tents. And David took the head of the Philistine,
and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. And as
David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him,
and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.




CHAPTER 83

DAVID AND JONATHAN


AND it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul,
that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan
loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day, and would let
him go no more home to his father's house. Then Jonathan and David made
a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. And Jonathan stripped
himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his
garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. And
David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely:
and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight
of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. And it
came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter
of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel,
singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and
with instruments of musick. And the women answered one another as they
played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten
thousands. And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and
he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they
have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came
upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David
played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in
Saul's hand. And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was
departed from Saul. Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him
his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
people. And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
was with him. But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out
and came in before them.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 18]

And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the
thing pleased him. And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be
a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against
him. And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all
his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law. And
Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said,
Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that
I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed? And the servants of Saul told
him, saying, On this manner spake David. And Saul said, Thus shall ye
say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but to be avenged of
the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand
of the Philistines. And when his servants told David these words, it
pleased David well to be the king's son in law. Wherefore David arose
and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred
men. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. And Saul saw and
knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter
loved him. And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
David's enemy continually. And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and
to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan Saul's
son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my
father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed
to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide
thyself: and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I
see, that I will tell thee.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 19]

And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto
him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because
he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to
theeward very good: for he did put his life in his hand, and slew the
Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against
innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? And Saul hearkened unto
the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not
be slain. And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence,
as in times past.

And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the
Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from
him.

And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house
with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand. And
Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he
slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the
wall: and David fled, and escaped that night. Saul also sent messengers
unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and
Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to
night, to morrow thou shalt be slain. So Michal let David down through
a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped. And Michal took an
image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his
bolster, and covered it with a cloth. And when Saul sent messengers to
take David, she said, He is sick. And Saul sent the messengers again to
see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the
bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster. And Saul said unto
Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he
is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why
should I kill thee?

So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him
all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in
Naioth. And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin
before thy father, that he seeketh my life? And he said unto him, God
forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either
great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father
hide this thing from me? it is not so. And David sware moreover, and
said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine
eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:
but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a
step between me and death. Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever
thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee. And David said unto
Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail
to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself
in the field unto the third day at even. If thy father at all miss
me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to
Beth-lehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the
family. If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him. And
Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And
they went out both of them into the field. Then Jonathan said to David,
To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat
will be empty. And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt
go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. And
I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a
mark. And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.
If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side
of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and
no hurt; as the LORD liveth. But if I say thus unto the young man,
Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent
thee away.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 20 ]

So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come,
the king sat him down to eat meat. And the king sat upon his seat, as
at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and
Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty. Nevertheless
Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath
befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. And it came
to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that
David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore
cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go
to Beth-lehem: and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family
hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get
away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto
the king's table. Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and
he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion?
For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not
be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto
me, for he shall surely die. And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and
said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done? And
Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it
was determined of his father to slay David. So Jonathan arose from the
table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month:
for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 21]

And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the
field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot.
And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. And when the lad was
come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried
after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee? And Jonathan
cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad
gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. But the lad knew not
any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. And Jonathan gave
his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the
city.

And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the
south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three
times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until
David exceeded. And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as
we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he
arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.




CHAPTER 84

SAUL PURSUES DAVID


THEN came David to Nob, and asked Ahimelech the priest for bread. So
the priest gave him hallowed bread.

And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand
spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with
me, because the king's business required haste. And the priest said,
The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley
of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if
thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And
David said, There is none like that; give it me. And David arose, and
fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of
the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying,
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? And David
laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the
king of Gath. And he departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam:
and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went
down thither to him. And every one that was in distress, and every
one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered
themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were
with him about four hundred men. And David went thence to Mizpeh of
Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother,
I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do
for me. And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
with him all the while that David was in the hold. And the prophet Gad
said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the
land of Judah.

When Saul heard that David was discovered, and that Ahimelech had given
him the hallowed bread, and the sword of Goliath the Philistine, he
sent to call Ahimelech the priest. And the king said, Thou shalt surely
die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. And the king said
unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of
the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew
when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king
would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And
Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that
day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. And Nob,
the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men
and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep,
with the edge of the sword. And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son
of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. And Abiathar
shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests. And David said
unto Abiathar, Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my
life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 23]

And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a
mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but
God delivered him not into his hand. And David saw that Saul was come
out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and
strengthened his hand in God. And he said unto him, Fear not: for the
hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over
Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father
knoweth. And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode
in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

And David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men
compassed David and his men round about to take them. But there came a
messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines
have invaded the land. Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after
David, and went against the Philistines. And David went up from thence,
and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.

And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the
wilderness of En-gedi. Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of
all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the
wild goats. And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave;
and Saul went in to the cave: and David and his men remained in the
sides of the cave. And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day
of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy
into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto
thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because
he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid
that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to
stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the
LORD. So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them
not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went
on his way. David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and
cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind
him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 26]

And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying,
Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? Behold, this day thine eyes have seen
how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave:
and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I
will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S
anointed. Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in
my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee
not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression
in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my
soul to take it. The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and
thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these
words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And
Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. And he said to David, Thou art
more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have
rewarded thee evil. And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely
be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine
hand. Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of
my father's house. And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but
David and his men gat them up unto the hold.

And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and
lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.

And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.




CHAPTER 85

DAVID SPARES SAUL'S LIFE THE SECOND TIME


AND the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide
himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon? Then Saul
arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand
chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of
Ziph. And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw
that Saul came after him into the wilderness. David therefore sent out
spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.

And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and
David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the
captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched
round about him. Then David said, Who will go down with me to Saul to
the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. So David and
Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping
within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster:
but Abner and the people lay round about him. Then said Abishai to
David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now
therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the
earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time. And David said
to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against
the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless? David said furthermore, As the
LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or
he shall descend into battle, and perish. The LORD forbid that I should
stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray thee,
take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water,
and let us go. So David took the spear and the cruse of water from
Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew
it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep
from the LORD was fallen upon them.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 26]

Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an
hill afar off; a great space being between them: and David cried to
the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not,
Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the
king? And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is
like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord
the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy
lord. This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,
ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S
anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of
water that was at his bolster. And Saul knew David's voice, and said,
Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my
lord, O king. And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? Then said
Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee
harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I
have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. And David answered
and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come
over and fetch it. The LORD render to every man his righteousness and
his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but
I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed. And,
behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my
life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out
of all tribulation. Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son
David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail.
So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

[Sidenote: I. Samuel 28]

And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of
Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape
into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek
me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were
with him unto Achish, king of Gath. And it was told Saul that David was
fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.




CHAPTER 86

SAUL CONSULTS THE WITCH OF EN-DOR


NOW Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him
in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had
familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. And the Philistines
gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul
gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. And when Saul
saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly
trembled. And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him
not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar
spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said
to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.
And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and
two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said,
I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him
up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold,
thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have
familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then
layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? And Saul sware to
her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment
happen to thee for this thing. Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring
up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. And when the woman saw
Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul,
saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul. And the king said
unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto
Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. And he said unto her, What
form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered
with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped
with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.

And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?
And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war
against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more,
neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that
thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. Then said Samuel,
Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from
thee, and is become thine enemy? Moreover the LORD will also deliver
Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt
thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of
Israel into the hand of the Philistines. Then Saul fell straightway
all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of
Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all
the day, nor all the night.

And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and
said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have
put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou
spakest unto me. Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the
voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee;
and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together
with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So
he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. And the woman had a fat
calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and
kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: and she brought it
before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose
up, and went away that night.




CHAPTER 87

THE DEATH OF SAUL


[Sidenote: I. Samuel 31]

NOW the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled
from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and
the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's
sons. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto his
armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest
these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his
armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a
sword, and fell upon it. And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was
dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. So Saul died,
and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same
day together.

And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley,
and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel
fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities,
and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. And it came to
pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that
they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out
of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head:
and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and
did obeisance. And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he
said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. And David said
unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered,
The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are
fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. And David
said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and
Jonathan his son be dead? And the young man that told him said, As I
happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his
spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I
answered, Here am I. And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered
him, I am an Amalekite. He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee,
upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is
yet whole in me. So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure
that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have
brought them hither unto my lord. Then David took hold on his clothes,
and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him.

[Sidenote: II. SAMUEL 1]

And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan
his son:

The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty
fallen!

Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest
the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
uncircumcised triumph.

Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain,
upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty
is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been
anointed with oil.

From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of
Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their
death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were
stronger than lions.

Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet,
with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou
wast slain in thine high places.

I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou
been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

BOOK VIII--DAVID THE KING




CHAPTER 88

DAVID ANOINTED KING


AND it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD,
saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD
said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he
said, Unto Hebron. So David went up thither: and the men of Judah came,
and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. But Abner
the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of
Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; and made him king over all
Israel. But the house of Judah followed David. And the time that David
was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six
months.

And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of
Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. And Joab the son of Zeruiah,
and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool
of Gibeon. And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul
waxed weaker and weaker. And Abner was displeased with Ish-bosheth, and
revolted to David; and had communication with the elders of Israel,
saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: now
then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand
of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of
the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. And Abner
also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in
the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that
seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. So Abner came to David to
Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that
were with him a feast. And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go,
and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart
desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 5]

And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop,
and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David
in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. When
Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab,
saying, Abner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is
gone in peace. Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou
done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him
away, and he is quite gone? Thou knowest Abner, that he came to deceive
thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that
thou doest. And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David
knew it not. And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside
in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the
fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. And
afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless
before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner. And
David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your
clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king
David himself followed the bier. And they buried Abner in Hebron: and
the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all
the people wept.

Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,
saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. Also in time past, when
Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in
Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel,
and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. So all the elders of Israel
came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them
in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.
David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty
years. In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and
in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and
Judah.

And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Thou shalt not
come in hither. Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the
same is the city of David. And David went on, and grew great, and the
LORD God of hosts was with him.




CHAPTER 89

DAVID BRINGS THE ARK TO ZION


AGAIN, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty
thousand. And David arose, and went with all the people that were with
him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose
name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between
the cherubims. And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought
it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. And when they came to
Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God,
and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the LORD
was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and
there he died by the ark of God. And David was displeased, because the
LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place
Perez-uzzah to this day. And David was afraid of the LORD that day,
and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me? So David would not
remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David
carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. And the ark
of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three
months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his household.

And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house
of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark
of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of
Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. And David danced before
the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD
with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. And they brought
in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the
tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. And as soon as David had
made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed
the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. And he dealt among all the
people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women
as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a
flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 6]

And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,
and subdued them. And he smote Moab: and the Moabites became David's
servants, and brought gifts. He smote also the Syrians, and dedicated
unto the LORD the silver and gold of all the nations which he subdued.




CHAPTER 90

DAVID SENDS FOR MEPHIBOSHETH


[Sidenote: II. Samuel 11]

AND David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul,
that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake? And there was of the
house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called
him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy
servant is he. And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house
of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said
unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king,
Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir. Now
when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come
unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said,
Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! And David said unto
him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy
father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father;
and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. And he bowed himself,
and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a
dead dog as I am? Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and
said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained
to Saul and to all his house. Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy
servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the
fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth
thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Then said Ziba unto
the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his
servant, so shall thy servant do. So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem:
for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both
his feet.




CHAPTER 91

DAVID TAKES THE WIFE OF URIAH


AND it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings
go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him,
and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged
Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem. And it came to pass in
an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the
roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing
herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. And David sent
and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba,
the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? And David sent
messengers, and took her. And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah
the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David. And David wrote a letter to
Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. And he wrote in the letter,
saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire
ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. And it came to pass,
when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where
he knew that valiant men were. And the men of the city went out, and
fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of
David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. Then Joab sent and told David
all the things concerning the war. So the messenger went, and came and
shewed David all that Joab had sent him for. And the messenger said
unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us
into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the
gate. And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite
is dead also. Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say
unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth
one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city,
and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. And when the wife of Uriah
heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. And
when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house,
and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David
had done displeased the LORD.

And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said
unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other
poor. The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: but the poor
man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and
nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children;
it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his
bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. And there came a traveller unto
the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own
herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took
the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to
Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall
surely die: and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
thing, and because he had no pity.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 12]

And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Wherefore hast thou
despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou
hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife
to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of
Ammon. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house. And
David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said
unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the
enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee
shall surely die.

And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that
Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. David therefore
besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay
all night upon the earth. And the elders of his house arose, and went
to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did
he eat bread with them. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that
the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the
child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive,
we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will
he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? But when
David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child
was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead?
And they said, He is dead. Then David arose from the earth, and washed,
and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house
of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when
he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. Then said his
servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst
fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child
was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. And he said, While the child
was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD
will be gracious to me, that the child may live? But now he is dead,
wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him,
but he shall not return to me.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 13]

And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife: and she bare a son, and he
called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.




CHAPTER 92

THE REVOLT OF ABSALOM


NOW Absalom, the king's son, had slain his brother Amnon, and had fled
from his father's face. And Absalom went to Geshur, and was there
three years. And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto him.
And when Joab perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom, he
caused a woman of Tekoah, by a parable, to incline the king's heart
to fetch home Absalom. So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought
Absalom to Jerusalem. And the king said, Let him turn to his own house,
and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house. Now
in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his
beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there
was no blemish in him. And when he polled his head, (for it was at
every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred
shekels after the king's weight.

So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's
face. Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time,
he would not come. Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's
field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.
And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. Then Joab arose, and
came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy
servants set my field on fire? And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I
sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king,
to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to
have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if
there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me. So Joab came to the king,
and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king,
and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the
king kissed Absalom.

And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and
horses, and fifty men to run before him. And Absalom rose up early, and
stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that
had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called
unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is
of one of the tribes of Israel. And Absalom said unto him, See, thy
matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king
to hear thee. Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the
land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me,
and I would do him justice! And it was so, that when any man came nigh
to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and
kissed him. And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to
the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king,
I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the
LORD, in Hebron. For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in
Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
then I will serve the LORD. And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So
he arose, and went to Hebron. But Absalom sent spies throughout all the
tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. And with Absalom went
two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in
their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. And Absalom sent for
Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from
Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for
the people increased continually with Absalom.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 15]

And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of
Israel are after Absalom. And David said unto all his servants that
were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not
else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of
the sword. And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in
a place that was far off. And all the country wept with a loud voice,
and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the
brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
wilderness. And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him,
bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of
God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out
of the city. And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God
into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will
bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: but if he thus
say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as
seemeth good unto him. Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of
God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 16]

And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went
up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people
that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping
as they went up. And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the
conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn
the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. And it came to pass, that
when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God,
behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent and
earth upon his head: unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me,
then thou shalt be a burden unto me: but if thou return to the city,
and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been
thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then
mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. And hast thou not
there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be,
that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou
shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. Behold, they have
there with them their two sons; and by them ye shall send unto me every
thing that ye can hear. So Hushai David's friend came into the city,
and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of
the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of
Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. Then said Abishai
the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my
lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. And
the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let
him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall
then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? And David said to Abishai, and
to all his servants, Behold, my son seeketh my life: how much more
now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for
the LORD hath bidden him. It may be that the LORD will look on mine
affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this
day. And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the
hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones
at him, and cast dust.

And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
and Ahithophel with him. And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite,
David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom,
God save the king, God save the king. And Absalom said to Hushai, Is
this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people,
and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will
I abide. And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will
I be in thy presence.

Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall
do. And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,
was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the
counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand
men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night: and I will
come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him
afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will
smite the king only: and I will bring back all the people unto thee.
And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear
likewise what he saith. And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom
spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner:
shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou. And Hushai said unto
Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this
time. For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they
be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of
her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not
lodge with the people. Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some
other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown
at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter
among the people that follow Absalom. And he also that is valiant,
whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all
Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with
him are valiant men. Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally
gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by
the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we
will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and
of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as
one. Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring
ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be
not one small stone found there. And Absalom and all the men of Israel
said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of
Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 17]

Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and
thus and thus have I counselled. Now therefore send quickly, and tell
David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness,
but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the
people that are with him. Now the sons of Zadok and Abiathar stayed by
En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench
went and told them; and they went and told king David. Nevertheless
a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away
quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his
court; whither they went down.

And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and
spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. And when
Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where
is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone
over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find
them, they returned to Jerusalem. And it came to pass, after they were
departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king
David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water:
for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you. Then David arose, and
all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by
the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over
Jordan. And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city,
and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was
buried in the sepulchre of his father.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 18]

Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all
the men of Israel with him. And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host
instead of Joab. So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.




CHAPTER 93

THE DEATH OF ABSALOM


AND David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of
thousands and captains of hundreds over them. And David sent forth a
third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part
under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a
third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto
the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. But the people
answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not
care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now
thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou
succour us out of the city.

And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the
king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds
and by thousands. And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai,
saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge
concerning Absalom. So the people went out into the field against
Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; where the people of
Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a
great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men. For the battle was
there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured
more people that day than the sword devoured.

And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule,
and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head
caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the
earth; and the mule that was under him went away. And a certain man saw
it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest
him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would
have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle. And the man said
unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine
hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for
in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. Otherwise I should have
wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid
from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.
Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts
in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was
yet alive in the midst of the oak. And ten young men that bare Joab's
armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. And Joab blew
the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for
Joab held back the people. And they took Absalom, and cast him into a
great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him:
and all Israel fled every one to his tent.

Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king
tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies. And Joab
said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt
bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings,
because the king's son is dead. Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the
king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever,
let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore
wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? But
howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz
ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi. And Ahimaaz called, and
said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon
his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which
hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the
king. And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw
a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. And the king said unto him,
Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still. And,
behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the
LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi
answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against
thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is. And the king was much
moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he
went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God
I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 19]

And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for
Absalom. And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all
the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved
for his son. And the people gat them by stealth that day into the
city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. But
the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my
son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! And Joab came into the house
to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy
servants, which have saved thy life; in that thou lovest thine enemies,
and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou
regardest neither princes nor servants: for I perceive, that if Absalom
had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants:
for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one
with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the
evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 19]

Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the
people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the
people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.




CHAPTER 94

DAVID BROUGHT BACK TO JERUSALEM


AND all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel,
saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he
delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out
of the land for Absalom. And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is
dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the
king back?

And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak
unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king
back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king,
even to his house. Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh:
wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? And he bowed the
heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that
they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to
go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. And Shimei the
son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down
with the men of Judah to meet king David. And there were a thousand men
of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and
his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over
Jordan before the king. And there went over a ferry boat to carry over
the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the
son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; and
said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither
do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my
lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to
his heart. For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go
down to meet my lord the king. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered
and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed
the LORD'S anointed? And David said, What have I to do with you, ye
sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know
that I am this day king over Israel? Therefore the king said unto
Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.

And David had many mighty men. And Abishai the brother of Joab was the
chief among them. And when David fought against the Philistines three
of the mighty men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto
the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the
valley of Rephaim. And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of
the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. And David longed, and said, Oh
that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem,
which is by the gate! And the three mighty men brake through the host
of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that
was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he
would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.




CHAPTER 95

DAVID'S CHOICE


AND again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah. And Joab
and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king,
to number the people of Israel. So when they had gone through all the
land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and
there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the
sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 24]

And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And
David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done:
and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant;
for I have done very foolishly. For when David was up in the morning,
the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things;
choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. So Gad came to
David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine
come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before
thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days'
pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return
to him that sent me. And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait:
let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great:
and let me not fall into the hand of man.

So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to
the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to
Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. And when the angel stretched out his
hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil,
and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay
now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of
Araunah the Jebusite. And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the
angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have
done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I
pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.

[Sidenote: II. Samuel 24]

And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar
unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite. And David
went up as the LORD commanded. So the LORD was intreated for the land,
and the plague was stayed from Israel.

BOOK IX--SOLOMON THE KING




CHAPTER 96

SOLOMON ANOINTED KING


NOW king David was old and stricken in years. And Adonijah the son
of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared
him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. And his
father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou
done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him
after Absalom. And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him. But Zadok
the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet,
and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. And
Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth,
and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah
the king's servants: but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the
mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.

Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and
David our lord knoweth it not? Now therefore come, let me, I pray
thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the
life of thy son Solomon. Go and get thee in unto king David, and say
unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid,
saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? Behold, while thou
yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and
confirm thy words.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 1]

And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber, and spake as
Nathan had commanded her. And, lo, while she yet talked with the king,
Nathan the prophet also came in. And they told the king, saying, Behold
Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed
himself before the king with his face to the ground. And Nathan said,
My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and
he shall sit upon my throne? For he is gone down this day, and hath
slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called
all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the
priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save
king Adonijah. But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
called. Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the
king after him?

Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came
into the king's presence, and stood before the king. And the king
sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out
of all distress, even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel,
saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to
the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.

And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. The
king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and
cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to
Gihon: and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there
king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king
Solomon. Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon
my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him
to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the
LORD God of my lord the king say so too. As the LORD hath been with my
lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater
than the throne of my lord king David.

So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and the king's body-guard, went down, and caused Solomon to
ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. And Zadok the
priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.
And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king
Solomon. And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with
the sound of them.

And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they
had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the
trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an
uproar? And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art
a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. And Jonathan answered and
said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in
Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city
rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. And also Solomon
sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. And moreover the king's servants
came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon
better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne.
And the king bowed himself upon the bed. And also thus said the king,
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my
throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it. And all the guests that were
with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.

And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught
hold on the horns of the altar. And it was told Solomon, saying,
Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on
the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day
that he will not slay his servant with the sword. And Solomon said, If
he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall
to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he
came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go
to thine house.




CHAPTER 97

DEATH OF KING DAVID


[Sidenote: I. Kings 2]

NOW the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
Solomon his son, saying, I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong
therefore, and shew thyself a man; and keep the charge of the LORD thy
God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments,
and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the
law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and
whithersoever thou turnest thyself: that the LORD may continue his word
which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to
their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all
their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of
Israel.

So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven
years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
Jerusalem. Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and
his kingdom was established greatly. And Solomon made affinity with
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her
into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own
house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.




CHAPTER 98

SOLOMON'S JUDGMENT


[Sidenote: I. Kings 3]

AND Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his
father. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon
that altar. In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. And Solomon said, Thou hast
shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he
walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness
of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness,
that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this
day. And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead
of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go
out or come in. And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which
thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
for multitude. Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to
judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
able to judge this thy so great a people? And the speech pleased the
Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. And God said unto him, Because
thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life;
neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine
enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a
wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee
before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. And I
have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and
honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee
all thy days. And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and
my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy
days.

And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and
offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a
feast to all his servants.

Then came there two women unto the king, and stood before him. And the
one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I
was delivered of a child with her in the house. And it came to pass the
third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered
also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house,
save we two in the house. And this woman's child died in the night;
because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight, and took my son
from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom,
and laid her dead child in my bosom. And when I rose in the morning to
give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered
it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. And
the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is
thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is
my son. Thus they spake before the king. Then said the king, The one
saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the
other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before
the king. And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
half to the one, and half to the other. Then spake the woman whose the
living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son,
and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay
it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide
it. Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in
no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. And all Israel heard of the
judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they
saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.

[Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON, BY BONIFACIO VERONESE

IN THE ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS, VENICE]

And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of
the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents,
and served Solomon all the days of his life. And Judah and Israel dwelt
safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even
to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.

And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. And
Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east
country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men:
and his fame was in all nations round about. And he spake three
thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake
of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop
that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl,
and of creeping things, and of fishes. And there came of all people
to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had
heard of his wisdom.




CHAPTER 99

THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE


[Sidenote: I. Kings 5]

AND Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for
Hiram was ever a lover of David. And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto
the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on
every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. But
now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is
neither adversary nor evil occurrent. And, behold, I purpose to build
an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto
David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in
thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. Now therefore command
thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants
shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy
servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest
that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto
the Sidonians.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 6]

And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath
given unto David a wise son over this great people. And Hiram sent
to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest
to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar,
and concerning timber of fir. My servants shall bring them down from
Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the
place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my
desire, in giving food for my household. So Hiram gave Solomon cedar
trees and fir trees according to all his desire. And Solomon gave
Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and
twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was
thirty thousand men. And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month
by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
Adoniram was over the levy.

And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and
fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; beside the chief of
Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three
hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. And the
king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed
stones, to lay the foundation of the house. And Solomon's builders and
Hiram's builders did hew them: so they prepared timber and stones to
build the house.

And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth
year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the
second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. And the
house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it
was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any
tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. So he built
the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards
of cedar. And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and
open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. And the oracle
he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant
of the LORD. And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he
overlaid with gold.

And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten
cubits high. And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the
one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched
the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of
the house. And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. And he carved all
the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims
and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. And the floor of
the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. And he built the
inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid,
in the month Zif: and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which
is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years
in building it.

And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He was a widow's
son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a
worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and
cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and
wrought all his work. For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen
cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of
them about. And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple. And
he made a molten sea. It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward
the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward
the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above
upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. And it was an hand
breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup,
with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. And Hiram made
the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. In the plain of Jordan
did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.

And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding
many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. And Solomon made
all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar
of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was, and the
candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the
left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs
of gold, and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the
spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for
the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors
of the house, to wit, of the temple. So was ended all the work that
king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the
things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the
gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of
the LORD.




CHAPTER 100

THE DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE


[Sidenote: I. Kings 8]

THEN Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king
Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant
of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. And all the men
of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the
month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. And all the elders of Israel
came, and the priests took up the ark. And they brought up the ark of
the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy
vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the
Levites bring up. And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel,
that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing
sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. And
the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his
place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under
the wings of the cherubims. For the cherubims spread forth their two
wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and
the staves thereof above. There was nothing in the ark save the two
tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a
covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
Egypt. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, so that the priests
could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the
LORD had filled the house of the LORD.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 8]

Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick
darkness. I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled
place for thee to abide in for ever. And the king turned his face
about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the
congregation of Israel stood;) and he said, Blessed be the LORD God of
Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with
his hand fulfilled it, saying, Since the day that I brought forth my
people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of
Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose
David to be over my people Israel. And it was in the heart of David
my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart
to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine
heart. Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my
name. And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of
Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name
of the LORD God of Israel. And I have set there a place for the ark,
wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers,
when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.

And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
and he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven
above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy
servants that walk before thee with all their heart: who hast kept with
thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also
with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this
day. But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I
have builded? Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and
to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the
prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day: that thine eyes
may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of
which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken
unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place. And
hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people
Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven
thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.

If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in
this house: then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying
the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned
against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name,
and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: then hear thou
in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people
Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and
give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an
inheritance. If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be a caterpiller; if their enemy
besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever
sickness there be; what prayer and supplication soever be made by any
man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague
of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: then
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give
to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for
thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which
thou gavest unto our fathers.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 8]

Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,
but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; (for they shall
hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched
out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; hear thou in
heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger
calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to
fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this
house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.

If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou
shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which
thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:
then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and
maintain their cause. If they sin against thee, (for there is no man
that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to
the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the
enemy, far or near; yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land
whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication
unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We
have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
and so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul,
in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray
unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the
city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy
name: then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people
that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein
they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before
them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
for they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest
forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: that thine
eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the
supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that
they call for unto thee. For thou didst separate them from among all
the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by
the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
Egypt, O Lord GOD.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 8]

Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the
ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with
salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. O LORD God, turn
not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy
servant.

And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar
of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to
heaven. And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with
a loud voice, saying, Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto
his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not
failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand
of Moses his servant. The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our
fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: that he may incline our
hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the
LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the
cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times,
as the matter shall require: that all the people of the earth may know
that the LORD is God, and that there is none else. Let your heart
therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes,
and to keep his commandments, as at this day.

Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from
heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the
glory of the LORD filled the house. And the priests could not enter
into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled
the LORD'S house. And when all the children of Israel saw how the
fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and
worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy
endureth for ever.

Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen,
and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the
people dedicated the house of God.




CHAPTER 101

THE QUEEN OF SHEBA


AND when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. And
she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare
spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come
to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. And
Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from
the king, which he told her not. And when the queen of Sheba had seen
all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, and the meat of
his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his
ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by
which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit
in her. And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not the
words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half
was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I
heard. Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. Blessed be the LORD
thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel:
because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to
do judgment and justice. And she gave the king an hundred and twenty
talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones:
there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of
Sheba gave to king Solomon.

And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal
bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.




CHAPTER 102

SOLOMON'S RICHES--HE FORSAKES THE LORD


[Sidenote: I. Kings 10]

NOW the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
hundred threescore and six talents of gold, beside that he had of the
merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all
the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. And king
Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of
gold went to one target. And he made three hundred shields of beaten
gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them
in the house of the forest of Lebanon. Moreover the king made a great
throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. The throne had six
steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays
on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the
stays. And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. And
all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of
silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. For the
king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in
three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver,
ivory, and apes, and peacocks. So king Solomon exceeded all the kings
of the earth for riches and for wisdom.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 11]

And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God
had put in his heart. And they brought every man his present, vessels
of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices,
horses, and mules, a rate year by year. And Solomon gathered together
chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for
chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. And the king made silver to
be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore
trees that are in the vale, for abundance. And Solomon had horses
brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the
linen yarn at a price.

But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter
of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and
Hittites. For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives
turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect
with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. And
Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the
LORD, as did David his father.

And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from
the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, and had
commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other
gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded. Wherefore the LORD
said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not
kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will
surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's
sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. Howbeit I will not
rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David
my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.

And the LORD stirred up adversaries against Solomon. And Jeroboam
the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, even
he lifted up his hand against the king. And the man Jeroboam was a
mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was
industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of
Joseph. And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in
the field: and Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent
it in twelve pieces: and he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for
thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee. Howbeit
I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him
prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I
chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: but I will take
the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten
tribes. And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have
chosen me to put my name there. And I will take thee, and thou shalt
reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over
Israel. And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to
keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I
will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David,
and will give Israel unto thee. And I will for this afflict the seed of
David, but not for ever.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 11]

Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled
into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the
death of Solomon.

And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was
forty years. And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

BOOK X--THE DIVIDED KINGDOM




CHAPTER 103

REHOBOAM--THE REVOLT OF THE TEN TRIBES


AND Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to
make him king. And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of
king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) that they sent and called
him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake
unto Rehoboam, saying, Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore
make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which
he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. And he said unto
them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people
departed.

And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon
his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may
answer this people? And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be
a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for
ever. But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and
which stood before him: and he said unto them, What counsel give ye
that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the
yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? And the young men that
were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak
unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our
yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto
them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. And now
whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your
yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you
with scorpions.

So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the
king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. And the
king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel
that they gave him; and spake to them after the counsel of the young
men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your
yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you
with scorpions. Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for
the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which
the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the
people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?
neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O
Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto
their tents.

But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah,
Rehoboam reigned over them. Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was
over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto
this day. And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and
made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house
of David, but the tribe of Judah only.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 12]

And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of
Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand
chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel,
to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. But the word
of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, Speak unto Rehoboam,
the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and
Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, Thus saith the
LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children
of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.
They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to
depart, according to the word of the LORD.

Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and
went out from thence, and built Penuel. And Jeroboam said in his heart,
Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: if this people go
up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall
the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam
king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of
Judah. Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:
behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt. And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. And
this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one,
even unto Dan. And he made an house of high places, and made priests of
the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 14]

At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. And Jeroboam said
to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be
not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold,
there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over
this people. And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse
of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the
child. And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes
were set by reason of his age.

And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to
ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt
thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall
feign herself to be another woman. And it was so, when Ahijah heard the
sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in,
thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I
am sent to thee with heavy tidings. Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the
LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people,
and made thee prince over my people Israel, and rent the kingdom away
from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been
as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me
with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; but
hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and
made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and
hast cast me behind thy back: therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon
the house of Jeroboam. Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall
the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the
air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it. Arise thou therefore, get thee
to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child
shall die. And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he
only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found
some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut
off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. For the LORD
shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall
root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers,
and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their
groves, provoking the LORD to anger. And he shall give Israel up
because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to
sin.

And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when
she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; and they buried
him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD,
which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. And the
days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept
with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.




CHAPTER 104

THREE KINGS OF JUDAH


AND Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty
and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen
years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the
tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And Judah did evil in the
sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins
which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.

And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: and he took away the treasures
of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he
even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which
Solomon had made. And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all
their days. And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with
his fathers in the city of David. And Abijam his son reigned in his
stead.

Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned
Abijam over Judah. Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And he walked
in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his
heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his
father. Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him
a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish
Jerusalem: because David did that which was right in the eyes of the
LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all
the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of
David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 14]

And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over
Judah. And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And Asa did
that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: for he
took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and
brake down the images, and cut down the groves: and commanded Judah
to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the
commandment. Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high
places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. And he
built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war
in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 15]

In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel
came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might
let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. Then Asa brought out
silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of
the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at
Damascus, saying, There is a league between me and thee, as there was
between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and
gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may
depart from me. And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the
captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote
Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building
of Ramah, and let his work cease. Then Asa the king took all Judah;
and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof,
wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the
city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.




CHAPTER 105

THE WICKED KINGS OF ISRAEL


AND Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second
year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. And he
did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father,
and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. And Baasha the son
of Ahijah conspired against him, and smote him, and reigned in his
stead. And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until
he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he
spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite. In the third year of Asa
king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel
in Tirzah, twenty and four years. And he did evil in the sight of
the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith
he made Israel to sin. Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son
of Hanani against Baasha, saying, Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of
the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast
walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin,
to provoke me to anger with their sins; behold, I will take away the
posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy
house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. So Baasha slept with
his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his
stead. And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house
of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah. And Zimri went in and smote
him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of
Judah, and reigned in his stead. And it came to pass, when he began to
reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of
Baasha.

And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the
Philistines. And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made
Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they
besieged Tirzah. And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was
taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt
the king's house over him with fire, and died. Then were the people of
Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the
son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. But the people
that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the
son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. But Omri wrought evil
in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.
So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his
son reigned in his stead.

And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the
son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab reigned over Israel in
Samaria twenty and two years. And Ahab did evil in the sight of the
LORD above all that were before him. And it came to pass, as if it had
been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of
the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. And he
reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in
Samaria. And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD
God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before
him.




CHAPTER 106

ELIJAH


AND Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said
unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,
there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Get thee hence, and
turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is
before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook;
and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. So he went and did
according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook
Cherith, that is before Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and
flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank
of the brook. And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried
up, because there had been no rain in the land.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 17]

And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to
Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have
commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. So he arose and went
to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the
widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and
said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may
drink. And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. And she said,
As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal
in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering
two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we
may eat it, and die. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as
thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it
unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the
LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall
the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon
the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the barrel of meal
wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word
of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. And it came to pass after these
things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell
sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in
him. And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man
of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to
slay my son? And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out
of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid
him upon his own bed. And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my
God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
slaying her son? And he stretched himself upon the child three times,
and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let
this child's soul come into him again. And the LORD heard the voice of
Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into
the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy
son liveth. And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou
art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 18]




CHAPTER 107

ELIJAH AND THE PROPHETS OF BAAL


AND it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came
to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and
I will send rain upon the earth. And Elijah went to shew himself unto
Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria. And Ahab called Obadiah,
which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD
greatly: for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a
cave, and fed them with bread and water.) And Ahab said unto Obadiah,
Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks:
peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive,
that we lose not all the beasts. So they divided the land between them
to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went
another way by himself.

And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him,
and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah? And he
answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. And he
said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into
the hand of Ahab, to slay me? As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no
nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and
when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and
nation, that they found thee not. And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy
lord, Behold, Elijah is here. And it shall come to pass, as soon as I
am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither
I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee,
he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. Was it
not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD,
how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and
fed them with bread and water? And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord,
Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me. And Elijah said, As the
LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself
unto him to day. So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab
went to meet Elijah.

And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art
thou he that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have not troubled
Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the
commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim. Now therefore
send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets
of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four
hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. So Ahab sent unto all the
children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount
Carmel. And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then
follow him. And the people answered him not a word. Then said Elijah
unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but
Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. Let them therefore give
us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and
cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will
dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and
call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the
LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the
people answered and said, It is well spoken. And Elijah said unto the
prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it
first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no
fire under. And they took the bullock which was given them, and they
dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until
noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that
answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. And it came to
pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is
a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey,
or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And they cried aloud,
and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till
the blood gushed out upon them. And it came to pass, when midday was
past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any
that regarded.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 19]

And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the
people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that
was broken down. And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number
of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD
came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: and with the stones he built an
altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar,
as great as would contain two measures of seed. And he put the wood in
order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and
said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice,
and on the wood. And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it
the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the
third time. And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
trench also with water.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 19]

And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of
Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art
God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all
these things at thy word. Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people
may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their
heart back again. Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the
burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked
up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it,
they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the
LORD, he is the God. And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of
Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah
brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a
sound of abundance of rain. So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And
Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the
earth, and put his face between his knees, and said to his servant,
Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said,
There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. And it came to
pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little
cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto
Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee
not. And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black
with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and
went to Jezreel. And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded
up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.




CHAPTER 108

THE STILL SMALL VOICE


AND Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had
slain all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger
unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make
not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.

And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to
Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. But
he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat
down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might
die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am
not better than my fathers. And as he lay and slept under a juniper
tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and
eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,
and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid
him down again. And the angel of the LORD came again the second time,
and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too
great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the
strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
of God.

And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the
word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou
here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown
down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I
only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. And he said, Go
forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD
passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in
pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and
after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:
and after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and
after the fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard
it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in
the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him,
and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very
jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have
forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets
with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life,
to take it away. And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to
the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be
king over Syria: and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be
king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt
thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. And it shall come to pass, that
him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that
escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. Yet I have left me
seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal,
and every mouth which hath not kissed him.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 19]

So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was
plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth:
and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. And he left
the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my
father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto
him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? And he returned back
from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their
flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and
they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto
him.




CHAPTER 109

SIEGE OF SAMARIA

[Sidenote: I. Kings 20]

AND Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and
there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots:
and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it. And he
sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto
him, Thus saith Ben-hadad, thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives
also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine. And the king of
Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying,
I am thine, and all that I have. And the messengers came again, and
said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee,
saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives,
and thy children; yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow
about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of
thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine
eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away. Then the king
of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray
you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my
wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and
I denied him not. And all the elders and all the people said unto
him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent. Wherefore he said unto the
messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst
send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may
not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again. And
Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more
also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the
people that follow me. And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell
him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that
putteth it off. And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message,
as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said
unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in
array against the city.

And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold,
I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I
am the LORD. And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD,
Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said,
Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou. Then he numbered the
young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred
and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all
the children of Israel, being seven thousand. So these young men of
the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which
followed them. And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled;
and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an
horse with the horsemen. And the king of Israel went out, and smote the
horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go,
strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the
return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee. And
it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered
the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. And the
children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went
against them. And they pitched one over against the other seven days.
And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the
children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in
one day.

And Ben-hadad's servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray
thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out
to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. So they
girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came
to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray
thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? Go ye, bring him. Then
Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the
chariot. And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee
in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send
thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent
him away.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 21]

And the LORD sent a prophet unto the king of Israel. And he said unto
him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a
man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go
for his life, and thy people for his people. And the king of Israel
went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.




CHAPTER 110

NABOTH'S VINEYARD


AND it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had
a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of
Samaria. And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house:
and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem
good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. And Naboth
said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance
of my fathers unto thee. And Ahab came into his house heavy and
displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken
to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my
fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
and would eat no bread.

But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? And he said unto her,
Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give
me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give
thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee
my vineyard. And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern
the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be
merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. So she
wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent
the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city,
dwelling with Naboth, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high
among the people: and set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear
witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And
then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 21]

And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the
inhabitants in his city, did as it was written in the letters which
she had sent unto them. They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high
among the people.

And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him:
and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in
the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the
king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him
with stones, that he died. Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth
is stoned, and is dead. And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that
Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise,
take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he
refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take
possession of it.

And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Arise,
go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he
is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou
killed, and also taken possession? Thus saith the LORD, In the place
where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even
thine. And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work
evil in the sight of the LORD. Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and
will take away thy posterity, and will make thine house like the house
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger,
and made Israel to sin. And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The
dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. Him that dieth of Ahab
in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall
the fowls of the air eat.

And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in
sackcloth, and went softly. And the word of the LORD came to Elijah
the Tishbite, saying, Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?
because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.




CHAPTER 111

JEHOSHAPHAT, KING OF JUDAH


AND they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of
Judah came down to the king of Israel. And the king of Israel said unto
his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is our's, and we be still,
and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? And he said unto
Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as
thy people, my horses as thy horses.

And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee,
at the word of the LORD to day. Then the king of Israel gathered
the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them,
Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And
they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the
king. And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
besides, that we might enquire of him? And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom
we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy
good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king
say so. Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
hither Micaiah the son of Imlah. So he came to the king. And the king
said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or
shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD
shall deliver it into the hand of the king. And the king said unto him,
How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that
which is true in the name of the LORD? And he said, I saw all Israel
scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the
LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house
in peace. And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? And the
king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the
governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; and say, Thus saith
the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of
affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. And
Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken
by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 22]

So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
Ramoth-gilead. And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will
disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.
And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. But
the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule
over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save
only with the king of Israel. And it came to pass, when the captains
of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king
of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat
cried out. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots
perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back
from pursuing him. And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote
the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he
said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out
of the host; for I am wounded. And the battle increased that day: and
the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at
even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down
of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own
country. So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
the king in Samaria. And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria;
and the dogs licked up his blood; according unto the word of the LORD
which he spake. So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son
reigned in his stead.

[Sidenote: I. Kings 22]

Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year
of Ahab king of Israel. Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.
And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside
from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD. And
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.




CHAPTER 112

AHAZIAH, KING OF ISRAEL


AHAZIAH the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years
over Israel. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in
the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: for he served
Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel,
according to all that his father had done.

Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was
in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them,
Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of
this disease. But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite,
Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say
unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go
to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Now therefore thus saith the
LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up,
but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed. So he died according to the
word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his
stead.




CHAPTER 113

ELIJAH TAKEN UP TO HEAVEN


AND it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by
a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. And fifty men of
the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two
stood by Jordan. And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together,
and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
they two went over on dry ground.

And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto
Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.
And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be
upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if
thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but
if not, it shall not be so. And it came to pass, as they still went
on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and
horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
whirlwind into heaven.

And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of
Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took
hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took up also
the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood
by the bank of Jordan; and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell
from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of
Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
thither: and Elisha went over. And when the sons of the prophets which
were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth
rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
ground before him. And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with
thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy
master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and
cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall
not send. And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found
him not. And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

[Sidenote: II. Kings 2]

And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the
situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is
naught, and the ground barren. And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and
put salt therein. And they brought it to him. And he went forth unto
the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus
saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from
thence any more death or barren land. So the waters were healed unto
this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.

And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by
the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked
him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name
of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and
tare forty and two children of them. And he went from thence to mount
Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.




CHAPTER 114

WAR WITH THE MOABITES


[Sidenote: II. Kings 3]

NOW Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father,
and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father
had made. Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of
Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with
the wool. But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of
Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all
Israel. And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against
Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people
as thy people, and my horses as thy horses. And he said, Which way
shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of
Edom. So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king
of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there
was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. And
the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three
kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab! But Jehoshaphat
said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of
the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and
said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the
hands of Elijah. And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with
him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went
down to him. And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do
with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets
of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD
hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand
of Moab. And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. But now
bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played,
that the hand of the LORD came upon him. And he said, Thus saith the
LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. For thus saith the LORD, Ye
shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall
be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and
your beasts. And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he
will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. And ye shall smite every
fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and
stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered,
that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was
filled with water.

And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight
against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and
upward, and stood in the border. And they rose up early in the morning,
and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the
other side as red as blood: and they said, This is blood: the kings are
surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab,
to the spoil. And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites
rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they
went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country. And they
beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man
his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and
felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones
thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.

And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him,
he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through
even unto the king of Edom: but they could not. Then he took his eldest
son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt
offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel:
and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.




CHAPTER 115

THE WIDOW'S OIL--THE SHUNAMMITE


[Sidenote: II. Kings 4]

NOW there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and
thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is
come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. And Elisha said unto
her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house?
And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a
pot of oil. Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. And when thou art
come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and
shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that
which is full. So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and
upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto
her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a
vessel more. And the oil stayed. Then she came and told the man of God.
And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy
children of the rest.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 4]

And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great
woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft
as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. And she said unto
her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God,
which passeth by us continually. Let us make a little chamber, I pray
thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table,
and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to
us, that he shall turn in thither. And it fell on a day, that he came
thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there. And he said to
Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her,
she stood before him. And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold,
thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done
for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of
the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. And he said,
What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath
no child, and her husband is old. And he said, Call her. And when he
had called her, she stood in the door. And he said, About this season,
according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said,
Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. And the
woman bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her.

And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his
father to the reapers. And he said unto his father, My head, my head.
And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. And when he had taken
him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon,
and then died. And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of
God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. And she called unto her
husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and
one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new
moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well. Then she saddled
an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy
riding for me, except I bid thee. So she went and came unto the man of
God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her
afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that
Shunammite: run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child?
And she answered, It is well.

And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the
feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said,
Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid
it from me, and hath not told me. Then she said, Did I desire a son of
my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?

Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine
hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any
salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of
the child. And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and
as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed
her. And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face
of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he
went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,
and laid upon his bed. He went in therefore, and shut the door upon
them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. And he went up, and lay upon the
child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes,
and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child;
and the flesh of the child waxed warm. Then he returned, and walked in
the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and
the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. And he
called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And
when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. Then she went
in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up
her son, and went out.




CHAPTER 116

NAAMAN HEALED--THE IRON SWIMS


NOW Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man
with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given
deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was
a leper. And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited
on Naaman's wife. And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord
were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of
his leprosy. And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus
said the maid that is of the land of Israel. And the king of Syria
said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And
he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand
pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. And he brought the letter
to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee,
behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou
mayest recover him of his leprosy. And it came to pass, when the king
of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am
I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to
recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see
how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 5]

And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king
of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,
Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he
shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. So Naaman came with
his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house
of Elisha. And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash
in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and
thou shalt be clean. But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said,
Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call
on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place,
and recover the leper. Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus,
better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be
clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. And his servants came
near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid
thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much
rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? Then went he
down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying
of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a
little child, and he was clean.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 6]

And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came,
and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no
God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take
a blessing of thy servant. But he said, As the LORD liveth, before
whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but
he refused. And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be
given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will
henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods,
but unto the LORD. In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that
when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD
pardon thy servant in this thing. And he said unto him, Go in peace.
So he departed from him a little way.

But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my
master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands
that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him,
and take somewhat of him. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when
Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to
meet him, and said, Is all well? And he said, All is well. My master
hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount
Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray
thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. And Naaman said,
Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents
of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon
two of his servants; and they bare them before him. And when he came
to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the
house: and he let the men go, and they departed. But he went in, and
stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou,
Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And he said unto
him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his
chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive
garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and
menservants, and maidservants? The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall
cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his
presence a leper as white as snow.

And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place
where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. Let us go, we pray thee,
unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a
place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. And one said,
Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I
will go. So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
down wood. But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the
water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed. And
the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And
he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and
took it.




CHAPTER 117

BEN-HADAD, KING OF SYRIA, MAKES WAR ON ISRAEL


THEN the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with
his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp. And
the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou
pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down. And the
king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and
warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice. Therefore
the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he
called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of
us is for the king of Israel? And one of his servants said, None, my
lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the
king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 6]

And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And
it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. Therefore sent he
thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night,
and compassed the city about. And when the servant of the man of God
was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city
both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas,
my master! how shall we do? And he answered, Fear not: for they that
be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed,
and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the
LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the
mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said,
Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with
blindness according to the word of Elisha.

And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the
city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he
led them to Samaria. And it came to pass, when they were come into
Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they
may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold,
they were in the midst of Samaria. And the king of Israel said unto
Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite
them? And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite
those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set
bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to
their master. And he prepared great provision for them: and when they
had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 7]

And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered
all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. And there was a great
famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head
was sold for fourscore pieces of silver.

Then said the king, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. But Elisha sat
in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from
before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders,
See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?
look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at
the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him? And while
he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and
he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the
LORD any longer?

Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD,
To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for
a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of
Samaria. Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of
God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might
this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
but shalt not eat thereof.

And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and
they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? If we say, We
will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall
die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come,
and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive,
we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die. And they rose
up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they
were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was
no man there. For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a
noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great
host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired
against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians,
to come upon us. Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and
left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as
it was, and fled for their life. And when these lepers came to the
uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and
drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and
hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried
thence also, and went and hid it. Then they said one to another, We do
not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace:
if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us:
now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household. So
they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them,
saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no
man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and
the tents as they were. And he called the porters; and they told it to
the king's house within.

And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will
now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be
hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in
the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them
alive, and get into the city. And one of his servants answered and
said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which
are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude
of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see. They
took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host
of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. And they went after them unto
Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which
the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned,
and told the king. And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of
the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two
measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. And
the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge
of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as
the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 8]

And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick;
and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. And the
king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the
man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of
this disease? So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him,
even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came
and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath
sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? And Elisha
said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit
the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die. And he settled his
countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God
wept. And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because
I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their
strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay
with the sword, and wilt dash their children. And Hazael said, But
what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And
Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over
Syria. So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to
him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou
shouldest surely recover. And it came to pass on the morrow, that he
took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face,
so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.




CHAPTER 118

JEHU EXECUTES JUDGMENT ON THE HOUSE OF AHAB


[Sidenote: II. Kings 8]


IN the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoram the
son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. Now when Jehoram was
risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and
slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes
of Israel. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as
did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he
wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. Howbeit the LORD
would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he
had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to
his sons for ever. And there came a writing to him from Elijah the
prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because
thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the
ways of Asa king of Judah, but hast walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which
were better than thyself: behold, with a great plague will the LORD
smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods.
And after all this the LORD smote him with an incurable disease: so he
died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like
the burning of his fathers. Thirty and two years old was he when he
began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed
without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David,
but not in the sepulchres of the kings. And Ahaziah his son reigned in
his stead. Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And he walked in the way of the
house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house
of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab. And he went
with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in
Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. And king Joram went back
to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him
at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the
son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in
Jezreel, because he was sick.

And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and
said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine
hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead: and when thou comest thither, look out
there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and
make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner
chamber; then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open
the door, and flee, and tarry not.

So the young man went to Ramoth-gilead. And when he came, behold, the
captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to
thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To
thee, O captain. And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured
the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even
over Israel. And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I
may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all
the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. And the dogs shall
eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury
her. And he opened the door, and fled.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 9]

Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto
him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said
unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication. And they said, It is
false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then they
hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top
of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king. And Jehu
said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the
city to go to tell it in Jezreel. So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went
to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come
down to see Joram. And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel,
and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company.
And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him
say, Is it peace? So there went one on horseback to meet him, and
said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou
to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying,
The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. Then he sent out a
second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king,
Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn
thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them,
and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the
son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. And Joram said, Make ready.
And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah
king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against
Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. And it came
to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he
answered, What peace, so long as the sins of thy mother Jezebel and her
witchcrafts are so many? And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said
to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah. And Jehu drew a bow with his
full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went
out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. Then said Jehu to
Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field
of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode
together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;
surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his
sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith
the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground,
according to the word of the LORD.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 11]

But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of
the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him
also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is
by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. And his servants
carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre
with his fathers in the city of David.

And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted
her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window. And as Jehu
entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?
who? And there looked out to him two or three officers. And he said,
Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was
sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.
And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now
this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter. And they
went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the
feet, and the palms of her hands. Wherefore they came again, and told
him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his
servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall
dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as
dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that
they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all
his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him
none remaining. And they brought forth the images out of the house of
Baal, and burned them. And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake
down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day. Thus
Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the
law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not
from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin. In those days the
LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts
of Israel.

And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And
Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. And the time that Jehu reigned
over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.




CHAPTER 119

JOASH, KING OF JUDAH


WHEN Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she
arose and destroyed all the seed royal. But Jehosheba, the daughter
of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and
stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid
him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that
he was not slain. And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six
years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.

And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him
into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took
an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's
son. And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And to the captains over hundreds
did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the
temple of the LORD. And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in
his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to
the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple. And
he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave
him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they
clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.

And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people,
she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. And when she
looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the
princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land
rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and
cried, Treason, Treason. But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains
of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her
forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the
sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of
the LORD. And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by which
the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 12]

And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the
people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also
and the people. And all the people of the land went into the house of
Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces
thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And
the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. And he took
the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the
people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of
the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's
house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. And all the people of the
land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet. Seven years old was Joash
when he began to reign. In the seventh year of Jehu Joash began to
reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem, and did that which was
right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest
instructed him. But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he
died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. And they
buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done
good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house. Now after the
death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the
king. Then the king hearkened unto them. And they left the house of
the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath
came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass. And the Spirit
of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood
above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress
ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye
have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you. And they conspired
against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king
in the court of the house of the LORD. Thus Joash the king remembered
not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew
his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require
it.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 13]

And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came
up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed
all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the
spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. For the army of the Syrians
came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great
host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their
fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. And when they were
departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own
servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada
the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him
in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the
kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.




CHAPTER 120

DEATH OF ELISHA


IN the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of
Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
and reigned seventeen years. And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against
Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria,
and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days. And
Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw
the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under
the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their
tents, as beforetime. Nevertheless they departed not from the sins
of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein:
and there remained the grove also in Samaria.) Neither did he leave
of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and
ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and
had made them like the dust by threshing. And Jehoahaz slept with his
fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in
his stead.

Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash
the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and
said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
thereof. And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
unto him bow and arrows. And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine
hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his
hands upon the king's hands. And he said, Open the window eastward.
And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said,
The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance
from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have
consumed them. And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And
he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote
thrice, and stayed. And the man of God was wroth with him, and said,
Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten
Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria
but thrice.

And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites
invaded the land at the coming in of the year. And it came to pass, as
they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and
they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was
let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on
his feet.




CHAPTER 121

JOASH AND AMAZIAH


[Sidenote: II. Kings 14]

IN the second year of Joash king of Israel reigned Amaziah king of
Judah. And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD. And
it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand,
that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father. But the
children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is
written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded,
saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the
children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put
to death for his own sin. Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and
sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel,
saying, Come, let us see one another in the face. And Joash king of
Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was
in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy
daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was
in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. So Joash the king of Israel
went up; and Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
every man to his tent. And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king
of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and
brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. And Joash
slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of
Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. And Amaziah the son
of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz
king of Israel fifteen years. Now they made a conspiracy against him in
Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish,
and slew him there. And they brought him on horses: and he was buried
at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. And all the people
of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king
instead of his father Amaziah. And Azariah, who was also called Uzziah,
reigned over Judah fifty and two years, and he did that which was right
in the sight of the LORD. But the kings of Israel were evil kings:
Jeroboam and Zachariah his son, and Shallum and Menahem and Pekahiah.
In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of
Remaliah conspired against Pekahiah, and killed him, and reigned in his
stead. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. In the
days of Pekah came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took all the
land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. And Hoshea the
son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and
smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 15]

In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began
Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. Five and twenty years
old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in
Jerusalem. He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an
hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten
thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him,
both the second year, and the third. So Jotham became mighty, because
he prepared his ways before the LORD his God. And Jotham slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son
reigned in his stead.

Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in
the sight of the LORD, like David his father: for he walked in the
ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of
Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them
captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into
the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two
hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much
spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. For the LORD brought
Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and
transgressed sore against the LORD. And Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria
came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. For Ahaz
took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house
of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria:
but he helped him not. And in the time of his distress did he trespass
yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz. For he sacrificed
unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the
gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to
them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all
Israel. And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres
of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.




CHAPTER 122

ISRAEL CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE INTO ASSYRIA


IN the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah
to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. And he did that which was
evil in the sight of the LORD.

Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became
his servant, and gave him presents. And the king of Assyria found
conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt,
and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year
by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in
prison. Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and
carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in
Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. For
so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD
their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from
under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods.
Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the
prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways,
and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law
which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants
the prophets. Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their
necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the
LORD their God. And they left all the commandments of the LORD their
God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove,
and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. And they caused
their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used
divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the
sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. Therefore the LORD was very
angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none
left but the tribe of Judah only. Also Judah kept not the commandments
of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they
made. And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them,
and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them
out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So
was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
And the king of Assyria brought people from his own country, and placed
them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and
they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 17]




CHAPTER 123

SENNACHERIB INVADES THE LAND


[Sidenote: II. Kings 18]

NOW it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to
all that David his father did. He removed the high places, and brake
the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen
serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel
did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. He trusted in the
LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the
kings of Judah, nor any that were before him. For he clave to the LORD,
and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which
the LORD commanded Moses. And the LORD was with him; and he prospered
whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of
Assyria, and served him not. And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib
was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, he took
counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the
fountains which were without the city: and they did help him. So there
was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and
the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should
the kings of Assyria come, and find much water? Also he strengthened
himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to
the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of
David, and made darts and shields in abundance. And he set captains of
war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of
the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, Be strong
and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor
for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than
with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God
to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves
upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
Jerusalem, unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at
Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do
ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem? Doth not Hezekiah
persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst,
saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king
of Assyria? Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any
ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? Who was there among
all the gods of those nations that could deliver his people out of mine
hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?
Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this
manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom
was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand
of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine
hand? And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against
his servant Hezekiah. He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of
Israel, and to speak against him.

Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people
of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble
them; that they might take the city. And they spake against the God of
Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were
the work of the hands of man. And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and
the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and
read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread
it before the LORD. And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O
LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the
God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made
heaven and earth. LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine
eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him
to reproach the living God. Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have
destroyed the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into
the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood
and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. Now therefore, O LORD
our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the
kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou
only.

[Sidenote: II. Kings 20]

Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith
the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against
Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. Therefore thus saith the LORD
concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor
shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank
against it. By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. For I will defend this
city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out,
and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five
thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went
and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. And it came to pass, as he was
worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that two of his sons smote
him with the sword. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.




CHAPTER 124

HEZEKIAH'S SICKNESS


IN those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the
son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set
thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. Then he turned
his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying, I beseech thee,
O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with
a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And
Hezekiah wept sore.

[Sidenote: II. Chronicles 33]

And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court,
that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, Turn again, and tell
Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of
David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears:
behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the
house of the LORD. And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I
will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria;
and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant
David's sake. And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and
laid it on the boil, and he recovered.

And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD
will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the
third day? And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that
the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go
forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? And Hezekiah answered, It
is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let
the shadow return backward ten degrees. And Isaiah the prophet cried
unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which
it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.

At that time Berodach-baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a
present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his
precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was
found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. Then came Isaiah the prophet
unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from
whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far
country, even from Babylon. And he said, What have they seen in thine
house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house
have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not
shewed them. And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which
thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into
Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.

And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in
his stead.




CHAPTER 125

MANASSEH, AMON, AND JOSIAH


[Sidenote: II. Chronicles 34]

MANASSEH was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
fifty and five years in Jerusalem: but did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the
LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. For he built again
the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he
reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the
host of heaven, and served them. And he set a carved image, the idol
which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David
and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have
chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever. So
Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do
worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children
of Israel. And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
would not hearken. Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of
the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns,
and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. And when he
was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself
greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto him: and he was
intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to
Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was
God. So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own
house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. But he did that which
was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father; and
humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled
himself; but Amon trespassed more and more. And his servants conspired
against him, and slew him in his own house. But the people of the land
slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people
of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. Josiah was eight
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and
thirty years. And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD.
For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began
to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year
he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the
groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. And they brake
down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on
high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images,
and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and
strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. And
he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah
and Jerusalem. And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim,
and Simeon, even unto Naphtali. And when he had cut down all the idols
throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.

[Sidenote: II. Chronicles 35]

Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land,
and the house, he sent Shaphan and Maaseiah the governor of the city,
and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the
LORD his God. And when they brought out the money that was brought into
the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of
the LORD given by Moses. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath
given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. And it came to
pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his
clothes. And the king commanded, saying, Go, enquire of the LORD for
me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the
words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD
that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word
of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book. And Hilkiah,
and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess;
and they spake to her to that effect. And she answered them, Thus saith
the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me, Thus
saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon
the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the
book which they have read before the king of Judah: because they have
forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might
provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my
wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so
shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the
words which thou hast heard; Because thine heart was tender, and thou
didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against
this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have
even heard thee also, saith the LORD. Behold, I will gather thee to
thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither
shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place,
and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word
again.

[Sidenote: II. Chronicles 35]

Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and
Jerusalem, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
that was found in the house of the LORD. And the king stood in his
place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD,
and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes,
with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
covenant which are written in this book. And he caused all that were
present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants
of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their
fathers. And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that
were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And
all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of
their fathers.

Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they
killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. And he
set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of
the house of the LORD. And the children of Israel that were present
kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven
days. And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep
such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites,
and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.

[Sidenote: II. Chronicles 35]

After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of
Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah
went out against him. And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king
said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. His servants
therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second
chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died,
and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah
and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah:
and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their
lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and,
behold, they are written in the lamentations.

BOOK XI--THE CAPTIVITY AND THE RETURN




CHAPTER 126

THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY


THEN the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made
him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem. Jehoahaz was twenty and
three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months
in Jerusalem. And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and
condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of
gold. And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim; and took Jehoahaz, and
carried him to Egypt.

Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil
in the sight of the LORD his God. Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. And
Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

And Jehoiachin did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. And
when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him
to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and
made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. Zedekiah was
one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven
years in Jerusalem. And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
speaking from the mouth of the LORD. And he also rebelled against king
Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his
neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it;
and they built forts against it round about. And the city was besieged
unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. And on the ninth day of the
fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread
for the people of the land. And the city was broken up, and all the men
of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which
is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round
about:) and the king went the way toward the plain. And the army of
the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of
Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him. So they took the
king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they
gave judgment upon him. And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of
brass, and carried him to Babylon.

And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the
treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and
of his princes; all these Nebuchadnezzar brought to Babylon. And they
burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt
all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels
thereof. And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign
of the kingdom of Persia: to fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth
of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as
she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.




CHAPTER 127

THE RETURN


[Sidenote: Ezra 1]

NOW in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the
LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred
up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation
throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, Thus
saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all
the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house
at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his
people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is
in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the
God,) which is in Jerusalem. Then rose up the chief of the fathers of
Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them
whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD
which is in Jerusalem. And all they that were about them strengthened
their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with
beasts, and with precious things.

Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD,
which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put
them in the house of his gods; even those did Cyrus king of Persia
bring forth, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.

[Sidenote: Ezra 3]

Now the children of the province that went up out of the captivity,
of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem
and Judah, every one unto his city; the whole congregation together
was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, beside their
servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three
hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing
men and singing women. Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six;
their mules, two hundred forty and five; their camels, four hundred
thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.

And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of
the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to
set it up in his place: they gave after their ability unto the treasure
of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five
thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were
in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to
Jerusalem. Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren
the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren,
and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings
thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. And they
offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings
morning and evening.




CHAPTER 128

THE SECOND TEMPLE


AND when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD,
they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites
the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance
of David king of Israel. And they sang together by course in praising
and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy
endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a
great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the
house of the LORD was laid. But many of the priests and Levites and
chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first
house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes,
wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: so that the
people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise
of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout,
and the noise was heard afar off.

Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah,
and troubled them in building. And Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai
the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king of
Persia in this sort: be it known unto the king, that this city is a
rebellious city, and that they have moved sedition within the same of
old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. Then sent the king
an answer, saying, Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease,
and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be
given from me. Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at
Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius
king of Persia.

Then the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesied unto the Jews that
were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel. Then rose
up Zerubbabel and Jeshua, and began to build the house of God which is
at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them. At
the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and
Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath
commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? But the
eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not
cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius.

Then Tatnai sent a letter unto Darius the king concerning this matter,
wherein was written that the Jews had answered him, saying, In the
first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a
decree to build this house of God, and to take the vessels also of gold
and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the
temple that was in Jerusalem, and carry them into the temple that is
in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.

[Sidenote: Ezra 5]

Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house
of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. And there
was found a decree of Cyrus the king to build the house of God at
Jerusalem, and also that the golden and silver vessels of the house
of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at
Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again
unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place.

Now therefore, wrote Darius, let the work of this house of God alone;
let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this
house of God in his place. Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to
the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that
of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
expences be given unto these men, that they be not hindered. And that
which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for
the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil,
according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem,
let it be given them day by day without fail: that they may offer
sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the
life of the king, and of his sons. Also I have made a decree, that
whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his
house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon. And the God that
hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that
shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which
is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.

[Sidenote: Ezra 7]

Then Tatnai, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that
which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily. And the elders of
the Jews builded, and this house was finished in the sixth year of the
reign of Darius the king.

And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest
of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house
of God with joy: and they made an offering at the dedication of this
house of God, and a sin offering for all Israel. And they set the
priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the
service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of
Moses. And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
fourteenth day of the first month. And the children of Israel kept the
feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made
them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them,
to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of
Israel.




CHAPTER 129

EZRA GOES UP FROM BABYLON


NOW after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra
went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses:
and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the
LORD his God upon him.

Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the
commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. Artaxerxes,
king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of
heaven, perfect peace. I make a decree, that all they of the people of
Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded
of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. Forasmuch
as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire
concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which
is in thine hand; and to carry the silver and gold, which the king
and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose
habitation is in Jerusalem, and all the silver and gold that thou canst
find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the
people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their
God which is in Jerusalem: that thou mayest buy speedily with this
money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink
offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which
is in Jerusalem.

And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do
with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of
your God. The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. And
whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou
shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure
house. And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest,
the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it
be done speedily, unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred
measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. Whatsoever is
commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house
of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm
of the king and his sons? Also we certify you, that touching any of the
ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll,
tribute, or custom, upon them. And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy
God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge
all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws
of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. And whosoever will
not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be
executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment,
or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.

Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing
as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which
is in Jerusalem: and hath extended mercy unto me before the king,
and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And
I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and
I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. And I
gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there
abode we in tents three days. Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the
river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek
of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our
substance. For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had
spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for
good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them
that forsake him. So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he
was intreated of us.

[Sidenote: Ezra 8]

Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the
first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon
us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay
in wait by the way. And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three
days. Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the house of our God, by number and by weight of every one:
and all the weight was written at that time. Also the children of those
that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity,
offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel. And they delivered the
king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on
this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of
God.




CHAPTER 130

THE BUILDING OF JERUSALEM


[Sidenote: Nehemiah 1]

THE words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the
month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah;
and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left
of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said unto me, The
remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in
great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken
down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. And it came to pass,
when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain
days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, and said, I
beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that
keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his
commandments: let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open,
that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants,
and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned
against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. We have dealt
very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor
the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant
Moses.

Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant
Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the
nations: but if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do
them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the
heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto
the place that I have chosen to set my name there. Now these are thy
servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power,
and by thy strong hand. O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear
be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy
servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy
servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
was the king's cupbearer.

And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine,
and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his
presence. Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.
Then I was very sore afraid, and said unto the king, Let the king live
for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the
place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
consumed with fire? Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make
request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. And I said unto the king, If
it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight,
that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers'
sepulchres, that I may build it. And the king said unto me, (the queen
also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt
thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be
given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me
over till I come into Judah; and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the
king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates
of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the
city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted
me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's
letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with
me. So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. And I arose in
the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my
God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast
with me, save the beast that I rode upon. And I went out by night by
the gate of the valley, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were
broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. And the
rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet
told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the
rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.

Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire:
come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a
reproach. Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon
me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said,
Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this
good work. But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn,
and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel
against the king? Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of
heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
build.

[Sidenote: Nehemiah 4]

But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the
wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said,
What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they
sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones
out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? Now Tobiah the
Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox
go up, he shall even break down their stone wall. Hear, O our God; for
we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give
them for a prey in the land of captivity: and cover not their iniquity,
and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have
provoked thee to anger before the builders. So built we the wall; and
all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people
had a mind to work.

But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians,
and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of
Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped,
then they were very wroth, and conspired all of them together to come
and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it. Nevertheless we made
our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night,
because of them. And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens
is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build
the wall. And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work
to cease. And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall
return unto us they will be upon you.

[Sidenote: Nehemiah 6]

Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher
places, I even set the people after their families with their swords,
their spears, and their bows. And I looked, and rose up, and said unto
the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not
ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and
fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and
your houses.

And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us,
and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of
us to the wall, every one unto his work. And it came to pass from that
time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the
other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and
the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those
that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and
with the other hand held a weapon. For the builders, every one had
his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the
trumpet was by me. And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and
to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
separated upon the wall, one far from another. In what place therefore
ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God
shall fight for us.

So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the
rising of the morning till the stars appeared. So the wall was finished
in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all
the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast
down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought
of our God.

And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the
street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the
scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had
commanded to Israel. And Ezra the priest brought the law before the
congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with
understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. And he read
therein before the street that was before the water gate from the
morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that
could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto
the book of the law. And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood,
which they had made for the purpose. And Ezra opened the book in the
sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when
he opened it, all the people stood up: and Ezra blessed the LORD, the
great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up
their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with
their faces to the ground.

And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe,
and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This
day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the
people wept, when they heard the words of the law. Then he said unto
them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions
unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our
Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.

And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people
also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy
city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities. And the people blessed
all the men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites
out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the
dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing,
with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. And the sons of the singers
gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round
about Jerusalem, and from the villages; and they stood in two companies
upon the wall, the singers and the priests with trumpets. And the
singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. Also that day they
offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice
with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the
joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.




CHAPTER 131

ESTHER'S REQUEST


[Sidenote: Esther 1]

NOW it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which
reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and
twenty provinces:) in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto
all his princes and his servants: when he shewed the riches of his
glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days,
even an hundred and fourscore days.

And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the
people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and
small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of
fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds
were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white,
and black, marble. And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the
vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
according to the state of the king. Also Vashti the queen made a feast
for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

[Sidenote: Esther 2]

On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine,
he commanded the seven chamberlains to bring Vashti the queen before
the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her
beauty: for she was fair to look on. But the queen Vashti refused to
come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the
king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. Then the king said to the
wise men, which knew the times, What shall we do unto the queen Vashti
according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of
the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? And Memucan answered before
the king and the princes, If it please the king, let there go a royal
commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the
Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no
more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto
another that is better than she.

And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did
according to the word of Memucan.

Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there
be fair young virgins sought for the king: and let the maiden which
pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the
king; and he did so.

Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was
Mordecai, who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
which had been carried away with Jeconiah [Jehoiachin] king of Judah,
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. And he
brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she
had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful;
whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own
daughter.

So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was
heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the
palace, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the
custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. And the maiden pleased him, and
she obtained kindness of him: and he preferred her and her maids unto
the best place of the house of the women. Esther had not shewed her
people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should
not shew it. And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the
women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house
of the women unto the king's house. Now when the turn of Esther was
come, she required nothing but what the king's chamberlain appointed.
And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon
her. So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in
the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his
reign.

And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace
and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the
royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. Then
the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even
Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts,
according to the state of the king.

In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the
king's chamberlains, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and
sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. And the thing was known to
Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the
king thereof in Mordecai's name. And when inquisition was made of the
matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree:
and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the Agagite, and
advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with
him. And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed,
and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But
Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. Then the king's servants,
which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest
thou the king's commandment?

Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened
not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters
would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. And when Haman
saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman
full of wrath. And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone;
for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of
Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.

[Sidenote: Esther 3]

And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered
abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy
kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep
they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to
suffer them. If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands
of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the
king's treasuries.

And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman, the
Jews' enemy. And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee,
the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first
month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded
unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every
province; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with
the king's ring. And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's
provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both
young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to
take the spoil of them for a prey.

The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the
decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down
to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

[Sidenote: Esther 4]

When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes,
and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the
city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; and came even before the
king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with
sackcloth. And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment
and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and
fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.

So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was
the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai,
and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not. Then
called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had
appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai,
to know what it was, and why it was. So Hatach went forth to Mordecai
unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.

And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum
of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries
for the Jews, to destroy them. Also he gave him the copy of the writing
of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it
unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she
should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make
request before him for her people. And Hatach came and told Esther the
words of Mordecai.

Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do
know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king
into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put
him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden
sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto
the king these thirty days.

And they told to Mordecai Esther's words. Then Mordecai commanded to
answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the
king's house, more than all the Jews. For if thou altogether holdest
thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance
arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house
shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the
kingdom for such a time as this?

Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, Go, gather together
all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and
neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens
will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not
according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. So Mordecai went his
way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.

Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal
apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over
against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the
royal house, over against the gate of the house. And it was so, when
the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained
favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre
that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the
sceptre.

Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is
thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and
Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him. Then
the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther
hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had
prepared.

And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy
petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even
to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. Then answered Esther,
and said, My petition and my request is; If I have found favour in the
sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and
to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that
I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.

Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when
Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved
for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. Nevertheless
Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called
for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. And Haman told them of the glory
of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things
wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above
the princes and servants of the king. Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther
the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that
she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also
with the king. Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see
Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

[Sidenote: Esther 6]

Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows
be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king
that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the
king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the
gallows to be made.




CHAPTER 132

THE ADVANCEMENT OF MORDECAI


ON that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring
the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the
king. And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of two of the
king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand
on the king Ahasuerus. And the king said, What honour and dignity hath
been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. And the king said,
Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the
king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows
that he had prepared for him. And the king's servants said unto him,
Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come
in. So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done
unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought
in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than
to myself? And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king
delighteth to honour, let the royal apparel be brought which the king
useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown
royal which is set upon his head: and let this apparel and horse be
delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that
they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and
bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim
before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
to honour. Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the
apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all
that thou hast spoken. Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and
arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of
the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man
whom the king delighteth to honour.

[Sidenote: Esther 7]

And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his
house mourning, and having his head covered. And Haman told Zeresh
his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then
said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the
seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not
prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. And while they
were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to
bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.

So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. And the
king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine,
What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and
what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of
the kingdom. Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found
favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be
given me at my petition, and my people at my request: for we are sold,
I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.

Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who
is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? And
Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman
was afraid before the king and the queen. And Harbonah, one of the
chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty
cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for
the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him
thereon. So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews'
enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for
Esther had told what he was unto her. And the king took off his ring,
which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther
set Mordecai over the house of Haman.

And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet,
and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the
Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. Then
the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose,
and stood before the king, and said, If it please the king, and if I
have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the
king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the
letters devised by Haman, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are
in all the king's provinces: for how can I endure to see the evil that
shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction
of my kindred? Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and
to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman,
and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand
upon the Jews. Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the
king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is
written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man
reverse. Then were the king's scribes called. And Mordecai wrote in
the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent
letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young
dromedaries: wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city
to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy,
to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and
province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to
take the spoil of them for a prey, upon one day in all the provinces of
king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
which is the month Adar.

[Sidenote: Esther 8]

And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of
blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of
fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. And in every
province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and
his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day.
And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the
Jews fell upon them.

And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men. And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace; now what is thy
petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further?
and it shall be done. Then said Esther, If it please the king, let
it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also
according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
upon the gallows. And the king commanded it so to be done: and the
decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

[Sidenote: Esther 9]

And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews
that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and
far, to stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth
day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, as
the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month
which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a
good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of
sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. Because Haman,
the enemy of all the Jews, had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume
them, and to destroy them: wherefore they called these days Purim after
the name of Pur.

And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the
isles of the sea. And all the acts of his power and of his might,
and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king
advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Media and Persia? For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king
Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of
his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to
all his seed.

BOOK XII--THE POETICAL BOOKS




CHAPTER 133

JOB SMITTEN


THERE was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was
perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. And
there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. His substance
also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five
hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great
household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the
east. And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;
and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with
them. And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,
that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,
and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for
Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their
hearts. Thus did Job continually.

Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. And the LORD said unto
Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From
going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And
the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the LORD, and
said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about
him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?
thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased
in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath,
and he will curse thee to thy face. And the LORD said unto Satan,
Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not
forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

[Sidenote: Job 2]

And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and
drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: and there came a
messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses
feeding beside them: and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them
away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and
I only am escaped alone to tell thee. While he was yet speaking, there
came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven,
and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them;
and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. While he was yet speaking,
there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands,
and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain
the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone
to tell thee. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and
said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their
eldest brother's house: and, behold, there came a great wind from
the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell
upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
tell thee. Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head,
and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, and said, Naked was I
born, and naked shall I die: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
away; blessed be the name of the LORD. In all this Job sinned not, nor
charged God foolishly.

Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. And the LORD said unto
Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said,
From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his
integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without
cause. And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand
now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy
face. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
save his life.

So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with
sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. And he took him
a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?
curse God, and die. But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the
foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God,
and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his
lips.




CHAPTER 134

JOB'S COMFORTERS


NOW when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon
him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and
Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an
appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. And
when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted
up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and
sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. So they sat down with
him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word
unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.

After this opened Job his mouth, and said,

    Let the day perish wherein I was born.
    Why died I not from my birth?
    For now should I have lain still and been quiet,
    I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
    With kings and counsellors of the earth,
    Which built desolate places for themselves.
    There the wicked cease from troubling;
    And there the weary be at rest.
    There the prisoners rest together;
    They hear not the voice of the oppressor.
    The small and great are there;
    And the servant is free from his master.
    For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,
    And that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
    I was not in safety, neither had I rest,
    Neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

[Sidenote: Job 2]

Then Eliphaz answered and said,

    Behold, thou hast instructed many,
    And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
    Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
    And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
    But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest;
    It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
    Is not this thy fear, thy confidence,
    Thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
    Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?
    Or where were the righteous cut off?
    Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
    And sow wickedness, reap the same.
    By the blast of God they perish,
    And by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
    Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,
    Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
    Yet man is born unto trouble,
    As the sparks fly upward.
    I would seek unto God,
    And unto God would I commit my cause:
    Which doeth great things and unsearchable;
    Marvellous things without number:
    Who giveth rain upon the earth,
    And sendeth waters upon the fields:
    To set up on high those that be low;
    That those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
    So the poor hath hope,
    And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
    Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:
    Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
    For he maketh sore, and bindeth up:
    He woundeth, and his hands make whole.
    He shall deliver thee in six troubles:
    Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
    In famine he shall redeem thee from death:
    And in war from the power of the sword.
    Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:
    Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
    At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:
    Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
    For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:
    And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
    And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace;
    And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
    Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
    And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
    Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,
    Like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
    Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;
    Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.

[Sidenote: Job 6]

[Sidenote: Job 7]

But Job answered and said,

    Oh that my grief were throughly weighed,
    And my calamity laid in the balances together!
    For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
    Therefore my words are swallowed up.
    Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
    Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
    Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?
    Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
    The things that my soul refused to touch
    Are as my sorrowful meat.
    Oh that I might have my request;
    And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
    Even that it would please God to destroy me;
    That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
    Then should I yet have comfort;
    Yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare;
    For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
    What is my strength, that I should hope?
    And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
    To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend;
    But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
    Teach me, and I will hold my tongue:
    And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
    O remember that my life is wind:
    Mine eye shall no more see good.
    The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more:
    Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
    As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away:
    So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
    He shall return no more to his house,
    Neither shall his place know him any more.
    Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
    I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
    I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
    What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?
    And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
    And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,
    And try him every moment?
    I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?
    Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee,
    So that I am a burden to myself?
    And why dost thou not pardon my transgression,
    And take away mine iniquity?
    For now shall I sleep in the dust;
    And thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

Then answered Bildad, and said,

    How long wilt thou speak these things?
    And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
    Doth God pervert judgment?
    Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
    If thy children have sinned against him,
    And he have cast them away for their transgression;
    If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes,
    And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
    If thou wert pure and upright;
    Surely now he would awake for thee,
    And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
    Though thy beginning was small,
    Yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
    Can the rush grow up without mire?
    Can the flag grow without water?
    Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down,
    It withereth before any other herb.
    So are the paths of all that forget God;
    And the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
    Whose hope shall be cut off,
    And whose trust shall be a spider's web.
    He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
    He shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
    He is green before the sun,
    And his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
    His roots are wrapped about the heap,
    And seeth the place of stones.
    If he destroy him from his place,
    Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
    Behold, this is the joy of his way,
    And out of the earth shall others grow.
    Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
    Neither will he help the evil doers.

[Sidenote: Job 9]

Then Job answered and said,

    I know it is so of a truth:
    But how should man be just with God?
    If he will contend with him,
    He cannot answer him one of a thousand.
    He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
    Who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
    Which removeth the mountains, and they know not:
    Which overturneth them in his anger.
    Which shaketh the earth out of her place,
    And the pillars thereof tremble.
    Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not;
    And sealeth up the stars.
    Which alone spreadeth out the heavens,
    And treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
    Which doeth great things past finding out;
    Yea, and wonders without number.
    Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
    He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
    Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?
    Who will say unto him, What doest thou?
    How much less shall I answer him,
    And choose out my words to reason with him?
    Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer,
    But I would make supplication to my judge.
    If I had called, and he had answered me;
    Yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
    For he breaketh me with a tempest,
    And multiplieth my wounds without cause.
    He will not suffer me to take my breath,
    But filleth me with bitterness.
    If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong:
    And if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
    If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me:
    If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
    This is one thing, therefore I said it,
    He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.

Then answered Zophar, and said,

    Should not the multitude of words be answered?
    And should a man full of talk be justified?
    Should thy lies make men hold their peace?
    And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
    For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure,
    And I am clean in thine eyes.
    But oh that God would speak,
    And open his lips against thee:
    And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom,
    That they are double to that which is!
    Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity
        deserveth.
    Canst thou by searching find out God?
    Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
    It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?
    Deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
    The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
    And broader than the sea.
    For he knoweth vain men:
    He seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
    For vain man would be wise,
    Though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
    If thou prepare thine heart,
    And stretch out thine hands toward him;
    If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,
    And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
    For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
    Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
    Because thou shalt forget thy misery,
    And remember it as waters that pass away:
    And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday;
    Thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
    And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;
    Yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
    Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
    Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

[Sidenote: Job 12]

[Sidenote: Job 13]

And Job answered and said,

    No doubt but ye are the people,
    And wisdom shall die with you.
    But I have understanding as well as you;
    I am not inferior to you:
    Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
    I am as one mocked of his neighbour,
    Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him:
    The just upright man is laughed to scorn.
    But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
    And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
    Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee:
    And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
    Who knoweth not in all these
    That the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
    In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
    And the breath of all mankind.
    Doth not the ear try words?
    And the mouth taste his meat?
    With the ancient is wisdom;
    And in length of days understanding.
    With him is wisdom and strength,
    He hath counsel and understanding.
    Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again:
    He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
    Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:
    Also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
    With him is strength and wisdom:
    The deceived and the deceiver are his.
    He leadeth counsellors away spoiled,
    And maketh the judges fools.
    He looseth the bond of kings,
    And girdeth their loins with a girdle.
    He leadeth princes away spoiled,
    And overthroweth the mighty.
    He removeth away the speech of the trusty,
    And taketh away the understanding of the aged.
    He poureth contempt upon princes,
    And weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
    He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
    And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
    He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them:
    He enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.
    He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth,
    And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
    They grope in the dark without light,
    And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
    Lo, mine eye hath seen all this,
    Mine ear hath heard and understood it.
    What ye know, the same do I know also:
    I am not inferior unto you.
    Surely I would speak to the Almighty,
    And I desire to reason with God.
    But ye are forgers of lies,
    Ye are all physicians of no value.
    Hold your peace, let me alone,
    That I may speak, and let come on me what will.
    Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth,
    And put my life in mine hand?
    Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him:
    But I will maintain mine own ways before him.
    He also shall be my salvation:
    For an hypocrite shall not come before him.
    Man that is born of a woman
    Is of few days, and full of trouble.
    He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
    He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
    And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one,
    And bringest me into judgment with thee?
    As the waters fail from the sea,
    And the flood decayeth and drieth up:
    So man lieth down, and riseth not:
    Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
    Nor be raised out of their sleep.
    O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave,
    That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,
    That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
    If a man die, shall he live again?
    All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
    Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee:
    Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
    For now thou numberest my steps:
    Dost thou not watch over my sin?

And Eliphaz reproved Job. And again Job answered and said,

    Miserable comforters are ye all.
    I also could speak as ye do:
    If your soul were in my soul's stead,
    I could heap up words against you,
    And shake mine head at you.
    But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
    And the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
    My friends scorn me:
    But mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
    O that one might plead for a man with God,
    As a man pleadeth for his neighbour!

And Bildad reproved Job. Then

Job answered and said,

    How long will ye vex my soul,
    And break me in pieces with words?
    These ten times have ye reproached me:
    Ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
    And be it indeed that I have erred,
    Mine error remaineth with myself.
    If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
    And plead against me my reproach:
    Know now that God hath overthrown me,
    And hath compassed me with his net.
    Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
    I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
    He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,
    And he hath set darkness in my paths.
    He hath stripped me of my glory,
    And taken the crown from my head.
    He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone:
    And mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
    He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
    And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
    His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,
    And encamp round about my tabernacle.
    He hath put my brethren far from me,
    And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
    My kinsfolk have failed,
    And my familiar friends have forgotten me.
    Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
    For the hand of God hath touched me.
    Why do ye persecute me as God,
    And are not satisfied with my flesh?
    Oh that my words were now written!
    Oh that they were printed in a book!
    That they were graven with an iron pen
    And lead in the rock for ever!
    For I know that my redeemer liveth,
    And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
    And though after my skin worms destroy this body,
    Yet in my flesh shall I see God:
    Whom I shall see for myself,
    And mine eyes shall behold, and not another;
    Though my reins be consumed within me.

    [Sidenote: Job 20]

    Then answered Zophar, and said,

    Knowest thou not this of old,
    Since man was placed upon earth,
    That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
    And the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
    He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
    Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
    The eye also which saw him shall see him no more;
    Neither shall his place any more behold him.
    His children shall seek to please the poor,
    And his hands shall restore their goods.
    His bones are full of the sin of his youth,
    Which shall lie down with him in the dust.
    That which he laboured for shall he restore,
    And shall not swallow it down:
    According to his substance shall the restitution be,
    And he shall not rejoice therein.
    Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor;
    Because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
    He shall flee from the iron weapon,
    And the bow of steel shall strike him through.
    The heaven shall reveal his iniquity;
    And the earth shall rise up against him.
    The increase of his house shall depart,
    And his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
    This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
    And the heritage appointed unto him by God.

[Sidenote: Job 21]

But Job answered and said,

    Hear diligently my speech,
    And let this be your consolations.
    Suffer me that I may speak;
    And after that I have spoken, mock on.
    Wherefore do the wicked live,
    Become old, yea, are mighty in power?
    Their seed is established in their sight with them,
    And their offspring before their eyes.
    Their houses are safe from fear,
    Neither is the rod of God upon them.
    They send forth their little ones like a flock,
    And their children dance.
    They take the timbrel and harp,
    And rejoice at the sound of the organ.
    They spend their days in wealth,
    And in a moment go down to the grave.
    Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us;
    For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
    What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
    And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
    Lo, their good is not in their hand:
    The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
    How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!
    And how oft cometh their destruction upon them!
    God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
    They are as stubble before the wind,
    And as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
    God layeth up his iniquity for his children:
    He rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
    His eyes shall see his destruction,
    And he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
    Have ye not asked them that go by the way?
    And do ye not know their tokens,
    That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?
    They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
    Who shall declare his way to his face?
    And who shall repay him what he hath done?
    Yet shall he be brought to the grave,
    And shall remain in the tomb.
    The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
    And every man shall draw after him,
    As there are innumerable before him.
    How then comfort ye me in vain,
    Seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?

Then Eliphaz accused Job of divers sins, and exhorted him to repentance
with promises of mercy. Then Job answered and said,

    Even to day is my complaint bitter:
    My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
    Oh that I knew where I might find him!
    That I might come even to his seat!
    I would order my cause before him,
    And fill my mouth with arguments.
    I would know the words which he would answer me,
    And understand what he would say unto me.
    Will he plead against me with his great power?
    No; but he would put strength in me.
    There the righteous might dispute with him;
    So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
    Behold, I go forward, but he is not there;
    And backward, but I cannot perceive him:
    On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
    He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
    But he knoweth the way that I take:
    When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
    My foot hath held his steps,
    His way have I kept, and not declined.
    Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips;
    I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
    But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?
    And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
    For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me:
    And many such things are with him.
    Therefore am I troubled at his presence:
    When I consider, I am afraid of him.
    For God maketh my heart soft,
    And the Almighty troubleth me:
    Because I was not cut off before the darkness,
    Neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.

[Sidenote: Job 25]

Then Bildad replied to Job, and Job answered and said,

    How hast thou helped him that is without power?
    How savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
    How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom?
    And how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
    To whom hast thou uttered words?
    And whose spirit came from thee?
    Dead things are formed
    From under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
    Hell is naked before him,
    And destruction hath no covering.
    He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,
    And hangeth the earth upon nothing.
    He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
    And the cloud is not rent under them.
    He holdeth back the face of his throne,
    And spreadeth his cloud upon it.
    He hath compassed the waters with bounds,
    Until the day and night come to an end.
    The pillars of heaven tremble
    And are astonished at his reproof.
    He divideth the sea with his power,
    And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
    By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens;
    His hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
    Lo, these are parts of his ways:
    But how little a portion is heard of him?
    But the thunder of his power who can understand?
    Whence then cometh wisdom?
    And where is the place of understanding?
    Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
    And kept close from the fowls of the air.
    Destruction and death say,
    We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
    God understandeth the way thereof,
    And he knoweth the place thereof.
    For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
    And seeth under the whole heaven;
    To make the weight for the winds;
    And he weigheth the waters by measure.
    When he made a decree for the rain,
    And a way for the lightning of the thunder:
    Then did he see it, and declare it;
    He prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
    And unto man he said,
    Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
    And to depart from evil is understanding.

[Sidenote: Job 31]

Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

    Oh that I were as in months past,
    As in the days when God preserved me;
    When his candle shined upon my head,
    And when by his light I walked through darkness;
    As I was in the days of my youth,
    When the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
    When the Almighty was yet with me,
    When my children were about me;
    When I washed my steps with butter,
    And the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
    When I went out to the gate through the city,
    When I prepared my seat in the street!
    The young men saw me, and hid themselves:
    And the aged arose, and stood up.
    The princes refrained talking,
    And laid their hand on their mouth.
    The nobles held their peace,
    And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
    When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
    And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
    Because I delivered the poor that cried,
    And the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
    The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:
    And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
    I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
    My judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
    I was eyes to the blind,
    And feet was I to the lame.
    I was a father to the poor:
    And the cause which I knew not I searched out.
    But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
    Whose fathers I would have disdained
    To have set with the dogs of my flock.
    I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me:
    I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
    Thou art become cruel to me:
    With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
    Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,
    And dissolvest my substance.
    For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
    And to the house appointed for all living.
    Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave,
    Though they cry in his destruction.
    Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
    Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
    When I looked for good, then evil came unto me:
    And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
    If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
    Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
    Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,
    And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
    If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
    Or any poor without covering;
    If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
    When I saw my help in the gate:
    Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,
    And mine arm be broken from the bone.
    If I have made gold my hope,
    Or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
    If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,
    And because mine hand had gotten much:
    This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge:
    For I should have denied the God that is above.
    If my land cry against me,
    Or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
    If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
    Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
    Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
    And cockle instead of barley.

The words of Job are ended.

So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in
his own eyes. Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu: against Job was
his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. Also
against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found
no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

[Sidenote: Job 34]

And Elihu reasoned with Job, that God gave no account of his ways to
men, but called them to repentance. And Elihu said,

    Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,
    And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
    I am clean without transgression, I am innocent;
    Neither is there iniquity in me.
    Behold, he findeth occasions against me,
    He counteth me for his enemy,
    He putteth my feet in the stocks,
    He marketh all my paths.
    Behold, in this thou art not just:
    I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
    Why dost thou strive against him?
    For he giveth not account of any of his matters.
    For God speaketh once,
    Yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
    He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
    And his life from perishing by the sword.
    Then he is gracious unto him, and saith,
    Deliver him from going down to the pit:
    I have found a ransom.
    He looketh upon men, and if any say,
    I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
    And it profited me not;
    He will deliver his soul from going into the pit,
    And his life shall see the light.
    Lo, all these things worketh God
    Oftentimes with man,
    To bring back his soul from the pit,
    To be enlightened with the light of the living.
    For his eyes are upon the ways of man,
    And he seeth all his goings.
    There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,
    Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
    When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?
    And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?
    Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
    Surely it is meet to be said unto God,
    I have borne chastisement,
    I will not offend any more:
    That which I see not teach thou me:
    If I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
    Job hath spoken without knowledge,
    And his words were without wisdom.
    My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end
    Because of his answers for wicked men.
    For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,
    He clappeth his hands among us,
    And multiplieth his words against God.

Elihu also proceeded, and said,

    Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee
    That I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
    I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
    And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
    For truly my words shall not be false:
    He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
    Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:
    He is mighty in strength and wisdom.
    He preserveth not the life of the wicked:
    But giveth right to the poor.
    He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
    But with kings are they on the throne;
    Yea, he doth establish them for ever,
    and they are exalted.
    And if they be bound in fetters,
    And be holden in cords of affliction;
    Then he sheweth them their work,
    And their transgressions that they have exceeded.
    He openeth also their ear to discipline,
    And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
    If they obey and serve him,
    They shall spend their days in prosperity,
    And their years in pleasures.
    But if they obey not,
    They shall perish by the sword,
    And they shall die without knowledge.
    He delivereth the poor in his affliction,
    And openeth their ears in oppression.
    Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait
    Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
    And that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
    But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked:
    Judgment and justice take hold on thee.
    Behold, God is great, and we know him not,
    Neither can the number of his years be searched out.
    For he maketh small the drops of water:
    They pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
    Which the clouds do drop
    And distil upon man abundantly.
    Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
    Or the noise of his tabernacle?
    Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it,
    And covereth the bottom of the sea.
    With clouds he covereth the light;
    And commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
    God thundereth marvellously with his voice;
    Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
    For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth;
    Likewise to the small rain,
    And to the great rain of his strength.
    Out of the south cometh the whirlwind:
    And cold out of the north.
    By the breath of God frost is given:
    And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
    Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in
        power,
    And in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
    Men do therefore fear him:
    He respecteth not any that are wise of heart.




CHAPTER 135

THE LORD REASONETH WITH JOB


[Sidenote: Job 38]

[Sidenote: Job 39]

THEN the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

    Who is this that darkeneth counsel
    By words without knowledge?
    Gird up now thy loins like a man;
    For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
    Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
    Declare, if thou hast understanding.
    Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?
    Or who hath stretched the line upon it?
    Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?
    Or who laid the corner stone thereof;
    When the morning stars sang together,
    And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
    Or who shut up the sea with doors?
    When I made the cloud the garment thereof,
    And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
    And set bars and doors,
    And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:
    And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
    Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;
    And caused the dayspring to know his place;
    That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
    That the wicked might be shaken out of it?
    It is turned as clay to the seal;
    And they stand as a garment.
    And from the wicked their light is withholden,
    And the high arm shall be broken.
    Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
    Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
    Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?
    Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
    Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?
    Declare if thou knowest it all.
    Where is the way where light dwelleth?
    And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
    That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
    And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
    Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?
    Or because the number of thy days is great?
    Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?
    Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
    Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
    Against the day of battle and war?
    By what way is the light parted,
    Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
    Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
    Or a way for the lightning of thunder;
    To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;
    On the wilderness wherein there is no man;
    To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;
    And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
    Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go,
    And say unto thee, Here we are?
    Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
    Or who hath given understanding to the heart?
    Who can number the clouds in wisdom?
    Or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
    When the dust groweth into hardness,
    And the clods cleave fast together?
    Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?
    Or fill the appetite of the young lions,
    When they couch in their dens,
    And abide in the covert to lie in wait?
    Who provideth for the raven his food?
    When his young ones cry unto God,
    They wander for lack of meat.
    Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
    Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
    Whose house I have made the wilderness,
    And the barren land his dwellings.
    He scorneth the multitude of the city,
    Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
    The range of the mountains is his pasture,
    And he searcheth after every green thing.
    Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee,
    Or abide by thy crib?
    Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?
    Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
    Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?
    Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
    Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,
    And gather it into thy barn?
    Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?
    Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
    Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,
    And warmeth them in dust,
    And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
    Or that the wild beast may break them.
    She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's:
    Her labour is in vain without fear;
    Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
    Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
    What time she lifteth up herself on high,
    She scorneth the horse and his rider.
    Hast thou given the horse strength?
    Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
    Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?
    The glory of his nostrils is terrible.
    He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
    He goeth on to meet the armed men.
    He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;
    Neither turneth he back from the sword.
    The quiver rattleth against him,
    The glittering spear and the shield.
    He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:
    Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
    He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha;
    And he smelleth the battle afar off,
    The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
    Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,
    And stretch her wings toward the south?
    Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,
    And make her nest on high?
    She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,
    Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
    From thence she seeketh the prey,
    And her eyes behold afar off.
    Her young ones also suck up blood:
    And where the slain are, there is she.

[Sidenote: Job 40]

Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

    Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?
    He that reproveth God, let him answer it.

Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

    Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?
    I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
    Once have I spoken; but I will not answer:
    Yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.

Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

    Gird up thy loins now like a man:
    I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
    Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?
    Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
    Hast thou an arm like God?
    Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
    Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;
    And array thyself with glory and beauty.
    Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:
    And behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
    Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
    And tread down the wicked in their place.
    Hide them in the dust together;
    And bind their faces in secret.
    Then will I also confess unto thee
    That thine own right hand can save thee.
    Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;
    He eateth grass as an ox.
    His bones are as strong pieces of brass;
    His bones are like bars of iron.
    He is the chief of the ways of God:
    He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
    He lieth under the shady trees,
    In the covert of the reed, and fens.
    The shady trees cover him with their shadow;
    The willows of the brook compass him about.
    Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not:
    He trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
    Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?
    Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
    Canst thou put an hook into his nose?
    Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
    Will he make many supplications unto thee?
    Will he speak soft words unto thee?
    Will he make a covenant with thee?
    Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
    Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
    Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
    Shall the companions make a banquet of him?
    Shall they part him among the merchants?
    Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
    Or his head with fish spears?
    Lay thine hand upon him,
    Remember the battle, do no more.
    Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
    Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
    None is so fierce that dare stir him up:
    Who then is able to stand before me?
    Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?
    Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.

Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

    I know that thou canst do every thing,
    And that no thought can be withholden from thee.
    I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:
    But now mine eye seeth thee.
    Wherefore I abhor myself,
    And repent in dust and ashes.

And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the
LORD said to Eliphaz, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against
thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right,
as my servant Job hath. Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and
seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a
burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not
spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.

So Eliphaz and Bildad and Zophar went, and did according as the LORD
commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job. And the LORD turned the
captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave
Job twice as much as he had before. Then came there unto him all his
brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his
acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they
bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had
brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every
one an earring of gold.

So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for
he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand
yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. He had also seven sons and
three daughters. And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the
name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of
Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.

After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and
his sons' sons, even four generations. So Job died, being old and full
of days.




CHAPTER 136

PSALMS




PSALM 1


    BLESSED is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
    Nor standeth in the way of sinners,
    Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
    But his delight is in the law of the LORD;
    And in his law doth he meditate day and night.
    And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
    That bringeth forth his fruit in his season;
    His leaf also shall not wither;
    And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
    The ungodly are not so:
    But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
    Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
    Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
    For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous:
    But the way of the ungodly shall perish.




PSALM 8


    O LORD our Lord,
    How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
    Who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
    Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength
    Because of thine enemies,
    That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
    When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
    The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
    What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
    And the son of man, that thou visitest him?
    For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
    And hast crowned him with glory and honour.
    Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
    Thou hast put all things under his feet:
    All sheep and oxen,
    Yea, and the beasts of the field;
    The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,
    And whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
    O LORD our Lord,
    How excellent is thy name in all the earth!




PSALM 15


    LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle?
    Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
    He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,
    And speaketh the truth in his heart.
    He that backbiteth not with his tongue,
    Nor doeth evil to his neighbour,
    Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
    In whose eyes a vile person is contemned;
    But he honoureth them that fear the LORD.
    He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
    He that putteth not out his money to usury,
    Nor taketh reward against the innocent.
    He that doeth these things shall never be moved.




PSALM 16


    PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
    O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord:
    My goodness extendeth not to thee;
    But to the saints that are in the earth,
    And to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
    Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god:
    Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer,
    Nor take up their names into my lips.
    The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
    Thou maintainest my lot.
    The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
    Yea, I have a goodly heritage.
    I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel:
    My reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
    I have set the LORD always before me:
    Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
    Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:
    My flesh also shall rest in hope.
    For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;
    Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
    Thou wilt shew me the path of life:
    In thy presence is fulness of joy;
    At thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.




PSALM 19


    THE heavens declare the glory of God;
    And the firmament sheweth his handywork.
    Day unto day uttereth speech,
    And night unto night sheweth knowledge.
    There is no speech nor language,
    Where their voice is not heard.
    Their line is gone out through all the earth,
    And their words to the end of the world.
    In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
    Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
    And rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
    His going forth is from the end of the heaven,
    And his circuit unto the ends of it:
    And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
    The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul:
    The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
    The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart:
    The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
    The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever:
    The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
    More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
    Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
    Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
    And in keeping of them there is great reward.
    Who can understand his errors?
    Cleanse thou me from secret faults.
    Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins;
    Let them not have dominion over me:
    Then shall I be upright,
    And I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
    Let the words of my mouth,
    And the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight,
    O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.




PSALM 23


    THE LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
    He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
    He leadeth me beside the still waters.
    He restoreth my soul:
    He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
    Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
    I will fear no evil: for thou art with me;
    Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
    Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
    Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
    Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:
    And I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.




PSALM 24


    THE earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof;
    The world, and they that dwell therein.
    For he hath founded it upon the seas,
    And established it upon the floods.
    Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD?
    Or who shall stand in his holy place?
    He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;
    Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,
    Nor sworn deceitfully.
    He shall receive the blessing from the LORD,
    And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
    This is the generation of them that seek him,
    That seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
    Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
    And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;
    And the King of glory shall come in.
    Who is this King of glory?
    The LORD strong and mighty,
    The LORD mighty in battle.
    Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
    Even lift them up, ye everlasting doors;
    And the King of glory shall come in.
    Who is this King of glory?
    The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.




PSALM 29


    GIVE unto the LORD, O ye mighty,
    Give unto the LORD glory and strength.
    Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name;
    Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
    The voice of the LORD is upon the waters:
    The God of glory thundereth:
    The LORD is upon many waters.
    The voice of the LORD is powerful;
    The voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
    The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars;
    Yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
    He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
    Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
    The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
    The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness;
    The LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
    The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve,
    And discovereth the forests:
    And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
    The LORD sitteth upon the flood;
    Yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.
    The LORD will give strength unto his people;
    The LORD will bless his people with peace.




PSALM 33


    REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous:
    For praise is comely for the upright.
    Praise the LORD with harp:
    Sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
    Sing unto him a new song;
    Play skilfully with a loud noise.
    For the word of the LORD is right;
    And all his works are done in truth.
    He loveth righteousness and judgment:
    The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
    By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
    And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
    He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap:
    He layeth up the depth in storehouses.
    Let all the earth fear the LORD:
    Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
    For he spake, and it was done;
    He commanded, and it stood fast.
    The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought:
    He maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
    The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever,
    The thoughts of his heart to all generations.
    Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD;
    And the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
    The LORD looketh from heaven;
    He beholdeth all the sons of men.
    From the place of his habitation he looketh
    Upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
    He fashioneth their hearts alike;
    He considereth all their works.
    There is no king saved by the multitude of an host:
    A mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
    An horse is a vain thing for safety:
    Neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
    Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him,
    Upon them that hope in his mercy;
    To deliver their soul from death,
    And to keep them alive in famine.
    Our soul waiteth for the LORD:
    He is our help and our shield.
    For our heart shall rejoice in him,
    Because we have trusted in his holy name.
    Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us,
    According as we hope in thee.




PSALM 34


    I WILL bless the LORD at all times:
    His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
    My soul shall make her boast in the LORD:
    The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
    O magnify the LORD with me,
    And let us exalt his name together.
    I sought the LORD, and he heard me,
    And delivered me from all my fears.
    They looked unto him, and were lightened:
    And their faces were not ashamed.
    This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him,
    And saved him out of all his troubles.
    The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
    And delivereth them.
    O taste and see that the LORD is good:
    Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
    O fear the LORD, ye his saints:
    For there is no want to them that fear him.
    The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger:
    But they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
    Come, ye children, hearken unto me:
    I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
    What man is he that desireth life,
    And loveth many days, that he may see good?
    Keep thy tongue from evil,
    And thy lips from speaking guile.
    Depart from evil, and do good;
    Seek peace, and pursue it.
    The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous,
    And his ears are open unto their cry.
    The face of the LORD is against them that do evil,
    To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
    The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth,
    And delivereth them out of all their troubles.
    The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart;
    And saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
    Many are the afflictions of the righteous:
    But the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
    He keepeth all his bones:
    Not one of them is broken.
    Evil shall slay the wicked:
    And they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
    The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants:
    And none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.




PSALM 42


    As the hart panteth after the water brooks,
    So panteth my soul after thee, O God.
    My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
    When shall I come and appear before God?
    My tears have been my meat day and night,
    While they continually say unto me,
    Where is thy God?
    When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me:
    For I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
        God,
    With the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept
        holyday.
    Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
    And why art thou disquieted in me?
    Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him
    For the help of his countenance.
    O my God, my soul is cast down within me:
    Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan,
    And of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
    Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts:
    All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
    Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime,
    And in the night his song shall be with me,
    And my prayer unto the God of my life.
    I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?
    Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
    As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me;
    While they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
    Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
    And why art thou disquieted within me?
    Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,
    Who is the health of my countenance, and my God.




PSALM 43


    JUDGE me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
    O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
    For thou art the God of my strength: Why dost thou cast me off?
    Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
    O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me;
    Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
    Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:
    Yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
    Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
    And why art thou disquieted within me?
    Hope in God: for I shall yet praise him,
    Who is the health of my countenance, and my God.




PSALM 45


    MY heart is inditing a good matter:
    I speak of the things which I have made touching the king:
    My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
    Thou art fairer than the children of men:
    Grace is poured into thy lips:
    Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
    Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty,
    With thy glory and thy majesty.
    And in thy majesty ride prosperously
    Because of truth and meekness and righteousness;
    And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
    Thine arrows are sharp
    In the heart of the king's enemies;
    Whereby the people fall under thee.
    Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
    The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
    Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness:
    Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee
    With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
    All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia,
    Out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
    Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women:
    Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
    Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
    Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
    So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty:
    For he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
    And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift;
    Even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
    The king's daughter is all glorious within:
    Her clothing is of wrought gold.
    She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
    The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
    With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought:
    They shall enter into the king's palace.
    Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,
    Whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
    I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
    Therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.




PSALM 46


    GOD is our refuge and strength,
    A very present help in trouble.
    Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed,
    And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
    Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
    Though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
    There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God,
    The holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
    God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:
    God shall help her, and that right early.
    The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved:
    He uttered his voice, the earth melted.
    The LORD of hosts is with us;
    The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
    Come, behold the works of the LORD,
    What desolations he hath made in the earth.
    He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;
    He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder;
    He burneth the chariot in the fire.
    Be still, and know that I am God:
    I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
    The LORD of hosts is with us;
    The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.




PSALM 47


    O CLAP your hands, all ye people;
    Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
    For the LORD most high is terrible;
    He is a great King over all the earth.
    He shall subdue the people under us,
    And the nations under our feet.
    He shall choose our inheritance for us,
    The excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
    God is gone up with a shout,
    The LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
    Sing praises to God, sing praises:
    Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
    For God is the King of all the earth:
    Sing ye praises with understanding.
    God reigneth over the heathen:
    God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
    The princes of the people are gathered together,
    Even the people of the God of Abraham:
    For the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.




PSALM 51


    HAVE mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
    According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
        transgressions.
    Wash me throughly from mine iniquity,
    And cleanse me from my sin.
    For I acknowledge my transgressions:
    And my sin is ever before me.
    Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
    And done this evil in thy sight:
    That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
    And be clear when thou judgest.
    Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;
    And in sin did my mother conceive me.
    Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts:
    And in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
    Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:
    Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
    Make me to hear joy and gladness;
    That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
    Hide thy face from my sins,
    And blot out all mine iniquities.
    Create in me a clean heart, O God;
    And renew a right spirit within me.
    Cast me not away from thy presence;
    And take not thy holy spirit from me.
    Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
    And uphold me with thy free spirit.
    Then will I teach transgressors thy ways;
    And sinners shall be converted unto thee.
    Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation:
    And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
    O Lord, open thou my lips;
    And my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
    For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it:
    Thou delightest not in burnt offering.
    The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:
    A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
    Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
    Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
    Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
        with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
    Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.




PSALM 63


    O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee:
    My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee
    In a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
    To see thy power and thy glory,
    So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
    Because thy lovingkindness is better than life,
    My lips shall praise thee.
    Thus will I bless thee while I live:
    I will lift up my hands in thy name.
    My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;
    And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
    When I remember thee upon my bed,
    And meditate on thee in the night watches.
    Because thou hast been my help,
    Therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice....




PSALM 65


    PRAISE waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion:
    And unto thee shall the vow be performed.
    O thou that hearest prayer,
    Unto thee shall all flesh come.
    Iniquities prevail against me:
    As for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
    Blessed is the man whom thou choosest,
    And causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts:
    We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy
        holy temple.
    By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us,
    O God of our salvation;
    Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them
        that are afar off upon the sea:
    Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains;
    Being girded with power:
    Which stilleth the noise of the seas,
    The noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
    They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens:
    Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
    Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it:
    Thou greatly enrichest it
    With the river of God, which is full of water:
    Thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
    Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly:
    Thou settlest the furrows thereof:
    Thou makest it soft with showers:
    Thou blessest the springing thereof.
    Thou crownest the year with thy goodness;
    And thy paths drop fatness.
    They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness:
    And the little hills rejoice on every side.
    The pastures are clothed with flocks;
    The valleys also are covered over with corn;
    They shout for joy, they also sing.




PSALM 77


    I CRIED unto God with my voice,
    Even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
    In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord:
    My sore ran in the night, and ceased not:
    My soul refused to be comforted.
    I remembered God, and was troubled:
    I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
    Thou holdest mine eyes waking:
    I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
    I have considered the days of old,
    The years of ancient times.
    I call to remembrance my song in the night:
    I commune with mine own heart:
    And my spirit made diligent search.
    Will the Lord cast off for ever?
    And will he be favourable no more?
    Is his mercy clean gone for ever?
    Doth his promise fail for evermore?
    Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
    Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
    And I said, This is my infirmity:
    But I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
    I will remember the works of the LORD:
    Surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
    I will meditate also of all thy work,
    And talk of thy doings.
    Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
    Who is so great a God as our God?
    Thou art the God that doest wonders:
    Thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
    Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people,
    The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
    The waters saw thee, O God,
    The waters saw thee; they were afraid:
    The depths also were troubled.
    The clouds poured out water:
    The skies sent out a sound:
    Thine arrows also went abroad.
    The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven:
    The lightnings lightened the world:
    The earth trembled and shook.
    Thy way is in the sea,
    And thy path in the great waters,
    And thy footsteps are not known.
    Thou leddest thy people like a flock
    By the hand of Moses and Aaron.




PSALM 84


    HOW amiable are thy tabernacles,
    O LORD of hosts!
    My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:
    My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
    Yea, the sparrow hath found an house,
    And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,
    Even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
    Blessed are they that dwell in thy house:
    They will be still praising thee. Selah.
    Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee;
    In whose heart are the ways of them.
    Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well;
    The rain also filleth the pools.
    They go from strength to strength,
    Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
    O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer:
    Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
    Behold, O God our shield,
    And look upon the face of thine anointed.
    For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.
    I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
    Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
    For the LORD God is a sun and shield:
    The LORD will give grace and glory:
    No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
    O LORD of hosts,
    Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.




PSALM 86


    BOW down thine ear, O LORD, hear me:
    For I am poor and needy.
    Preserve my soul; for I am holy:
    O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
    Be merciful unto me, O Lord:
    For I cry unto thee daily.
    Rejoice the soul of thy servant:
    For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
    For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive;
    And plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
    Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer;
    And attend to the voice of my supplications.
    In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee:
    For thou wilt answer me.
    Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord;
    Neither are there any works like unto thy works.
    All nations whom thou hast made
    Shall come and worship before thee, O Lord;
    And shall glorify thy name.
    For thou art great, and doest wondrous things:
    Thou art God alone.
    Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth:
    Unite my heart to fear thy name.
    I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart:
    And I will glorify thy name for evermore.
    For great is thy mercy toward me:
    And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
    O God, the proud are risen against me,
    And the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul;
    And have not set thee before them.
    But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
    Longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
    O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me;
    Give thy strength unto thy servant,
    And save the son of thine handmaid.
    Shew me a token for good;
    That they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed:
    Because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.




PSALM 90


    LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place
    In all generations.
    Before the mountains were brought forth,
    Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
    Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
    Thou turnest man to destruction;
    And sayest, Return, ye children of men.
    For a thousand years in thy sight
    Are but as yesterday when it is past,
    And as a watch in the night.
    Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
    In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
    In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
    In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
    For we are consumed by thine anger,
    And by thy wrath are we troubled.
    Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
    Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
    For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
    We spend our years as a tale that is told.
    The days of our years are threescore years and ten;
    And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years,
    Yet is their strength labour and sorrow;
    For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
    Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
    Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
    So teach us to number our days,
    That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
    Return, O LORD, how long?
    And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
    O satisfy us early with thy mercy;
    That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
    Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
    And the years wherein we have seen evil.
    Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
    And thy glory unto their children.
    And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us:
    And establish thou the work of our hands upon us;
    Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.




PSALM 91


    HE that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High
    Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
    I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress:
    My God; in him will I trust.
    Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
    And from the noisome pestilence.
    He shall cover thee with his feathers,
    And under his wings shalt thou trust:
    His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
    Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;
    Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
    Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness;
    Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
    A thousand shall fall at thy side,
    And ten thousand at thy right hand;
    But it shall not come nigh thee.
    Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
    And see the reward of the wicked.
    Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge,
    Even the most High, thy habitation;
    There shall no evil befall thee,
    Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
    For he shall give his angels charge over thee,
    To keep thee in all thy ways.
    They shall bear thee up in their hands,
    Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
    Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:
    The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
    Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
    I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
    He shall call upon me, and I will answer him:
    I will be with him in trouble;
    I will deliver him, and honour him.
    With long life will I satisfy him,
    And shew him my salvation.




PSALM 93


    THE LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty;
    The LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself:
    The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.
    Thy throne is established of old:
    Thou art from everlasting.
    The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their
        voice;
    The floods lift up their waves.
    The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
    Yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
    Thy testimonies are very sure:
    Holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.




PSALM 95


    O COME, let us sing unto the LORD:
    Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
    Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving,
    And make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
    For the LORD is a great God,
    And a great King above all gods.
    In his hand are the deep places of the earth:
    The strength of the hills is his also.
    The sea is his, and he made it:
    And his hands formed the dry land.
    O come, let us worship and bow down:
    Let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
    For he is our God;
    And we are the people of his pasture,
    And the sheep of his hand.
    To day if ye will hear his voice,
    Harden not your heart, as in the provocation,
    And as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
    When your fathers tempted me,
    Proved me, and saw my work.
    Forty years long was I grieved with this generation,
    And said, It is a people that do err in their heart,
    And they have not known my ways:
    Unto whom I sware in my wrath
    That they should not enter into my
    rest.




PSALM 96


    O SING unto the LORD a new song:
    Sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
    Sing unto the LORD, bless his name;
    Shew forth his salvation from day to day.
    Declare his glory among the heathen,
    His wonders among all people.
    For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised:
    He is to be feared above all gods.
    For all the gods of the nations are idols:
    But the LORD made the heavens.
    Honour and majesty are before him:
    Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
    Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people,
    Give unto the LORD glory and strength.
    Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name:
    Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
    O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness:
    Fear before him, all the earth.
    Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth:
    The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved:
    He shall judge the people righteously.
    Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;
    Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
    Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein:
    Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD:
    For he cometh,
    For he cometh to judge the earth:
    He shall judge the world with righteousness,
    And the people with his truth.




PSALM 98


    O SING unto the LORD a new song;
    For he hath done marvellous things:
    His right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
    The LORD hath made known his salvation:
    His righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
    He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel:
    All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
    Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth:
    Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
    Sing unto the LORD with the harp;
    With the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
    With trumpets and sound of cornet
    Make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
    Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
    The world, and they that dwell therein.
    Let the floods clap their hands:
    Let the hills be joyful together before the LORD;
    For he cometh to judge the earth:
    With righteousness shall he judge the world,
    And the people with equity.




PSALM 100


    MAKE a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
    Serve the LORD with gladness:
    Come before his presence with singing.
    Know ye that the LORD he is God:
    It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves;
    We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
    Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
        praise:
    Be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
    For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting;
    And his truth endureth to all generations.




PSALM 103


    BLESS the LORD, O my soul:
    And all that is within me, bless his holy name.
    Bless the LORD, O my soul,
    And forget not all his benefits:
    Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
    Who healeth all thy diseases;
    Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
    Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
    Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things;
    So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
    The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment
    For all that are oppressed.
    He made known his ways unto Moses,
    His acts unto the children of Israel.
    The LORD is merciful and gracious,
    Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
    He will not always chide:
    Neither will he keep his anger for ever.
    He hath not dealt with us after our sins;
    Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
    For as the heaven is high above the earth,
    So great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
    As far as the east is from the west,
    So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
    Like as a father pitieth his children,
    So the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
    For he knoweth our frame;
    He remembereth that we are dust.
    As for man, his days are as grass:
    As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
    For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
    And the place thereof shall know it no more.
    But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon
        them that fear him,
    And his righteousness unto children's children;
    To such as keep his covenant,
    And to those that remember his commandments to do them.
    The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens;
    And his kingdom ruleth over all.
    Bless the LORD, ye his angels,
    That excel in strength, that do his
    commandments,
    Hearkening unto the voice of his word.
    Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts;
    Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
    Bless the LORD, all his works
    In all places of his dominion:
    Bless the LORD, O my soul.




PSALM 104


    BLESS the LORD, O my soul.
    O LORD my God, thou art very great;
    Thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
    Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment:
    Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
    Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters:
    Who maketh the clouds his chariot:
    Who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
    Who maketh his angels spirits;
    His ministers a flaming fire:
    Who laid the foundations of the earth,
    That it should not be removed for ever.
    Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:
    The waters stood above the mountains.
    At thy rebuke they fled;
    At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
    They go up by the mountains;
    They go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded
        for them.
    Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
    That they turn not again to cover the earth.
    He sendeth the springs into the valleys,
    Which run among the hills.
    They give drink to every beast of the field:
    The wild asses quench their thirst.
    By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
    Which sing among the branches.
    He watereth the hills from his chambers:
    The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
    He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
    And herb for the service of man:
    That he may bring forth food out of the earth;
    And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
    And oil to make his face to shine,
    And bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
    The trees of the LORD are full of sap;
    The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
    Where the birds make their nests:
    As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
    The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;
    And the rocks for the conies.
    He appointed the moon for seasons:
    The sun knoweth his going down.
    Thou makest darkness, and it is night:
    Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
    The young lions roar after their prey,
    And seek their meat from God.
    The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together,
    And lay them down in their dens.
    Man goeth forth unto his work
    And to his labour until the evening.
    O LORD, how manifold are thy works!
    In wisdom hast thou made them all:
    The earth is full of thy riches.
    So is this great and wide sea,
    Wherein are things creeping innumerable,
    Both small and great beasts.
    There go the ships:
    There is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
    These wait all upon thee;
    That thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
    That thou givest them they gather:
    Thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
    Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled:
    Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
    Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created:
    And thou renewest the face of the earth.
    The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever:
    The LORD shall rejoice in his works.
    He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth:
    He toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
    I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live:
    I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
    My meditation of him shall be sweet:
    I will be glad in the LORD.
    Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth,
    And let the wicked be no more.
    Bless thou the LORD, O my soul.
    Praise ye the LORD.




PSALM 107


    O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is good:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
    Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
    And gathered them out of the lands,
    From the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
    They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way;
    They found no city to dwell in.
    Hungry and thirsty,
    Their soul fainted in them.
    Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
    And he delivered them out of their distresses.
    And he led them forth by the right way,
    That they might go to a city of habitation.
    Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
    And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
    For he satisfieth the longing soul,
    And filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
    Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
    Being bound in affliction and iron;
    Because they rebelled against the words of God,
    And contemned the counsel of the most High:
    Therefore he brought down their heart with labour;
    They fell down, and there was none to help.
    Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
    And he saved them out of their distresses.
    He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
    And brake their bands in sunder.
    Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
    And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
    For he hath broken the gates of brass,
    And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
    Fools because of their transgression,
    And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
    Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat;
    And they draw near unto the gates of death.
    Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
    And he saveth them out of their distresses.
    He sent his word, and healed them,
    And delivered them from their destructions.
    Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
    And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
    And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
    And declare his works with rejoicing.
    They that go down to the sea in ships,
    That do business in great waters;
    These see the works of the LORD,
    And his wonders in the deep.
    For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
    Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
    They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
    Their soul is melted because of trouble.
    They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
    And are at their wit's end.
    Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
    And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
    He maketh the storm a calm,
    So that the waves thereof are still.
    Then are they glad because they be quiet;
    So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
    Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
    And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
    Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
    And praise him in the assembly of the elders.
    He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
    And the watersprings into dry ground;
    A fruitful land into barrenness,
    For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
    He turneth the wilderness into a standing water,
    And dry ground into watersprings.
    And there he maketh the hungry to dwell,
    That they may prepare a city for habitation;
    And sow the fields, and plant vineyards,
    Which may yield fruits of increase.
    He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
    And suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
    Again, they are minished and brought low
    Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
    He poureth contempt upon princes,
    And causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
    Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction,
    And maketh him families like a flock.
    The righteous shall see it, and rejoice:
    And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
    Whoso is wise, and will observe these things,
    Even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.




PSALM 111


    PRAISE ye the LORD.
    I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
    In the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
    The works of the LORD are great,
    Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
    His work is honourable and glorious:
    And his righteousness endureth for ever.
    He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:
    The LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
    He hath given meat unto them that fear him:
    He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
    He hath shewed his people the power of his works,
    That he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
    The works of his hands are verity and judgment;
    All his commandments are sure.
    They stand fast for ever and ever,
    And are done in truth and uprightness.
    He sent redemption unto his people:
    He hath commanded his covenant for ever:
    Holy and reverend is his name.
    The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom:
    A good understanding have all they that do his commandments:
    His praise endureth for ever.




PSALM 116


    I LOVE the LORD, because he hath heard
    My voice and my supplications.
    Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,
    Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
    The sorrows of death compassed me,
    And the pains of hell gat hold upon me:
    I found trouble and sorrow.
    Then called I upon the name of the LORD;
    O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
    Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;
    Yea, our God is merciful.
    The LORD preserveth the simple:
    I was brought low, and he helped me.
    Return unto thy rest, O my soul;
    For the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
    For thou hast delivered my soul from death,
    Mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
    I will walk before the LORD
    In the land of the living.
    I believed, therefore have I spoken:
    I was greatly afflicted:
    I said in my haste,
    All men are liars.
    What shall I render unto the LORD
    For all his benefits toward me?
    I will take the cup of salvation,
    And call upon the name of the LORD.
    I will pay my vows unto the LORD now
    In the presence of all his people.
    Precious in the sight of the LORD
    Is the death of his saints.
    O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant,
    And the son of thine handmaid:
    Thou hast loosed my bonds.
    I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
    And will call upon the name of the LORD.
    I will pay my vows unto the LORD now
    In the presence of all his people,
    In the courts of the LORD'S house,
    In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
    Praise ye the LORD.




PSALM 118


    O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
    Because his mercy endureth for ever.
    Let Israel now say,
    That his mercy endureth for ever.
    Let the house of Aaron now say,
    That his mercy endureth for ever.
    Let them now that fear the LORD say,
    That his mercy endureth for ever.
    I called upon the LORD in distress:
    The LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.
    The LORD is on my side; I will not fear:
    What can man do unto me?
    The LORD taketh my part with them that help me:
    Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
    It is better to trust in the LORD
    Than to put confidence in man.
    It is better to trust in the LORD
    Than to put confidence in princes.
    All nations compassed me about:
    But in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
    They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about:
    But in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
    They compassed me about like bees;
    They are quenched as the fire of thorns:
    For in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
    Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall:
    But the LORD helped me....




PSALM 121


    I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills,
    From whence cometh my help.
    My help cometh from the LORD,
    Which made heaven and earth.
    He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
    He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
    Behold, he that keepeth Israel
    Shall neither slumber nor sleep.
    The LORD is thy keeper:
    The LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.
    The sun shall not smite thee by day,
    Nor the moon by night.
    The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil:
    He shall preserve thy soul.
    The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in
    From this time forth, and even for evermore.




PSALM 136


    O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    O give thanks unto the God of gods:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    O give thanks to the Lord of lords:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him who alone doeth great wonders:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him that by wisdom made the heavens:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him that stretched out the earth above the waters:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him that made great lights:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    The sun to rule by day:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    The moon and stars to rule by night:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    And brought out Israel from among them:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him which divided the Red sea into parts:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    And made Israel to pass through the midst of it:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him which led his people through the wilderness:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    To him which smote great kings:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    And slew famous kings:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    Sihon king of the Amorites:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    And Og the king of Bashan:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    And gave their land for an heritage:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    Even an heritage unto Israel his servant:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    Who remembered us in our low estate:
    For his mercy endureth for ever:
    And hath redeemed us from our enemies:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    Who giveth food to all flesh:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.
    O give thanks unto the God of heaven:
    For his mercy endureth for ever.




PSALM 138


    I WILL praise thee with my whole heart:
    Before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
    I will worship toward thy holy temple,
    And praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth:
    For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
    In the day when I cried thou answeredst me,
    And strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
    All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD,
    When they hear the words of thy mouth.
    Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD:
    For great is the glory of the LORD.
    Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
    But the proud he knoweth afar off.
    Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
    Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies,
    And thy right hand shall save me.
    The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me:
    Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever:
    Forsake not the works of thine own hands.




PSALM 139


    O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.
    Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,
    Thou understandest my thought afar off.
    Thou compassest my path and my lying down,
    And art acquainted with all my ways.
    For there is not a word in my tongue,
    But, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
    Thou hast beset me behind and before,
    And laid thine hand upon me.
    Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
    It is high, I cannot attain unto it.
    Whither shall I go from thy spirit?
    Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
    If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
    If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
    If I take the wings of the morning,
    And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
    Even there shall thy hand lead me,
    And thy right hand shall hold me.
    If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me;
    Even the night shall be light about me.
    Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee;
    But the night shineth as the day:
    The darkness and the light are both alike to thee....
    I will praise thee;
    For I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
    Marvellous are thy works;
    And that my soul knoweth right well....
    Search me, O God, and know my heart:
    Try me, and know my thoughts:
    And see if there be any wicked way in me,
    And lead me in the way everlasting.




PSALM 145


    I WILL extol thee, my God, O king;
    And I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
    Every day will I bless thee;
    And I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
    Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
    And his greatness is unsearchable.
    One generation shall praise thy works to another,
    And shall declare thy mighty acts.
    I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty,
    And of thy wondrous works.
    And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts:
    And I will declare thy greatness.
    They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
    And shall sing of thy righteousness.
    The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion;
    Slow to anger, and of great mercy.
    The LORD is good to all:
    And his tender mercies are over all his works.
    All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD;
    And thy saints shall bless thee.
    They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,
    And talk of thy power;
    To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts,
    And the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
    Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
    And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
    The LORD upholdeth all that fall,
    And raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
    The eyes of all wait upon thee;
    And thou givest them their meat in due season.
    Thou openest thine hand,
    And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
    The LORD is righteous in all his ways,
    And holy in all his works.
    The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him,
    To all that call upon him in truth.
    He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him:
    He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
    The LORD preserveth all them that love him:
    But all the wicked will he destroy.
    My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD:
    And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.




PSALM 146


    PRAISE ye the LORD.
    Praise the LORD, O my soul.
    While I live will I praise the LORD:
    I will sing praises unto my God while
    I have any being.
    Put not your trust in princes,
    Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
    His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth;
    In that very day his thoughts perish.
    Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,
    Whose hope is in the LORD his God:
    Which made heaven, and earth,
    The sea, and all that therein is:
    Which keepeth truth for ever:
    Which executeth judgment for the oppressed:
    Which giveth food to the hungry.
    The LORD looseth the prisoners:
    The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind:
    The LORD raiseth them that are bowed down:
    The LORD loveth the righteous:
    The LORD preserveth the strangers;
    He relieveth the fatherless and widow:
    But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
    The LORD shall reign for ever,
    Even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations.
    Praise ye the LORD.




PSALM 147


    PRAISE ye the LORD:
    For it is good to sing praises unto our God;
    For it is pleasant; and praise is comely.
    The LORD doth build up Jerusalem:
    He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
    He healeth the broken in heart,
    And bindeth up their wounds.
    He telleth the number of the stars;
    He calleth them all by their names.
    Great is our Lord, and of great power:
    His understanding is infinite.
    The LORD lifteth up the meek:
    He casteth the wicked down to the ground.
    Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving;
    Sing praise upon the harp unto our God:
    Who covereth the heaven with clouds,
    Who prepareth rain for the earth,
    Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
    He giveth to the beast his food,
    And to the young ravens which cry.
    He delighteth not in the strength of the horse:
    He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
    The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him,
    In those that hope in his mercy.
    Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem;
    Praise thy God, O Zion.
    For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates;
    He hath blessed thy children within thee.
    He maketh peace in thy borders,
    And filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
    He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth:
    His word runneth very swiftly.
    He giveth snow like wool:
    He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
    He casteth forth his ice like morsels:
    Who can stand before his cold?
    He sendeth out his word, and melteth them:
    He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
    He sheweth his word unto Jacob,
    His statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
    He hath not dealt so with any nation:
    And as for his judgments, they have not known them.
    Praise ye the LORD.




PSALM 148


    PRAISE ye the LORD.
    Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:
    Praise him in the heights.
    Praise ye him, all his angels:
    Praise ye him, all his hosts.
    Praise ye him, sun and moon:
    Praise him, all ye stars of light.
    Praise him, ye heavens of heavens,
    And ye waters that be above the heavens.
    Let them praise the name of the LORD:
    For he commanded, and they were created.
    He hath also stablished them for ever and ever:
    He hath made a decree which shall not pass.
    Praise the LORD from the earth,
    Ye dragons, and all deeps:
    Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours;
    Stormy wind fulfilling his word:
    Mountains, and all hills;
    Fruitful trees, and all cedars:
    Beasts, and all cattle;
    Creeping things, and flying fowl:
    Kings of the earth, and all people;
    Princes, and all judges of the earth:
    Both young men, and maidens;
    Old men, and children:
    Let them praise the name of the LORD:
    For his name alone is excellent;
    His glory is above the earth and heaven.
    He also exalteth the horn of his people,
    The praise of all his saints;
    Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him.
    Praise ye the LORD.




PSALM 150


    PRAISE ye the LORD.
    Praise God in his sanctuary:
    Praise him in the firmament of his power.
    Praise him for his mighty acts:
    Praise him according to his excellent greatness.
    Praise him with the sound of the trumpet:
    Praise him with the psaltery and harp.
    Praise him with the timbrel and dance:
    Praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
    Praise him upon the loud cymbals:
    Praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
    Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD.
    Praise ye the LORD.

THE proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.

    The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge:
    But fools despise wisdom and instruction.
    My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
    And forsake not the law of thy mother:
    For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,
    And chains about thy neck.
    My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
    Let not mercy and truth forsake thee:
    Bind them about thy neck;
    Write them upon the table of thine heart:
    So shalt thou find favour and good understanding
    In the sight of God and man.
    Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
    And lean not unto thine own understanding.
    In all thy ways acknowledge him,
    And he shall direct thy paths.
    Be not wise in thine own eyes:
    Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
    My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;
    Neither be weary of his correction:
    For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth;
    Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
    Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,
    And the man that getteth understanding.
    For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,
    And the gain thereof than fine gold.
    She is more precious than rubies:
    And all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
    Length of days is in her right hand;
    And in her left hand riches and honour.
    Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
    And all her paths are peace.
    Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom:
    And with all thy getting get understanding.
    Exalt her, and she shall promote thee:
    She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
    She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace:
    A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
    The path of the just is as the shining light,
    That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
    The way of the wicked is as darkness:
    They know not at what they stumble.
    Keep thy heart with all diligence;
    For out of it are the issues of life.
    Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
    Consider her ways, and be wise:
    Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
    Provideth her meat in the summer,
    And gathereth her food in the harvest.
    How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?
    When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
    Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
    A little folding of the hands to sleep:
    So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth,
    And thy want as an armed man.
    These six things doth the LORD hate:
    Yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
    A proud look, a lying tongue,
    And hands that shed innocent blood,
    An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,
    Feet that be swift in running to mischief,
    A false witness that speaketh lies,
    And he that soweth discord among brethren.
    Doth not wisdom cry?
    And understanding put forth her voice?
    She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city,
    At the coming in at the doors.
    Unto you, O men, I call;
    And my voice is to the sons of man.
    Wisdom is better than rubies;
    And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
    I love them that love me;
    And those that seek me early shall find me.
    Riches and honour are with me;
    Yea, durable riches and righteousness.
    The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way,
    Before his works of old.
    I was set up from everlasting,
    From the beginning, or ever the earth was.
    When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
    When there were no fountains abounding with water.
    Before the mountains were settled,
    Before the hills was I brought forth:
    While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
    Nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
    When he prepared the heavens, I was there:
    When he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
    When he established the clouds above:
    When he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
    When he gave to the sea his decree,
    That the waters should not pass his commandment:
    When he appointed the foundations of the earth:
    Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:
    And I was daily his delight,
    Rejoicing always before him;
    Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;
    And my delights were with the sons of men.
    Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children:
    For blessed are they that keep my ways.
    Hear instruction, and be wise,
    And refuse it not.
    Blessed is the man that heareth me,
    Watching daily at my gates,
    Waiting at the posts of my doors.
    For whoso findeth me findeth life,
    And shall obtain favour of the LORD.
    But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:
    All they that hate me love death.
    The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom:
    And the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
    A wise son maketh a glad father:
    But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
    He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand:
    But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
    Hatred stirreth up strifes:
    But love covereth all sins.
    He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction:
    But he that refuseth reproof erreth.
    He that hideth hatred with lying lips,
    And he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.
    In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin:
    But he that refraineth his lips is wise.
    The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich,
    And he addeth no sorrow with it.
    When pride cometh, then cometh shame:
    But with the lowly is wisdom.
    A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast:
    But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
    The way of a fool is right in his own eyes:
    But he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.
    The lip of truth shall be established for ever:
    But a lying tongue is but for a moment.
    Lying lips are abomination to the LORD:
    But they that deal truly are his delight.
    He that walketh with wise men shall be wise:
    But a companion of fools shall be destroyed.
    He that spareth his rod hateth his son:
    But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.
    He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth:
    But he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.
    A soft answer turneth away wrath:
    But grievous words stir up anger.
    The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
    Beholding the evil and the good.
    A fool despiseth his father's instruction:
    But he that regardeth reproof is prudent.
    Better is little with the fear of the LORD,
    Than great treasure and trouble therewith.
    Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,
    Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
    Pride goeth before destruction,
    And an haughty spirit before a fall.
    Pleasant words are as an honeycomb,
    Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
    The hoary head is a crown of glory,
    If it be found in the way of righteousness.
    He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
    And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
    Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:
    And he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
    Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
    Evil shall not depart from his house.
    The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
    Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
    A friend loveth at all times,
    And a brother is born for adversity.
    A merry heart doeth good like a medicine:
    But a broken spirit drieth the bones.
    He also that is slothful in his work
    Is brother to him that is a great waster.
    Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
    And an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
    Even a child is known by his doings,
    Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
    Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
    His lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
    To do justice and judgment
    Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
    Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
    He also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
    He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man:
    He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
    Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
    Keepeth his soul from troubles.
    A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,
    And loving favour rather than silver and gold.
    The rich and poor meet together:
    The LORD is the maker of them all.
    Train up a child in the way he should go:
    And when he is old, he will not depart from it.
    He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
    For he giveth of his bread to the poor.
    Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child;
    But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
    Rob not the poor, because he is poor:
    Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate.
    Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,
    And despise not thy mother when she is old.
    Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
    When it giveth his colour in the cup,
    When it moveth itself aright.
    At the last it biteth like a serpent,
    And stingeth like an adder.
    Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
    And let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth.
    If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
    And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
    For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
    And the LORD shall reward thee.
    Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
    There is more hope of a fool than of him.
    Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:
    And he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
    Boast not thyself of to morrow;
    For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
    Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
    A stranger, and not thine own lips.
    Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.
    A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself;
    But the simple pass on, and are punished.
    Iron sharpeneth iron;
    So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
    Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof:
    So he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
    As in water face answereth to face,
    So the heart of man to man.
    The wicked flee when no man pursueth:
    But the righteous are bold as a lion.
    Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness,
    Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
    Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son:
    But he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.
    He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
    Even his prayer shall be abomination.
    Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way,
    He shall fall himself into his own pit:
    But the upright shall have good things in possession.
    He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
    But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.
    Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved:
    But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
    He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
    But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
    He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour
    Than he that flattereth with the tongue.
    Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
        transgression;
    The same is the companion of a destroyer.
    He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:
    But he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
    He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
    But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
    He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack:
    But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
    He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck,
    Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
    When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice:
    But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
    A man that flattereth his neighbour
    Spreadeth a net for his feet.
    The righteous considereth the cause of the poor:
    But the wicked regardeth not to know it.
    If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man,
    Whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.
    A fool uttereth all his mind:
    But a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.
    Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words?
    There is more hope of a fool than of him.
    An angry man stirreth up strife,
    And a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
    A man's pride shall bring him low:
    But honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.
    Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul:
    He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.
    The fear of man bringeth a snare:
    But whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.
    Every word of God is pure:
    He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.



CHAPTER 138

REMEMBER THY CREATOR


[Sidenote: Ecclesiastes 12]

    REMEMBER now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,
    While the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh,
    When thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
    While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
        darkened,
    Nor the clouds return after the rain:
    In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
    And the strong men shall bow themselves,
    And the grinders cease because they are few,
    And those that look out of the windows be darkened,
    And the doors shall be shut in the streets,
    When the sound of the grinding is low,
    And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,
    And all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;
    Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high,
    And fears shall be in the way,
    And the almond tree shall flourish,
    And the grasshopper shall be a burden,
    And desire shall fail:
    Because man goeth to his long home,
    and the mourners go about the streets:
    Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken,
    Or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at
        the cistern.
    Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was:
    And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

[Sidenote: Ecclesiastes 12]

Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his
commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring
every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good,
or whether it be evil.

BOOK XIII--THE PROPHETS




CHAPTER 139

PROPHECIES OF ISAIAH


THE vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
kings of Judah. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD
hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's
crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. Come
now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be
as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
crimson, they shall be as wool.

And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the
LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion
shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. And
he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and
they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us
walk in the light of the LORD.

Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin
shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and
choose the good. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil,
and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
both her kings.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 9]

The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that
dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
shined. Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there
shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to
order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform
this.

And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch
shall grow out of his roots: and the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon
him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel
and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; and
shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he
shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the
hearing of his ears: but with righteousness shall he judge the poor,
and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite
the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips
shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his
loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall
dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and
the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little
child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young
ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned
child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. They shall not hurt
nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for
an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest
shall be glorious. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not
be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also
is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out
of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Praise the
LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make
mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done
excellent things: this is known in all the earth. Cry out and shout,
thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the
midst of thee. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD
will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people
shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.
And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited
for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him,
we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a
strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. Open ye
the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter
in. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the
LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength: for he bringeth down them that
dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even
to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. The foot shall tread it
down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. The way
of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of
the just. Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance
of thee. With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in
the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.

Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a
stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he
that believeth shall not make haste. Behold, a king shall reign in
righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. And a man shall be
as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as
rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a
weary land. And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the
ears of them that hear shall hearken. The heart also of the rash shall
understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready
to speak plainly.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 26]

Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near,
acknowledge my might. The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath
surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring
fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He that
walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain
of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that
stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from
seeing evil; he shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.
Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land
that is very far off.

The LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king;
he will save us.

The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the
desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. Strengthen ye the weak
hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful
heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance,
even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.

Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the
tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out,
and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool,
and the thirsty land springs of water.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 40]

And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with
songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and
gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.




CHAPTER 140

PROMISES OF THE MESSIAH AND OF GOSPEL GRACE


COMFORT ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably
to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that
her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD'S hand
double for all her sins.

The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every
valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low:
and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
and the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see
it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. The voice said,
Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the
goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: the grass withereth,
the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it:
surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but
the word of our God shall stand for ever.

O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice
with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah,
Behold your God! Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and
his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his
work before him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall
gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
gently lead those that are with young.

Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted
out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in
a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
balance? Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a
very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing; and they are
counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto
him? Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you
from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of
the earth? It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and
the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the
heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
that bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth
as vanity. To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith
the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created
these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them
all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in
power; not one faileth. Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O
Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over
from my God?

Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the
LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is
weary? there is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to
the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even
the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly
fall: but they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be
weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. When the poor and needy seek
water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the
LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will
open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys:
I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of
water. I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and
the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree,
and the pine, and the box tree together: that they may see, and know,
and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath
done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.

Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth
judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his
voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and
the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment
unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 41]

Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched
them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of
it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them
that walk therein: I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and
will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant
of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to
bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness
out of the prison house. I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory
will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. Behold,
the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before
they spring forth I tell you of them. Sing unto the LORD a new song,
and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea,
and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. Let
the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages
that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let
them shout from the top of the mountains. Let them give glory unto the
LORD, and declare his praise in the islands. The LORD shall go forth
as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall
cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. I have long time
holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will
I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once. I
will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I
will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. And I will
bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths
that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and
crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not
forsake them.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 43]

But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that
formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have
called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the
waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not
overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be
burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the LORD thy
God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. Since thou wast precious in
my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore
will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. Fear not: for I am
with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from
the west; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the
earth; even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him
for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have
ears. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be
assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things?
let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or
let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith the
LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe
me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed,
neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside
me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have
shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my
witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God. Yea, before the day was I am
he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and
who shall let it?

Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have
formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten
of me. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. Sing,
O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the
earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree
therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in
Israel. Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, I am the LORD that maketh
all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth
abroad the earth by myself; that frustrateth the tokens of the liars,
and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh
their knowledge foolish; that confirmeth the word of his servant, and
performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem,
Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be
built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof: that saith to
the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: that saith of Cyrus,
He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to
Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall
be laid. I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak
righteousness, I declare things that are right. Assemble yourselves
and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they
have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray
unto a god that cannot save. Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let
them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time?
who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no
God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.
Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God,
and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out
of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every
knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Surely, shall one say, in the
LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and
all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. In the LORD shall
all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory. Behold, I have
refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace
of affliction. O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then
had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
the sea. There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked. Sing,
O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O
mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy
upon his afflicted. But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my
Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she
should not have compassion on her son? yea, they may forget, yet will I
not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands;
thy walls are continually before me. For the LORD shall comfort Zion:
he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness
like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness
shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 45]

Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a
law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a
light of the people. My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone
forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon
me, and on mine arm shall they trust. Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like
smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell
therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever,
and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart
is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of
their revilings. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the
worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever,
and my salvation from generation to generation.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 52]

Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the
ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut
Rahab, and wounded the dragon? Art thou not it which hath dried the
sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the
sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? Therefore the redeemed of the
LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting
joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and
sorrow and mourning shall flee away. I, even I, am he that comforteth
you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall
die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; and forgettest
the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the
foundations of the earth?




CHAPTER 141

GOOD TIDINGS


HOW beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good,
that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!
Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem:
for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.
Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
extolled, and be very high. As many were astonied at thee; his visage
was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of
men: so shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their
mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see;
and that which they had not heard shall they consider.

Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD
revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as
a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when
we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is
despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and
we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have
turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the
iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he
opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and
as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his
generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the
transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with
the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no
violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the LORD
to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul
an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days,
and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of
the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall
my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall
divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul
unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the
sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath
no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without
money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which
is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken
diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear,
and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with
you, even the sure mercies of David.

Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is
near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon
him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. For my thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain
cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but
watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give
seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: so shall my word be that
goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it
shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing
whereto I sent it. For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with
peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. Instead
of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall
come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an
everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 55]

Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation
is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the
man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that
keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing
any evil. Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls
a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give
them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. Also the sons of
the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to
love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth
the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even
them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house
of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted
upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for
all people.

[Sidenote: Isaiah 57]

For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose
name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is
of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble,
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. For I will not contend
for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail
before me, and the souls which I have made. I have seen his ways, and
will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and
to his mourners. Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that
is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him. But the wicked are like
the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and
dirt. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. Wherefore have we
fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our
soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye
find pleasure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fast for strife
and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast
as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.

Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his
soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth
and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable
day to the LORD? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose
the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the
oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy
bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to
thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that
thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break
forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and
thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be
thy rereward.

If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure
on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD,
honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding
thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou
delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the
high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy
father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen
upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory
shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and
kings to the brightness of thy rising.

The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall
the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an
everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.

The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed
me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening
of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year
of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all
that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto
them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of
righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.

I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God;
for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered
me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself
with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. For
as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the
things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause
righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of
the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the
great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on
them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his
lovingkindnesses. For he said, Surely they are my people, children that
will not lie: so he was their Saviour. In all their affliction he was
afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in
his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the
days of old.




CHAPTER 142

WORDS OF JEREMIAH


[Sidenote: Jeremiah 1]

THE words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, to whom the word of the LORD
came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah. It came
also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, unto the end of the
eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the
carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.

Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families
of the house of Israel: thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your
fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked
after vanity, and are become vain? For my people have committed two
evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed
them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the
turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming;
but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.

Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is
not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? Oh that my head
were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day
and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

[Sidenote: Jeremiah 18]

Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man
glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that
he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise
lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these
things I delight, saith the LORD.

Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may
ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.




CHAPTER 143

THE POTTER'S VESSEL


THE word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, Arise, and go
down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my
words. Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought
a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in
the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed
good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith
the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in
mine hand, O house of Israel. At what instant I shall speak concerning
a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down,
and to destroy it; if that nation, against whom I have pronounced,
turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do
unto them. And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation,
and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; if it do evil in
my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good,
wherewith I said I would benefit them.

Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of
the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests; and go
forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of
the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee, and
say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants
of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,
I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his
ears shall tingle. Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the
men that go with thee, and shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh
a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury
them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.

Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in
the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.
Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that
were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah
out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, Thou, Pashur, and all
that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come
to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou,
and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, Thus speaketh the
LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken
unto thee in a book. For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I
will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the
LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their
fathers, and they shall possess it.

The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee
with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn
thee.

Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles
afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep
him, as a shepherd doth his flock.

Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according
to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took
them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my
covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the
LORD: but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and
they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his
neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they
shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
their sin no more.

[Sidenote: Jeremiah 37]

Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good
thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house
of Judah. In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and
righteousness in the land. In those days shall Judah be saved, and
Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall
be called, The LORD our righteousness.




CHAPTER 144

JEREMIAH IS PERSECUTED


AND it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken
up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, then Jeremiah went
forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate
himself thence in the midst of the people. And when he was in the gate
of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah;
and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the
Chaldeans. Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and
brought him to the princes. Wherefore the princes were wroth with
Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan
the scribe: for they had made that the prison. [Sidenote: Ezekiel 1]

When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and
had remained there many days, Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out:
and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any
word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou
shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. Then Zedekiah
the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of
the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out
of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. So
Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem
was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

And Jeremiah wrote these words in his lamentations: It is of the LORD'S
mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh
him. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
salvation of the LORD. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in
his youth. He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne
it upon him. He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be
hope. He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
with reproach.

For the Lord will not cast off for ever: but though he cause grief, yet
will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. For
he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his
sins? Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. Let
us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.




CHAPTER 145

EZEKIEL AMONG THE CAPTIVES


NOW it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the
fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of
Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. And
he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak
unto thee. And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and
set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. And he said
unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a
rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers
have transgressed against me, even unto this very day. Therefore say,
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the
heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet
will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they
shall come. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather
you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye
have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. And I will
give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will
take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart
of flesh: that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances,
and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the
Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision
that I had seen went up from me. Then I spake unto them of the
captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.




CHAPTER 146

EVERY MAN JUDGED BY HIS OWN ACTIONS


THE word of the LORD came again to me, saying, Son of man, when the
land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch
out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof,
and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should
deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.
If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it,
so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the
beasts: though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be
delivered, but the land shall be desolate. Or if I bring a sword upon
that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man
and beast from it: though these three men were in it, as I live, saith
the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they
only shall be delivered themselves. Or if I send a pestilence into that
land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and
beast: though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the
Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but
deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

[Sidenote: Ezekiel 14]

The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, What mean ye, that ye
use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers
have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? As I
live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use
this proverb in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the
father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it
shall die. But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
and hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge,
hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and
hath covered the naked with a garment; he that hath not given forth
upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his
hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,
hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly;
he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.

If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that
doeth not any of those duties, shall he then live? he shall not live;
he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. Now, lo, if he
beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and
considereth, and doeth not such like, but hath given his bread to the
hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, that hath executed
my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the
iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. Yet say ye, Why? doth not
the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that
which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done
them, he shall surely live. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The
son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father
bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall
be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. But if
the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep
all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely
live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed,
they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath
done he shall live. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should
die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways,
and live? But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,
and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations
that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that
he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath
trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.

[Sidenote: Ezekiel 37]

Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to
his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your
transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you
all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a
new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For
I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD:
wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.




CHAPTER 147

THE VALLEY OF DRY BONES


THE hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of
the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of
bones, and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there
were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. And he
said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord
GOD, thou knowest. Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones,
and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. Thus
saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to
enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and
will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath
in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. So I
prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise,
and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and
the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. Then said
he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to
the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath,
and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as he
commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood
up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.

Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of
Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we
are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and
cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land
of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened
your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, and
shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in
your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and
performed it, saith the LORD.




CHAPTER 148

DANIEL AND HIS THREE FRIENDS


IN the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. And
the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the
vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar
to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure
house of his god. And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his
eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of
the king's seed, and of the princes; children in whom was no blemish,
but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge,
and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand
in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the
tongue of the Chaldeans. Now among these were of the children of Judah,
Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: unto whom the prince of the
eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar;
and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to
Azariah, of Abed-nego.

[Sidenote: Daniel 1]

As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all
learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and
dreams. Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before
Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed with them; and among them all was
found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood
they before the king. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding,
that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all
the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.




CHAPTER 149

NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S DREAM


[Sidenote: Daniel 2]

AND in the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams,
wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then
the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the
sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they
came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have
dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then
spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever:
tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. The
king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me:
if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a
dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew
me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and
said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the
interpretation of it. The king answered and said, I know of certainty
that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from
me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one
decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak
before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream,
and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. The
Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon
the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king,
lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer,
or Chaldean. And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there
is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose
dwelling is not with flesh.

For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to
destroy all the wise men of Babylon. And the decree went forth that
the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows
to be slain. Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch
the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise
men of Babylon, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch
made the thing known to Daniel. Then Daniel went in, and desired of
the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king
the interpretation. Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing
known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: that they
would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that
Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men
of Babylon.

Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel
blessed the God of heaven. Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the
name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: and he
changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up
kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know
understanding: he revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what
is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee, and
praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and
might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for
thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.

Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to
destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him;
Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and
I will shew unto the king the interpretation. Then Arioch brought
in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have
found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the
king the interpretation. The king answered and said to Daniel, whose
name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream
which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? Daniel answered in
the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath
demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the
soothsayers, shew unto the king; but there is a God in heaven that
revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what
shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head
upon thy bed, are these; as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into
thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that
revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. But as
for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have
more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the
interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of
thy heart.

[Sidenote: Daniel 2]

Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose
brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was
terrible. This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms
of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his
feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was
cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were
of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the
clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together,
and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind
carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that
smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before
the king.

Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given
thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the
children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the
heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over
them all. Thou art this head of gold. And after thee shall arise
another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass,
which shall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall
be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth
all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in
pieces and bruise. And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of
potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but
there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou
sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were
part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong,
and partly broken. And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay,
they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not
cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. And in the
days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which
shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other
people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms,
and it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone
was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces
the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God
hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the
dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

[Sidenote: Daniel 3]

Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel,
and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto
him. The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that
your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of
secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. Then the king made
Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler
over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all
the wise men of Babylon. Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of
Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.




CHAPTER 150

THE THREE HEBREWS IN THE FURNACE


NEBUCHADNEZZAR the king made an image of gold, whose height was
threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up
in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. Then Nebuchadnezzar
the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the
captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs,
and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the
image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Then the princes, the
governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors,
the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered
together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had
set up. Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound of the
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of
musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar
the king hath set up: and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall
the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the
musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and
worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the
Jews. They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for
ever. Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear
the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer,
and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast
into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. There are certain Jews whom
thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they
serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was
changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake,
and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than
it was wont to be heated. And he commanded the most mighty men that
were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to
cast them into the burning fiery furnace. Then these men were bound
in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments,
and were cast into the midst of the furnace. Therefore because the
king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the
flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell
down bound into the midst of the fiery furnace. Then Nebuchadnezzar
the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto
his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the
fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. He answered
and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire,
and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of
God.

[Sidenote: Daniel 3]

Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye
servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors,
being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire
had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were
their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. Then
Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his
servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and
yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god,
except their own God. Therefore I make a decree, That every people,
nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their
houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can
deliver after this sort. Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.




CHAPTER 151

BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST


[Sidenote: Daniel 5]

BELSHAZZAR the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and
drank wine before the thousand. Whiles he tasted the wine, he commanded
to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar
had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and
his princes, and his wives, might drink therein. Then they brought the
golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God
which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, and his wives,
drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of
silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. In the same hour came
forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick
upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king
saw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the king's countenance was
changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins
were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. The king cried
aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers.
And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever
shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall
be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and
shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. Then came in all the king's
wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the
king the interpretation thereof. Then was king Belshazzar greatly
troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were
astonied.

Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came
into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for
ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be
changed: there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the
holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and
wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king
Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of
the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; forasmuch as
an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of
dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were
found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let
Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.

[Illustration: DANIEL'S VISION, BY REMBRANDT

IN THE BERLIN MUSEUM]

Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and
said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children
of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of
Jewry? I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in
thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found
in thee. And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought
in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known
unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the
interpretation of the thing: and I have heard of thee, that thou canst
make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the
writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt
be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and
shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to
thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing
unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. O thou king,
the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and
majesty, and glory, and honour: and for the majesty that he gave him,
all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him:
whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he
would he set up; and whom he would he put down. But when his heart was
lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his
kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: and he was driven
from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his
dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen,
and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most
high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it
whomsoever he will. And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled
thine heart, though thou knewest all this; but hast lifted up thyself
against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his
house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, and thy wives, have drunk
wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of
brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and
the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast
thou not glorified: then was the part of the hand sent from him; and
this writing was written. And this is the writing that was written,
MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation of the thing:
MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art
weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is
divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.

[Sidenote: Daniel 5]

Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and
put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning
him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And
Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two
years old.




CHAPTER 152

DANIEL IN THE LIONS' DEN


[Sidenote: Daniel 6]

IT pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; and over these three
presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give
accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. Then this
Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an
excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over
the whole realm. Then the presidents and princes sought to find
occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find
none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was
there any error or fault found in him. Then said these men, We shall
not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against
him concerning the law of his God. Then these presidents and princes
assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius,
live for ever. All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and
the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together
to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever
shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee,
O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish
the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to
the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. Wherefore king
Darius signed the writing and the decree.

Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his
house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he
kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks
before his God, as he did aforetime. Then these men assembled, and
found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. Then they
came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast
thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of
any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast
into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true,
according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of
the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor
the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a
day. Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with
himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured
till the going down of the sun to deliver him. Then these men assembled
unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of
the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king
establisheth may be changed. Then the king commanded, and they brought
Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said
unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver
thee. And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his
lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.

[Illustration: JONAH CAST TO THE WHALE, BY NICOLAS POUSSIN

IN THE ROYAL GALLERY AT WINDSOR]

Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither
were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from
him. Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste
unto the den of lions. And when he came to the den, he cried with a
lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel,
O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? Then said Daniel unto
the king, O king, live for ever. My God hath sent his angel, and hath
shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before
him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I
done no hurt. Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded
that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up
out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he
believed in his God.

And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused
Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children,
and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all
their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. Then
king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell
in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. I make a decree, That
in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God
of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his
kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be
even unto the end. He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs
and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the
power of the lions.

So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of
Cyrus the Persian.




CHAPTER 153

JONAH

[Sidenote: Jonah 1]

NOW the word of the LORD came unto Jonah, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh,
that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up
before me. But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence
of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to
Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go
with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.

But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty
tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then the
mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth
the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them.
But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was
fast asleep. So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What
meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God
will think upon us, that we perish not. And they said every one to his
fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause
this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this
evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what
is thy country? and of what people art thou? And he said unto them, I
am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made
the sea and the dry land. Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and
said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled
from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

[Sidenote: Jonah 2]

Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may
be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. And he said
unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the
sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest
is upon you. Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land;
but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against
them. Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O
LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay
not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased
thee. So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the
sea ceased from her raging. Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly,
and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah
was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. Then Jonah
prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly, and said, I cried
by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me. Salvation
is of the LORD. And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out
Jonah upon the dry land. And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the
second time, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and
preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went
unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an
exceeding great city of three days' journey. And Jonah began to enter
into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days,
and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put
on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne,
and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and
sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through
Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither
man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor
drink water: but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and
from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn
and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God
repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and
he did it not.

But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. And he
prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my
saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto
Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow
to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.
Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is
better for me to die than to live.

Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? So Jonah went out of
the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a
booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would
become of the city. And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to
come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver
him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. But God
prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the
gourd that it withered. And it came to pass, when the sun did arise,
that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head
of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It
is better for me to die than to live. And God said to Jonah, Doest thou
well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry,
even unto death. Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd,
for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which
came up in a night, and perished in a night: and should not I spare
Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand
persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left
hand; and also much cattle?




CHAPTER 154

ZECHARIAH'S PREDICTIONS CONCERNING CHRIST


[Sidenote: Zechariah 6]

THUS speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is
The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build
the temple of the LORD: even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and
he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he
shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be
between them both.

Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation;
lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. And
he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from
sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. In
that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. Awake,
O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow,
saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be
scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. And the LORD
shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD,
and his name one.




CHAPTER 155

MALACHI'S PROPHECY OF CHRIST


[Sidenote: Malachi 3]

BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before
me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even
the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall
come, saith the LORD of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming?
and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire,
and like fullers' sope: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier
of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as
gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in
righteousness.

For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day
that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall
leave them neither root nor branch.

But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves
of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be
ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this,
saith the LORD of hosts.

[Illustration]




BOOK I--THE BIRTH AND YOUTH OF JESUS




CHAPTER 1

THE ANNUNCIATION


IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made
by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him
was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in
darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest
named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. And they were both
righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances
of the Lord blameless. And they had no child, and they both were now
well stricken in years. And it came to pass, that while he executed the
priest's office before God in the order of his course, according to the
custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went
into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were
praying without at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an
angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.

[Illustration: THE VISITATION OF THE VIRGIN TO ST. ELIZABETH

BY ALBERTINELLI

IN THE UFFIZI GALLERY, FLORENCE]

But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is
heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt
call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many
shall rejoice at his birth. For he shall be great in the sight of the
Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be
filled with the Holy Ghost. And many of the children of Israel shall he
turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit
and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
prepared for the Lord.

And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am
an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. And the angel answering
said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and
am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. And,
behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that
these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words,
which shall be fulfilled in their season. And the people waited for
Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. And
when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that
he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and
remained speechless. And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of
his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city
of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly
favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And when
she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what
manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear
not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt
bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great,
and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give
unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the
house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then
said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be? And the angel answered and
said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which
shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. For with God
nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the
Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from
her.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 1]

And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with
haste, into a city of Juda; and entered into the house of Zacharias,
and saluted Elisabeth. And it came to pass, that when Elisabeth heard
the salutation of Mary, she spake out with a loud voice, and said,
Blessed art thou among women. And whence is this to me, that the mother
of my Lord should come to me? And Mary said,

    My soul doth magnify the Lord,
    And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
    For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden:
    For, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
    For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
    And holy is his name.
    And his mercy is on them that fear him
    From generation to generation.
    He hath shewed strength with his arm;
    He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
    He hath put down the mighty from their seats,
    And exalted them of low degree.
    He hath filled the hungry with good things;
    And the rich he hath sent empty away.
    He hath holpen his servant Israel,
    In remembrance of his mercy;
    As he spake to our fathers,
    To Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own
house.




CHAPTER 2

THE BIRTH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST


[Sidenote: St. Luke 1]

AND Elisabeth brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her cousins
heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced
with her. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of
his father. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be
called John. And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that
is called by this name. And they made signs to his father, how he would
have him called. And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying,
His name is John. And they marvelled all. And his mouth was opened
immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. And
fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings
were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. And all
they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner
of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.

And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
prophesied, saying,

    Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;
    For he hath visited and redeemed his people,
    And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us
    In the house of his servant David;
    As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
        since the world began:
    That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of
        all that hate us;
    To perform the mercy promised to our fathers,
    And to remember his holy covenant;
    The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
    That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the
        hand of our enemies
    Might serve him without fear,
    In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
    And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
    For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
    To give knowledge of salvation unto his people
    By the remission of their sins,
    Through the tender mercy of our God;
    Whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
    To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
    To guide our feet into the way of peace.

And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts
till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

CHAPTER 3

THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST


AND it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from
Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. And all went to
be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from
Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of
David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and
lineage of David:) to be taxed, with Mary his espoused wife, who was
great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days
were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth
her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him
in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 2]

And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord
came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and
they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for,
behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all
people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall
find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And
suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men. And it came to pass, as the angels were
gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another,
Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to
pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste,
and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when
they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them
concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those
things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these
things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and
seen, as it was told unto them. And when eight days were accomplished
for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS.




CHAPTER 4

SIMEON AND ANNA


AND, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;
and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of
Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed unto him
by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the
Lord's Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the
parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of
the law, then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

    Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
    According to thy word:
    For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
    Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
    A light to lighten the Gentiles,
    And the glory of thy people Israel.

And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken
of him. And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and
for a sign which shall be spoken against; (yea, a sword shall pierce
through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed.

And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the
tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband
seven years; and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years,
which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
prayers night and day. And she coming in that instant gave thanks
likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for
redemption in Jerusalem.




CHAPTER 5

THE WISE MEN OF THE EAST


NOW when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the
king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in
the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king had heard
these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he
had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together,
he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto
him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the
princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule
my people Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men,
enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent
them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young
child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may
come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed;
and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till
it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the
star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

[Illustration: THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST, BY FRANCIA

IN THE DRESDEN GALLERY]

And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with
Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they
had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they
should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country
another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring
thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. When he
arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed
into Egypt: and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of
Egypt have I called my son.

Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in
Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under,
according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great
mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted,
because they are not.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 2]

But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a
dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, and take the young child and
his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which
sought the young child's life. And he arose, and took the young child
and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard
that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he
was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a
dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: and he came and dwelt
in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.




CHAPTER 6

CHRIST FOUND IN THE TEMPLE


AND the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:
and the grace of God was upon him. Now his parents went to Jerusalem
every year at the feast of the passover. And when he was twelve years
old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when
they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried
behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. But
they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey;
and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And
when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking
him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the
temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and
asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his
understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed:
and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us?
behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto
them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my
Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake
unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and
man.




CHAPTER 7

JOHN BAPTIZES JESUS


[Sidenote: St. Luke 3]

THERE was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a
witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might
believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and
the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him
not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born,
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of
grace and truth.

In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate
being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, Annas and
Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the
son of Zacharias in the wilderness. And he came into all the country
about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of
sins; as it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,
saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and
every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be
made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; And all flesh
shall see the salvation of God. And the same John had his raiment of
camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was
locusts and wild honey. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea,
and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in
Jordan, confessing their sins. Then said he to the multitude that came
forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy
of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham
to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones
to raise up children unto Abraham. And now also the axe is laid unto
the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth
good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. And the people asked
him, saying, What shall we do then? He answereth and saith unto them,
He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he
that hath meat, let him do likewise. Then came also publicans to be
baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? And he said unto
them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. And the soldiers
likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said
unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be
content with your wages.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 3]

And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their
hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; John answered,
saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier
than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose:
he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: whose fan is
in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather
the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire
unquenchable. And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto
the people.

Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of
him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,
and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to
be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
suffered him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out
of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a
voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age.

BOOK II--THE PUBLIC MINISTRY OF JESUS




CHAPTER 8

THE TEMPTATION IN THE WILDERNESS


THEN was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he
was afterward an hungred. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If
thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he
answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone,
but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a
pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at
any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is
written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil
taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the
kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith unto him, All
these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written,
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered
unto him.




CHAPTER 9

DISCIPLES CALLED


THESE things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
baptizing. The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This
is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before
me: for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be
made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. And
John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like
a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent
me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt
see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which
baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bare record that this is
the Son of God. Again the next day after John stood, and two of his
disciples; and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the
Lamb of God! And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed
Jesus. Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,
What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being
interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and
see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for
it was about the tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak,
and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first findeth
his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias,
which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus.
And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona:
thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. The
day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip,
and saith unto him, Follow me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city
of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We
have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write,
Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can
there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come
and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him, Whence
knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip
called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael
answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art
the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said
unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt
see greater things than these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God
ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

[Sidenote: St. John 1]




CHAPTER 10

THE FIRST MIRACLE


[Sidenote: St. John 2]

AND the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
the mother of Jesus was there: and both Jesus was called, and his
disciples, to the marriage.

And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They
have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with
thee? mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith unto the servants,
Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of
the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear
unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine,
and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water
knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto
him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men
have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good
wine until now.

This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested
forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and
the changers of money sitting: and when he had made a scourge of small
cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the
oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; and
said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my
Father's house an house of merchandise. And his disciples remembered
that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. Then
answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us,
seeing that thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said unto them,
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said
the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt
thou rear it up in three days? But he spake of the temple of his body.
When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered
that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and
the word which Jesus had said.

Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many
believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. But
Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and
needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.




CHAPTER 11

NICODEMUS COMES TO JESUS BY NIGHT


THERE was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that
thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles
that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto
him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he
cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man
be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's
womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto
thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Jesus
answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest
not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do
know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye
believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up
to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which
is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his
Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him
might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the
name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation,
that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil
hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be
reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds
may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

[Sidenote: St. John 3]

After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. And John also was
baptizing in AEnon near to Salim, because there was much water there:
and they came, and were baptized. For John was not yet cast into
prison.

THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA


[Sidenote: St. John 4]

WHEN therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
made and baptized more disciples than John, (though Jesus himself
baptized not, but his disciples,) he left Judaea, and departed again
into Galilee. And he must needs go through Samaria. Then cometh he to a
city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus
therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and
it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. (For his disciples were
gone away unto the city to buy meat.)

Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a
Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have
no dealings with the Samaritans. Jesus answered and said unto her, If
thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me
to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
living water.

The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and
the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? Art
thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? Jesus answered and
said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never
thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of
water springing up into everlasting life.

The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
not, neither come hither to draw. Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy
husband, and come hither. The woman answered and said, I have no
husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy
husband: in that saidst thou truly. The woman saith unto him, Sir,
I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this
mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought
to worship. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh,
when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship
the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for
the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that
worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. The woman saith
unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he
is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak
unto thee am he.

And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with
the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou
with her? The woman then left her water-pot, and went her way into the
city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man, which told me all things
that ever I did: is not this the Christ? Then they went out of the
city, and came unto him.

In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. But he
said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. Therefore said
the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me,
and to finish his work. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then
cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on
the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth
receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he
that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. And herein is
that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. I sent you to reap
that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are
entered into their labours.

And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying
of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. So when
the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would
tarry with them: and he abode there two days. And many more believed
because of his own word; and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not
because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that
this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.




CHAPTER 13

THE NOBLEMAN'S SON


[Sidenote: St. John 4]

NOW when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed
into Galilee. For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no
honour in his own country. Then when he was come into Galilee, the
Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at
Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. So Jesus
came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.

And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. When
he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto
him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he
was at the point of death.

Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not
believe. The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed
the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,
saying, Thy son liveth. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began
to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the
fever left him. So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the
which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and
his whole house. This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when
he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.




CHAPTER 14

JESUS PREACHES AT NAZARETH


[Sidenote: St. Luke 4]

AND Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his
custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood
up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the
prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place
where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he
hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to
heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are
bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the
book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes
of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he
began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your
ears.

And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which
proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb,
Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,
do also here in thy country. And he said, Verily I say unto you, No
prophet is accepted in his own country. But I tell you of a truth,
many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was
shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout
all the land; but unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta,
a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were
in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was
cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. And all they in the synagogue,
when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, and rose up,
and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill
whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
But he passing through the midst of them went his way.




CHAPTER 15

THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES


AND it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the
word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and saw two ships
standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were
washing their nets.

And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him
that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and
taught the people out of the ship.

Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the
deep, and let down your nets for a draught. And Simon answering said
unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing:
nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. And when they had
this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net
brake. And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
ship, that they should come and help them.

And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart
from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he was astonished, and
all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had
taken: and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from
henceforth thou shalt catch men. And when they had brought their ships
to land, they forsook all, and followed him.




CHAPTER 16

JESUS HEALS THE SICK


AND they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he
entered into the synagogue, and taught. And they were astonished at
his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as
the scribes. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean
spirit; and he cried out, saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with
thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee
who thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold
thy peace, and come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had torn
him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. And they were all
amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What
thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth
he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. And immediately his
fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.

[Sidenote: St. Mark 1]

And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered
into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. But Simon's
wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. And
he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately
the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. And at even, when the
sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them
that were possessed with devils. And all the city was gathered together
at the door. And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and
cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because
they knew him.

And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out,
and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. And Simon and
they that were with him followed after him. And when they had found
him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee. And he said unto them,
Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for
therefore came I forth. And he preached in their synagogues throughout
all Galilee, and cast out devils. And there came a leper to him,
beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou
wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus, moved with compassion,
put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be
thou clean. And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy
departed from him, and he was cleansed. And he straitly charged him,
and forthwith sent him away; and saith unto him, See thou say nothing
to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for
thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto
them. But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into
the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from
every quarter.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 6]

And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised
that he was in the house. And straightway many were gathered together,
insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as
about the door: and he preached the word unto them. And they come unto
him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. And when
they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the
roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the
bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. When Jesus saw their faith, he
said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. But
there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their
hearts, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
but God only? And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that
they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye
these things in your hearts? Whether is it easier to say to the sick
of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up
thy bed, and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power
on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say
unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.
And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them
all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We
never saw it on this fashion.

And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted
unto him, and he taught them. And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son
of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow
me. And he arose and followed him. And it came to pass, that, as Jesus
sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together
with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed
him. And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and
drinketh with publicans and sinners? When Jesus heard it, he saith unto
them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that
are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.




CHAPTER 17

THE APOSTLES CALLED


AND it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain
to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was
day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve,
whom also he named apostles; Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and
Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and
Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, and Judas
the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.

[Illustration: THE MIRACULOUS DRAFT OF FISHES, BY RAPHAEL

IN THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM, SOUTH KENSINGTON, LONDON]

And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of
his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and
Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear
him, and to be healed of their diseases; and they that were vexed with
unclean spirits: and they were healed. And the whole multitude sought
to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.




CHAPTER 18

THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 5]

AND seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was
set, his disciples came unto him: and he opened his mouth, and taught
them, saying,

Blessed are the poor in spirit: for their's is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
they shall be filled.

Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of
God.

Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for
their's is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile
you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you
falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your
reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
you.

Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour,
wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but
to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light
of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do
men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick;
and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven.

Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am
not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till
heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break
one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be
called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and
teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of heaven.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 6]

Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: but
I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a
cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to
his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever
shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. Therefore if
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy
brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar,
and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and
offer thy gift. Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in
the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into
prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,
till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou
shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine
oaths: but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it
is God's throne: nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou
swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil.

Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth
for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever
shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if
any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have
thy cloke also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with
him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
of thee turn not thou away.

Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour,
and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them
that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of
your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the
evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even
the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do
ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore
perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:
otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before
thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that
they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father
which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou
prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray
standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they
may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But
thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut
thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not
vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be
heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for
your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
After this manner therefore pray ye:

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
your Father forgive your trespasses.

Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up
for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where
your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body
is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be
full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full
of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how
great is that darkness!

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 6]

No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love
the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye
cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought
for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for
your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and
the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not,
neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking
thought can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for
raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil
not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in
all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so
clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast
into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we
drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (for after all these things
do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and
his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Take
therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought
for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 7]

Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye
shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's
eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt
thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;
and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out
the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast
out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again
and rend you.

Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he
that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or
what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him
a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then,
being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much
more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that
ask him? Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.

Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is
the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but
inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits.
Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good
tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good
fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith
unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he
that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to
me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and
in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful
works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from
me, ye that work iniquity.

Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I
will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and
the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat
upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And
every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall
be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and
the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat
upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people
were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having
authority, and not as the scribes.




CHAPTER 19

THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS


AND when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much
people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea. And, behold,
there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and
when he saw him, he fell at his feet, and besought him greatly, saying,
My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and
lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live. And
Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, and had
suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she
had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, when she had
heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. And
straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her
body that she was healed of that plague.

And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of
him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging
thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? And he looked round about to see
her that had done this thing.

[Sidenote: St. Mark 5]

But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came
and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. And he said unto
her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be
whole of thy plague.

While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house
certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the
Master any further? As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken,
he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John
the brother of James. And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the
synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado,
and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him
to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and
the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in
where the damsel was lying. And he took the damsel by the hand, and
said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say
unto thee, arise. And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she
was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
astonishment. And he charged them straitly that no man should know it;
and commanded that something should be given her to eat.




CHAPTER 20

THE POOL OF BETHESDA


[Sidenote: St. John 5]

AFTER this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.

Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called
in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a
great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for
the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season
into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the
troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease
he had.

And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight
years. When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long
time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? The
impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is
troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another
steppeth down before me. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed,
and walk. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,
and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day:
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. He answered them, He that
made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. Then
asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy
bed, and walk? And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus
had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold,
thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made
him whole.

And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him,
because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only
had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making
himself equal with God.

Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for
what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. For the
Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth:
and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For
as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the
Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath
committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honour the
Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son
honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. Verily, verily, I say
unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me,
hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is
passed from death unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour
is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son
of God: and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in
himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath
given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of
man. Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that
are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that
have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment
is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father
which hath sent me. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not
true. There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that
the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. Ye sent unto John, and
he bare witness unto the truth. But I receive not testimony from man:
but these things I say, that ye might be saved. He was a burning and
a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his
light. But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works
which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do,
bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. And the Father
himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither
heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. And ye have not his
word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 12]

Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and
they are they which testify of me. And ye will not come to me, that ye
might have life. I receive not honour from men. But I know you, that
ye have not the love of God in you. I am come in my Father's name, and
ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will
receive. How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and
seek not the honour that cometh from God only? Do not think that I will
accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses,
in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me:
for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye
believe my words?




CHAPTER 21

JESUS HEALS ON THE SABBATH DAY


AT that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his
disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to
eat. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. But
he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an
hungred, and they that were with him; how he entered into the house of
God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat,
neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? Or have
ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the
temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? But I say unto you, That
in this place is one greater than the temple. But if ye had known what
this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have
condemned the guiltless. For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath
day.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 7]

And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: and,
behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked
him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might
accuse him. And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you,
that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is
a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
sabbath days. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And
he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they
might destroy him. But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from
thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
and charged them that they should not make him known: that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Behold
my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well
pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to
the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man
hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall he not break, and
smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto
victory. And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. While he yet talked
to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without,
desiring to speak with him. Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother
and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. But he
answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are
my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will
of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister,
and mother.




CHAPTER 22

THE CENTURION'S SERVANT AND THE WIDOW'S SON


NOW when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people,
he entered into Capernaum. And a certain centurion's servant, who
was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. And when he heard of
Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that
he would come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they
besought him instantly, saying that he was worthy for whom he should
do this: for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house,
the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not
thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:
wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in
a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I also am a man set under
authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he
goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this,
and he doeth it. When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him,
and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say
unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And they
that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that
had been sick.

And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called
Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. Now
when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead
man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and
much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had
compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched
the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I
say unto thee, Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.
And he delivered him to his mother. And there came a fear on all: and
they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; God
hath visited his people. And this rumour of him went forth throughout
all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 11]

Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two
of his disciples, and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or
do we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew
John again those things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive
their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to
them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning
John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with
the wind? But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. But
what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more
than a prophet. For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send
my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not
risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least
in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from the days of John
the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the
violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied
until John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to
come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children
sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, and saying, We
have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you,
and ye have not lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking,
and they say, He hath a devil. The Son of man came eating and drinking,
and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of
publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 7]

Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works
were done, because they repented not: Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe
unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you,
had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in
sackcloth and ashes.

But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at
the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art
exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty
works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would
have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so
it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of my
Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any
man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
him. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke
is easy, and my burden is light.




CHAPTER 23

THE WOMAN THAT WAS A SINNER


AND one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he
went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. And, behold, a
woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at
meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and
stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with
tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his
feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee which
had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he
were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is
that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. And Jesus answering said unto
him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say
on. There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed
five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to
pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them
will love him most? Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom
he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. And
he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?
I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but
she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of
her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not
anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore
I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved
much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And he
said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at meat with
him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins
also? And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.




CHAPTER 24

THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER


ON a certain day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went
into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. And
he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower
went forth to sow; and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side,
and the fowls came and devoured them up: some fell upon stony places,
where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because
they had no deepness of earth: and when the sun was up, they were
scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some
fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: but other
fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold,
some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 13]

And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them
in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto
you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is
not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away
even that he hath. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they
seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall
see, and shall not perceive: for this people's heart is waxed gross,
and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed;
lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their
ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted,
and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and
your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets
and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and
have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have
not heard them.

Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the
word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked
one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he
which received seed by the way side. But he that received the seed
into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with
joy receiveth it; yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a
while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the
word, by and by he is offended. He also that received seed among the
thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the
deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the
word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth
forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.




CHAPTER 25

THE TARES, THE MUSTARD SEED, THE LEAVEN, ETC.


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 13]


ANOTHER parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: but while men
slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his
way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and
said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from
whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.
The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them
up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up
also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and
in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together
first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the
wheat into my barn.

Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his
field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it
is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of
the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. Another parable spake
he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman
took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his
disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the
tares of the field. He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the
good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are
the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the
wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the
end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the
tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of
this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do
iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him
hear.

[Illustration: CHRIST HEALING THE SICK OF THE PALSY, BY VAN DYCK

IN THE POSSESSION OF KING EDWARD VII]

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the
which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he
had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and
bought it. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: which, when it was full,
they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels,
but cast the bad away. So shall it be at the end of the world: the
angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and
shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth.

Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say
unto him, Yea, Lord. Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe
which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that
is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new
and old.

And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he
departed thence. And when he was come into his own country, he taught
them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? Is not this
the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren,
James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not
all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? And they were
offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without
honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. And he did not
many mighty works there because of their unbelief.




CHAPTER 26

JESUS CALMS THE STORM


[Sidenote: St. Mark 4]

AND the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let
us pass over unto the other side. And when they had sent away the
multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were
also with him other little ships. And there arose a great storm of
wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. And he
was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake
him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? And he
arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.
And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said unto them,
Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? And they feared
exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that
even the wind and the sea obey him?




CHAPTER 27

THE HERD OF SWINE


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 8]

AND when he was come to the other side into the country of the
Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the
tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. And,
behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus,
thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to
go away into the herd of swine. And he said unto them, Go. And when
they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the
whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
perished in the waters. And they that kept them fled, and went their
ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
possessed of the devils. And, behold, the whole city came out to meet
Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart
out of their coasts.




CHAPTER 28

THE APOSTLES SENT FORTH


AND when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them
power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner
of sickness and all manner of disease. These twelve Jesus sent forth,
and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and
into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go rather to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom
of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. Provide
neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip for your
journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the
workman is worthy of his meat. And into whatsoever city or town ye
shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go
thence. And when ye come into an house, salute it. And if the house be
worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your
peace return to you. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your
words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
your feet. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the
land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. And ye shall be
hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end
shall be saved. And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able
to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both
soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and
one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the
very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye
are of more value than many sparrows. Whosoever therefore shall confess
me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
before my Father which is in heaven. And he that taketh not his cross,
and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. And whosoever shall give
to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the
name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his
reward.

And they went out, and preached that men should repent. And they cast
out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed
them.




CHAPTER 29

DEATH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST


AND king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and
he said that John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore
mighty works shewed forth themselves in him. Others said it was Elias,
and others that it was one of the prophets. But when Herod heard
thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the
dead. For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for
he had married her. For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful
for thee to have thy brother's wife. Therefore Herodias had a quarrel
against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: for Herod
feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed
him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a
supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; and
when the daughter of Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod
and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me
whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he sware unto her,
Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of
my kingdom. And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall
I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. And she came in
straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that
thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. And
the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their
sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. And immediately the
king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he
went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a charger,
and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. And
when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and
laid it in a tomb. And they went and told Jesus.




CHAPTER 30

MIRACLE OF THE LOAVES AND FISHES


[Sidenote: St. Mark 6]

WHEN Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert
place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed
him on foot out of the cities. And Jesus went forth, and saw a great
multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed
their sick. And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude
away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. He
said, Bring them hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit
down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and
looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his
disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat,
and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve
baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men,
beside women and children.




CHAPTER 31

JESUS WALKS ON THE SEA


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 14]

AND straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship,
and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes
away, because he perceived that they were about to come and take him
by force, to make him king. And when he had sent the multitudes away,
he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was
come, he was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea,
tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch
of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the
disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It
is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake
unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And Peter
answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on
the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind
boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying,
Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and
caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst
thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of
a truth thou art the Son of God. And when they were gone over, they
came into the land of Gennesaret. And when the men of that place had
knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and
brought unto him all that were diseased; and besought him that they
might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were
made perfectly whole.




CHAPTER 32

JESUS THE BREAD OF LIFE


THE day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the
sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto
his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples
into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone: when the
people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples,
they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. And
when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto
him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? Jesus answered them and said,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the
miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. Labour
not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto
everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him
hath God the Father sealed. Then said they unto him, What shall we do,
that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them,
This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may
see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? Our fathers did eat manna
in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to
eat. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true
bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from
heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord,
evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread
of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth
on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you that ye also have seen
me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me;
and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down
from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he
hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at
the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one
which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life:
and I will raise him up at the last day.

[Sidenote: St. John 6]

The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which
came down from heaven. And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of
Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith,
I came down from heaven? Jesus therefore answered and said unto them,
Murmur not among yourselves. No man can come to me, except the Father
which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.
Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father,
cometh unto me. Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which
is of God, he hath seen the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life.
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the
bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and
not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will
give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

[Sidenote: St. Mark 7]

The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man
give us his flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For
my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth
my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the
living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth
me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from
heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth
of this bread shall live for ever.

These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. Many
therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is an hard
saying; who can hear it? When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples
murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? What and if
ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? It is the
spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that
I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. But there are
some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who
they were that believed not, and who should betray him. And he said,
Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were
given unto him of my Father.

From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with
him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then Simon
Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of
eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ,
the Son of the living God. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you
twelve, and one of you is a devil? He spake of Judas Iscariot the son
of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.




CHAPTER 33

THE GREEK WOMAN'S DAUGHTER AND A DEAF AND DUMB MAN HEALED


AND from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon,
and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could
not be hid. For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: the woman was a
Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would
cast forth the devil out of her daughter. But Jesus said unto her, Let
the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's
bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. And she answered and said unto
him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's
crumbs. And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil
is gone out of thy daughter. And when she was come to her house, she
found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto
the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. And
they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his
speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. And he took
him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and
he spit, and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed,
and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. And straightway his
ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake
plain. And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more
he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; and
were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well:
he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.




CHAPTER 34

JESUS FEEDS THE MULTITUDE A SECOND TIME


IN those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to
eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, I have
compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three
days, and have nothing to eat: and if I send them away fasting to their
own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from
far.

[Sidenote: St. Mark 8]

And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these
men with bread here in the wilderness? And he asked them, How many
loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. And he commanded the people to
sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks,
and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did
set them before the people. And they had a few small fishes: and he
blessed, and commanded to set them also before them. So they did eat,
and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left
seven baskets. And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he
sent them away.

And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came
into the parts of Dalmanutha. And the Pharisees came forth, and began
to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting
him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no
sign be given unto this generation. And he left them, and entering
into the ship again departed to the other side. Now the disciples had
forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more
than one loaf. And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod. And they reasoned
among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread. And when
Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no
bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet
hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and
do ye not remember? When I brake the five loaves among five thousand,
how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him,
Twelve. And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full
of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. And he said unto them,
How is it that ye do not understand?

And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and
besought him to touch him. And he took the blind man by the hand, and
led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his
hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. And he looked up, and
said, I see men as trees, walking. After that he put his hands again
upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every
man clearly. And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into
the town, nor tell it to any in the town.




CHAPTER 35

PETER CONFESSES CHRIST


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 16]

WHEN Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they
said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others,
Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye
that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed
art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee,
That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then charged he his disciples that
they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.

From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that
he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and
chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third
day. Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far
from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. But he turned, and said
unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for
thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.

Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever
will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life
for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give
in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory
of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man
according to his works.




CHAPTER 36

THE TRANSFIGURATION


[Sidenote: St. Mark 9]

AND after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John,
and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and
he was transfigured before them. And his raiment became shining,
exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. And
there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with
Jesus. And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us
to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one
for Moses, and one for Elias. For he wist not what to say; for they
were sore afraid. And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and
a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear
him. And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man
any more, save Jesus only with themselves. And as they came down from
the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things
they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. And they
kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the
rising from the dead should mean.

[Illustration: THE TRANSFIGURATION, BY RAPHAEL

IN THE VATICAN, ROME]

And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about
them, and the scribes questioning with them. And straightway all the
people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him
saluted him. And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought
unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; and wheresoever he taketh
him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and
pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him
out; and they could not. He answereth him, and saith, O faithless
generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?
bring him unto me. And they brought him unto him: and when he saw
him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and
wallowed foaming. And he asked his father, How long is it ago since
this came unto him? And he said, Of a child. And ofttimes it hath cast
him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou
canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. Jesus said
unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said
with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. When Jesus saw
that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit,
saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of
him, and enter no more into him. And the spirit cried, and rent him
sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many
said, He is dead. But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up;
and he arose. And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked
him privately, Why could not we cast him out? And he said unto them,
This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.

And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not
that any man should know it. For he taught his disciples, and said unto
them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall
kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day. But
they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.




CHAPTER 37

CHRIST TEACHES HUMILITY AND FORGIVENESS


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 18]

AT the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto
him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto
you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble
himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom
of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which
believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Take
heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you,
That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father
which is in heaven. For the Son of man is come to save that which was
lost. How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? And if so be that he
find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than
of the ninety and nine which went not astray. Even so it is not the
will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones
should perish.

Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him
his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast
gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee
one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto
the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee
as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye
shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto you, That if
two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For
where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
midst of them.

Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him,
I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which
would take account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon,
one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But
forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold,
and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be
made. The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. Then the lord of
that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave
him the debt. But the same servant went out, and found one of his
fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on
him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. And
his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying,
Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but
went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. So when
his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came
and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that
he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave
thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not thou also
have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he
should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my heavenly
Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one
his brother their trespasses. And he turned him unto his disciples, and
said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:
for I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those
things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things
which ye hear, and have not heard them.




CHAPTER 38

JESUS AT THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES


[Sidenote: St. John 7]

AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in
Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. Now the Jews' feast of
tabernacles was at hand. His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart
hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works
that thou doest. For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret,
and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things,
shew thyself to the world. For neither did his brethren believe in
him. Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
is alway ready. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because
I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up unto this
feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full
come. When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the
feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. Then the Jews sought him
at the feast, and said, Where is he? And there was much murmuring among
the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others
said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. Howbeit no man spake openly of
him for fear of the Jews.

[Sidenote: St. John 7]

Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and
taught. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned? Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not
mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know
of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh
his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in
him. Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the
law? Why go ye about to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou
hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? Then said some of them of
Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? But, lo, he speaketh
boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that
this is the very Christ? Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but
when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me,
and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent
me is true, whom ye know not. But I know him: for I am from him, and he
hath sent me. Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on
him, because his hour was not yet come. And many of the people believed
on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than
these which this man hath done?

The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning
him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take
him. Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and
then I go unto him that sent me. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find
me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. Then said the Jews among
themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go
unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? What
manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall
not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? In the last day,
that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man
thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as
the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on
him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that
Jesus was not yet glorified.)

Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of
a truth this is the Prophet. Others said, This is the Christ. But
some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the scripture
said that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of
Bethlehem, where David was? So there was a division among the people
because of him. And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid
hands on him.

Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they
said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? The officers answered,
Never man spake like this man. Then answered them the Pharisees, Are
ye also deceived? Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed
on him? But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. Nicodemus
saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and
look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. And every man went unto
his own house.




CHAPTER 39

THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD


JESUS went unto the mount of Olives. And early in the morning he came
again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat
down, and taught them. And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a
woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, they
say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very
act. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but
what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him, that they might have to
accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the
ground, as though he heard them not. So when they continued asking him,
he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among
you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down,
and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by
their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest,
even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing
in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the
woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no
man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,
Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

[Sidenote: St. John 8]

Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world:
he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
light of life. The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest
record of thyself; thy record is not true. Jesus answered and said unto
them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know
whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and
whither I go. Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. And yet if I
judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father
that sent me. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two
men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that
sent me beareth witness of me. Then said they unto him, Where is thy
Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had
known me, ye should have known my Father also. These words spake Jesus
in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on
him; for his hour was not yet come.

And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of
this world; I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you, that ye
shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall
die in your sins. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus
saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is
true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. Then said
Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye
know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father
hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me:
the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that
please him. As he spake these words, many believed on him.

[Sidenote: St. John 8]

Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue
in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you free. They answered him, We be
Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou,
Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant
abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. If the Son
therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. I know that ye
are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no
place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do
that which ye have seen with your father. They answered and said unto
him, Abraham is our father.

Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the
works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you
the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the
deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We have one Father, even
God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:
for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but
he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot
hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your
father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh
a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of
it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you
convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe
me? He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them
not, because ye are not of God. Then answered the Jews, and said unto
him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do
dishonour me. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh
and judgeth. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying,
he shall never see death.

Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my
saying, he shall never taste of death. Art thou greater than our father
Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou
thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it
is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know
him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his
saying. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
was glad. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years
old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily,
I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. Then took they up stones to
cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going
through the midst of them, and so passed by.




CHAPTER 40

THE GOOD SAMARITAN


AND, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What
is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering said, Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as
thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus,
And who is my neighbour? And Jesus answering said, A certain man went
down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped
him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half
dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when
he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when
he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other
side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound
up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast,
and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when
he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said
unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when
I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest
thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said,
He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou
likewise.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 10]

Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain
village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and
heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to
him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to
serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and
said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many
things: but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,
which shall not be taken away from her.




CHAPTER 41

THE LORD'S PRAYER AND OTHER SAYINGS OF CHRIST


[Sidenote: St. Luke 11]

AND it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when
he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray,
as John also taught his disciples. And he said unto them, When ye pray,
say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. Give us day by day
our daily bread. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one
that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us
from evil.

And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go
unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing
to set before him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me
not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give
him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will
rise and give him as many as he needeth. And I say unto you, Ask, and
it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall
be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son
shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a
stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? or
if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being
evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more
shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass,
when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the
chief of the devils. And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign
from heaven. But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
divided against a house falleth. If Satan also be divided against
himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out
devils through Beelzebub. And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by
whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom
of God is come upon you. When a strong man armed keepeth his palace,
his goods are in peace: but when a stronger than he shall come upon
him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he
trusted, and divideth his spoils. He that is not with me is against me:
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. When the unclean spirit
is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and
finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. Then goeth he,
and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and
they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse
than the first.

[Illustration: CHRIST DISPUTING WITH THE DOCTORS, BY LUINI

IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY, LONDON]

And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and
he went in, and sat down to meat. And when the Pharisee saw it, he
marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner. And the Lord said
unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and
the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which
is within also? But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and,
behold, all things are clean unto you.

When there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people,
insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his
disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which
is hypocrisy. For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
neither hid, that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have
spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have
spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the
body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn
you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power
to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. Are not five sparrows
sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not
therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 12]

Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall
the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: but he that
denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God. And
whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it
shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and
unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye
shall answer, or what ye shall say: for the Holy Ghost shall teach you
in the same hour what ye ought to say.

And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that
he divide the inheritance with me. And he said unto him, Man, who made
me a judge or a divider over you? And he said unto them, Take heed,
and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the
abundance of the things which he possesseth. And he spake a parable
unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth
plentifully: and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,
because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This
will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will
I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul,
thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat,
drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy
soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be,
which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself,
and is not rich toward God.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 12]

And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what
ye shall put on. The life is more than meat, and the body is more than
raiment. Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more
are ye better than the fowls? And which of you with taking thought can
add to his stature one cubit? If ye then be not able to do that thing
which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? Consider the lilies
how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you,
that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If
then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to
morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye
of little faith? And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. For all these things do the
nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have
need of these things. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all
these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock; for it is
your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye
yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return
from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto
him immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he
cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird
himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and
serve them. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the
third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. And this
know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief
would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house
to be broken through. Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man
cometh at an hour when ye think not.

Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us,
or even to all? And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise
steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give
them their portion of meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom
his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Of a truth I say unto you,
that he will make him ruler over all that he hath. But and if that
servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin
to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be
drunken; the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh
not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in
sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. And that
servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither
did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he
that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten
with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be
much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will
ask the more.

He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then
said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I
come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why
cumbereth it the ground? And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it
alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it
bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.

And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And,
behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen
years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.
And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman,
thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he laid his hands on her:
and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. And the
ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus
had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six
days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed,
and not on the sabbath day. The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou
hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his
ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these
eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? And when
he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all
the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 13]




CHAPTER 42

JESUS LAMENTS OVER JERUSALEM


AND he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying
toward Jerusalem. Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be
saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate:
for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the
door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying,
Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know
you not whence ye are: then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and
drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. But he
shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me,
all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the
prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. And
they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north,
and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. And,
behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which
shall be last.

The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get
thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. And he said unto
them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do
cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.
Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following:
for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent
unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a
hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold,
your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye
shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he
that cometh in the name of the Lord.




CHAPTER 43

THE BLIND MAN AT THE POOL OF SILOAM


[Sidenote: St. John 9]

AND as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man,
or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither hath
this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be
made manifest in him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while
it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in
the world, I am the light of the world. When he had thus spoken, he
spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the
eyes of the blind man with the clay, and said unto him, Go, wash in the
pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way
therefore, and washed, and came seeing.

The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he
was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, This is
he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. Therefore said
they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? He answered and said, A man
that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto
me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I
received sight. Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know
not.

They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. And it was
the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. Then
again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He
said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because
he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a
sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. They say
unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened
thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. But the Jews did not believe
concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until
they called the parents of him that had received his sight. And they
asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how
then doth he now see? His parents answered them and said, We know that
this is our son, and that he was born blind: but by what means he now
seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of
age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.

These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the
Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was
Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. Therefore said his
parents, He is of age; ask him. Then again called they the man that
was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this
man is a sinner. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no,
I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine
eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear:
wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? Then
they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses'
disciples. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we
know not from whence he is. The man answered and said unto them, Why
herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and
yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners:
but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he
heareth. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could
do nothing. They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born
in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. Jesus heard
that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto
him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, Who is
he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, Thou
hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said,
Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.




CHAPTER 44

THE GOOD SHEPHERD


[Sidenote: St. John 10]

VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into
the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and
a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the
sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and
he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he
putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow
him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but
will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. This
parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they
were which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came
before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I
am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go
in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal,
and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life,
and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd:
the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is an
hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the
wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth
them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an
hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and
know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even
so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other
sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring,
and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one
shepherd. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down
of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

[Sidenote: St. John 10]

There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.

And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. Then came the Jews
round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to
doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them,
I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's
name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not, because ye are not
of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice, and I know
them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they
shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is
able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them,
Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those
works do ye stone me? The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work
we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a
man, makest thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your
law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word
of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; say ye of him, whom
the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest;
because I said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my
Father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe
the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and
I in him.

Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their
hand, and went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at
first baptized; and there he abode. And many resorted unto him, and
said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man
were true. And many believed on him there.




CHAPTER 45

THE PARABLE OF THE WEDDING SUPPER


AND it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief
Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. And,
behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. And
Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it
lawful to heal on the sabbath day? And they held their peace. And he
took him, and healed him, and let him go; and answered them, saying,
Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not
straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? And they could not answer
him again to these things.

And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked
how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, When thou art
bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest
a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; and he that bade thee
and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with
shame to take the lowest room. But when thou art bidden, go and sit
down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say
unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the
presence of them that sit at meat with thee. For whosoever exalteth
himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner
or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy
kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and
a recompence be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the
poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for
they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the
resurrection of the just.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 14]

And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he
said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of
God. Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
bade many: and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that
were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. And they all with one
consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a
piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me
excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go
to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have
married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So that servant came,
and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being
angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of
the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt,
and the blind. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast
commanded, and yet there is room. And the lord said unto the servant,
Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that
my house may be filled. For I say unto you, That none of those men
which were bidden shall taste of my supper.




CHAPTER 46

THE LOST SHEEP, THE LOST COIN, AND THE PRODIGAL SON


[Sidenote: St. Luke 15]

THEN drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
sinners, and eateth with them.

And he spake this parable unto them, saying, What man of you, having
an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety
and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he
find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends
and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my
sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in
heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine
just persons, which need no repentance. Either what woman having ten
pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and
sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? And when she
hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together,
saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of
God over one sinner that repenteth.

And he said, A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said
to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to
me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the
younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far
country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when
he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he
began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of
that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he
would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat:
and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How
many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and
I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say
unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and
am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired
servants. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and
fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy
to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth
the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us
eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was
lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the
house, he heard musick and dancing. And he called one of the servants,
and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother
is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath
received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in:
therefore came his father out, and intreated him. And he answering
said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither
transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest
me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as soon as this
thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou
hast killed for him the fatted calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou
art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we
should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is
alive again; and was lost, and is found.




CHAPTER 47

THE UNJUST STEWARD, THE RICH MAN, AND LAZARUS


[Sidenote: St. Luke 16]

AND he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man,
which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had
wasted his goods. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that
I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
mayest be no longer steward. Then the steward said within himself, What
shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot
dig; to beg I am ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am
put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto
the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? And he said, An hundred
measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down
quickly, and write fifty. Then said he to another, And how much owest
thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him,
Take thy bill, and write fourscore. And the lord commended the unjust
steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are
in their generation wiser than the children of light. And I say unto
you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that,
when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. He
that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and
he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye
have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to
your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that
which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?
No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. And the Pharisees also, who were
covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. And he said
unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God
knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is
abomination in the sight of God.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 17]

There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine
linen, and fared sumptuously every day: and there was a certain beggar
named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring
to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table:
moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass, that
the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom:
the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his
eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in
his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me,
and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and
cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said,
Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and
likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art
tormented. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great
gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. Then he
said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to
my father's house: for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto
them, lest they also come into this place of torment. Abraham saith
unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. And he
said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead,
they will repent. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the
prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the
dead.




CHAPTER 48

THANKS AND PRAYER


AND it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through
the midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered into a certain
village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
and they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy
on us. And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves
unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were
cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his
feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering
said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are
not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. And
he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.

And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not
with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for,
behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall
desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see
it. And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after
them, nor follow them. For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of
the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven;
so shall also the Son of man be in his day. But first must he suffer
many things, and be rejected of this generation. And as it was in the
days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They
did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage,
until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came,
and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot;
they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they
builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in
the day when the Son of man is revealed. In that day, he which shall be
upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to
take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return
back. Remember Lot's wife.

And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always
to pray, and not to faint; saying, There was in a city a judge, which
feared not God, neither regarded man: and there was a widow in that
city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And
he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though
I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me,
I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the
Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge
his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long
with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised others: two men went up into
the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The
Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that
I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even
as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that
I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so
much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be
merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house
justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself
shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.




CHAPTER 49

JESUS RAISES LAZARUS


[Sidenote: St. John 11]

NOW a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary
and her sister Martha. (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with
ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was
sick.) Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
whom thou lovest is sick. When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness
is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might
be glorified thereby. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and
Lazarus. When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two
days still in the same place where he was. Then after that saith he to
his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. His disciples say unto him,
Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither
again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any
man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of
this world. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there
is no light in him. These things said he: and after that he saith unto
them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out
of sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do
well. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly,
Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to
the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. Then said
Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also
go, that we may die with him. Then when Jesus came, he found that he
had lain in the grave four days already.

[Sidenote: St. John 11]

Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: and
many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning
their brother. Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was
coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. Then said
Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had
not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of
God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall
rise again. Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again
in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the
resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die. Believest thou this? She saith unto him, Yea, Lord:
I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come
into the world. And when she had so said, she went her way, and called
Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for
thee. As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.

Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where
Martha met him. The Jews then which were with her in the house, and
comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went
out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at
his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews
also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was
troubled, and said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
come and see. Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of
the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? Jesus
therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave,
and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha,
the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he
stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. Jesus saith unto her, Said I
not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the
glory of God? Then they took away the stone from the place where the
dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank
thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always:
but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may
believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes:
and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them,
Loose him, and let him go.

Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which
Jesus did, believed on him. But some of them went their ways to the
Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. Then gathered the
chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for
this man doeth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will
believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place
and nation. And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that
same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that
it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and
that the whole nation perish not. And this spake he not of himself:
but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die
for that nation; and not for that nation only, but that also he should
gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him
to death. Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but
went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called
Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. And the Jews' passover
was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem
before the passover, to purify themselves. Then sought they for Jesus,
and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye,
that he will not come to the feast? Now both the chief priests and the
Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were,
he should shew it, that they might take him.




CHAPTER 50

JESUS BLESSES THE CHILDREN


[Sidenote: St. Mark 10]

AND they brought young children to Jesus, that he should touch them:
and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw
it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the
kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the
kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he
took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 20]

And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and
kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I
may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou
me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. Thou knowest the
commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do
not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And
he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from
my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One
thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to
the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up
the cross, and follow me. And he was sad at that saying, and went away
grieved: for he had great possessions.

And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly
shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! And the
disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again,
and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in
riches to enter into the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God. And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
themselves, Who then can be saved? And Jesus looking upon them saith,
With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things
are possible.

Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have
followed thee. And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you,
There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the
gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. But many that are
first shall be last; and the last first.




CHAPTER 51

THE LABOURERS


JESUS said, For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into
his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a
day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third
hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and said unto
them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will
give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth
and ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went
out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye
here all the day idle? They say unto him, Because no man hath hired
us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever
is right, that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the lord of
the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them
their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came
that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a
penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when
they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them
equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. But he
answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not
thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I
will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to
do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? So
the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but
few chosen.

BOOK III--THE LAST DAYS OF JESUS




CHAPTER 52

JESUS GOES UP TO JERUSALEM


AND they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before
them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And
he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should
happen unto him, saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of
man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes;
and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the
Gentiles: and they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall
spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise
again. And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
desire. And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right
hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. But Jesus said unto
them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink
of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? And they
said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink
of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized
withal shall ye be baptized: but to sit on my right hand and on my left
hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is
prepared. And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased
with James and John. But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto
them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles
exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority
upon them. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be
great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be
the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not
to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom
for many. And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with
his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son
of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. And when he heard that it
was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son
of David, have mercy on me. And many charged him that he should hold
his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have
mercy on me. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And
they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise;
he calleth thee. And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to
Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might
receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath
made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed
Jesus in the way.

And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among
the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was;
and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. And he
ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was
to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and
saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down,
and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured,
saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. And
Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by
false accusation, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, This
day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of
Abraham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
lost.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 19]

And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany,
at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your
entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose
him, and bring him hither. And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him?
thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. And they
that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.
And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them,
Why loose ye the colt? And they said, The Lord hath need of him. And
they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt,
and they set Jesus thereon. And as he went, they spread their clothes
in the way. And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice
and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had
seen; saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord:
peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. And some of the Pharisees
from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should
hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

[Sidenote: St. John 12]

And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the
things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine
eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast
a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every
side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within
thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because
thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. These things understood
not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then
remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they
had done these things unto him. The people therefore that was with
him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the
dead, bare record. For this cause the people also met him, for that
they heard that he had done this miracle. The Pharisees therefore said
among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the
world is gone after him.




CHAPTER 53

THE VOICE FROM HEAVEN


AND there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at
the feast: the same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida
of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. Philip
cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. And
Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man
should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of
wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it
bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and
he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall
also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from
this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify
thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again.

The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. Jesus answered and
said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. Now is
the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be
cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
unto me. This he said, signifying what death he should die. The people
answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for
ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is
this Son of man? Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the
light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon
you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children
of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself
from them. But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet
they believed not on him: that the saying of Esaias the prophet might
be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and
to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but
because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be
put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than
the praise of God.

Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but
on him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. I
am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should
not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words, and believe not,
I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the
world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in
the last day. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which
sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should
speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that
sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the
moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto
them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but
ye have made it a den of thieves. And the blind and the lame came to
him in the temple; and he healed them. And when the chief priests and
scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying
in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore
displeased, and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings thou hast perfected praise?




CHAPTER 54

THE BARREN FIG TREE


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 21]

AND he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged
there. Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found
nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow
on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered
away. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon
is the fig tree withered away! Jesus answered and said unto them,
Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not
only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say
unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea;
it shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
believing, ye shall receive.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 21]

And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders
of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what
authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing,
which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I
do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of
men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? But if we
shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell.

And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
things. But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. He answered
and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. And he came
to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir:
and went not. Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They
say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God
before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and
ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe
him.

Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted
a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it,
and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far
country: and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the
husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and
stoned another. Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and
they did unto them likewise. But last of all he sent unto them his son,
saying, They will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the
son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill
him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast
him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When the lord therefore of the
vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? They say unto
him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his
vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in
their seasons.

Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone
which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner:
this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore
say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given
to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall
on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it
will grind him to powder. And when the chief priests and Pharisees had
heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. But when they
sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they
took him for a prophet.




CHAPTER 55

PARABLE OF THE WEDDING FEAST


AND Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a
marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that
were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. Again, he sent
forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I
have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all
things are ready: come unto the marriage. But they made light of it,
and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: and
the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew
them. But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth
his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which
were bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as
many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. So those servants went out
into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found,
both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. And when
the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on
a wedding garment: and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in
hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then said
the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away,
and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 22]

Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle
him in his talk. And they sent out unto him their disciples with the
Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest
the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
regardest not the person of men. Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou?
Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceived
their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Shew me
the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith
unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him,
Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the
things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and
went their way. But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the
Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them,
which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him,
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying,
What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of
David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,
saying, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
make thine enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is
he his son? And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
man from that day forth ask him any more questions.




CHAPTER 56

THE WIDOW'S MITE


[Sidenote: St. Mark 12]

AND Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast
money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. And
there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which
make a farthing. And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto
them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,
than all they which have cast into the treasury: for all they did cast
in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she
had, even all her living.




CHAPTER 57

THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE AND THE END OF THE WORLD


AND Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples
came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said
unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There
shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown
down.

And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him
privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall
be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus
answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For
many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive
many. And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be
not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is
not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,
in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall
they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall
be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be
offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And
many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because
iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that
shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of
the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
nations; and then shall the end come.

But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven,
but my Father only. But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the
flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,
until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the
flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the
Son of man be. Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken,
and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one
shall be taken, and the other left. Watch therefore: for ye know not
what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman
of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would
have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son
of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord
hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
doing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and
to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come
in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not
aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with
the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 25]

Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which
took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of
them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took
their lamps, and took no oil with them: but the wise took oil in their
vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all
slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose,
and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of
your oil; for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, saying,
Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to
them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy,
the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the
marriage: and the door was shut. Afterward came also the other virgins,
saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say
unto you, I know you not. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day
nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 25]

For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country,
who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And
unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to
every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his
journey. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
with the same, and made them other five talents. And likewise he that
had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received
one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. After a
long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five
talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold,
I have gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto him,
Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over
a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into
the joy of thy lord. He also that had received two talents came and
said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained
two other talents beside them. His lord said unto him, Well done, good
and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I
will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy
lord. Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not
sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: and I was afraid,
and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is
thine. His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strawed: thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to
the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own
with usury. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him
which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given,
and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken
away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into
outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before
him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one
from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he
shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then
shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye
clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came
unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When
saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the
King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto me. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand,
Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I
was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took
me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye
visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or
in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them,
saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of
the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into
everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.




CHAPTER 58

THE LAST SUPPER


AND it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he
said unto his disciples, Ye know that after two days is the feast of
the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. Then
assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders
of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called
Caiaphas, and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and
kill him. But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
among the people.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 26]

Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious
ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his
disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this
waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the
poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath
poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I
say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole
world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a
memorial of her.

Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief
priests, and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver
him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came
to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee
to eat the passover? And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and
say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the
passover at thy house with my disciples. And the disciples did as
Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. And as they
were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave
it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took
the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all
of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it
new with you in my Father's kingdom.

[Sidenote: St. John 13]

Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was
come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having
loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. He
riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and
girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to
wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him,
Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What
I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith
unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash
thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord,
not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He
that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every
whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him;
therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their
feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto
them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord:
and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have
washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have
given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord;
neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these
things, happy are ye if ye do them. I speak not of you all: I know whom
I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth
bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. Now I tell you before
it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send
receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and
said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus
loved. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake. He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto
him, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a
sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it
to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. And after the sop Satan entered
into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. Now
no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. For
some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said
unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or,
that he should give something to the poor. He then having received the
sop went immediately out: and it was night.

Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man
glorified, and God is glorified in him. Little children, yet a little
while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews,
Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. A new commandment
I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that
ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my
disciples, if ye have love one to another.

Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered
him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow
me afterwards. Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now?
I will lay down my life for thy sake. Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay
down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock
shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.




CHAPTER 59

JESUS COMFORTS HIS DISCIPLES


LET not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would
have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare
a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that
where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way
ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest;
and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the
truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye
had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth
ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us
the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so
long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that
hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us
the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father
in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the
Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am
in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very
works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me,
the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these
shall he do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask
in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the
Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

[Sidenote: St. John 14]

If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he
shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it
seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth
with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will
come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye
see me: because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know
that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that hath my
commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that
loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest myself to him. Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how
is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my
words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make
our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and
the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But
the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in
my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you,
my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how
I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye
would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is
greater than I. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that,
when it is come to pass, ye might believe. Hereafter I will not talk
much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing
in me. But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.




CHAPTER 60

THE TRUE VINE


[Sidenote: St. John 15]

I AM the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch
in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that
beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now
ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in
me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except
it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the
vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the
same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If
a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered;
and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified,
that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father
hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye
keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept
my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I
spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy
might be full.

This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what
his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I
have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. Ye have not chosen
me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and
bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever
ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. These things
I command you, that ye love one another. If the world hate you, ye
know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world,
the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but
I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than
his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if
they have kept my saying, they will keep your's also. But all these
things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not
him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not
had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. He that hateth me
hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which
none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen
and hated both me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word
might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without
a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,
he shall testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have
been with me from the beginning.

[Sidenote: St. John 16]

These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that
whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these
things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father,
nor me. But these things have I told you, that when the time shall
come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said
not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go my
way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your
heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that
I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart, I will send him unto you. I have yet many things to
say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit
of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not
speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak:
and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall
receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. All things that the Father
hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall
shew it unto you. A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a
little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

[Sidenote: St. John 17]

Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that
he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again,
a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father? They
said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot
tell what he saith. Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him,
and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A
little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and
ye shall see me? Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and
lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but
your sorrow shall be turned into joy. And in that day ye shall ask me
nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the
Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing
in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. These
things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I
shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly
of the Father. At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto
you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth
you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from
God. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again,
I leave the world, and go to the Father. His disciples said unto him,
Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now are we
sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should
ask thee: by this we believe that thou earnest forth from God. Jesus
answered them, Do ye now believe? Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now
come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave
me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. These
things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the
world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome
the world.




CHAPTER 61

JESUS PRAYS FOR HIS DISCIPLES


THESE words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,
Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he
should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is
life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee on the earth: I
have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father,
glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with
thee before the world was. I have manifested thy name unto the men
which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou
gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that
all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.

For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they
have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee,
and they have believed that thou didst send me. I pray for them: I pray
not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are
thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom
thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. While I was with
them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me
I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that
the scripture might be fulfilled. And now come I to thee; and these
things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in
themselves. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I
pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou
shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they
also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these
alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee,
that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou
hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them;
that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me,
that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that
thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father,
I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I
am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou
lovedst me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father,
the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have
known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name,
and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may
be in them, and I in them. And when they had sung an hymn, they went
out into the mount of Olives. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall
be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite
the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. Peter
answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of
thee, yet will I never be offended. Jesus said unto him, Verily I say
unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me
thrice. Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.




CHAPTER 62

JESUS BETRAYED AND DENIED


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 26]

THEN cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith
unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. And he
took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be
sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. And he
went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my
Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not
as I will, but as thou wilt. And he cometh unto the disciples, and
findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch
with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation:
the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away again
the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not
pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. And he came and
found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. And he left them,
and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going: behold, he
is at hand that doth betray me.

And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with
him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests
and elders of the people. Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign,
saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. And
forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. And
Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they,
and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. And, behold, one of them which
were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck
a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus
unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take
the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now
pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve
legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that
thus it must be? In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye
come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I
sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be
fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high
priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. But Peter
followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and
sat with the servants, to see the end. Now the chief priests, and
elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to
put him to death; but found none: yea, though many false witnesses
came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, and
said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and
to build it in three days. And the high priest arose, and said unto
him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against
thee? But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said
unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether
thou be the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast
said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of
man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have
heard his blasphemy. What think ye? They answered and said, He is
guilty of death. Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and
others smote him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto
us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?

[Illustration: CHRIST CROWNED WITH THORNS, BY VAN DYCK

IN THE PRADO MUSEUM, MADRID]

Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. But he denied before them
all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. And when he was gone out into
the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there,
This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he denied with
an oath, I do not know the man. And after a while came unto him they
that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for
thy speech bewrayeth thee. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying,
I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered
the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou
shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 27]

When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the
people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: and when they
had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate
the governor.

Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned,
repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to
the chief priests and elders, saying, I have sinned in that I have
betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see
thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the
silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the
treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and
bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore
that field was called the field of blood unto this day. Then was
fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they
took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued,
whom they of the children of Israel did value; and gave them for the
potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.




CHAPTER 63

JESUS CONDEMNED AND CRUCIFIED


[Sidenote: St. John 18]

THEN led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was
early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they
should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. Pilate then
went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this
man? They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we
would not have delivered him up unto thee. Then said Pilate unto them,
Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore
said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: that
the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what
death he should die. Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again,
and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others
tell it thee of me? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and
the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were
of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate
therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou
sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause
came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every
one that is of the truth heareth my voice. Pilate saith unto him, What
is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews,
and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. And they were the
more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout
all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. When Pilate heard of
Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. And as soon as he
knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod,
who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.

And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to
see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and
he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and
arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. And the
same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they
were at enmity between themselves.

And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the
rulers and the people, said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto
me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined
him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things
whereof ye accuse him: no, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and,
lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise
him, and release him. Now at that feast the governor was wont to
release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. And they had then
a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered
together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?
Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? For he knew that for envy
they had delivered him.

[Illustration: THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS, BY RUBENS

IN THE CATHEDRAL, ANTWERP]

When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him,
saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered
many things this day in a dream because of him. But the chief priests
and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and
destroy Jesus. The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of
the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. Pilate
saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called
Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. And the governor
said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying,
Let him be crucified. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing,
but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands
before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood
be on us, and on our children. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and
scourged him. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on
his head, and they put on him a purple robe, and said, Hail, King of
the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. Pilate therefore went
forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you,
that ye may know that I find no fault in him. Then came Jesus forth,
wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto
them, Behold the man! When the chief priests therefore and officers saw
him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith
unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die,
because he made himself the Son of God.

[Sidenote: St. Matthew 27]

When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
and went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence
art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Then saith Pilate unto him,
Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to
crucify thee, and have power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou
couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee
from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater
sin. And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews
cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's
friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. When
Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat
down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but
in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the preparation of the passover,
and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your
King! But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.
Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests
answered, We have no king but Caesar. Then delivered he him therefore
unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 23]

And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian,
coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he
might bear it after Jesus. And there followed him a great company of
people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus
turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but
weep for yourselves, and for your children. And there were also two
other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. And when they
were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified
him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the
left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. And the people
stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying,
He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of
God. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him
vinegar, and saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing
was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. This title then read many
of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the
city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. Then said the
chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews;
but that he said, I am King of the Jews. Pilate answered, What I have
written I have written.

And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If
thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked
him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same
condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of
our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto
Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus
said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in
paradise. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness
over all the earth until the ninth hour.

Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's
sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus
therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved,
he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith he to the
disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her
unto his own home.

Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the
ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood there, when they
heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. And straightway one of
them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on
a reed, and gave him to drink. When Jesus therefore had received the
vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up
the ghost.

[Illustration: THE ENTOMBMENT, BY TITIAN

IN THE LOUVRE, PARIS]

The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies
should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath
day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,
and that they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers, and brake
the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they
brake not his legs: but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his
side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. And he that saw it
bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true,
that ye might believe. For these things were done, that the scripture
should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. And again
another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced. And,
behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves
were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came
out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city,
and appeared unto many. Now when the centurion, and they that were with
him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were
done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. When
the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph,
who also himself was Jesus' disciple: he went to Pilate, and begged the
body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And when
Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and
laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he
rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. And
there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the
sepulchre.

Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief
priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we
remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three
days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made
sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal
him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the
last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye
have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they went, and
made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.




CHAPTER 64

THE RESURRECTION


[Sidenote: St. Matthew 28]

IN the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of
the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the
Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from
the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his
raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and
became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women,
Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is
not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the
Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from
the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall
ye see him: lo, I have told you. And they departed quickly from the
sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples
word. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to
the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other disciple did
outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he stooping down,
and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then
cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and
seeth the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, that was about his head,
not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by
itself. Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to
the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. For as yet they knew not the
scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples
went away again unto their own home.

[Sidenote: St. John 20]

But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she
stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, and seeth two angels in
white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest
thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and
I know not where they have laid him. And when she had thus said, she
turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was
Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if
thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I
will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself,
and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto
her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my
brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;
and to my God, and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples
that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto
her. Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the
city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel,
they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye, His disciples
came by night, and stole him away while we slept. And if this come to
the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. So they took
the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly
reported among the Jews until this day.




CHAPTER 65

APPEARANCES OF CHRIST AFTER THE RESURRECTION


[Illustration: THE SUPPER AT EMMAUS, BY REMBRANDT

IN THE LOUVRE, PARIS]

AND, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus,
which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. And they talked
together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass,
that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew
near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should
not know him. And he said unto them, What manner of communications are
these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? And the
one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou
only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are
come to pass there in these days? And he said unto them, What things?
And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a
prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: and
how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to
death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which
should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third
day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women also of our
company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; and when
they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a
vision of angels, which said that he was alive. And certain of them
which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the
women had said: but him they saw not.

[Sidenote: St. Luke 24]

Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that
the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these
things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all
the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things
concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they
went: and he made as though he would have gone further. But they
constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and
the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. And it came to
pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and
brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him;
and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, Did
not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and
while he opened to us the scriptures? And they rose up the same hour,
and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and
them that were with them, saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath
appeared to Simon. And they told what things were done in the way, and
how he was known of them in breaking of bread. And as they thus spake,
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace
be unto you. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that
they had seen a spirit. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and
why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that
it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and
bones, as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them
his hands and his feet. And while they yet believed not for joy, and
wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? And they gave him
a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And he took it, and
did eat before them. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you:
as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said
this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. But Thomas, one of the
twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other
disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said
unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and
put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his
side, I will not believe.

[Sidenote: St. John 20]

And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with
them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst,
and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy
finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it
into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered
and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas,
because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that
have not seen, and yet have believed.

And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you,
while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were
written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms,
concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might
understand the scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are
witnesses of these things. And, behold, I send the promise of my Father
upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued
with power from on high.

After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at
the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. There were
together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana
in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also
go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately;
and that night they caught nothing. But when the morning was now come,
Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered
him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not
able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. Therefore that disciple
whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon
Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him,
(for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. And the other
disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but
as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. As soon
then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and
fish laid thereon, and bread. Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish
which ye have now caught. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to
land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all
there were so many, yet was not the net broken. Jesus saith unto them,
Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou?
knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and
giveth them, and fish likewise.

So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;
thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He
saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He
saith unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon,
son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto
him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou
knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto
him, Feed my sheep. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast
young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but
when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another
shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. This spake
he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had
spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about,
seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on
his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that
to thee? follow thou me.

And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if
they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself
could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.




CHAPTER 66

THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST


[Sidenote: St. Luke 24]

AND he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands,
and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was
parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And while they looked
stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them
in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you
into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
heaven. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
joy: and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God,
Amen.

BOOK IV--THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES AND THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF PAUL




CHAPTER 67

THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVEN


AND the apostles appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was
surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord,
which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou
hast chosen, that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship,
from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own
place. And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as
of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were
sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out
of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the
multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man
heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed and
marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak
Galilaeans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were
born? Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. But Peter,
standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them,
Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto
you, and hearken to my words: for these are not drunken, as ye suppose,
seeing it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that which was
spoken by the prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days,
saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh. And I will shew
wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; and it shall
come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall
be saved.

Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved
of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did
by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: him, being
delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye
have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: whom God
hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not
possible that he should be holden of it. Therefore being by the right
hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of
the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath
made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said
unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what
shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and
ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many
as the Lord our God shall call.

Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same
day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they
continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in
breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and
many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And they, continuing
daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house
to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added
to the church daily such as should be saved.




CHAPTER 68

PETER AND JOHN CURE THE LAME MAN


[Sidenote: The Acts 3]

NOW Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
prayer, being the ninth hour. And a certain man lame from his birth
was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is
called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give
I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And
he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his
feet and ancle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and
walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping,
and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate
of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that
which had happened unto him. And as the lame man which was healed held
Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that
is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.

[Sidenote: The Acts 4]

And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the
temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, being grieved that they
taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the
dead. And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next
day: for it was now eventide. Howbeit many of them which heard the word
believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.

And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders,
and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and
Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were
gathered together at Jerusalem. And when they had set them in the
midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of
the people, and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined of the
good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; be
it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised
from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is
become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other:
for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we
must be saved.

Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that
they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took
knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. And beholding the man
which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they
conferred among themselves. And they called them, and commanded them
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John
answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God
to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but
speak the things which we have seen and heard. So when they had further
threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might
punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that
which was done. For the man was above forty years old, on whom this
miracle of healing was shewed. And being let go, they went to their
own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had
said unto them.

[Illustration: THE DEATH OF ANANIAS, BY RAPHAEL

IN THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM, SOUTH KENSINGTON, LONDON]

And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common. Neither was
there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of
lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that
were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution
was made unto every man according as he had need.




CHAPTER 69

ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA


BUT a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
possession, and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy
to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to
the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? While
it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not
in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. And Ananias hearing these
words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them
that heard these things. And the young men arose, wound him up, and
carried him out, and buried him.

And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not
knowing what was done, came in. And Peter answered unto her, Tell me
whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.
Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to
tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have
buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. Then fell
she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the
young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried
her by her husband. And great fear came upon all the church, and upon
as many as heard these things.

[Sidenote: The Acts 5]

And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
among the people. And believers were the more added to the Lord,
multitudes both of men and women. Insomuch that they brought forth
the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that
at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of
them. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean
spirits: and they were healed every one.

Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, and laid
their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. But the
angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them
forth, and said, Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all
the words of this life. And when they heard that, they entered into the
temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came,
and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all
the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have
them brought. But when the officers came, and found them not in the
prison, they returned, and told, saying, The prison truly found we shut
with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors:
but when we had opened, we found no man within. Then came one and
told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing
in the temple, and teaching the people. Then went the captain with
the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the
people, lest they should have been stoned. And when they had brought
them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,
saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in
this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine,
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

[Sidenote: The Acts 6]

Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey
God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye
slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand
to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and
forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things; and so
is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to
slay them. Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people,
and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; and said unto
them, Ye men of Israel, refrain from these men, and let them alone: for
if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if
it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to
fight against God. And to him they agreed: and when they had called the
apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in
the name of Jesus, and let them go. And they departed from the presence
of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame
for his name. And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased
not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.




CHAPTER 70

STEPHEN


AND Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles
among the people. Then there arose certain of the synagogue, disputing
with Stephen. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the
spirit by which he spake. Then they suborned men, which said, We have
heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. And
they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came
upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, and set up
false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous
words against this holy place, and the law: for we have heard him say,
that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change
the customs which Moses delivered us. And all that sat in the council,
looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an
angel.

Then said the high priest, Are these things so? And Stephen answered
and said, Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and
they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One;
of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: who have received
the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.

When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they
gnashed on him with their teeth. But he, being full of the Holy Ghost,
looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus
standing on the right hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens
opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. Then
they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon
him with one accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and
the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying,
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled down, and cried with a
loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had
said this, he fell asleep. And Saul was consenting unto his death. And
at that time there was a great persecution against the church which
was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the
regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. And devout men
carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. As
for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and
haling men and women committed them to prison. Therefore they that were
scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.




CHAPTER 71

SIMON THE SORCERER--THE ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH


[Sidenote: The Acts 8]

THEN Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. And
there was great joy in that city. But there was a certain man, called
Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched
the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: to
whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This
man is the great power of God. But when they believed Philip preaching
the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ,
they were baptized, both men and women. Then Simon himself believed
also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered,
beholding the miracles and signs which were done.

[Sidenote: The Acts 8]

Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when
they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy
Ghost: (for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then laid they their hands
on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. And when Simon saw that
through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he
offered them money, saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever
I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said unto him,
Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift
of God may be purchased with money. Thou hast neither part nor lot in
this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent
therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought
of thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou art in
the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. Then answered
Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things
which ye have spoken come upon me. And they, when they had testified
and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached
the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go
toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,
which is desert. And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia,
an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians,
who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for
to worship, was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
prophet. Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself
to this chariot. And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the
prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? And he
said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip
that he would come up and sit with him. The place of the scripture
which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and
like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: in
his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare
his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. And the eunuch
answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet
this? of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opened his mouth,
and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. And as
they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch
said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And
Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And
he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both
into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And
when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught
away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way
rejoicing.




CHAPTER 72

THE CONVERSION OF SAUL


AND Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired of him
letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this
way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto
Jerusalem. And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly
there shined round about him a light from heaven: and he fell to the
earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus
whom thou persecutest. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what
wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. And the men
which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing
no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into
Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
drink.

And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him
said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here,
Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which
is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called
Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, and hath seen in a vision a
man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might
receive his sight. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of
this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: and
here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on
thy name. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen
vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the
children of Israel: for I will shew him how great things he must suffer
for my name's sake. And Ananias went his way, and entered into the
house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even
Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent
me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy
Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:
and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. And when
he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days
with the disciples which were at Damascus. And straightway he preached
Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.

[Sidenote: The Acts 9]

And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill
him: but their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the
gates day and night to kill him. Then the disciples took him by night,
and let him down by the wall in a basket. And when Saul was come to
Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they
were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. But
Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto
them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to
him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.




CHAPTER 73

DORCAS



[Sidenote: The Acts 9]

NOW there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works
and almsdeeds which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that
she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in
an upper chamber. And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the
disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men,
desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. Then Peter arose
and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper
chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats
and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. But Peter put
them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the
body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw
Peter, she sat up. And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and
when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive. And it
was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.




CHAPTER 74

CORNELIUS


THERE was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the
band called the Italian band, a devout man, and one that feared God
with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to
God alway. He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day
an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. And
when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And
he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial
before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose
surname is Peter: he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is
by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. And when
the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his
household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him
continually; and when he had declared all these things unto them, he
sent them to Joppa.

On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the
city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made
ready, he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain
vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the
four corners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner
of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping
things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise,
Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never
eaten any thing that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto
him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou
common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into
heaven. Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he
had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius
stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was
surnamed Peter, were lodged there.

While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold,
three men seek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with
them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. Then Peter went down to
the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I
am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? And they
said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God,
and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from
God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words
of thee. Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow
Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied
him.

And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited
for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. And
as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet,
and worshipped him. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself
also am a man. And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many
that were come together. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it
is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come
unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not
call any man common or unclean. Therefore came I unto you without
gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent
ye have sent for me? And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting
until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and,
behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said, Cornelius,
thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the
sight of God. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose
surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by
the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. Immediately
therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come.
Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things
that are commanded thee of God.

[Sidenote: The Acts 10]

Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God
is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him,
and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. The word which God
sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ:
(he is Lord of all:) that word, I say, ye know, which was published
throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which
John preached; how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were
oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. And we are witnesses of
all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem;
whom they slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day,
and shewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen
before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he
rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and
to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of
quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his
name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

[Sidenote: The Acts 12]

While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them
which heard the word. And they of the circumcision which believed were
astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles
also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them
speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man
forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received
the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in
the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: and when he had
found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a
whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much
people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there
stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that
there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to
pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every man
according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren
which dwelt in Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the elders by
the hands of Barnabas and Saul.




CHAPTER 75

PETER IN PRISON


NOW about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex
certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of John with the
sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
to take Peter also. And when he had apprehended him, he put him in
prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep
him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. Peter
therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of
the church unto God for him. And when Herod would have brought him
forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound
with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And,
behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in
the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying,
Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel
said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did.
And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And
he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was
done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. When they were past the
first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth
unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went
out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed
from him. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out
of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of
the Jews. And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house
of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were
gathered together praying. And as Peter knocked at the door of the
gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter's
voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how
Peter stood before the gate. And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But
she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his
angel. But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,
and saw him, they were astonished. But he, beckoning unto them with the
hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought
him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James,
and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. Now
as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what
was become of Peter. And when Herod had sought for him, and found him
not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to
death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.

And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
throne, and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout,
saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. And immediately the
angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he
was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.




CHAPTER 76

MISSION OF PAUL AND BARNABAS TO THE GENTILES


[Sidenote: The Acts 13]

NOW there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and
teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen,
and Saul. As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have
called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands
on them, they sent them away. So they, being sent forth by the Holy
Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the
synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.

[Sidenote: The Acts 14]

And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:
which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent
man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of
God. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. Then
Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his
eyes on him, and said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou
child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not
cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand
of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun
for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness;
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. Then the
deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the
doctrine of the Lord.

Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga
in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. But
when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and
went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. And after
the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue
sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of
exhortation for the people, say on. Then Paul stood up, and preached
unto them of Jesus and the resurrection. And when the Jews were gone
out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be
preached to them the next sabbath.

And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear
the word of God. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled
with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,
contradicting and blaspheming. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and
said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been
spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves
unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath
the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the
Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the
earth. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed. And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
region. But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and
Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. But they shook off
the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. And the
disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost. And they
came unto Lystra. And there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet,
being a cripple who never had walked: the same heard Paul speak: who
stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be
healed, said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
leaped and walked. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they
lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods
are come down to us in the likeness of men. And they called Barnabas,
Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Then
the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and
garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their
clothes, and scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done
sacrifice unto them. And they departed to Derbe. And when they had
preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned
again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, confirming the souls of
the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that
we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. And
when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with
fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. And
after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. And
when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
and thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to
the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. And when they were
come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God
had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the
Gentiles. And there they abode long time with the disciples. And Paul
said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every
city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
But Paul thought not good to take him with them. And the contention was
so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other:
and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; and Paul chose
Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace
of God. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.




CHAPTER 77

PAUL AND SILAS IMPRISONED


[Sidenote: The Acts 16]

NOW when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia,
they came down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night;
There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into
Macedonia, and help us. And after he had seen the vision, immediately
we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord
had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. Therefore loosing
from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the
next day to Neapolis; and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief
city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city
abiding certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a
river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and
spake unto the women which resorted thither.

[Sidenote: The Acts 16]

And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of
Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened,
that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. And when
she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye
have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and
abide there. And she constrained us.

And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed
with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much
gain by soothsaying: the same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying,
These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the
way of salvation. And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved,
turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus
Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. And when her
masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and
Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, and brought
them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly
trouble our city, and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to
receive, neither to observe, being Romans. And the multitude rose up
together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and
commanded to beat them. And when they had laid many stripes upon them,
they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison,
and made their feet fast in the stocks.

And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and
the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so
that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the
doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. And the keeper
of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors
open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing
that the prisoners had been fled. But Paul cried with a loud voice,
saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. Then he called for a
light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul
and Silas, and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
be saved, and thy house. And they spake unto him the word of the Lord,
and to all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of
the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his,
straightway. And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat
before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. And
when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those
men go. And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in
peace. But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust
us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch
us out. And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. And they came and
besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of
the city. And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house
of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and
departed.

IN THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM, SOUTH KENSINGTON, LONDON]




CHAPTER 78

PAUL PREACHES AT THESSALONICA, ATHENS, AND CORINTH


NOW when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came
to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: and Paul, as his
manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with
them out of the scriptures, opening and alleging, that Christ must
needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this
Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. And some of them believed,
and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great
multitude, and of the chief women not a few.

But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
certain fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all
the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought
to bring them out to the people. And when they found them not, they
drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying,
These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; whom
Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar,
saying that there is another king, one Jesus. And they troubled the
people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.

[Sidenote: The Acts 17]

And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto
Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. These
were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the
word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily,
whether those things were so. Therefore many of them believed; also of
honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. But when the
Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of
Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. And
then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the
sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. And they that conducted
Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas
and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.

Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in
him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. Then Paul stood in
the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that
in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld
your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN
GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord
of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither
is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing
he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; and hath made of one
blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and
hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their
habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel
after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: for
in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your
own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as
we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is
like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all
men every where to repent: because he hath appointed a day, in the
which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath
ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
raised him from the dead.

[Sidenote: The Acts 18]

And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and
others said, We will hear thee again of this matter. So Paul departed
from among them. Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed:
among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named
Damaris, and others with them.

After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; and
found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from
Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded
all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. And because he
was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their
occupation they were tentmakers. And he reasoned in the synagogue every
sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. And when Silas and
Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit,
and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. And when they opposed
themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them,
Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will
go unto the Gentiles. Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a
vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: for I am with
thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people
in this city. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching
the word of God among them.




CHAPTER 79

GALLIO


AND when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection
with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the
law. And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto
the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews,
reason would that I should bear with you: but if it be a question of
words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge
of such matters. And he drave them from the judgment seat. Then all the
Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him
before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.

And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his
leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him
Priscilla and Aquila. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but
he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: and many that
believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. Many of them
also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned
them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it
fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily grew the word of God and
prevailed.




CHAPTER 80

A PART OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS


[Sidenote: I. Corinthians 1]

PAUL, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of
God, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every
place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and
our's: grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
the Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto
the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Now I beseech you,
brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the
same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be
perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which
are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of
Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? was Paul
crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? Eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,
the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. Who is Paul,
and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord
gave to every man? I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the
increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he
that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. For we are labourers
together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. For
other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
Christ. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him
shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's; whether
Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
present, or things to come; all are your's; and ye are Christ's; and
Christ is God's. Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye
do, do all to the glory of God.

[Sidenote: I. Corinthians 10]

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And
though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and
all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove
mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all
my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long,
and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is
not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own,
is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity,
but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but
whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues,
they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is
perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I
was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as
a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now
we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in
part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth
faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.

Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto
you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand. For I delivered
unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died
for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and
that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: and
that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, he was
seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part
remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he
was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was
seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the least
of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because
I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I
am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I
laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God
which was with me.

Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some
among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be
no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ
be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they
also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life
only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now
is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that
slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be
made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then cometh the end,
when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;
when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For
he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last
enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body
do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,
except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body
that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other
grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every
seed his own body. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory
of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth
from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.
It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised
in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And as we have
borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the
heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. For
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,
and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O
death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of
death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God,
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.




CHAPTER 81

DIANA OF THE EPHESIANS


[Sidenote: The Acts 19]

AFTER these things Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed
through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have
been there, I must also see Rome. So he sent into Macedonia two of them
that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed
in Asia for a season. And the same time there arose no small stir about
that way. For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said,
Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. Moreover ye see
and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia,
this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that
they be no gods, which are made with hands: so that not only this our
craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the
great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be
destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. And when they heard
these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is
Diana of the Ephesians.

And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius
and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they
rushed with one accord into the theatre. And when Paul would have
entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. And
certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him,
desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.
Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly
was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come
together. And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he dismissed
the assembly. And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.




CHAPTER 82

A PART OF THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS


[Sidenote: II. Cor. 1]

PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our
brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the
saints which are in all Achaia: grace be to you and peace from God
our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be God, even the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of
all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be
able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith
we ourselves are comforted of God. For our light affliction, which
is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but
at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are
temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. For we know
that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home
in the body, we are absent from the Lord: (for we walk by faith, not by
sight:) we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
the body, and to be present with the Lord. Wherefore we labour, that,
whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. For we must all
appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive
the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether
it be good or bad. For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we
thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he
died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto
themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. Therefore
if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed
away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who
hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the
ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling
the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. Now
then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by
us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath
made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him.

We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive
not the grace of God in vain. (For he saith, I have heard thee in a
time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee:
behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: but
in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much
patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes,
in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
by pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy
Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God,
by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by
honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and
yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we
live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;
as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing
all things.

Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor,
that ye through his poverty might be rich. He which soweth sparingly
shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap
also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,
so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a
cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you;
that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to
every good work.




CHAPTER 83

A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE GALATIANS


[Sidenote: Galatians 1]

PAUL, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and
God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) and all the brethren
which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: grace be to you and
peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave
himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil
world, according to the will of God and our Father.

Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree: that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
faith. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For
as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there
is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if
ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil
the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But the fruit of
the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they
that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and
lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

[Sidenote: Romans 1]

Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying
one another. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law
of Christ. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall
of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall
of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well
doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have
therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto
them who are of the household of faith. God forbid that I should
glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world
is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Christ Jesus
neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new
creature. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit. Amen.




CHAPTER 84

A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS


PAUL, a servant of Jesus Christ, to all that be in Rome, beloved of
God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father,
and the Lord Jesus Christ. As much as in me is, I am ready to preach
the gospel to you that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the
gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every
one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For
therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as
it is written, The just shall live by faith. There is no respect of
persons with God. For as many as have sinned without law shall also
perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
judged by the law; in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. Now we know that what
things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law:
that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty
before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now
the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed
by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is
by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe:
for there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of
the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus.

Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace
wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not
only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation
worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and
hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. For when we were yet
without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely
for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some
would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that,
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Wherefore, as by one man
sin entered into the world, and death by sin; so death passed upon all
men, for that all have sinned. As by one man's disobedience many were
made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it
in the lusts thereof. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin
unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But now being made free
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness,
and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death; but the
gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Sidenote: Romans 5]

There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For to be
carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and
peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. But ye are not in the
flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. For
as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. The
Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children
of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. And
we know that all things work together for good to them that love God,
to them who are the called according to his purpose. He that spared not
his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him
also freely give us all things?

Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea
rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love
of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more
than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God,
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Sidenote: The Acts 20]

I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service. Let love be without dissimulation.
Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly
affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring
one another; not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the
Lord; rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in
prayer; distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them
that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind one
toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low
estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to no man evil for
evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible,
as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved,
avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is
written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if
thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so
doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of
evil, but overcome evil with good. Owe no man any thing, but to love
one another. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is
the fulfilling of the law. For none of us liveth to himself, and no
man dieth to himself. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and
whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or
die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died, and rose,
and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. But
why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy
brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
Let not then your good be evil spoken of: for the kingdom of God is
not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost. Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.




CHAPTER 85

EUTYCHUS--THE ELDERS OF EPHESUS


AND when the Jews laid wait for Paul, as he was about to sail into
Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. And we sailed away
from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to Troas,
where we abode seven days. And upon the first day of the week, when the
disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready
to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. And
there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered
together. And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he
sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken
up dead. And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. When he therefore was
come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long
while, even till break of day, so he departed. And they brought the
young man alive, and were not a little comforted.

And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to
take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. And
when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Miletus. And
from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the
first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you
at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with
many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of
the Jews: and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,
but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to
house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. And now, behold,
I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that
shall befall me there: save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every
city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.

[Sidenote: The Acts 20]

But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto
myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry,
which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the
grace of God. And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have
gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. Wherefore
I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all
men. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace.
I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye yourselves
know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them
that were with me. I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring
ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord
Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them
all. And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should
see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.




CHAPTER 86

PAUL GOES UP TO JERUSALEM


[Sidenote: The Acts 21]

AND it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
launched, we came with a straight course unto Patara: and finding a
ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth, and
landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. And when
we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. And the
day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were
present. And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

And Paul and the men that were with him went into the temple. And the
Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up
all the people, and laid hands on him. And all the city was moved,
and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of
the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut. And as they went about
to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that
all Jerusalem was in an uproar. Who immediately took soldiers and
centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain
and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. Then the chief captain
came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains;
and demanded who he was, and what he had done. And some cried one
thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know
the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the
castle. And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
of the soldiers for the violence of the people. For the multitude of
the people followed after, crying, Away with him. And as Paul was to be
led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, I beseech thee,
suffer me to speak unto the people. And when he had given him licence,
Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people.
And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the
Hebrew tongue, and declared to them how he was converted to the faith
of Christ, and that he was sent to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.

And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their
voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is
not fit that he should live. And as they cried out, and cast off their
clothes, and threw dust into the air, the chief captain commanded him
to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by
scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that
stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and
uncondemned? When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief
captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a
Roman? He said, Yea. And the chief captain answered, With a great
sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born. Then
straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and
the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman,
and because he had bound him. On the morrow, because he would have
known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him
from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council
to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.




CHAPTER 87

PAUL SENT UNTO FELIX


AND Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I
have lived in all good conscience before God until this day. And the
high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on
the mouth. Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited
wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to
be smitten contrary to the law? And they that stood by said, Revilest
thou God's high priest? Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he
was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of
the ruler of thy people. And when there arose a great dissension, the
chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of
them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from
among them, and to bring him into the castle. And the night following
the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou
hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at
Rome.

[Sidenote: The Acts 23]

And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound
themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink
till they had killed Paul. And they came to the chief priests and
elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we
will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. And when Paul's sister's
son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle,
and told Paul. Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and
said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a
certain thing to tell him. So he took him, and brought him to the chief
captain. Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with
him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest
bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would
enquire somewhat of him more perfectly. But do not thou yield unto
them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men, which have
bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink
till they have killed him. So the chief captain then let the young man
depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed
these things to me. And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make
ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore
and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; and
provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto
Felix the governor. And he wrote a letter after this manner:

Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth
greeting. This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed
of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood
that he was a Roman. And when I would have known the cause wherefore
they accused him, I brought him forth into their council: whom I
perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing
laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. And when it was told me
how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee,
and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they
had against him. Farewell.

[Sidenote: The Acts 24]

Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought
him by night to Antipatris. On the morrow they left the horsemen
to go with him, who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the
epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. And when the
governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And
when he understood that he was of Cilicia; I will hear thee, said he,
when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in
Herod's judgment hall.

And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders,
and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor
against Paul. And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse
him, saying, We have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover
of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader
of the sect of the Nazarenes: who also hath gone about to profane the
temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. But
the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him
away out of our hands, commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by
examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
whereof we accuse him. And the Jews also assented, saying that these
things were so.

Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak,
answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge
unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: because
that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I
went up to Jerusalem for to worship. And they neither found me in the
temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither
in the synagogues, nor in the city. But this I confess unto thee,
that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my
fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the
prophets: and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and
unjust. And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
void of offence toward God, and toward men.

And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of
that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain
shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. And he
commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and
that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto
him. And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the
faith in Christ. And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and
judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this
time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. He hoped
also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose
him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix,
willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.




CHAPTER 88

PAUL ACCUSED BEFORE FESTUS


Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. Then the high priest and the chief
of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, that he would
send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. But
Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he
himself would depart shortly thither. Let them therefore, said he,
which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if
there be any wickedness in him. And when he had tarried among them more
than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on
the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. And when he was come,
the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid
many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said,
Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things
before me? Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I
ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well
knowest. For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy
of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things
whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto
Caesar.

[Sidenote: The Acts 25]

Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast
thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to
salute Festus. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared
Paul's cause unto the king. Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also
hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. And on
the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and
was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and
principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought
forth. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the
Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that
he ought not to live any longer. Of whom I have no certain thing to
write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and
specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I
might have somewhat to write. For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send
a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

[Sidenote: The Acts 26]

Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.
Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: I think
myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day
before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews.
My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine
own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; which knew me from the
beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect
of our religion I lived a Pharisee. And now I stand and am judged for
the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers. I verily thought
with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of
Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of
the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the
chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to
blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them
even unto strange cities.

Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the
chief priests, at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven,
above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which
journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard
a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
the pricks. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus
whom thou persecutest. But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have
appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a
witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people,
and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes,
and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance
among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision: but shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they
should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. Having
therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing
both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the
prophets and Moses did say should come: that Christ should suffer, and
that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should
shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.

And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul,
thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. But he
said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of
truth and soberness. For the king knoweth of these things, before whom
also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are
hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa,
believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa
said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. And Paul
said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me
this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these
bonds.

And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and
Bernice, and they that sat with them: and when they were gone aside,
they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy
of death or of bonds. Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might
have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.




CHAPTER 89

PAUL SENT TO ROME


AND when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a
centurion of Augustus' band. And entering into a ship of Adramyttium,
we launched, and the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius
courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his
friends to refresh himself. And when we had launched from thence, we
sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. And when we had
sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city
of Lycia. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
into Italy; and he put us therein. And when we had sailed slowly many
days, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against
Salmone; and, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called
the Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. Now when much
time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast
was now already past, Paul admonished them, and said unto them, Sirs,
I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not
only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. Nevertheless the
centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than
those things which were spoken by Paul. And when the south wind blew
softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence,
they sailed close by Crete.

[Sidenote: The Acts 27]

But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind. And when
the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her
drive. And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
they lightened the ship; and the third day we cast out with our own
hands the tackling of the ship. And when neither sun nor stars in many
days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should
be saved was then taken away. But after long abstinence Paul stood
forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened
unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm
and loss. And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall
be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. For there
stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God
hath given thee all them that sail with thee. Wherefore, sirs, be of
good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

[Sidenote: The Acts 28]

But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down
in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some
country. Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen
souls. And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered
a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if
it were possible, to thrust in the ship. And falling into a place
where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck
fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with
the violence of the waves. And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the
prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.

But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose;
and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first
into the sea, and get to land: and the rest, some on boards, and some
on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped
all safe to land.

And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called
Melita. And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they
kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain,
and because of the cold. And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks,
and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and
fastened on his hand. And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast
hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a
murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth
not to live. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no
harm. Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down
dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm
come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had
wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. And landing at
Syracuse, we tarried there three days: and so we went toward Rome. And
when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii
forum, and the Three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and
took courage. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the
prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell
by himself with a soldier that kept him. And Paul dwelt two whole
years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern
the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.




CHAPTER 90

A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS


PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints
which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: grace be to
you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of his grace. For by grace are ye saved through
faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works,
lest any man should boast. For this cause I bow my knees unto the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and
earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his
glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted
and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is
the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of
Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the
fulness of God.

[Sidenote: Ephesians 1]

I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness
and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope
of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father
of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. Wherefore
putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we
are members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun
go down upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil.

Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working
with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him
that needeth. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,
but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister
grace unto the hearers.

And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and
clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and
be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even
as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. And, ye
fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord.

Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the
flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto
Christ; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as the servants of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing
service, as to the Lord, and not to men: knowing that whatsoever good
thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether
he be bond or free. And, ye masters, do the same things unto them,
forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven;
neither is there respect of persons with him.

Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil. Stand therefore, having your loins girt
about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and
your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all,
taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and
the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: praying always with
all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
all perseverance and supplication for all saints.




CHAPTER 91

A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS


[Sidenote: Philippians 1]

PAUL and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in
Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: grace
be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus
Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every
prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, for your fellowship
in the gospel from the first day until now; being confident of this
very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it
until the day of Jesus Christ.

Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made
himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and
was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man,
he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of
the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea
doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of
all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be
found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law,
but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
is of God by faith. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended:
but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the
mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. For our
conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour,
the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be
fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby
he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. Be careful
for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of
God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds
through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think
on these things. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
Amen.




CHAPTER 92

A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS


IF ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on
things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your
life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall
appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore
your members which are upon the earth. But now ye also put off all
these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of
your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the
old man with his deeds; and have put on the new man, which is renewed
in knowledge after the image of him that created him: where there is
neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,
Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. Put on
therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies,
kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one
another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against
any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these
things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the
peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in
one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the
Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him; knowing that of
the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve
the Lord Christ. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong
which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

[Sidenote: Colossians 3]




CHAPTER 93

A PART OF THE EPISTLES OF PAUL TO TIMOTHY


[Sidenote: I. Timothy 1]

PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; unto Timothy, my
own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and
Jesus Christ our Lord. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of
whom I am chief.

Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into
this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food
and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich
fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful
lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of
money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they
have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many
sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the
good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also
called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded,
nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us
richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in
good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate. Wherefore I
put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in
thee by the putting on of my hands. Be not thou therefore ashamed of
the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker
of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; who
hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to
our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given
us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by
the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death,
and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not
ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is
able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Flee
also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace,
with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Continue thou in
the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing
of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known
the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may
be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For I am now ready to be
offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good
fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth
there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but
unto all them also that love his appearing.




CHAPTER 94

A PART OF THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS


GOD, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto
the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by
his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express
image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of
the Majesty on high.

Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in
things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able
to succour them that are tempted.

[Sidenote: Hebrews 1]

Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For
we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling
of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace,
that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
And truly there were many priests, because they were not suffered to
continue by reason of death: but this man, because he continueth ever,
hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them
to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to
make intercession for them. For such an high priest became us, who is
holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than
the heavens; who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this
he did once, when he offered up himself. So Christ was once offered to
bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear
the second time without sin unto salvation.

For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take
away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: in
burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then
said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to
do thy will, O God. By the which will we are sanctified through the
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

[Sidenote: Hebrews 11]

Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated
for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an
high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart
in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast
the profession of our faith without wavering; for he is faithful that
promised.

Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by
the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things
which do appear. Without faith it is impossible to please God: for he
that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder
of them that diligently seek him. By faith Noah, being warned of God
of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the
saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became
heir of the righteousness which is by faith. By faith Abraham, when he
was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an
inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By
faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country,
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of
the same promise: for he looked for a city which hath foundations,
whose builder and maker is God. By faith Abraham, when he was tried,
offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his
only begotten son. By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused
to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than
the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the
reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of
Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also,
and Samuel, and of the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms,
wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of
weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight
the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life
again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they
might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel
mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they
were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with
the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being
destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:)
they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of
the earth.

[Sidenote: Hebrews 12]

Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith;
who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against
himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet
resisted unto blood, striving against sin. And ye have forgotten the
exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise
not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked
of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you
as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? Now
no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:
nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
unto them which are exercised thereby. Follow peace with all men, and
holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.

Let brotherly love continue. Be not forgetful to entertain strangers:
for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Let your
conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things
as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not
fear what man shall do unto me. Remember them which have the rule over
you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow,
considering the end of their conversation. Jesus Christ the same
yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

BOOK V--LETTERS OF JAMES, PETER, AND JOHN




CHAPTER 95

A PART OF THE EPISTLE OF JAMES


JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. My brethren, count it all
joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying
of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work,
that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. If any of you lack
wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith,
nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven
with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall
receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all
his ways. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
but the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the
grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning
heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and
the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man
fade away in his ways. Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for
when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord
hath promised to them that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted,
I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away
of his own lust, and enticed. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every
good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from
the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. Wherefore, my beloved
brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. Wherefore
lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive
with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth
himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of
man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of
the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. Pure religion and
undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless
and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the
world.

My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
glory, with respect of persons. For if there come unto your assembly a
man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor
man in vile raiment; and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay
clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to
the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: are ye not
then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this
world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to
them that love him?

[Sidenote: James 2]

For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy;
and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. What doth it profit, my brethren,
though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save
him? If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and
one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled;
notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to
the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works,
is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have
works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my
faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest
well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain
man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father
justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith
made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham
believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he
was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man is
justified, and not by faith only.

[Sidenote: I. Peter 1]

My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the
greater condemnation. For in many things we offend all. If any man
offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to
bridle the whole body. Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that
they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. Behold also the
ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds,
yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the
governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth
great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And
the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among
our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire
the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. For every kind
of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea,
is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: but the tongue can no man
tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Therewith bless we
God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after
the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and
cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. Doth a fountain
send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig
tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no
fountain both yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise man and endued
with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his
works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife
in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. For where
envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. But
the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,
and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is
sown in peace of them that make peace. Behold, we count them happy
which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the
end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be
yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. Is any among
you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. Is any
sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;
and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your
faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Let him
know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way
shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.




CHAPTER 96

A PART OF THE EPISTLES OF PETER


PETER, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, grace unto
you, and peace, be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten
us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power
of God through faith unto salvation.

But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner
of conversation. Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes,
desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby. Honour
all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. This is
thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering
wrongfully. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also
suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when
he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not;
but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: who his own self
bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,
should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For
ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd
and Bishop of your souls. Finally, be ye all of one mind, having
compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:
not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise
blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit
a blessing. The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
and watch unto prayer. And above all things have fervent charity among
yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. Likewise, ye
younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject
one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the
proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore
under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. Be sober, be
vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh
about, seeking whom he may devour.

[Sidenote: I. Peter 2]

I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by
putting you in remembrance; knowing that shortly I must put off this my
tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with
the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord
is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but
is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but
that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come
as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with
a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth
also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then
that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought
ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness? Nevertheless we,
according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for
such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without
spot, and blameless.




CHAPTER 97

A PART OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN


[Sidenote: I. John 1]

THAT which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may
have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father,
and with his Son Jesus Christ. This then is the message which we have
heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is
no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and
walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the
light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and
the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not
sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for
ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. And hereby we do
know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I
know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth
is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love
of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he
abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. He
that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness
even until now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and
there is none occasion of stumbling in him. I write unto you, little
children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. Love
not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man
love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is
in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the
pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world
passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God
abideth for ever.

Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not,
because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it
doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every
man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the
transgression of the law. And ye know that he was manifested to take
away our sins; and in him is no sin.

Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen
him, neither known him. Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of
God, neither he that loveth not his brother. For this is the message
that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for
us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso hath
this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his
bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? My
little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in
deed and in truth. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of
God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that
loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested
the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son
into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not
that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also
to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one
another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Hereby
know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of
his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the
Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus
is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have
known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he
that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our
love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment:
because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love;
but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that
feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first
loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he
love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him,
that he who loveth God love his brother also.




CHAPTER 98

JOHN TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES OF ASIA


[Sidenote: Rev. 1]

JOHN to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and
peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from
Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of
the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved
us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us
kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion
for ever and ever. Amen.

Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they
also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
because of him. Even so, Amen.

[Sidenote: Rev. 4]

I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and
in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is
called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus
Christ. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me
a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the
first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send
it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto
Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto
Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. And I turned to see the voice that
spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and
in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man,
clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with
a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white
as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like unto
fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound
of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of
his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the
sun shineth in his strength. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as
dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not;
I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and,
behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of
death. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are,
and the things which shall be hereafter.




CHAPTER 99

THE THRONE AND THE LAMB


AFTER this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the
first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me;
which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be
hereafter. And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne
was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. And he that sat was to
look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow
round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round about
the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four
and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on
their heads crowns of gold. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings
and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning
before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and
in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four
beasts full of eyes before and behind. And I saw in the right hand of
him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside,
sealed with seven seals. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst stood a
Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are
the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and
took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty
elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and
golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. And they
sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open
the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by
thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on
the earth. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round
about the throne: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten
thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy
is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom,
and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature
which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as
are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing,
and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. After this I beheld, and,
lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and
kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before
the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried
with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon
the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about
the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before
the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Blessing, and
glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might,
be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.

[Sidenote: Rev. 7]

And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which
are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him,
Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of
great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in
the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God,
and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the
throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For
the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall
lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes.

And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a
cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the
sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: and he had in his hand a little
book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot
on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and
when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the
seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I
heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which
the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel which I
saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven,
and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that
therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there
should be time no longer.

[Sidenote: Rev. 17]

And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an
hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in
their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song
before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no
man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand,
which were redeemed from the earth. And in their mouth was found no
guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.

And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud
voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment
is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
the fountains of waters. Here is the patience of the saints: here are
they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I
heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that
they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. And
I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like
unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand
a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with
a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and
reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the
earth is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on
the earth; and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of the
temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another
angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried
with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy
sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for
her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust in his sickle into the
earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great
winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden without
the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse
bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that
had gotten the victory stand on the sea of glass, having the harps
of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God
Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall
not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy.
And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye
his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. And I heard
as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. And I saw a great white throne, and
him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away;
and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and
great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book
was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of
those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell
delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every
man according to their works.




CHAPTER 100

THE NEW JERUSALEM


AND I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the
first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John
saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice
out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and
he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself
shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things
are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make
all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true
and faithful. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit
all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. And the city
had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the
glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And
the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no
night there. And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but
they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

[Sidenote: Rev. 21]

And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of
the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree
of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit
every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
nations. And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and
of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: and they
shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. And there
shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the
sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever
and ever.

[Sidenote: Rev. 22]

And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly: blessed
is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. And I
John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen,
I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me
these things. Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep
the sayings of this book: worship God. And he saith unto me, Seal not
the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. He
that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let
him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come
quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his
work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the
first and the last. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that
they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
gates into the city. I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you
these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David,
and the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say,
Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst
come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. He
which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even
so, come, Lord Jesus.

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
