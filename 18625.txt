HOW TO USE THIS BOOK


This book is intended as a companion volume to _Contemporary British
Literature_; but the differences between conditions in America and in
England have made it necessary to alter somewhat the original plan.

In America today we have a few excellent writers who challenge comparison
with the best of present-day England. We have many more who have been
widely successful in the business of making novels, poems, plays, which
cannot rank as literature at all. In choosing from such a large number a
list for study, it is our hope that we have not omitted the name of any
author who counts as a force in our developing literature; but, on the
other hand, it is undoubtedly true that we have excluded many writers
whose work compares favorably with that of some on the list. Our choice
has been governed by two principles: (1) To include experimental
work--work dealing with fresh materials or attempting new methods--rather
than better work on familiar patterns; and (2) to represent varying
tendencies in the literary effort of our country today rather than work
that ranks high in popular taste. The task of doing justice to every
writer is impossible; but we have been primarily concerned not with
writers but with readers--those who wish guidance to the best that there
is in our literature and to the signs that point to the future.

The word _contemporary_ we have interpreted arbitrarily to mean since the
beginning of the War, excluding writers who died before August, 1914, and
living authors who have produced no work since then. Space limitations
made it impossible to go back to the beginning of the century, and no
other date since then is so significant as 1914.

The biographical material is limited to information of interest for the
interpretation of work. The bibliographies are selective except in the
case of the more important authors, for whom they are, for the student's
purpose, complete. The following items have usually been omitted: (1)
books privately printed; (2) separate editions of works included in
larger volumes; (3) unimportant or inaccessible works; (4) works not of a
literary character; (5) English reprints; (6) editions other than the
first. Exceptions to this plan explain themselves.

The stars (*) are merely guides to the reader in long bibliographies and
bibliographies containing works of very unequal merit.

The Suggestions for Reading given in the case of the more important
authors are intended for students who need and desire guidance. It is our
hope that these hints and questions may lead to discussion and
differences of opinion, for dissent is the guidepost to truth. As far as
possible, we have avoided statement of our own opinions.

The Studies and Reviews are the meagre result of long search in
periodical literature. The fact that the photograph and the personal note
bulk far more largely than criticism in America needs no comment here.

Supplementary to the alphabetical list of authors with material for
study, which constitutes the body of the book, are the classified
indexes. These are intended for use in planning courses of study. The
classification according to form suggests the limitation of work to
poets, dramatists, novelists, short-story writers, essayists, critics,
writers on country life, travel, and Nature, humorists, "columnists," and
writers of biography and autobiography. In this connection should be
noted the supplementary list of poets whose names have not been included
in our list but whose work can be studied in one or more of the
anthologies indicated.

The classification according to birthplace (in some cases information
could not be obtained) furnishes material for the study of local groups
of writers.

The classification according to subject matter (including the use of
local color and background), although it is necessarily incomplete,
will, it is hoped, suggest courses of reading on these bases.

Preceding the alphabetical list of authors are bibliographies of
different types, which should be of use in the finding of material: lists
of indexes and critical periodicals; of general works of reference
discussing the period; of collections of poems, plays, short-stories, and
essays; and of bibliographies of short plays and short stories.

Our thanks for criticisms and suggestions are due to Professors Robert
Herrick, Robert Morss Lovett, and Percy Holmes Boynton.

To Mr. G. Teyen, of the Chicago Public Library, we are indebted for
continual help in procuring books, verifying references, and, in general,
for putting the resources of the library at our disposal.

CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN LITERATURE

ALPHABETICAL LIST OF AUTHORS


+Franklin Pierce Adams+--(Illinois, 1881)--humorous poet, "columnist."

Editor of "The Conning Tower" in the _New York World_.

For bibliography, cf. _Who's Who in America_.



+Henry (Brooks) Adams+--man of letters.

Born in Boston, 1838. Great-grandson of John Adams and grandson of John
Quincy Adams, presidents of the United States. Brother of Charles Francis
and Brooks Adams. A.B., Harvard, 1858, LL.D., Western Reserve, 1892.

Secretary to his father, Charles Francis Adams, American Minister to
England, 1861-8. Assistant professor at Harvard, 1870-7, and editor of
_North American Review_, 1870-6.

Lived in Washington from 1877 until his death in 1918, but traveled
extensively and knew many famous people.

In memory of his wife, he commissioned Saint Gaudens to make for her tomb
in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, the statue sometimes called
_Silence_, which is one of the sculptor's most beautiful works.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. _The Education of Henry Adams_ is autobiographic.

The persistent irony of the presentation should be corrected by reading
Brooks Adams's account of his brother.

2. _Mont Saint Michel and Chartres_ is an attempt to interpret the spirit
of mediaeval architecture, both secular and ecclesiastical. To appreciate
it fully, familiarity with the subject is necessary.

The novels are worth study as satires.

Born at Savannah, Georgia, 1889. A.B., Harvard, 1912. Has lived abroad,
in London, Rome, and Windermere.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. A good introduction to Mr. Aiken's verse is his own explanation of his
theory in _Poetry_, 14 ('19); 152ff. To readers to whom this is not
accessible, the following extracts may furnish some clue as to his aim
and method:

     What I had from the outset been somewhat doubtfully hankering for
     was some way of getting contrapuntal effects in poetry--the effects
     of contrasting and conflicting tones and themes, a kind of
     underlying simultaneity in dissimilarity. It seemed to me that by
     using a large medium, dividing it into several main parts, and
     subdividing these parts into short movements in various veins and
     forms, this was rendered possible. I do not wish to press the
     musical analogies too closely. I am aware that the word symphony, as
     a musical term, has a very definite meaning, and I am aware that it
     is only with considerable license that I use the term for such poems
     as _Senlin_ or _Forslin_, which have three and five parts
     respectively, and do not in any orthodox way develop their themes.
     But the effect obtained is, very roughly speaking, that of the
     symphony, or symphonic poem. Granted that one has chosen a theme--or
     been chosen by a theme!--which will permit rapid changes of tone,
     which will not insist on a tone too static, it will be seen that
     there is no limit to the variety of effects obtainable: for not only
     can one use all the simpler poetic tones...; but, since one is using
     them as parts of a larger design, one can also obtain novel effects
     by placing them in juxtaposition as consecutive movements....

     All this, I must emphasize, is no less a matter of emotional tone
     than of form; the two things cannot well be separated. For such
     symphonic effects one employs what one might term emotion-mass with
     just as deliberate a regard for its position in the total design as
     one would employ a variation of form. One should regard this or that
     emotional theme as a musical unit having such-and-such a tone
     quality, and use it only when that particular tone-quality is
     wanted. Here I flatly give myself away as being in reality in quest
     of a sort of absolute poetry, a poetry in which the intention is not
     so much to arouse an emotion merely, or to persuade of a reality, as
     to employ such emotion or sense of reality (tangentially struck)
     with the same cool detachment with which a composer employs notes or
     chords. Not content to present emotions or things or sensations for
     their own sakes--as is the case with most poetry--this method takes
     only the most delicately evocative aspects of them, makes of them a
     keyboard, and plays upon them a music of which the chief
     characteristic is its elusiveness, its fleetingness, and its
     richness in the shimmering overtones of hint and suggestion. Such a
     poetry, in other words, will not so much present an idea as use its
     resonance.

2. An interesting comparison may be made between the work of Mr. Aiken,
and that of Mr. T.S. Eliot (q.v.), of whom he is an admirer. See also
Sidney Lanier's latest poems.

3. Another interesting study is the influence of Freud upon the poetry of
Mr. Aiken.

+Sherwood Anderson+--short-story writer, novelist.

Born at Camden, Ohio, 1876. Of Scotch-Irish ancestry. Father a journeyman
harness-maker. Public school education. At the age of sixteen or
seventeen came to Chicago and worked four or five years as a laborer.
Soldier in the Spanish-American War. Later, in the advertising business.

In 1921, received the prize of $2,000 offered by _The Dial_ to further
the work of the American author considered to be most promising.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. The autobiographical element in Mr. Anderson's work is marked and
should never be forgotten in judging his work. The conventional element
is easily discoverable as patched on, particularly in the long books.

2. To realize the qualities that make some critics regard Mr. Anderson as
perhaps our most promising novelist, examples should be noted of the
following qualities which he possesses to a striking degree: (1)
independence of literary traditions and methods; (2) a keen eye for
details; (3) a passionate desire to interpret life; (4) a strong sense of
the value of individual lives of little seeming importance.

3. Are Mr. Anderson's defects due to the limitations of his experience,
or do you notice certain temperamental defects which he is not likely to
outgrow?

4. Mr. Anderson's experiments in form are interesting to study. Compare
the prosiness of his verse with his efforts to use poetic cadence in _The
Triumph of the Egg_. Does it suggest to you the possibility of developing
a form intermediate between prose and free verse?

5. Does Mr. Anderson succeed best as novelist or as short-story writer?
Why?

+(Charles) William Beebe+--Nature writer.

Born at Brooklyn, 1877. B.S., Columbia, 1898; post-graduate work, 1898-9.
Honorary Curator of Ornithology, New York Zooelogical Society since 1899;
director of the British Guiana Zooelogical Station. Has traveled
extensively in Asia, South America, and Mexico, especially, for purposes
of observation.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Although Mr. Beebe is preeminently an ornithologist, he belongs to
literature by reason of the volumes of nature studies listed below. A
comparison of his books with those of the English ornithologist, W.H.
Hudson (cf. Manly and Rickert, _Contemporary British Literature_) is
illuminative of the merits of both.

2. Another interesting comparison may be made between Mr. Beebe's
descriptions of the jungle in _Jungle Peace_ and H.M. Tomlinson's in _Sea
and Jungle_ (cf. Manly and Rickert, _op. cit._).

3. An analysis of the use of suggestion in appeal to the different senses
brings out one of the main sources of Mr. Beebe's charm as a writer.

4. Read aloud several fine passages to observe the prose rhythms.

his own statement of his creed.

+James Branch Cabell+--novelist, critic.

Born at Richmond, Virginia, 1879, of an old Southern family. A.B.,
William and Mary College, 1898, where he taught French and Greek, 1896-7.
Newspaper work from 1899-1901. Since then he has devoted his time almost
entirely to the study and writing of literature. His study of genealogy
and history has an important bearing upon his creative work.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Before reading Mr. Cabell's stories, read his _Beyond Life_, which
explains his theory of romance. He maintains that art should be based on
the dream of life as it should be, not as it is; that enduring
literature is not "reportorial work"; that there is vital falsity in
being true to life because "facts out of relation to the rest of life
become lies," and that art therefore "must become more or less an
allegory."

2. Mr. Cabell's fiction falls into two divisions:

  (1) Romances of the middle ages.
  (2) Comedies of present-day Virginia.

Both elements are found in _The Cream of the Jest_ (cf. with Du Maurier's
_Peter Ibbetson_). The romances illustrate different aspects of his
theory of chivalry; the modern comedies, his theory of gallantry (cf.
_Beyond Life_).

3. In his romances he has created an imaginary province of France, the
people of which bear names and use idioms drawn from widely diverse and
incongruous sources. His effort to create mediaeval atmosphere by the use
of archaisms does not preclude modern idiom and slang. Through all this
work, elaborate pretense of non-existent sources of the tales and
frequent allusions to fictitious authors are a part of the method. After
reading some of these stories, consider the following criticism from the
_London Times_ quoted by Mr. Cabell himself at the end of _Beyond Life_:
"It requires a nicer touch than Mr. Cabell's, to reproduce the atmosphere
of the Middle Ages ... the artifice is more apparent than the art...."

4. An interesting study is to isolate the authors for whom Mr. Cabell
expresses particular admiration and those for whom he expresses contempt
in _Beyond Life_ and to deduce from his attitudes his peculiar literary
qualities.

5. Mr. Cabell's style is notable for the elaboration of its rhythm, its
careful avoidance of _cliches_, its preference for rare, archaic words
and its allusiveness. Consider it from the point of view of sincerity,
simplicity, clarity, and charm. Does it intensify or dull your interest
in what he has to say? Study, for example, the following exposition of
his theory of art:

     For the creative artist must remember that his book is structurally
     different from life, in that, were there nothing else, his book
     begins and ends at a definite point, whereas the canons of heredity
     and religion forbid us to believe that life can ever do anything of
     the sort. He must remember that his art traces in ancestry from the
     tribal huntsman telling tales about the cave-fire; and so, strives
     to emulate not human life, but human speech, with its natural
     elisions and falsifications. He must remember, too, that his one
     concern with the one all-prevalent truth in normal existence is
     jealously to exclude it from his book.... For "living" is to be
     conscious of an incessant series of less than momentary sensations,
     of about equal poignancy, for the most part, and of nearly equal
     unimportance. Art attempts to marshal the shambling procession into
     trimness, to usurp the role of memory and convention in assigning to
     some of these sensations an especial prominence, and, in the old
     phrase, to lend perspective to the forest we cannot see because of
     the trees. Art, as long ago observed my friend Mrs. Kennaston, is an
     expurgated edition of nature: at art's touch, too, "the drossy
     particles fall off and mingle with the dust" (_Beyond Life_, p.
     249).

In summing up Mr. Cabell's work, consider the following:

  (1) Has he a definite philosophy?
  (2) Has he a genuine sense of character or do his characters
       repeat the same personality?
  (3) Is he a sincere artist or "a self-conscious attitudinizer?"
  (4) Is he likely ever to hold the high place in American
       literature which by some critics is denied him today? If so,
       on what basis?

Born at New Orleans, 1844. Educated in public schools, but has honorary
higher degrees. Served in the Confederate army, 1863-5. Reporter on the
New Orleans _Picayune_ and accountant with a firm of cotton factors,
1865-79. Since 1879, has devoted his time to literature.

Mr. Cable became at once famous for his studies of Louisiana life in _Old
Creole Days_, and his pictures of this life have given him a permanent
place in American literature. His stories should be read in connection
with those of Kate Chopin and of Grace King (q.v.).

+(William) Bliss Carman+--poet.

Born at Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, 1861. His ancestors lived in
Connecticut at the time of the Revolution. A.B., University of New
Brunswick, 1881; A.M., 1884. Studied at the University of Edinburgh,
1882-3, and at Harvard, 1886-8. Studied law two years. LL.D., University
of New Brunswick, 1906. Came to live in the United States, 1889. Has been
teacher, editor, and civil engineer.

In collaboration with Mary Perry King, Mr. Carman has produced several
poem-dances (_Daughters of Dawn_, 1913, and _Earth Deities_, 1914), which
it is interesting to compare with Mr. Lindsay's development of the idea
of the poem-game.

Mr. Carman's most admired work is to be found in the _Vagabondia_
volumes, in three of which he collaborated with Richard Hovey (1894,
1896, 1900). His _Collected Poems_ were published in 1905, and his
_Echoes from Vagabondia_, 1912.

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Miss Cather's special field is the pioneer life of immigrants in the
Middle West. Points to be considered are: (1) her realism; (2) her
detachment or objectivity; (3) her sympathy.

2. In what other respects does she stand out among the leading women
novelists of today?

3. What is the value of her material?

4. Compare her studies with those of Cahan (q.v.), Cournos (q.v.), and
Tobenkin (q.v.).

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

As an aid to analysis of Mr. Churchill's work, consider Mr. Carl Van
Doren's article in the _Nation_, of which the most striking passages are
quoted below:

     To reflect a little upon this combination of heroic color and moral
     earnestness is to discover how much Mr. Churchill owes to the
     element injected into American life by Theodore Roosevelt.... Like
     him Mr. Churchill has habitually moved along the main lines of
     national feeling--believing in America and democracy with a fealty
     unshaken by any adverse evidence and delighting in the American
     pageant with a gusto rarely modified by the exercise of any critical
     intelligence. Morally he has been strenuous and eager;
     intellectually he has been naive and belated.

       *       *       *       *       *

     Once taken by an idea for a novel, he has always burned with it as
     if it were as new to the world as to him. Here lies, without much
     question, the secret of that genuine earnestness which pervades all
     his books: he writes out of the contagious passion of a recent
     convert or a still excited discoverer. Here lies, too, without much
     question, the secret of Mr. Churchill's success in holding his
     audiences: a sort of unconscious politician among novelists, he
     gathers his premonitions at happy moments, when the drift is already
     setting in. Never once has Mr. Churchill like a philosopher or a
     seer, run off alone.

       *       *       *       *       *

     Even for those, however, who perceive that he belongs intellectually
     to a middle class which is neither very subtle nor very profound on
     the one hand nor very shrewd or very downright on the other, it is
     impossible to withhold from Mr. Churchill the respect due a sincere,
      scrupulous, and upright man who has served the truth and his art
     according to his lights.... The sounds which have reached him from
     among the people have come from those who eagerly aspire to better
     things arrived at by orderly progress, from those who desire in some
     lawful way to outgrow the injustices and inequalities of civil
     existence and by fit methods to free the human spirit from all that
     clogs and stifles it. But as they aspire and intend better than they
     think, so, in concert with them, does Mr. Churchill.

Born at Catskill-on-Hudson, New York, 1910, daughter of Grace Hazard
Conkling (q.v.). She began to talk her poems to her mother at the age of
four. Her mother took them down without change, merely arranging the line
divisions. Her earliest expression was in the form of a chant to an
imaginary companion to whom she gave the name "Mary Cobweb" (cf. Poetry,
14 ['19]: 344).

Hilda Conkling's name is included in this list, not because her poems are
remarkable for a child, but because they show actual achievement and the
highest quality of imagination.

Her work is to be found in _Poetry_, 8 ('16): 191; and 10 ('17): 197, and

+Adelaide Crapsey+--poet.

Born at Rochester, New York, 1878. A.B., Vassar, 1902. Taught English at
Kemper Hall, Kenosha, Wisconsin, 1903. In 1905, studied archaeology in
Rome. Instructor in poetics at Smith College, 1911; but stopped teaching
because of failing health. Died at Saranac Lake, 1914.

She had begun an investigation into the structure of English verse, which
she was unable to finish. Her poems were nearly all written after her
breakdown in 1913, and reflect the tragic experience through which she
was passing.

Some of them are written in a form of her own invention, the "cinquain"
(five unrhymed lines, having two, four, six, eight, and two syllables).


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Miss Crapsey's theories of versification should be remembered in
studying her forms.

2. What is to be said of her verbal economy?

3. A comparison of her verses with those of Emily Dickinson has been
suggested. Carried out in detail, it suggests interesting points of
difference as well as of resemblance.

+Gladys Cromwell+--poet.

Born in New York City, 1885. Educated in New York private schools and
lived much abroad. In 1918, with her twin sister, she went into Red Cross
Canteen work and was stationed at Chalons. As a result of depression due
to nerve strain, both sisters committed suicide by jumping overboard from
the steamer on which they were coming home. For their War service the
French Government later awarded them the Croix de Guerre. Miss Cromwell's
_Poems_ in 1919 divided with Mr. Neihardt's (q.v.) _Song of Three
Friends_ the annual prize of the Poetry Society of America.

+Theodore Dreiser+--novelist, dramatist.

Born at Terre Haute, Indiana, 1871, of German ancestry. Educated in the
public schools of Warsaw, Indiana, and at the University of Indiana.
Newspaper work in Chicago and St. Louis, 1892-5. Editor of _Every Month_
(literary and musical magazine), 1895-8. Editorial positions on
_McClure's_, _Century_, _Cosmopolitan_, and various other magazines,
finally becoming editor-in-chief of the Butterick Publications
(_Delineator_, _Designer_, _New Idea_, _English Delineator_), 1907-10.
Organized the National Child Rescue Campaign, 1907.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. As Mr. Dreiser is considered by many critics the novelist of biggest
stature as yet produced by America, the nature and sources of his
strength and of his weakness deserve careful analysis. Observe (1) that
his attitude toward life and his general method derive from Zola; (2)
that his materials are drawn from his extensive and varied experience as
a journalist; (3) that these two facts are exemplified in brief in his
biographical studies, _Twelve Men_, which are "human documents."

2. Note the dates of _Sister Carrie_ and of _Jennie Gerhardt_, and work
out Dreiser's loss and gain during the long period of silence between
them.

3. _Hey, Rub-a-Dub-Dub_ (cf. _Nation_, 109 ['19]: 278) should be read by
every student of Dreiser, for its revelation of his attitude toward
humanity, which contributes largely to the greatness of his work, and of
his failure to think out a point of view, which is a fundamental
weakness. Note his admission: "I am one of those curious persons who
cannot make up their minds about anything."

4. With what types of material does Mr. Dreiser succeed best? Why?

5. Discuss Mr. Dreiser's style in connection with the following topics:
(1) economy; (2) realism; (3) suggestion; (4) taste; (5) rhythmic beauty.
What deeply rooted defect is suggested by the following description of
the Woolworth Building in New York:--"lifts its defiant spear of clay
into the very maw of heaven"?

6. How far does Mr. Dreiser represent American life? Do you think his
work will be for some time the best that we can do in literature?

7. Read Mr. Van Doren's article (listed below) for suggestion of other
points for discussion. The following passage is especially significant:

     Not the incurable awkwardness of his style nor his occasional
     merciless verbosity nor his too frequent interpositions of crude
     argument can destroy the effect which he produces at his best--that
     of a noble spirit brooding over a world which in spite of many
     condemnations he deeply, somberly loves. Something peasantlike in
     his genius may blind him a little to the finer shades of character
     and set him astray in his reports of cultivated society. His
     conscience about telling the plain truth may suffer at times from a
     dogmatic tolerance which refuses to draw lines between good and evil
     or between beautiful and ugly or between wise and foolish. But he
     gains, on the whole, more than he loses by the magnitude of his
     cosmic philosophizing.... From somewhere sound accents of an
     authority not sufficiently explained by the mere accuracy of his
     versions of life. Though it may indeed be difficult for a thinker of
     the widest views to contract himself to the dimensions needed for
     realistic art, and though he may often fail when he attempts it,
     when he does succeed he has the opportunity, which the mere
     worldling lacks, of ennobling his art with some of the great lights
     of the poets.

+T(homas) S(tearns) Eliot+--poet, critic.

Born at St. Louis, Missouri, 1888. A.B., Harvard, 1909; A.M., 1910.

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Is Mr. Eliot's poetry derived from a keen sense of life experienced or
from literature? What echoes of earlier poets do you find in his work?

2. Does the adjective _distinguished_ apply to his work? What are the
sources of his distinction? What evidences of fresh vision of old things
do you find? of unexpected and true associations and contrasts? of a
delicate sense for essential details that make a picture? of the power of
suggestive condensation? of ability to get an emotional effect through
irony?

3. Consider the following quotation from Mr. Eliot as illuminative of his
method of work: "The contemplation of the horrid or sordid by the artist
is the necessary and negative aspect of the impulse toward beauty."

4. It is interesting to make a special study of Mr. Eliot's management of
verse.

5. What, if any, temperamental defect is likely to interfere with his
development?

+John Gould Fletcher+--poet, critic.

Born at Little Rock, Arkansas, 1886. Studied at Phillips Academy,

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Read the prefaces to _Irradiations_ and _Goblins and Pagodas_ for Mr.
Fletcher's theory of poetry before you read the poems themselves. Has he
succeeded in making the arts of painting and music do service to poetry?

2. After reading the poems, consider the justice or injustice of Mr.
Aiken's criticism: "It is a sort of absolute poetry, a poetry of detached
waver and brilliance, a beautiful flowering of language alone--a
parthenogenesis, as if language were fertilized by itself rather than by
thought or feeling. Remove the magic of phrase and sound and there is
nothing left: no thread of continuity, no thought, no story, no emotion.
But the magic of phrase and sound is powerful, and it takes one into a
fantastic world."

3. Do you find any poems to which the quotation given above does not
apply? Are these of more or of less value than the others?

+Robert Lee Frost+--poet.

Born at San Francisco, 1875. At the age of ten, he was taken to New
England where eight generations of his forefathers had lived. In 1892, he
spent a few months at Dartmouth College but disliking college routine,
decided to earn his living, and became a millhand in Lawrence,
Massachusetts. In 1897, two years after he had married, he entered
Harvard and studied there for two years; but he finally gave up the idea
of a degree and turned to various kinds of work, teaching, shoe-making,
and newspaper work. From 1900-11, he was farming at Derry, New Hampshire,
but with little success. At the same time, he was writing and offering
for publication poems which were invariably refused. He likewise taught
English at Derry, 1906-11, and psychology at Plymouth, 1911-2.

In 1912, he sold his farm and with his wife and four children went to
England. He offered a collection of poems to an English publisher and
went to live in the little country town of Beaconsfield. The poems were
published and their merits were quickly recognized. In 1914, Mr. Frost
rented a small place at Ledbury, Gloucestershire, near the English poets,
Lascelles Abercrombie, and W.W. Gibson. With the publication of _North of
Boston_ his reputation as a poet was established.

In 1915, Mr. Frost returned to America and went to live near Franconia,
New Hampshire. From 1916 to 1919 he taught English at Amherst College.
But he found that college life was disturbing to his creative energy, and
in 1920 he bought land in Vermont and again became a farmer. In 1921,
the University of Michigan, in recognition of his talents, offered him a
salary to live in Ann Arbor without teaching. This position he accepted,
but it is reported that he intends to return to farming to secure the
leisure necessary for his work.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Make a list of subjects that you have not found treated elsewhere in
poetry. Test the truth of the treatment by your own experience and decide
whether Mr. Frost has converted these commonplace experiences into a new
field of poetry.

2. Read in succession the poems concerning New England life and decide
whether they seem more authentic and more valuable than the others. If
so, why?

3. Is Mr. Frost's realism photographic? Consider in this connection his
own statement: "There are two types of realist--the one who offers a good
deal of dirt with his potato to show that it is a real one; and the one
who is satisfied with the potato brushed clean.... To me the thing that
art does for life is to strip it to form."

In view of the last sentence it is interesting to consider the kinds of
details that Mr. Frost chooses for presentation and those that he omits.

4. Read several of the long poems to discover his relative strength in
narrative and in dramatic presentation.

5. Examine the vocabulary for naturalness, colloquialism, and
extraordinary occasional fitness of words.

6. Try to sum up briefly Mr. Frost's philosophy of life and his attitude
toward nature and people.

7. What do you observe about the metrical forms, the beauty or lack of
beauty in the rhythm? Do many of the poems sing?

8. What do you prophesy as to Mr. Frost's future?

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Compare Mr. Fuller's stories of Europe with his studies of life in
Chicago. What is their relative success? What inferences do you draw?

2. Considering dates, materials, and methods, where do you place Mr.
Fuller's work in the development of the American novel?

+Hamlin Garland+--short-story writer, novelist.

Born on a farm near West Salem, Wisconsin, 1860, of Scotch and New
England ancestry. During his boyhood, his father moved first to Iowa,
then to Dakota. As a boy, Mr. Garland helped his father with all the hard
work of making farmland out of prairie. While still in his teens, he was
able to do a man's work. His schooling was desultory, but he finished the
course at Cedar Valley Seminary, Osage, Iowa, then taught, 1882-3. In
1883 he took up a claim in Dakota, but the next year went to Boston and
began his career as teacher and writer.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Read the autobiographical books, _A Son of the Middle Border_ and _A
Daughter of the Middle Border_, to get the background of Mr. Garland's
work. Then read his essays called _Crumbling Idols_, for the literary
theory on which his work was created.

2. Two literary landmarks in Mr. Garland's history are: Edward
Eggleston's _The Hoosier Schoolmaster_ (1871), and Joseph Kirkland's
_Zury: the Meanest Man in Spring County_ (1887). Read these and decide
how much they influenced _Main-Traveled Roads_ and similar volumes of Mr.
Garland's.

3. Mr. Garland says that he presents farm life "not as the summer boarder
or the young lady novelist sees it--but as the working farmer endures
it." Find evidence of this.

4. Consider how far Mr. Garland's success depends upon the richness of
his material, how far upon his philosophy of life and his honesty to his
own experience, and how far upon his technical skill as a writer.

5. What are his most obvious limitations? What is the relative importance
of his novels and of his short stories?

6. Consider separately: (1) his power of visualization; (2) his choice of
significant detail; (3) his originality or lack of it; (4) his range in
characterization; (5) his power of suggestion as over against his
vividness of delineation; (6) his economy--or lack of it--in expression.
Where does his main strength lie?

+Katharine Fullerton Gerould (Mrs. Gordon Hall Gerould)+--short-story
    writer, novelist, essayist.

Born at Brockton, Massachusetts, 1879. A.B., Radcliffe College, 1900;
A.M., 1901. Reader in English at Bryn Mawr College, 1901-10, except
1908-9 which she spent in England and France.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Mrs. Gerould belongs to the school of Henry James, but shows marked
individuality in her themes and in her dramatic power. A comparison of
some of her short stories with stories by Mr. James (q.v.) and by Mrs.
Wharton (q.v.) is illuminating for the powers and limitations of all
three.

2. Another interesting comparison is between Mrs. Gerould's stories and
the collection entitled _Bliss_ by the English writer, Katherine
Mansfield (Mrs. J. Middleton Murry); cf. Manly and Rickert, _Contemporary
British Literature_.

+Arturo Giovannitti+--poet.

Born in the Abruzzi, Italy, 1884, of a family of good social standing,
his father and one of his brothers being doctors, and another brother a
lawyer. Educated in a local Italian college. Came to America in 1900,
full of enthusiasm for democracy. Worked in a coal mine. Later, studied
at Union Theological Seminary. Conducted Presbyterian missions in several
places.

In 1906, he became a socialist and one of the leaders of the I.W.W.
During the Lawrence strikes he preached the doctrine of Syndicalism and
was arrested on the charge of inciting to riot. He also organized relief
work for the strikers.

On an Italian newspaper; editor of _Il Proletario_, a socialist paper.
His first speech in English was made at the time of his trial and
produced a powerful effect upon his audience. During his imprisonment, he
studied English literature and wrote poems, of which the most famous is
"The Walker." His chief concern is with the submerged, and he writes from
actual experience of having been "one of those who sleep in the park."


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. What are the main features of the social creed at the root of
Giovannitti's poetry?

2. Is he a poet or a propagandist? Test his sincerity; his passion; his
truth to experience.

3. What are his limitations as thinker and as poet?

4. Compare and contrast his work with Whitman's in ideas and in form.

5. Do you find marks of greatness in him?

Mr. Harris's work belongs in a class by itself. It is valuable partly for
its content, as in the case of his intimate portraits of famous men whom
he has known, and partly for the force and brilliancy of the style.

+Joseph Hergesheimer+--novelist.

Born at Philadelphia, 1880. Educated for a short time at a Quaker school
in Philadelphia and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Note Mr. Hergesheimer's use of setting and atmosphere. What is the
relative importance of these to plot and character? Is the author's main
interest in developing a story, in creating characters that live, or in
suggesting particular phases of life, each with its own physical and
emotional atmosphere?

2. What evidences of originality do you find in his books?

3. Is the author a realist or a romanticist? Is it true, as has been
said, that he stands midway between the "unrelieved realism" of the new
school of writers and the "genteel moralism" of the old?

4. Consider these two criticisms of Mr. Hergesheimer's work: (1) He aims
to set down "relative truth ... the colors and scents and emotions of
existence"; and (2) he is at times as much concerned "with the stuffs as
with the stuff of life."

5. Make a special study of his style: (1) of his use of suggestion; (2)
of his choice of words; (3) of his feeling for rhythm. It is true that
there is both art and artifice in his methods?

6. In what ways, if any, has he made actual contribution to American
literature? Can you prophesy as to his future?

+Robert Herrick+--novelist.

Born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1868. A.B., Harvard, 1890. Taught
English at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1890-3, and at the
University of Chicago since then, becoming professor, 1905. More
important for interpretation of his work is the fact that he has
carefully studied modern English and Continental literatures and is
deeply interested in philosophy and the social sciences.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Much of Mr. Herrick's work must be regarded as primarily social
criticism of American life. Does the interest tend to centre rather upon
the problems of the characters, growing out of their circumstances, or
upon the characters themselves?

2. Is Mr. Herrick's work more notable for scope and breadth or for
intensity?

3. Note, especially in the novels previous to 1905, the conscientious
artistry, the compactness of structure, and the unity of tone commonly
associated with poetry. What other qualities characteristic of poetry
appear in Mr. Herrick's work?

4. With the structure of his earlier work compare that of the _Memoirs of
an American Citizen_ as showing an attempt at greater breadth of canvas
and greater variety of tone. Trace this attempt further in his later
work.

5. What evidences do you find in Mr. Herrick's novels of a carefully
wrought theory of the art of the novelist?

6. Someone has called Mr. Herrick "a discouraged idealist." Is this just?

+William Dean Howells+--novelist, dramatist, critic, poet.

Born at Martins Ferry, Ohio, 1837. Of Welsh, English, Pennsylvania Dutch,
and Irish ancestry. His father was a country editor, and Mr. Howells,
living as he did under pioneer conditions, had very little formal
education, but educated himself in working on newspapers as printer,
correspondent, and editor. He read continually in boyhood, and taught
himself to read six languages. As the result of a campaign life of
Lincoln, he was appointed U.S. consul at Venice and lived there, 1861-5.
After a year on the staff of the _Nation_, he became assistant editor of
the _Atlantic Monthly_, 1866-72, and editor, 1872-81. Later, he became an
editorial writer for _Harper's Magazine_, 1886-91, and finally writer of
the "Editor's Easy Chair," for the same magazine.

Although Mr. Howells did not go to college, he received many honorary
higher degrees, and was offered professorships by three Universities
(including that which had been held by Longfellow and Lowell at Harvard);
but he refused these, not considering himself fitted for such work. In
his editorial capacity he gave much advice and help to authors who
afterward became famous. He died in 1920.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. For just appraisement of Mr. Howells, it is necessary to be familiar
with the facts of his life, and with his theories of fiction. For his
life the two autobiographical books _Years of My Youth_ and _My Literary
Passions_ are most valuable. After reading these, it is possible to see
the large use of autobiographical material in the novels.

2. It is interesting to group the books of Howells according to the
sources of the material: (1) those growing out of his early life in Ohio;
(2) those growing out of his life abroad; (3) those growing out of his
life in Boston and New York. This last class might well be subdivided
into those written before he came under the influence of Tolstoi and
those written after. The turning-point is in _A Hazard of New Fortunes_.
Does Mr. Howells's interest in sociological problems add to or lessen the
final value of his work?

3. The realism of Howells set a standard for American literature, the
effect of which has not yet passed. Study his theories of fiction
(_Criticism and Fiction_, and _Literature and Life_) and consider the
good and bad effects of his work upon the development of the novel.

4. Use the following quotation from Van Wyck Brooks, on Howells's
"panoramic theory" of the novel as a test of his work:

     To make a work of art, it is necessary to take a piece out of life
     and round it off; and, so long as the piece is perfectly rounded off
     and complete in itself, so long as the chosen group of characters
     are perfectly proportioned in relation to one another, there is no
     need to introduce an artificial chain of action.

5. Howells's style has often been admired. Try to analyze it into its
elements. Consider Mark Twain's judgment:

     For forty years his English has been to me a continual delight and
     astonishment. In the sustained exhibition of certain great
     qualities--clearness, compression, verbal exactness and unforced and
     seemingly unconscious felicity of phrasing--he is, in my belief,
     without his peer in the English-writing world.

6. Can you make any judgment now as to Howells's future place in American
literature?

+Henry James+--novelist.

Born in New York City, 1843. Younger brother of William James, the
psychologist. Educated largely in France and Switzerland. Studied at the
Harvard Law School. After 1869, lived for the most part abroad, chiefly
in England. Spent much time at Lamb House, Rye, a beautiful eighteenth
century English house which he purchased in order to live in retirement.
Just before his death, to show his sympathy for the part played by
England in the War and his criticism of what he considered our
backwardness, he became naturalized as a British citizen. In 1916,
received the Order of Merit (O.M.), the highest honor for literary men
conferred in England. His death in 1916 was attributed to overstrain
caused by the War and his efforts to help the sufferers.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. A good approach to the work of Henry James is through the three
articles from the _Quarterly Review_ listed below. Mr. Fullerton sums up
the material scattered through the prefaces to the definitive edition of
1909. Mr. Percy Lubbock writes as the editor of the _Letters_. Mrs.
Wharton adds to criticism of the _Letters_ illuminating personal
reminiscences.

2. One of the important _Prefaces_ on James's theory of the novel and his
method of work is that to the _Portrait of a Lady_, from which the
extract below is taken. In speaking of Turgenev's attitude toward his
characters, James says:

     He saw them, in that fashion, as disponible, saw them subject to the
     chances, the complications of existence, and saw them vividly but
     then had to find for them the right relations, those that would most
     bring them out; to imagine, to invent and select and piece together
     the situations most useful and favourable to the sense of the
     creatures themselves, the complications they would be most likely to
     produce and to feel.

     "To arrive at these things is to arrive at my 'story,' he said, "and
     that's the way I look for it. The result is that I'm often accused
     of not having 'story' enough...."

     So this beautiful genius, and I recall with comfort the gratitude I
     drew from his reference to the intensity of suggestion that may
     reside in the stray figure, the unattached character, the image _en
     disponible_. It gave me higher warrant than I seemed then to have
     met for just that blest habit of one's own imagination, the trick of
     investing some conceived or encountered individual, some brace or
     group of individuals, with the germinal property and authority. I
     was myself so much more antecedently conscious of my figures than of
     their setting--a too preliminary, a preferential interest in which
     struck me as in general such a putting of the cart before the horse.
     I might envy, though I couldn't emulate, the imaginative writer so
     constituted as to see his fable first and to make out his agents
     afterwards: I could think so little of any situation that didn't
     depend for its interest on the nature of the persons situated, and
     thereby on their way of taking it....

     The question comes back thus, obviously, to the kind and the degree
     of the artist's prime sensibility, which is the soil out of which
     his subject springs. The quality and capacity of that soil, its
     ability to "grow" with due freshness and straightness any vision of
     life, represents, strongly or weakly, the projected morality. That
     element is but another name for the more or less close connexion of
     the subject with some mark made on the intelligence, with some
     sincere experience.

     On one thing I was determined; that, though I should clearly have to
     pile brick upon brick for the creation of an interest, I would leave
     no pretext for saying that anything is out of line, scale or
     perspective. I would build large--in fine embossed vaults and
     painted arches, as who should say, and yet never let it appear that
     the chequered pavement,  the ground under the reader's feet, fails
     to stretch at every point to the base of the walls....

     The bricks, for the whole counting-over--putting for bricks little
     touches and inventions and enhancements by the way--affect me in
     truth as well-nigh innumerable and as ever so scrupulously fitted
     together and packed-in. It is an effect of detail, of the minutest;
     though, if one were in this connexion to say all, one would express
     the hope that the general, the ampler part of the modest monument
     still survives....

     So early was to begin my tendency to _overtreat_, rather than
     undertreat (when there was choice or danger) my subject. (Many
     members of my craft, I gather, are far from agreeing with me, but I
     have always held overtreating the minor disservice.) ... There was
     the danger of the noted "thinness"--which was to be averted, tooth
     and nail, by cultivation of the lively.... And then there was
     another matter. I had, within the few preceding years, come to live
     in London, and the "international" light lay, in those days, to my
     sense, thick and rich upon the scene. It was the light in which so
     much of the picture hung. But that _is_ another matter. There is
     really too much to say.

3. Remember the following clues in reading James's, work: "His one
preoccupation was the criticism, for his own purpose, of the art of
life." The emphasis is on the word _art_. His _purpose_ is suggested by
his own claim to have "that tender appreciation of actuality which makes
even the application of a single coat of rose-color seem an act of
violence."

4. There is suggestion of Mr. James's limitations in the facts that he
was tone deaf and so could not appreciate music, and that he is said not
to have written a line of verse, and also in the fact that although his
method of presentation in the novels is dramatic throughout and he
strongly desired to write plays, the eight plays that he wrote (three of
which were presented) were failures.

5. Mr. James's place in the sequence of great European novelists is as a
follower of Balzac, Flaubert, De Maupassant, and Turgenev, and as a
predecessor of Conrad (whose study of him listed below should be read).

6. Early in the nineties, a great change in method came about in James's
work (cf. _Cambridge_, III, 98, 103). Judge separately typical books
written before this change and others written after; then read several
books of the period of change and decide what happened and whether or
not it enhanced the value of his work.

7. One of the remarkable facts about James's style is its influence upon
the critics who write about him. A close analysis of its
qualities--sentence length, the order and placing of the parts of the
sentence, punctuation, vocabulary, etc., might bring a more definite
understanding of the reasons for this influence.

8. A comparison of the work and qualities of Henry and William James
might be made a valuable contribution to criticism.

9. For a student familiar with Europe, a study of the reasons for James's
affinity with Europe and dislike for American life would make an
interesting study.

10. What different types of reasons can you bring to show that Henry
James is likely to be a permanent force in American literature?

+(Alfred) Joyce Kilmer+--poet, essayist.

Born at New Brunswick, New Jersey, 1886. Of mixed ancestry, Irish,
German, English, Scotch. A.B., Rutgers, 1904; Columbia, 1906. Married
Miss Aline Murray, step-daughter of Henry Mills Alden, editor of
_Harper's Magazine_ (cf. Aline Kilmer). Taught a short time, then held
various editorial positions on _The Churchman_, the _Literary Digest_,
_Current Literature_, the _New York Times Sunday Magazine_, among others.
In 1913, he and his wife were converted to Catholicism. In 1916, he was
called to the faculty of the School of Journalism, New York University,
succeeding Arthur Guiterman (q.v.). Enlisted as a private in the War and
was killed in action, 1918.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Kilmer wished to be judged by poetry written after October, 1913, and
to discard all earlier work. Why?

2. The following influences are traceable in his poetry: (1) Francis
Thompson, Coventry Patmore, and earlier Catholic poets; (2) his mother's
musical talent; (3) his journalistic work; (4) the War.

3. Kilmer's letters illustrate and explain the qualities of his work.

Born in New York City, 1883, of Danish ancestry. Educated at the Morris
High School. A chess prodigy at the age of ten, and supported himself
from seventeen to twenty-five by teaching chess and playing matches. Had
several years of experience as bookkeeper.

In 1914, founded and edited _The Glebe_, which issued the first anthology
of free verse. In 1916, 1917, 1919, published _Others_--three anthologies
of radical poets. In 1921, went to Rome to edit, in association with
Harold Loeb, an international magazine of the arts called _The Broom_
(cf. _Dial_ 70 ['21]: 606), but shortly after resigned.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Mr. Kreymborg is a rebel against all conventions of form and content
in poetry. Consequently, the one thing to be expected in his work is the
unexpected. How far his utterances are sincere and how far posed, each
reader must judge for himself.

2. The following quotation from _Poetry_ (9 ['16]: 51) may serve as a
starting-point in discussing Mr. Kreymborg's qualities: "An insinuating,
meddlesome, quizzical, inquiring spirit; sometimes a clown, oftener a
wit, now and then a lyric poet ... trips about cheerfully among life's
little incongruities; laughs at you and me and progress and prejudice and
dreams; says 'I told you so!' with an air, as if after a double
somersault in the circus ring; grows wistful, even tender, with emotions
always genuine ... always ... as becomes the harlequin-philosopher,
entertaining."

3. The new movements in art--Futurist, Cubist, Vorticist--should be
remembered in studying Mr. Kreymborg's verse.

4. What is to be said of his economy in words?

1907. During the next ten years was a newspaper man in Connecticut, Iowa,
and California, a magazine editor in Washington, D.C., and editor for New
York book publishers. During the last five years has been traveling in
the United States, living from one day to six months in the most diverse
places, and motoring from end to end of twenty-six states. While
supporting himself by short stories and experimental novels, he laid the
foundation for his unusually successful _Main Street_. His first book,
_Our Mr. Wrenn_, is said to contain a good deal of autobiography.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Do you recognize Gopher Prairie as a type? Is Mr. Lewis's picture
photography, caricature, or the kind of portraiture that is art? Or to
what degree do you find all these elements?

2. Is the main interest of the book in the story? in the
characterization? in the satire? or in an element of propaganda?

3. What is to be said of the constructive theory of living proposed by
the heroine? Is it better or worse than the standard that prevailed
before she went to Gopher Prairie to live?

4. Explain the success of the book. What, if any, elements of permanent
value do you find? What conspicuous defects?

+(Nicholas) Vachel Lindsay+--poet.

Born at Springfield, Illinois, 1879. Educated in the public schools.
Studied at Hiram College, Ohio, 1897-1900; at the Art Institute, Chicago,
1900-3, and at the New York School of Art, 1904-5. Member of the
Christian (Disciples) Church. Y.M.C.A. lecturer, 1905-09. Lecturer for
the Anti-Saloon League throughout central Illinois, 1909-10. Makes long
pilgrimages on foot (cf. _A Handy Guide for Beggars_).

In the summer of 1912, he walked from Illinois to New Mexico,
distributing his poems and speaking in behalf of "The Gospel of Beauty."


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Read for background _A Handy Guide for Beggars_ and _Adventures while
Preaching the Gospel of Beauty_.

2. An important clue to Mr. Lindsay's work is suggested in his own note
on reading his poems. Referring to the Greek lyrics as the type which
survives in American vaudeville where every line may be two-thirds spoken
and one-third sung, he adds: "I respectfully submit these poems as
experiments in which I endeavor to carry this vaudeville form back
towards the old Greek presentation of the half-chanted lyric. In this
case the one-third of music must be added by the instinct of the
reader.... Big general contrasts between the main sections should be the
rule of the first attempts at improvising. It is the hope of the writer
that after two or three readings each line will suggest its own separate
touch of melody to the reader who has become accustomed to the cadences.
Let him read what he likes read, and sing what he likes sung."

In carrying out this suggestion, note that Mr. Lindsay often prints aids
to expression by means of italics, capitals, spaces, and even side notes
and other notes on expression.

3. What different kinds of material appeal especially to Mr. Lindsay's
imagination? How do you explain his choice, and his limitations?

4. What effect upon his poetry has the missionary spirit which is so
strong in him? Is his poetry more valuable for its singing element or for
its ethical appeal? Do you discover any special originality?

5. How does his use of local material compare with that of Masters? of
Frost? of Sandburg?

6. Study his rhythmic sense in different poems, the verse forms that he
uses, the tendencies in rhyme, his use of refrain, of onomatopoeia, of
catalogues, etc.

7. Does Mr. Lindsay offend your poetic taste? If so, can you justify his
use of the material you object to?

8. Do you judge that Mr. Lindsay is likely to write much greater poetry
than he has hitherto produced?

9. Mr. Lindsay's drawings are worth study for comparison with his poems.

10. Compare Mr. Lindsay's development of the idea of the "poem game" with
the "poem dance" of Bliss Carman (q.v.).

11. Consider Mr. Lindsay as the "poet of democracy." What is he likely to
do for the people? for poetry?

+Amy Lowell+--poet, critic.

Born at Brookline, Massachusetts, 1874. Sister of President Lowell of
Harvard, and of Percival Lowell, the astronomer. Distantly related to
James Russell Lowell. Educated at private schools. Traveled extensively
in Europe as a child. Her visits to Egypt, Greece, and Turkey influenced
her development. In 1902, she decided to become a poet and spent eight
years studying, without publishing a poem. Her first poem appeared in the
_Atlantic_, 1910.

She is a collector of Keats manuscripts and says that the poet who
influenced her most profoundly was Keats. She has also made special study
of Chinese poetry.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. As Miss Lowell is the principal exponent of the theories of imagism
and free verse in this country, careful reading of some of her critical
papers leads to a better understanding of her work. Especially valuable
are her studies of Paul Fort in her volume entitled _Six French Poets_,
of "H.D." and John Gould Fletcher in her _Tendencies in Modern American
Poetry_, the prefaces to different volumes of her poems and to the
anthologies published under the title _Some Imagist Poets_ (1915, 1916),
and her articles in the _Dial_, 64 ('18): 51 ff., and in Poetry, 3 ('13):
213 ff.

2. In judging her work, consider separately her poems in regular metrical
form and those in free verse. Decide which method is better suited to her
type of imagination.

3. To what extent does her inspiration come from cultural
sources--travel, literature, art, music?

4. Consider especially her presentation of "images." How far do these
seem to be derived from direct experience? Test them by your own
experience. What principles seem to determine her choice of details?
Which sense impressions--sight, sound, taste, smell, touch--does she most
frequently and successfully suggest? Note instances where her figures of
speech sharpen the imagery and others where they seem to distort it. In
what ways is the influence of Keats perceptible in her work?

5. It is worth while to make special study of the historical imagery of
the poems in _Can Grande's Castle_.

6. If you are familiar with the impressionistic method of painting, work
out an analogy between it and Miss Lowell's word pictures.

7. Study separately her varieties of free verse and polyphonic prose (cf.
her study of Paul Fort and the preface to _Can Grande's Castle_). Choose
several poems in which you think the free verse form is especially
adapted to the content and draw conclusions as to the problems of
development of this kind of verse or of its possible influence upon
regular metrical forms.

8. Use the following poem by Miss Lowell as a basis for judging her work:

                  FRAGMENT

    What is poetry? Is it a mosaic
      Of colored stones which curiously are wrought
      Into a pattern? Rather glass that's taught
    By patient labor any hue to take
    And glowing with a sumptuous splendor, make
      Beauty a thing of awe; where sunbeams caught,
      Transmuted fall in sheafs of rainbows fraught
    With storied meaning for religion's sake.

9. In summing up Miss Lowell's achievement, consider the different phases
of it that appear in her volumes taken in chronological order, noting the
successive influences under which she has come. In what qualities does
she stand out strikingly from other contemporary poets? Do you expect
different and more important work from her in the future?

+Edgar Lee Masters+--poet.

Born at Garnett, Kansas, 1868, but brought up in Illinois. His schooling
was desultory, but he read widely. Studied one year at Knox College;
learned Greek, which influenced him strongly.

Studied law in his father's office at Lewiston, and practiced there for a
year. Then went to Chicago where he became a successful attorney and also
took an active part in politics.

Mr. Masters' fame was established by the _Spoon River Anthology_, which
was suggested by _The Greek Anthology_. With this Mr. Masters had become
familiar as early as 1909, through Mr. William Marion Reedy. _The Spoon
River Anthology_ first appeared in _Reedy's Mirror_, under the
significant pseudonym, "Webster Ford."


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Begin with _The Spoon River Anthology_. (Cf. the preface to _Toward
the Gulf_.) How much does it owe to its model? to other literary sources?
to the central Illinois environment in which the author grew up? What are
its most conspicuous merits and defects? How do you explain each?

2. Test the sketches by your own experience of small town life. Which
seem to you truest to individual character and most universal in type?

3. Compare similar sketches of personalities by Edwin Arlington Robinson,
which Mr. Masters had not read until after his book was published.

4. Consider how far Mr. Masters has achieved his avowed purpose "to
analyze society, to satirise society, to tell a story, to expose the
machinery of life, to present a working model of the big world"; to
create beauty, and to depict "our sorrows and hopes, our religious
failures, successes and visions, our poor little lives, rounded by a
sleep, in language and figures emotionally tuned to bring all of us
closer together in understanding and affection."

5. How do you explain the sudden popularity of the _Anthology_? What are
its chances of becoming a classic?

6. Read one of Mr. Masters' later volumes and compare it with the
_Anthology_ as to merits and defects.

7. Mr. Masters has always been a great reader. Trace, as far as you can,
the influence of the following authors: Homer; the Bible; Poe; Keats;
Shelley; Swinburne; Browning.

8. Draw parallels between his work and the work of (1) Edwin Arlington
Robinson, q.v., (2) of Robert Frost, q.v., (3) of Vachel Lindsay, q.v.,
and (4) of Carl Sandburg, q.v.

9. An interesting study might be made of the effects of Mr. Masters'
legal training upon his poetry.

10. Compare _Children of the Market Place_ with the _Anthology_ or
_Domesday Book_. Is Mr. Masters more successful as poet or as novelist?

+Lloyd Mifflin+--poet.

Born at Columbia, Pennsylvania, 1846. Son of an artist. Educated at
Washington Classical Institute and by tutors. Studied art with his father
and in Germany and Italy. Began as a painter, but later turned to poetry.
Is best known for his sonnets, the form in which most of his poetry is
written. These may be studied in his _Collected Sonnets_, 1905 (revised
edition, 1907), although several volumes have been published since then.

+Edna St. Vincent Millay+--poet, dramatist.

Born at Rockland, Maine, 1892. A.B., Vassar, 1917. Connected with the
Provincetown players both as dramatist and as actress.

Miss Millay's first poem, "Renascence," was published in _The Lyric
Year_, 1912.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. The poems need to be read aloud to give the full effect of their
passion and lyric beauty.

2. Compare Miss Millay's naivete with that of Blake. Do you find
suggestions of philosophy behind it or sheer emotion?

3. Does Miss Millay's later work show growth toward greatness or toward
sophisticated cleverness?

+Enos A(bijah) Mills+--Nature writer.

Born near Kansas City, Kansas, 1870. Self-educated. Worked on a ranch
fourteen years. Foreman in a mine. Went to the Rocky Mountains early in
life. Built a home on Long's Peak, Colorado, 1886. Has explored the Rocky
Mountains extensively, alone, on foot, and without firearms. Colorado
"snow observer" for Government, 1907, 1908.

Mr. Mills has done valuable work for the protection of wild animals and
flowers and for the establishment of national parks. His work belongs
with that of Thoreau, Burroughs, and Muir (by whom he was influenced to
continue it) for its freshly observed Nature content.

Among his best-known books are, perhaps, _The Story of a Thousand Year
Pine_, 1914, and _The Story of Scotch_, 1916 (dog story).

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. What effect has Mr. O'Neill's life experience had upon the quality of
his plays?

2. What evidence of originality do you find in his (1) themes, (2)
background, and (3) technique?

3. Consider the influence of Joseph Conrad (cf. Manly and Rickert,
_Contemporary British Literature_) upon O'Neill. Read especially _The
Nigger of the "Narcissus."_

4. How has Mr. O'Neill been influenced by the plays of John Millington
Synge?

5. What do you make of the fact that Mr. O'Neill has struck out in
various directions instead of working a particular vein?

6. What reasons do you find for the common opinion that he is our most
promising dramatist? What limitations or weaknesses do you think may
interfere with his development? Do you think he will become a great
dramatist?

+Ezra (Loomis) Pound+--poet, critic.

Born at Hailey, Idaho, 1885. Of English descent; on his mother's side
distantly related to Longfellow. Ph.B., Hamilton College. Fellow of the
University of Pennsylvania. Traveled in Spain, in Italy, in Provence,
1906-7; lived in Venice, and finally made his home in England. London
editor of _The Little Review_, 1917-9, and foreign correspondent of
_Poetry_, 1912-9.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Mr. Pound is an experimenter in verse, who has come under many
influences and belonged to many schools. His work should be studied
chronologically to discover these changes in interest and relationship.
To be noted among the influences are: (1) the mediaeval poetry of
Provence; (2) the Greek poets; (3) the Latin poets of the Empire; (4)
among modern French poets, Laurent Tailhade; (5) the poets of China and
Japan, whom he learned to know through the manuscript notes of Ernest
Fenollosa; (6) the work of the English Imagists (cf. especially the poems
of T.E. Hulme, published in Mr. Pound's volume called _Ripostes_); (7)
the work of the Vorticist school of poets and artists (cf. _Blast_,
edited by Wyndham Lewis), and the more accessible periodical, _The
Egoist_, of which Richard Aldington (cf. Manly and Rickert, _Contemporary
British Literature_) is assistant editor.

2. Consider also this from his own theory of poetry: "Poetry is a sort of
inspired mathematics, which gives us equations, not for abstract figures,
triangles, spheres and the like, but equations for the human emotions. If
one have a mind which inclines to magic rather than science, one will
prefer to speak of these equations as spells or incantations; it sounds
more arcane, mysterious, recondite."

Can this be related to the qualities of Mr. Pound's poetry?

3. After reading Mr. Pound's output, discuss the adequacy of the
following: "When content has become for an artist merely something to
inflate and display form with, then the petty serves as well as the
great, the ignoble equally with the lofty, the unlovely like the
beautiful, the sordid as the clean.... Real feeling consequently becomes
rarer, and the artist descends to trivialities of observation, vagaries
of assertion, or mere _bravado_ of standards and expression--pure tilting
at convention."

factory worker, etc.--while she wrote poems. Her reputation was made by
the publication of _The Ghetto_ in 1918.

+Edwin Arlington Robinson+--poet.

Born at Head Tide, Maine, 1869. Educated at Gardiner, Maine, on the
Kennebec River ("Tilbury Town"). Studied at Harvard, 1891-3. Struggled in
various ways to make a living in New York, even working in the subway,
while publishing his first poems. His _Captain Craig_, 1902, attracted
the attention of Roosevelt, who gave the author a position in the New
York Custom House, which he held 1905-10. Since then he has been able to
give his entire time to poetry.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. A good introduction to Mr. Robinson's work is Miss Lowell's review of
his _Collected Works_, in the _Dial_, 72 ('22): 130. Although Miss
Lowell's contention that Mr. Robinson is our greatest living poet would
be disputed by some critics, her article suggests many points of
departure in the study of his very important contribution to American
poetry.

2. Divide Mr. Robinson's work into two groups: (1) poems of which the
material is based upon literature; (2) those of which it comes from his
own life experience. Is it possible to say now which of these two groups
has the best chance of long endurance? Can you decide how far literature
has had a good effect upon Mr. Robinson's work, and how far it has
lessened the value of his poetry?

3. Consider as a group the poems that grow out of Mr. Robinson's New
England origin. In what ways is he characteristic of New England?
Compare his work with that of Mr. Frost in this respect.

4. Compare and contrast Mr. Robinson's portraits of persons with names as
titles with similar portraits in the _Spoon River Anthology_. This type
of verse seems to have been developed independently by both poets.

5. An interesting study could be made of the influence on Robinson of
Crabbe; another, of the influence of Hardy.

6. Another interesting study might grow out of the consideration of
Robinson as a poet born twenty years too soon. How much has the temper of
his work been determined by the fact that he had to wait so long for
recognition?

7. What are the main features of Mr. Robinson's philosophy as suggested
in the poems?

8. Can you find many poems that sing? What is to be said of the poet's
mastery of rhythms?

9. After reading the best of Mr. Robinson's work, it is interesting to
look up the comments of various admirers of it published on the occasion
of his fiftieth birthday, in the _New York Times_, December 21, 1919, or
the quotations from this article in _Poetry_, 15 ('20): 265, and to see
how far your judgment bears out these extravagant statements.

10. The influence of Robinson's work on younger American poets,
especially on Lindsay and Sandburg, makes an interesting study.

+Edwin Meade Robinson+--poet, novelist.

Born at Lima, Indiana, 1879. Not related to Edwin Arlington Robinson.
Newspaper man, first on the _Indianapolis Sentinel_, later on the
_Cleveland Plain Dealer_, in which he conducts a column. Besides his
successful volume of verse, _Piping and Panning_, 1920, Mr. Robinson has
published a novel which has attracted attention as an honest record of a
growing boy, _Enter Jerry_, 1920. For reviews, see _Book Review Digest_,
1920, 1921.



+Carl Sandburg+--poet.

Born at Galesburg, Illinois, of Swedish stock. Has little schooling but
wide experience of life. At thirteen drove a milk wagon, and for the next
six years did all kinds of rough work--as porter in a barber shop,
scene-shifter, truck-handler in a brickyard, turner apprentice in a
pottery, dishwasher in hotels, harvest hand in Kansas.

During the Spanish-American War served as private in Porto Rico.

Studied at Lombard College, Galesburg, 1898-1902, where he was captain
of the basket-ball team and editor-in-chief of the college paper.

After leaving college, earned his living in various ways--as advertising
manager for a department store, salesman, newspaperman, "safety first"
expert. Worked also as district organizer for the Social-Democratic party
of Wisconsin and was secretary to the mayor of Milwaukee, 1910-12.

In 1904 he had published a small pamphlet of poems, but his first real
appearance before the public was in _Poetry_, 1914. In the same year he
was awarded the Levinson prize for his "Chicago." In 1918 he shared with
Margaret Widdemer (q.v.) the prize of the Poetry Society of America; and
in 1921, shared this with Stephen Vincent Benet (q.v.).

Mr. Sandburg has a good voice and sings his poems to the accompaniment of
the guitar.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. In judging Mr. Sandburg's work, it is important to remember that his
theory involves complete freedom from conventions of all sorts--in
thinking, in metrical form, and in vocabulary. His aim seems to be to
reproduce the impressions that all phases of life make upon him.

2. Consider whether his early prairie environment had anything to do with
the large scale of his imagination, the appeal to him of enormous periods
of time, masses of men, and forces.

3. Do you find elements of universality in his exaggerated localisms? Do
they combine to form a definite philosophy?

4. What effect do the eccentricities and crudities of form have upon you?
Do you consider them an essential part of his poetic expression or
blemishes which he may one day overcome?

5. Do you find elements of greatness in Mr. Sandburg's work? Do you think
they are likely to outweigh his obvious defects?

6. Compare and contrast his democratic ideals with those of Lindsay.

Harvard; professor, 1907-12.

While Mr. Santayana's chief work is in philosophy, he belongs to
literature by the beauty of his poems, especially his sonnets, and by the
quality of his prose.

+Wallace Stevens+--poet.

A New York lawyer, living in Hartford, Connecticut, whose work although
not as yet collected into a volume has attracted much attention. Received
the _Poetry_ prize for the best one-act play, in 1916, for his "Three
Travellers Watch a Sunrise," and the Levinson prize for his
"Pecksniffiana," 1920.

Mr. Stevens's art is purely decorative, and its effects must be studied
as in pictorial art. He is an experimenter in free verse forms as well as
in impressions.

+(Newton) Booth Tarkington+--novelist, dramatist.

Born at Indianapolis, Indiana, 1869, of French ancestry on one side. Came
early under the influence of Riley (q.v.), a neighbor. Educated at
Phillips Exeter Academy, Purdue University, and Princeton. Honorary
higher degrees. Popular at college for his singing, acting and social
talents. Began to study art but was not successful as an artist. Has
written songs. Takes an active part in the social and political life of
his state. Served in the Indiana legislature, 1902-3.


SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Consider separately Mr. Tarkington's studies of boy life (especially
_Penrod_), and of adolescence (especially _Seventeen_ and _Clarence_).
Judged by your own experience and observation, are they presented with
true knowledge and humor, or are they a farcical skimming of surface
eccentricities? Compare them with Mark Twain's books about boys and with
Howells's _Boy's Town_.

2. Consider separately the historical novels. Is pure romance Mr.
Tarkington's field? Why or why not?

3. Consider the justice or the injustice of the following:

     According to all the codes of the more serious kinds of fiction, the
     unwillingness--or the inability--to conduct a plot to its legitimate
     ending implies some weakness in the artistic character; and this
     weakness is Mr. Tarkington's principal defect.... Now this causes
     the more regret for the reason that he has what is next best to
     character in a novelist--that is, knack. He has the knack of
     romance, when he wants to employ it: a light, allusive manner; a
     sufficient acquaintance with certain charming historical epochs and
     the "properties" thereto pertaining...; a considerable experience in
     the ways of the "world"; gay colors, swift moods, the note of tender
     elegy. He has also the knack of satire, which he employs more
     frequently than romance ... he has traveled a long way from the
     methods of his greener days. Why, then, does he continue to trifle
     with his threadbare adolescents, as if he were afraid to write
     candidly about his coevals? Why does he drift with the sentimental
     tide and make propaganda for provincial complacency?

4. In what direction lies Mr. Tarkington's future? Is he likely to become
more than a popular writer? What, if any, elements of enduring value do
you find in his work?

5. What "Hoosier" elements do you find in his work? Compare him with Ade,
Riley, Nicholson, and with the older writers of Indiana, Edward
Eggleston, and Maurice Thompson.

+Horace Traubel+--poet, biographer.

Born at Camden, New Jersey, 1873, of part Jewish parentage. Worked as
newsboy, errand boy, printer's devil, proof reader, reporter, and
editorial writer. Editor of various publications, including _The
Conservator_. Died in 1919.

Mr. Traubel is best known for his association with Whitman as friend,
secretary, and literary executor. When Whitman went to Camden in 1873, he
became a member of the Traubel household; and Mr. Traubel's account of
his life there is of the greatest value for the study of Whitman.

Although Traubel's poetry was strongly influenced by Whitman, he worked
out a philosophy of his own which is worth study. An interesting
comparison can be made of his ideas with Whitman's and with Edward
Carpenter's (cf. Manly and Rickert, _Contemporary British Literature_).

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING

1. Mrs. Wharton's friendship with Henry James and the derivation of her
methods from his suggest an interesting comparison of the work of these
two writers. For this comparison, books treating of similar material
should be chosen; for example, Mrs. Wharton's _The Custom of the Country_
or _Madame de Treymes_ with Mr. James's _Portrait of a Lady_ or _The
Ambassadors_. The result will show that Mrs. Wharton, having an
essentially different type of mind, has worked out an interesting set of
variations of Mr. James's method.

2. Mrs. Wharton's novels of American social life should be studied and
judged separately from her Italian historical novel (_The Valley of
Decision_) and from her New England stories, _Ethan Frome_ and _Summer_.

3. Two special phases of Mrs. Wharton's work which call for study are her
management of supernatural effects in some of her short stories and her
use of satire.

4. Her short stories offer a basis of comparison with those of Mrs.
Gerould (q.v.), another disciple of Mr. James.

5. Has Mrs. Wharton enough originality and enough distinction to hold a
permanent high place as a novelist of American manners?

6. Use the following criticisms by Mr. Carl Van Doren as the basis of a
critical judgment of your own. Decide whether he is in all respects
right:

     From the first Mrs. Wharton's power has lain in the ability to
     reproduce in fiction the circumstances of a compact community in a
     way that illustrates the various oppressions which such communities
     put upon individual vagaries, whether viewed as sin, or ignorance,
     or folly, or merely as social impossibility.

     She has always been singularly unpartisan, as if she recognized it
     as no duty of hers to do more for the herd or its members than to
     play over the spectacle of their clashes the long, cold light of her
     magnificent irony.

     It is only in these moments of satire that Mrs. Wharton reveals much
     about her disposition: her impatience of stupidity and affectation
     and muddy confusion of mind and purpose; her dislike of dinginess;
     her toleration of arrogance when it is high-bred. Such qualities do
     not help her, for all her spare, clean movement, to achieve the
     march or rush of narrative; such qualities, for all her satiric
     pungency, do not bring her into sympathy with the sturdy or burly or
     homely, or with the broader aspects of comedy.... So great is her
     self-possession that she holds criticism at arm's length, somewhat
     as her chosen circles hold the barbarians. If she had a little less
     of this pride of dignity she might perhaps avoid her tendency to
     assign to decorum a larger power than it actually exercises, even in
     the societies about which she writes.... The illusion of reality in
     her work, however, almost never fails her, so alertly is her mind on
     the lookout to avoid vulgar or shoddy romantic elements.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
