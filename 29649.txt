 THE SERPENT KNIGHT


   Signelil sits in her bower alone,
   Of her golden harp she waked the tone.

   Beneath her mantle her harp she played,
   Then in came striding the worm so laid.

   "Proud Signelil, if thou me wilt wed,
   I'll give thee store of gold so red."

   "Forbid the heavenly God so great
   That I should become the Lindworm's mate."

   "Since thee I may not for a wife acquire,
   Kiss me only and I'll retire."

   The linen so white betwixt she placed,
   And the laidly worm she kissed in haste.

   With his tail of serpent up strook he,
   From beneath her dress the blood ran free.

   The Lindworm down from the chamber strode,
   Wringing her hands behind she trode.

   And when she came out upon the stair
   Her seven bold brothers met her there.

   "Welcome our sister, whither dost hie?
   Keep'st thou the Lindworm company?"

   "Ah, yes! with the laidly worm I go,
   Because hard fate will have it so."

   The Lindworm into the mountain strode,
   Wringing her hands behind she trode.

   She fell on her knee, and her prayer she made,
   "Now son of Mary deign to aid."

   And when he had come to the mountain in,
   Off he cast his serpent's skin.

   His snake's appearance off he shook,
   And the form of a stately knight he took.

   "Thanks for thy trouble, proud Signelil,
   Now live and die with thee I will."

   Now is proud Signild free from fright,
   In a prince's arm she sleeps each night.




SIR OLAF


   Sir Olaf rides on his courser tall,
   Guests to bid to his bridal hall.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   In fours and fives the elfins dance,
   The elf-king's daughter I see advance.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Sir Olaf, cease so fierce to ride,
   And dance with me for a little tide."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "I may not dance, I may not stay,
   To-morrow is my bridal day."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Sir Olaf, if thou wilt dance with me,
   Two buckskin boots I'll give to thee."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "I dare not dance, I dare not stay,
   To-morrow is my bridal day."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Sir Olaf, if thou wilt dance with me,
   A silken shirt I'll give to thee."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "A silken shirt so fair and fine,
   Which my mother bleach'd in the pale moon-shine."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "I dare not dance, I must away,
   To-morrow is my bridal day."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Sir Olaf, if thou wilt dance with me,
   A helm of gold I'll give to thee."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "A helm of gold is a bonny thing,
   But I dare not tread the elfin ring."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "And if thou wilt not dance with me,
   Disease and death shall follow thee."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   She struck him on the shoulder bone,
   Fiercer pain he ne'er had known.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   Upon his steed she lifts the knight,
   "Now hie thee home to thy heart's delight."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   And when he came to his home so late,
   His mother stood at the castle gate.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Now tell to me, my dearest son,
   Why look'st so pale and woe-begone?"
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "O well may he look pale, I ween,
   Who has felt the stroke of the Elfin Queen."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Sir Olaf, list, my joy and pride,
   What shall I say to thy youthful bride?"
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Thou'lt tell my bride the wood I rove,
   My courser and my hounds to prove."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   The next, next morn at break of day
   The bride arrives with her friends so gay.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   They skinked mead, they skinked wine:
   "Where is Sir Olaf, bridegroom mine?"
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   "Sir Olaf's gone the woods to rove,
   His courser and his hounds to prove."
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   She lifted up the mantle red,
   There lay Sir Olaf stark and dead.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   The next, next day at early morn,
   Corses three from the gate are borne.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.

   Olaf the knight, and his youthful bride,
   And his mother dear, who of care had died.
      _Gaily they dance in the greenwood_.




THE TREACHEROUS MERMAN


   "Now rede me, mother," the merman cried,
   "How Marsk Stig's daughter may be my bride."

   She made him of water a noble steed,
   Of sands a saddle, and reins of reed.

   To a young knight chang'd she then her son,
   And to Mary's church at speed he's gone.

   To the church's ring his steed he bound,
   And three times backward the church pac'd round.

   When in he strode so proud and tall
   Away the images turned them all.

   The priest was standing with open book:
   "O who is yon knight of stately look?"

   Then laughed the maiden within her sleeve:
   "If he were my husband I should not grieve."

   He step'd over benches one and two:
   "O Marsk Stig's daughter I doat on you."

   He stepped over benches three and four:
   "Give me thy troth I thee implore."

   She gave him her hand with an air so free:
   "Here take thy troth, I will go with thee."

   A bridal train from church they go,
   They danc'd so lightly and free from woe.

   And when they came to the salt sea strand,
   The little boats turn'd away from the land.

   "Now Marsk Stig's daughter hold my steed,
   To cross the water a boat we need."

   To a little boat he chang'd his steed,
   And over the waves away they speed.

   And when in the midst of the sound they were,
   Dissolv'd the boat into water fair.

   Up the land far was heard the cry
   Of Marsk Stig's maid in her agony.

   Now will I caution each maiden bright,
   To dance not away with an unknown knight.

_Note_.--The above Ballad is a later, and greatly improved, version of
one which appeared under the title _The Merman_ only, in the _Romantic
Ballads_ of 1826.  The introduction of the incident of the changing by
magic of the horse into a boat, furnishes a reason for the catastrophe
which was lacking in the earlier version.




THE KNIGHT IN THE DEER'S SHAPE
OR
THE DECEIVER DECEIVED


   It was the Knight Sir Peter,
      He dwelleth down by Oe;
   Nothing, nothing, will he do
      But sail about and row.

   Sail about and row about
      Is all that he will do,
   So many a maiden he allures
      And proves to them untrue.

   To servants two addressed him,
      Sir Peter of the isle:
   "With wily speeches win me
      The Damsel Usalile."

   The gallant swains then riding
      To Usalile's home,
   A message sent inquiring
      If they to her might come.

   In then came the gallants,
      Before the board they stood--
   O, they were nimble at the tongue,
      Could speak in wily mode!

   "Thy brothers seven from Skaane
      Thee lovingly do greet,
   On board this ship to meet them
      Their sister they entreat."

   "O if with me for parlance
      My brothers are inclined,
   Here at her table sitting
      Their sister they will find.

   "No lovely maid on shipboard
      Is ever wont to go,
   But sharp reproofs pursue her,
      And taunting words, I trow."

   Away then ride the gallants
      And to their lord repair:
   "We cannot win the damsel
      By means of speeches fair."

   "O I will have the damsel,
      And she shall yet be won;
   I vow me to deceive her
      By force of magic Rune."

   Then o'er his broider'd trousers,
      And jacket flower'd fair,
   The skin of a hart he donneth
      The maiden to ensnare.

   Now sported the wild little hart
      The damsel's house before,
   Glitter'd like the ruddy gold
      Each hair the creature bore.

   Open stood the castle gate,
      The hart therein has stray'd;
   And lo with little puppies
      The merry maiden play'd.

   Up and down he sported,
      To the green wood he sped;
   Behind the Damsel hasting
      In a leash the puppies led.

   He sported up, he sported down,
      Towards the mead he hied;
   The Damsel speeding after
      With hand to lure him tried.

   The Damsel speeding after
      With hand to lure him strove:
   "That yonder lovely hart were tame
      O would to God above!

   "O would to God in heaven,
      That yonder hart were mine!
   Nothing should he ever drink
      Except the rosy wine.

   "Nothing should he ever drink
      Except the rosy wine,
   And nowhere should he slumber
      Save in these arms of mine."

   The knight he off has shaken
      The deer shape from his frame;
   In verity fair damsel,
      The hart he now is tame!

   Long stood she, the Damsel,
      So deep reflected she:
   "O for some cunning artifice
      To rid me quick of thee!"

   "Sir Peter, if what now I know
      I had but known before,
   The children I shall bear thee
      They ne'er should have been poor.

   "Within my father's castle
      A little girl I strayed,
   When in the earth a treasure
      Of ruddy gold they laid.

   "Down by the strand 'tis buried,
      Beneath a mighty stone."
   Thither to fetch the treasure
      In haste Sir Peter's gone.

   He has broken up the flinty rock,
      So deep a hole he's made--
   But none shall ever gold dig up
      Where gold was never laid!

   One shall never gold dig up
      Where gold was never laid;
   Never came together more
      The knight and lovely maid.




THE STALWART MONK


   Above the wood a cloister towers,
      Gilt window it displays;
   There lie before it Kempions twelve,
      The cloister they will raze.

   There lie before it Kempions twelve,
      The cloister down will tear;
   The oxen and the cows they slew
      The monks should have for fare.

   The monk he out of the window looked,
      Then shook both beam and wall:
   "And be the Kemps no more than twelve,
      I'll easily tame them all."

   The monk he called to his serving lad:
      "My club go fetch me in,
   For I will out to the forest straight
      And make them cease their din."

   It took fifteen to bring the club,
      And they strain'd all their might;
   The monk took it up with fingers two
      And swung it round so light.

   He takes the club upon his back
      And into the wood he's gone,
   And there met him the Kempions twelve
      Would fain set him upon.

   They drew a circle on the ground,
      And each one troll'd a song;
   I tell to ye for verity
      He silenced them all ere long.

   First slew he four, then slew he five,
      At length he all has slain;
   It was the monk of the shaven crown
      Would gladly fight again.

   It was the monk of the shaven crown
      Would seek for another fray,
   So out of the wood across the wold
      He blythely took his way.

   So blythely out of the good green wood
      He sped across the hill,
   And there met him a hoary Trold
      Whose name was Sivord Gill.

   "If thou art the monk of the shaven crown
      Who scath'd the warrior band,
   Thou either from me shalt shamefully flee
      Or manfully 'gainst me stand."

   "I am the monk of the shaven crown
      Who slew the warrior band,
   And never from thee will I shamefully flee
      But like a man will stand."

   The first blow gave the Trold, it fell
      Upon the monk's shoulder down,
   'Midst of his shoulder broke the skin,
      Bebloodied was his gown.

   The next blow gave the monk, it struck
      The Trold to the verdant sward:
   "Now shame befall thee, shaven Monk,
      The blows of thy club are hard.

   "Now hold thy hand, thou shaven Monk,
      And do not strike me more,
   And I will give thee silver and gold,
      And of coin a plenteous store."

   The Monk he ran, the Trold he crept,
      Still equal was their height;
   Then shewed he him a little house
      With doors of gold so bright.

   Then shewed he him a little house
      With golden doors fifteen;
   There got the Monk of silver and gold
      All he could wish I ween.

   Seven lasts of silver, seven of gold,
      To the cloisters he caus'd convey;
   He bade them find a monk could wield
      A club in as brave a way.

   'Twas drawing fast to an evening hour
      And the sun went down to rest,
   Still fifteen Roman miles the monk
      To the cloister had at least.

   'Twas tending fast to the evening tide
      And the sun to the earth did haste,
   Yet he seized the first dish at the supper board
      Ere the Abbot could get a taste.

   Full fifteen monks he knock'd down when
      No pottage he espied,
   And up he hung fifteen because
      The herrings were not fried.

   Then out and spoke the little boy
      Who waited at the meal:
   "Each time the monk to the cloister comes
      He thus with us will deal."

   And it was getting late at night
      And folks to bed should hie,
   Then because the Abbot sat too long
      He struck him out an eye.

   The Abbot hurried off to bed,
      No longer dared remain;
   I say to ye for verity
      He felt both shame and pain.

   'Twas early in the morning tide,
      The bells began to ring;
   It was the monk of the shaven crown
      Would neither read nor sing.

   So stately strode he up the choir
      Where the monks and nuns they stand,
   Not one of them dared read or sing
      For fear of his stalwart hand.

   So they the Abbot pious and good
      To a simple monk debased,
   And they the Monk of the shaven crown
      As Abbot o'er them placed.

   And he the cloister held with might
      Till thirty years were flown;
   Then died as Abbot in mighty fame,
      The Monk of the shaven crown.




THE CRUEL STEP-DAME


   My father up of the country rode,
      He thought to wed a lovely rose;
   And there he met a laidly wife,
      The source was she of all my woes.

   The first night they together slept
      She seemed to me a mother mild,
   But ere a second night was past
      She prov'd a step-dame fierce and wild.

   I sat beside my father's board,
      I sported there with hound and pup,
   And then to blast my blissful lot
      My step-dame wild came striding up.

   That God should make my lot so blest
      My wicked step-dame could not bear;
   She changed me to a sword so keen,
      And bade me far and wide to fare.

   By day I grac'd the side of the knight,
      I hung the hero's heart so near;
   At night I lay beneath his head,
      For his good sword he loved so dear.

   That God had made my lot so blest
      My wicked step-dame could not bear;
   She changed me to a little knife,
      And bade me far and wide to fare.

   By day I was in the Lady's hand,
      The linen white with me she cut;
   At night within her bower I slept,
      All in her golden casket put.

   That God had made my lot so blest,
      My wicked step-dame could not bear;
   She changed me to a little hind,
      And bade me wander far and near.

   She changed me to a little hind,
      And bade me wander far and near;
   My seven maids to wolves she changed,
      And fiercely urged them me to tear.

   My seven maidens were so kind,
      They all refus'd the hind to tear;
   Then vexed was my step-mother wild
      That God had made my lot so fair.

   The young Sir Henrik serves at court,
      He is a knight of handsome mien;
   For me he sorrowed day and night,
      But would not let his grief be seen.

   Sir Henrik roves with bow in hand
      The good green wood at morning tide;
   Then up there came a little hind,
      And fondly she the warrior eyed.

   Then up there came a little hind
      Before the young knight as he rang'd;
   Then off she cast her bestial shape,
      And to a lovely damsel changed.

   He took her tenderly in his arm,
      He called her oft his bosom's dear:
   "Thrice praised be God in heav'n that dwells
      That I have found my damsel here.

   "I have not any servant, love,
      Nor hast thou any maid, my fair,
   So we'll pull down the linden leaves,
      And thus our bridal bed prepare."

   It was then the damsel fair,
      Within the bed herself she placed;
   It was the brave Sir Henrik then
      Sweet sank to sleep by her embraced.

   Full sorely wept the damsel fair,
      As sleep began his eyes to find;
   Assuming then her bestial shape,
      She went away--a hapless hind.




THE CUCKOO


_From the Danish_.

   Yonder the cuckoo flutters,
      _Cuckoo_, _Cuckoo_! he utters,
   And lights the beech upon;
      Many a voice is sweeter,
   But do not mock the creature,
      Let each enjoy his own.

   He knows no notes of passion,
      A new song cannot fashion;
   True to the ancient rule,
      What his good sires respected
   By him is not neglected,--
      Is he for that a fool?

   O thou, my human brother,
      Who scorning every other
   With self-conceit dost swell,
      We cannot all be gallants,
   Not equal are our talents--
      Thou art no nightingale!

                                   LONDON:
                 Printed for THOMAS J. WISE, Hampstead, N.W.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
