THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.

(_A Characteristic Welcome to the Coming Year._)

It was on the 31st of December that they met. It had been arranged that
at the final hour of the last day of the expiring year they should
compare notes, and not one of them had failed to keep the appointment.
It would be scarcely right to say they were cheerful, but merriment was
not included in the programme.

[Illustration: The Military Man.]

"There is not the slightest chance of my bettering myself," said the
Military Man. "Now that the Regiment has come from India, I can't afford
to live at home, and I can't exchange because of my liver. Promotion was
never slower than in 'Ours,' and my look-out is about the most ghastly
there ever yet was seen."

[Illustration: The Briefless Barrister.]

"You are wrong there," observed the Briefless Barrister of mature years.
"I think mine is a shade worse. I give you my word that during the last
twelve months I have not earned enough fees to pay the rent of my
Chambers and the salary of my Clerk. And things are getting worse and
worse. One of the Solicitors who used to give me an occasional turn has
been struck off the Rolls, and the other, has transferred his business
to Australia. I feel inclined to follow, but I can't raise the
passage-money. What luck, now, could be worse than mine?"

"Why mine," answered the Author. "An entirely new set of men have come
to the front since I was popular, and my works are a drug in the market.
I haven't been able to get rid of more than a dozen pages during the
twelve months, and they appeared in a Magazine that stopped before the
appearance of the next number! The future never looked blacker and more
hopeless. I believe I am the most unfortunate man on earth."

[Illustration: The Doctor.]

"I fancy you are wrong," put in the Doctor. "I think my look-out worse
than yours. Sold my practice seven years ago to flutter on the Stock
Exchange. Lost my money in seven minutes, and have never had a patient
since. I went to West Slocum (my old home) the other day, and found the
place occupied by three Doctors, and the local Undertaker told me there
was not room enough for one! Talk about luck, I am the unluckiest dog in
the world!"

[Illustration: The Actor who has his Head turned with Applause.]

"I am not so sure of that," said the Actor, "here have I been 'resting'
for the last twelve months, and it seems just as likely as not that I
shall continue the operation until '94. I have tried everything in Town
and the Provinces, and there isn't an opening anywhere. My fate is about
the worst of the lot."

[Illustration: The Artist.]

"Not so bad as mine," grumbled the Artist. "Haven't sold a single
picture since the Jubilee year, and can't afford to pay the frame-maker.
My studio is full of paintings, and the dealers say that there isn't a
single canvas amongst the lot but what would be refused admission to an
Exhibition of Sign-boards! Don't know how I should have kept body and
soul together if it hadn't been for an opportune loan from one who in
happier times was, in my employment as a model. Talk about prospects!
Look at mine!"

[Illustration: Bulls and Bears. City Men.]

"Well, come, you are better off than I am," said the City Man. "If I
hadn't now and again to appear before the Registrar in the Bankruptcy
Court, I don't know what I should do with my time! I am stone broke.
That's about it--stone broke! Knocked out of the 'House,' and without a
scrap of credit: I am done for!"

And it was agreed that none of them had any prospects. Then they
separated, or rather, were on the eve of separating.

"By the way--fancy forgetting to do it!" said one of them.

And then they rectified the omission, and wished one another, "A Happy
New Year!"

THE FEAST OF REASON UP TO DATE.

The old Alchemist smiled as he watched the crucible on the glowing
coals. The fumes rose, and he inhaled them with delight.

It was a triumph. Yes, he was able to go forth a conqueror. It mattered
not where he wandered, for all flew from before him. He seemed to
possess some subtle power that no one understood, but which was
all-conquering. After a lengthened absence he returned to England.

At his Club he met one of his friends--a doctor.

"I will tell you my adventures," said the old Alchemist, lighting a
strong cigar. "You must know----"

"I know everything," said the Physician, sternly. "I know why you have
scared the Arabs, and why disease cannot touch you. The secret is
revealed by a recent _Lancet_. You can brave disease and death, because
_you are fond of eating onions_!"

Seeing that his secret was known, the old Alchemist heaved a heavy sigh,
and disappeared, perchance for ever!

"Tinned Dinners."

_A propos_ of an interesting article in the _Daily Telegraph_ last
Thursday on this subject, the problem that most naturally suggests
itself is, "How about the dinner, if you haven't any tin?" "No Song, No
Supper" is pleasantly alliterative, but is not of universal application.
"No tin, no dinner," may pass into a proverb, but, anyhow, it's a fact.

TO MY RIVAL.

  How I loved her, blindly, madly!
                          Sighing sadly,
                                     Feeling hurt
  If I did not see her daily.
                          Oh, how gaily
                                     She could flirt!

  Flirt with me, or flirt with others,
                          With my brothers
                                     Just as well,

  How I could be such a duffer
                          So to suffer,
                                     I can't tell.

  Then you came, played tennis finely,
                          Danced divinely,
                                     Sang as well;

  Half Adonis, half Apollo,
                          Beat me hollow.
                                     Such a swell!

  How I hated you, so clever!
                          _You_ were never
                                     Thought a bore!

  When I saw you so romantic
                          I was frantic;
                                     How I swore!

  I've recovered. Is she not a
                          Child that's got a
                                     Newer toy?
  From the first she thought she'd booked you;
                          Now she's hooked you.
                                     Wish you joy!

  I'll forgive you altogether,--
                          She'll see whether
                                     I shall care,--
  Shake your hand and gaily greet you,
                          When I meet you
                                     Anywhere.

A GRAND OLD DIARY FOR 1893.

(_Published in Advance._)

_January._--As I am in Biarritz, may just as well see how they manage
things in Spain. Looked up the Ministry at Madrid, and drafted them a
treaty with Portugal. They thanked me with the courtesy of hidaljos, but
refused with the paltry jealousy of a petty-fogging second-rate Power!
What nasty pride! Sent home to one of my Magazines, "How I took part in
a Bull-fight."

_February._--Opened Parliament and set things going, and then thought I
might take a trip to Russia to fill up the odd time. Had a chat with the
CZAR, and knocked off a plan for the introduction of "Home Rule." CZAR
polite, but didn't see it. Well of course every one has a right to his
own opinions, still I think it would do. CZAR didn't. Sent home to one
of my Magazines, "How I lived for three days in the Mines of Siberia."

_March._--Back to town for a few days, and then off again. CLARK says
travelling the best thing in the world for superfluous energy. Did China
thoroughly. Drew up a plan for altering the language, manners,
religions, politics, and customs of the Chinese. Brought it before a
Special Committee of Mandarins; but they prevaricated, and practically
shelved it. Sent home to one of my Magazines an article, "How I had a
Boxing-match with the Emperor of CHINA, and knocked his Majesty out of
time."

_April._--Things going on decently well at Westminster, so started for
Turkey. Arranged Turkish Finance for the Grand Vizier. But that official
distinctly an--well, not a wise man--said he would knock out a better
budget himself. Sent home to one of my Magazines, "My Fortnight's
Manoeuvres with the Bashi Bazouks."

_May._--Dropped in at St. Stephen's, and put a few finishing touches to
one or two measures, then away to Egypt. Sketched out a Republican form
of Government for the Khedive. However, his Highness did not seem to see
it. The Egyptians are very Conservative in their notions. Sent home to
one of my Magazines, "A Fortnight in the MAHDI'S Camp, by an
Acquaintance of OSMAN DIGNA."

_June._--Attended a couple of Cabinet Meetings, and then to America for
a jaunt. Gave the President a carefully worked-out scheme for converting
the Government of the United States into a Monarchy of limited
liability. The President greatly pleased, but not quite sure it would
work. The Americans are sadly behind the age. Sent home to one of my
Magazines, "How to see the World's Fair at Chicago in Twenty Minutes, by
One who has done it."

_July._--Session nearly out. Took part in a debate or two and then off
to the North Pole in a balloon. Managed to see a good deal of snow and
ice, and fancy we caught a sight of the Pole itself. Sent home (by
parachute) to one of my Magazines, "How I got within Measurable Distance
of the Moon."

_August._--Just back to Westminster for a couple of days to wind up the
Session, then away to India. Went on my own responsibility to see the
Ameer of AFGHANISTAN. Drew up a treaty in draft to be signed by the
Ameer and the Emperor of RUSSIA, CZAR was immensely pleased and wanted
to make me Prince of CRIM TARTARY. Sent to one of my Magazines. "How I
shot my first Wild Elephant."

_September._--Returned to Hawarden for the inside of a week and then
paid my hurried visit to Australia. Submitted to the Colonies a scheme
for "A Federal Association for the encouragement of the Naturalisation
of the Rabbit in Australasia." The proposal fell rather flat. Find the
rabbit is already known in these places. Sent home to one of my
Magazines an article entitled, "My Prize-fight with the Kangaroo, and
how I won it."

_October._--In London for a few days, then to Mexico. Saw the President,
and suggested the revival of the Empire. President very rude; told me to
mind my own business. Sent home to one of my Magazines, "A Week on the
Prairies Buffalo lassooing."

_November._--Popped in at Midlothian, and made a speech or two, and then
hurried away to Norway and Sweden. Tried to induce them to give up
_their_ form of Home Rule, which, as all the world knows, has been a
failure. Wanted them to take our Irish edition. They asked me "if it had
been a success?" Stumped! Sent to one of my Magazines, "How to take a
Photograph by Midnight Sunlight, by One who has done it."

_December._--Obliged to stay at home, because I think we are going to
change our Town-house. Downing Street most convenient, but question
whether I shall be able to get a renewal of the lease next year.
Sketched out the _scenario_ of the Drury Lane Pantomime; but Sir
AUGUSTUS prefers his own. Well, well, youth will have its way. Sent in
my special article for Christmas and the New Year, "The History of the
World, from the Earliest Times to the close of the Nineteenth Century,
by One who has employed his leisure moments in its compilation." And
here I may conclude, by wishing everybody "A Happy New Year."

STUART-RENDELL, when the rumour reached him. "What are Barmouth and
Biarritz? I took Mr. G. on to the Pyrenees, and Cannes. If a fresh
Barony is to be created for ARMITSTEAD, what shall I have?" "Why, a

THE MAN WHO WOULD.

V.--THE MAN WHO WOULD BRING AN ACTION FOR LIBEL.

The following incident in the career of BROWZER was recalled to memory
by an article in a literary journal. An author was airing his
grievances; among them this,--that writers of repute occasionally lend
their names and pens to obscure or unsuccessful papers for a
consideration, without asking how the usual staff of the paper is paid.
These, indeed, are delicate inquiries. Part of the plaint was expressed
in the following sentence:--

   "When a journal makes a call upon a good author, and in the pages of
   which he can gain neither honour nor renown, from which, as a matter
   of taste, he would shrink, under ordinary circumstances, from
   contributing to, that journal ought to be subjected to careful
   scrutiny."

Now what can this possibly be supposed to mean?--

"When a journal makes a call upon a good author, _and_ in the pages of
which he can gain neither honour nor renown," (why "and"?) "from which"
(namely, "honour and renown") "he would shrink" (why should he shrink
from renown and honour?) "from contributing to," (and how can he
contribute to honour and renown?) "that journal ought to be subjected to
careful scrutiny." "From which he would shrink from contributing to,"
what have we here? Surely it is the grammar that needs careful scrutiny,
and surely, in no circumstances, could a lofty "rate of pay" be
conferred on a style of this description.

It is natural to reflect that a writer in this unconventional manner has
mainly to thank himself for any want of success which he, and we, may
regret; and that reflection, again, suggests the case of BROWZER, the
Man who would bring an Action for Libel.

BROWZER had a small patrimony, any amount of leisure, and a good deal of
ambition. He liked the society of literary gentlemen, he envied their
buoyant successes, such as being "interviewed,", and sorrowed with their
sorrows, such as being reviewed. He listened to their artless gossip,
and fancied himself extremely knowing. In these circumstances of
temptation, BROWZER fell, as many better men have done, and wrote a
Novel. He drew on the recollections of his suburban youth; he revived
the sorrows of his sole flirtation; he sketched his aunts with a
satirical hand, and he produced a packet of manuscript weighing about
7-1/2 lbs. This manuscript he sent, first, to a literary man, whose name
he had seen in the papers, with a long and fulsome letter, asking for an
opinion. The parcel came back next day, accompanied by a lithographed
form of excuse. BROWZER denounced the envy and arrogance of mankind, and
sent his parcel to a publisher. He carefully set little traps, with
pieces of adhesive paper, every here and there, to detect carelessness
on the side of the reader. The parcel came back in a week, with a note
of regret that the novel was not suitable. Only one of BROWZER'S pieces
of adhesive paper had been removed, but the others were carefully
initialled. A modest author would have concluded that his opening
chapters condemned him, but BROWZER'S wrath against mankind only burned
the more fiercely. He removed his traps, however, and sent _Wilton's
Wooing_ the round of the Row. It always came back, "returning like the
peewit," at uncertain intervals. It was really a remarkable manuscript,
for it was written in black ink, blue ink, red ink, pencil, and
stylograph; moreover, most of it was inscribed on the margins, the
original copy having been erased, in favour of improved versions.
Finally BROWZER discovered a publisher who would take _Wilton's Wooing_,
on conditions that the author should pay L150 for preliminary expenses
(exclusive of advertising, for which a special charge was to be made),
would guarantee the sale of 300 copies, and would accept half profits on
the net results of the transaction.

The work saw the light, and, externally, it certainly did look very like
a novel. The reviews, which BROWZER read with frenzied excitement, also
looked very like reviews of novels. They were usually about two inches
in length, and generally ended by saying that "Mr. BROWZER has still
much to learn." Some of them condensed BROWZER'S plot into about eight
lines, in this manner:--

"He was a yearning psychologist--she was a suburban flirt. He sighed,
and analysed; she listened, and yawned. Finally, she went on the stage,
and he compiled this record of the stirring transaction."

But at last there came a longer criticism of _Wilton's Wooing_ in the
_Erechtheum_. Somebody took BROWZER to pieces, averring that "Mr.
BROWZER has neither grammar" (here followed a string of examples of
BROWZER'S idioms) "nor humour," (here came instances of his wit and
fancy), "nor taste" (again reinforced by specimens), "nor even knowledge
of the French language, which he habitually massacres." (Here followed
_a l'outrance, bete noir, soubriquet_, all our old friends.) Finally,
Mr. BROWZER was informed that many fields of honourable distinction
might be open to him, but that a novelist he could never be.

The wrath of BROWZER was magnificent. He went about among his friends,
who told him that the critique was clearly by that brute ST. CLAIR; they
knew his hand, they said; a confounded, conceited pendant, and a
stuck-up puppy. The review was calculated to damage the sale of any
book; it was a dastardly attack on BROWZER'S reputation as a man of wit
and humour, a linguist, and a grammarian. They thought (as BROWZER
wished to know) that an action would lie against the reviewer, or the
review. BROWZER went to a Solicitor, who espoused his cause, but without
enthusiasm. The name of the reviewer was demanded. Now ST. CLAIR was not
the reviewer; the critic was a man just from College, hence his fresh
indignation. Whether for the sake of diversion, or for the
advertisement, the critic wished himself to bear the brunt of BROWZER'S
anger, and the _Erechtheum_ handed him over to justice; his name was
_Smith_. This damped BROWZER'S eagerness; no laurels were to be won from
the obscure SMITH. The advocate of that culprit made out a case highly
satisfactory to the learned Judge, who had been a reviewer himself upon
a time. He showed that malice was out of the question; SMITH had never
heard BROWZER'S name, nor BROWZER, SMITH'S (in this instance) before the
book was published. He called several professors of the French tongue,
to prove that BROWZER'S French was that usual in fiction, but not the
language of MOLIERE, or of the Academy. He left no doubt on the question
of grammar. As to the wit and pathos, he made much mirth out of them. He
cross-examined BROWZER: had other reviews praised him? Had publishers
leaped eagerly at his work? On what terms was it published? BROWZER'S
answer appeared to show that _Wilton's Wooing_ was not regarded as a
masterpiece by the Trade.

BROWZER'S advocate put it that BROWZER was being crushed by unfair
ridicule on his first entry into a noble profession, or art, that of
SCOTT and FIELDING. He spoke of mighty poets in their misery dead. He
drew a picture of BROWZER'S agonies of mind. He showed that masterpieces
had, ere now, been rejected by the publishers. He denounced the licence
of the Press. Who was an unheard-of SMITH, who had written nothing, to
come forward and shout at BROWZER from behind the hedge of the
anonymous? The novelist was a creature of delicate organisation; he
suffered as others did not suffer; his only aim was to lighten care, and
instruct ignorance. Why was _he_ to be selected for cruel sarcasm and
insult?

The learned Judge summed-up dead against BROWZER. BROWZER had published
a book, had invited criticism, and then, when he only got what his work
merited, he came and asked for damages.

The question of malice he left to the Jury, who must see that the Critic
and Author had each been ignorant of the other's existence.

The Jury did not deliberate long. They brought in a verdict for BROWZER,
damages L500, and costs.

The advertisement, the publicity, caused _Wilton's Wooing_ to be eagerly
asked for. BROWZER'S book went into ten editions, and a large issue, at
six shillings. Next year BROWZER'S publishers proved that he owed them
L37 14s. 6d. This was disappointing, and even inexplicable, but
BROWZER'S fortune was made, and now he is much lauded by all the
reviewers.

The Foreman of the Jury is my grocer, and I ventured, in the confidence
of private life, to question the justice of the verdict. "Well," he
said, "you see it comes to _this_: where is this to stop? Mr. BROWZER,
he sells novels; I sell groceries."

"Excellent of their kind!" I interrupted.

"Well, I try to give satisfaction; and so does Mr. BROWZER. If that
young Mr. SMITH writes to the papers that my sugars are not original,
that I plagiarise them from a sand-bunker, or that my teas are not good
Chinese,--like Mr. BROWZER'S French, which is what is usual in the
Trade,--why, then, he interferes with my business. I bring my action,
and hope to win it; and so, as a tradesman, I feel that Mr. BROWZER was
wronged." There was no reply to these arguments, but I pity the
Reviewers.

TO MAUD.--A BIRTHDAY ROUNDEL.

  An empty purse! It's true we often say
    This weary world of ours knows nothing worse,
  And yet I send you, on this festive day,
                      An empty purse.

  Do not consign to an untimely hearse
    The friend who treats you in this heartless way.
  Don't let your pretty lips invoke a curse,
    But let me wish you happiness, and may
  You guess the reason from this little verse
    Why at your feet to-day I humbly lay
                      An empty purse.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

The worst thing about Mrs. HENNIKER'S new Novel, published by HURST AND
BLACKETT, is its title. There is a _London-Journal_ish,
penny-plain-twopence-coloured smack about _Foiled_ which is misleading.
My Baronite says he misses the re-iterated interjection which should
accompany the verb. "Ha! Ha! Foiled!!" would seem to be more the
thing--but it isn't. The story is a simple one, wound about an old
theme. It is well constructed, and admirably told. All the characters
are what are called Society people; but Mrs. HENNIKER has studied them
in the drawing-room, not from the area-railings, and reproduces them on
her page with vivid strokes. Some of her acquaintances will probably
feel uneasy when they read about _Lord Huddersfield_; whilst others will
be quite sure that (among their sisters), they recognise _Mrs. Anthony
Gore_. Those not in Society of to-day will find reminiscences of _Becky
Sharp_ in _Mrs. Gore_; whilst big-boned, good-natured, simple-hearted
_Anthony_, pleasantly recalls _Major Dobbin_. The book is full of shrewd
observation, and fine touches of character-drawing, with refreshing
oases of flower-garden and moor in Yorkshire and Scotland.

       *       *       *       *       *

Those who like a good "gashly" book should, my Baronite says, forthwith
send for _Lord Wastwater_ (BLACKWOOD). The plot is so eerie, and its
conclusion so incredulous, that the practised novel-reader, seeing
whither he is being led, almost up to the last page expects the
threatened blow will be averted by some more or less probable agency.
But Mr. (or Miss) SYDNEY BOLTON is inexorable. _Lord Wastwater_ is dead
now, and there can be no harm in saying that the House of Lords is well
rid of his impending company. He would have made a sad Duke.

A little more than a year ago, in celebration of the seventieth birthday
of HENRIETTE RONNER, there was published a volume containing
reproductions in photogravure of some of the works of that charming
painter. Madame RONNER knows the harmless, necessary cat as intimately
as ROSA BONHEUR knows the horse or the ox. She has painted it with
loving hand, in all circumstances of its strangely-varied life. No one
knows, my Baronite says, how pretty and graceful a thing a cat is, till
they study it with the assistance of Madame RONNER. CASSELLS afford
opportunity of making this study by presentation of a new and cheaper
edition of the volume, with cats in all attitudes purring round an
interesting essay on themselves, and their Portraiture, contributed by
Mr. H. M. SPIELMANN.

CHRISTMAS NUMBERS.

(_By a Comfort-loving Old Curmudgeon._)

  Yes, the boys home from school are all playing the fool
    With the house and its fittings from garret to basement.
  The girls, too, are back, and continual clack
    Goes on all day long, to home comfort's effacement.
  The pudding's as sticky, the holly as pricky,
    The smell of sour oranges awful as ever;
  Stuffed hamper-unpackers, and pullers of crackers,
    At making of litter and noise just as clever.
  The stairs are all rustle, the hall's full of bustle,
    Cold draughts and the banging of doors are incessant.
  They're nailing up greenery, putting up "scenery,"
    Ready for plays; 'tis a process unpleasant!
  A strong smell of size, dabs of paint in one's eyes,
    And "rehearsals" don't add to the charm of one's drawing-room.
  My pet easy-chairs are all bundled down-stairs,
    To leave the young idiots stage-space and more jawing-room
  For "Private Theatricals." Wax on my hat trickles
    From "Christmas Candles," that spot all the passages.
  Heart-cheering youthfulness? Common-sense truthfulness
    Tell us, at Christmas, youth's crassest of crass ages.
  From kitchen to attic plates polychromatic,
    From some "Christmas Number," make lumber. Good Heavens!
  Ye young Yule-tide stuffers, _we_ know, we old buffers,
    The _true_ "Christmas Numbers" are--Sixes and Sevens!

THE YOUNG GUARD.

    "_Old Sentry._ For this relief, much thanks; 'tis bitter cold,
      And I am sick at heart."--_Hamlet._

  First Sentry-go! Night, stars and snow!
    The air bites shrewdly, nipping, eager,
  As in old Denmark long ago.
    A long, long watch through storm and leaguer
  That dim, departing Sentinel
    Has held. He hails the Young Guard's entry--
  "Who goes there?" "Friend!" "Pass, friend!" "All's well!"
    Tired age retreats--fresh youth's on sentry.

  All's Well? Why that's a formal hail
    From Guard to Guard. "Not a mouse stirring,"
  _Francisco_ cried, chill, sleepy, pale.
    No bat through night-wastes wheeling, whirring;
  No trumpet's shrill, no rocket's roar.
    And here all seems as calm and quiet
  As on the heights of Elsinore,--
    Save for far sounds of wassail riot.

  Some "wake to-night and take their rouse"
    In England as in Denmark, doubtless,
  But here calm broods on midnight's brows;
    The flag clings to the flag-staff, floutless;
  And if ghosts walk--well, youngling Year,
    With hints of spectres why alarm you?
  Take your first watch, boy, void of fear,
    With hope, that inward fire, to warm you!

  The Old Guards know that youthful glow
    Is not the only thing that's needed
  For a long spell of Sentry-go;
    But when were veteran croakings heeded?
  And if they were, would carking care,
    Not wrinkle boy-brow prematurely?
  All's well--to-night. May your watch fare
    Serenely, steadfastly, securely.

  Angels and ministers of grace
    Defend you from all spooks alarming!
  There's something in your younker face
    That even ghosts should find disarming.
  They come in questionable shapes,
    Those phantoms of the Social Crisis.
  Are their cries menaces--or japes?
    These be _our_ Mysteries of Isis!

  The Citadel you have to ward
    Is old, and forces new are mustering.
  Vigilant valour will afford
    More help, my boy, than fear or flustering.
  Young HARRY with his beaver up
    Should be your model, my young "nipper!"
  _Punch_, lifting high a brimming cup,
    Tips the Young Guard a friendly flipper!

  From Bow comes the fur that's on his coat,
    From Germany comes his watch;
  His trousers the "London make" denote,
    His accent is Franco-Scotch;
    His liquor is Special Scotch;
  He "guesses" much, and he says "You bet";
    His manner is slow and sly;
  His smoke is a Turkish cigarette,
    For he is a Russian Spy--
    A blood-seeking Russian Spy!

  Oh! how will the woes of Virtue end?
    'Tis late in the Five-Act play;
  And Fortune still is dark Vice's friend,
    And villany holds its sway,
    Its truly wonderful sway!
  'Twould scarce be the thing for Vice to crow,
    And Virtue to sink and die;
  The end must arrive _some_ time, we know--
    So bring on your Russian Spy,--
    Come, out with your Russian Spy!

  It cannot be long! The time is here
    For Virtue to pardon Vice,
  Providing he does not live too near,
    Or call more than once or twice--
    Look in more than once or twice.

  But wrongs are not brooked by Russian gents--
    They're awfully angry fry!
  The hero may pardon past events,
    But not so the Russian Spy,--
    'Tis death from the Russian Spy!

  So as humbled Vice up stage retires,
    Forgiven by him, he'd slay
  (A noble revenge the House admires,
    By utterly giving way--
    By sniffingly giving way)--
  The Spy, with revolver, comes down C.,
    And aims at the evening sky,
  And down tumbles Vice, as dead as three,
    From lead from the Russian Spy!--
    Oh! accurate Russian Spy!

_Question._ And so you object to Theatres and Music-Halls?

_Answer._ Certainly; and know as much about one as the other.

_Q._ Do you approve of SHAKSPEARE?

_A._ Certainly not; nor of any other playwright.

_Q._ Have you ever read a dramatic composition?

_A._ Never; it is against my principles to peruse such (so-called)
literature.

_Q._ Then why do you object to the Author's work?

_A._ Because I know if I were SHAKSPEARE or any of his colleagues, my
writings would be entirely unfit for representation.

_Q._ Have you ever entered a Theatre?

_A._ Certainly not; and never shall.

_Q._ Have you visited a Music-Hall?

_A._ Emphatically no, and don't want to.

_Q._ Then why do you complain of them?

_A._ Because my imagination pictures them as indescribably horrible.

_Q._ How comes it that knowing so little, you have been sent to
adjudicate upon so much?

_A._ Because I was elected by the know-nothings of the district I have
the honour to represent.

_Q._ And what became of the rest of the constituency?

_A._ You mean the majority--oh, they didn't take the trouble to register
their votes.

_Q._ Then you are the mouthpiece of ignorance and incompetence?

_A._ Certainly--but that is not a pretty way of putting it!

THE POET'S LOVE.

  My Lady's name I cannot state,
     At different times I greet her
  As CHLOE, AMARYLLIS, KATE,
     According to the metre;
  I've called her MABEL many a time,--
  A name which leads itself to rhyme.

  My Lady's hair is sometimes black
    To match her sable dresses,
  At others falls about her back
    In glorious auburn tresses,
  Yet do not take me to imply
  She's given to the use of dye.

  I like her when she's sweet and small,
    The daintiest of flowers,
  I love her when, divinely tall,
    Above the rest she towers;
  And yet, as second thoughts suggest,
  Perhaps a golden mean were best.

  Sometimes, a simple rustic maid,
    She strays through meadows green,
  Sometimes her beauty is displayed
    In glittering ball-room scene;
  More recently I've thought upon
  Creating her a lady-Don.

  This peerless girl of whom I speak
    I ever worship blindly
  And sing her praises once a week,
    If editors are kindly;
  Alas, this paragon, I own,
  Exists within my verse alone!

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
