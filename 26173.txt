JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), the ancestor of this STEPHENS Family, was born,
according to the family tradition, in what is now the County of Berkes,
in the State of Pennsylvania, of Welsh parents, A. D. 1733. According to
the recollection of C. C. Stephens, (176) his grandfather, E. D.
Stephens, (16), son of this Joshua Stephens, (6), stated to him in an
interview at Hardin, Ohio, about 1860, that Joshua Stephens's father's
name was also Joshua Stephens, (3), which would make him the senior;
that Joshua Stephens, Senior, with two brothers, David, (5), and
Ebenezer, (4), came over from Wales. Of these three last named persons
nothing further is known at the present writing, than the foregoing
statement.

That there was a large Welsh immigration into the present territory of
Berkes County prior to 1733, the birth year of Joshua Stephens, Jr.,
(6), is a fact well corroborated by the (Stot.) history of Pennsylvania.




EXPLANATION


The principal abbreviations used in these pages are:

   b. standing for born.
   m. standing for married.
   d. standing for died.
   y. standing for young.

For convenience and distinction, as in all genealogical works, each name
is given a number separately. Without this it would be difficult to tell
which Joshua Stephens is meant, for there are many of that name, as also
others. The numbers are also valuable for tracing out any particular
pedigree; for instance, suppose that William Stephens, of Camp Verde,
should desire to know the full line of his paternal ancestry, he would
find his name on page (41) 56, where his number is given as 275: then
looking up the left-hand column of figures he will find No. 275 on page
(21) 27, where he will find the date of his birth, and that his father
is Samuel Stephens, No. 76; thence, running up the column to No. 76,
which he will find on page (11) 12, he will find that Samuel was the son
of Charles Stephens, No. 19; the latter figure is found on page (8) 8,
where Charles is shown to be the son of David Stephens, No. 10; the last
figure is to be found on page (7) 7, showing that David was the son of
Joshua Stephens, No. 6; he is the son of Joshua Stephens, No. 3. His
pedigree is:

   Joshua Stephens, (3), father of
   Joshua Stephens, (6), father of
   David Stephens, (10), father of
   Charles Stephens, (19), father of
   Samuel Stephens, (76), father of
   Williams Stephens, (275), father of

The name STEPHENS is of Greek derivation, and means a "crown". Just how
it came to be adopted by the ancester of this family is unknown. The
Welsh seldom used surnames at that period, one name usually sufficing;
the son taking his father's name with the Welsh suffix "AP," meaning
"son of"; thus STEPHENS AP EVANS, meaning Stephens the son of Evans,
while the latter would be Evans Ap somebody else. W. H. Stephens, (41),
son of the aforesaid E. D. Stephens, (16), once told the writer that the
old family name was STEPHENSHIP. In a conversation between the writer,
(182), and Rev. M. A. Jordan, a stepson of Col. John Stephens, (15), a
brother of E. D. Stephens, (16), Mr. Jordan said that, according to his
information, the original family name was STEPHENS O'BIVENS. Mr. Gilbert
Cope, an eminent genealogist, living at West Chester, Pennsylvania,
clears these discrepancies by stating that the name was STEPHENS AP
EVANS; that is, Stephens the son of Evans. It is thus easy to see how
easily one confused it into Stephenship, and the other into Stephens
O'Bivens. Accordingly, it must be true that Joshua Stephens, Senior,
(3), and perhaps his brothers, David, (5), and Ebenezer, (4), adopted
the permanent surname of Stephens. In fact, a family tradition is that
the emigrant ancester did adopt this name of Stephens. The father of
Joshua Stephens, Sr., (3), who, it is supposed, remained in Wales, may
have been named Stephens, (2), and his father's name may have been
Evans, (1); indeed, this theory is reasonable both from tradition and
the etymology as given in the foregoing. EVANS is a Welsh form of JOHN,
a Greek word of Hebrew derivation, meaning "the grace of God."

This tradition is further strengthened by another: that the immigrant
ancestors of the family, sometime after their arrival in Pennsylvania,
fell heir to their father's estate in Wales. In court they were required
to give additional evidence as to their identity by reason of their
having changed their names, before their shares of the estate were
distributed to them. Through these official channels should be found the
missing links, which will connect the American Lines with the Welsh, and
extend the genealogical tree across the Atlantic Ocean. By these means
only can the family seat, ancestry, arms and name be discovered, for the
item of the estate witnesses the fact that it was of no "common origin."

The indifference of the Welsh in the use of surnames is well shown by
the transcript of some documents of an estate of an old Stephens in
Pennsylvania, in the possession of the writer, wherein two brothers are
named, one "Evans Stephens" and the other "Stephens Evans."

Searches in the offices of the Register of Wills, and the old Probate
Courts of Pennsylvania, and the Doctors' Commons and the Herold's
College, of London, as well as of the files of old Pennsylvania
newspapers, and the archives of the various historical societies of
Pennsylvania should throw more light on the early history of these
immigrant ancesters, and possibly discover collateral branches which are
now seemingly hopelessly lost. Such searches require the expenditure of
more time and money than the writer now (1892) has, and if never done by
him, it is to be hoped that some family historian will come to the front
with the necessary abilities.

The family history, then, really begins thus:




FIRST GENERATION


1. EVANS AP ----, (1), a member of that ancient race, the Welsh, the
lineal descendants of that most ancient race, the Kelts, who inhabited
western Europe from time immemorial, lived in Wales, the territory
reserved for this branch of the Aryan family. He had a son:




SECOND GENERATION


2. STEPHENS AP EVANS, (2), who lived and died in Wales, and was the
owner of considerable estate. The liberal terms of Penn's grant in
America attracted the attention of his three sons:




THIRD GENERATION


     3. JOSHUA AP STEPHENS AP EVANS, (3), the immigrant ancestor of this
        family.

     4. EBENEZER AP STEPHENS AP EVANS, (4).

     5. DAVID AP STEPHENS AP EVANS, (5).

Who left their native home in Wales, and embarking in a sailing vessel,
after a voyage of something like thirty days, landed at Philadelphia;
this sometime prior to the year 1733. The three brothers selected lands
in what is now Berkes County, which was not set off from Philadelphia
County until 1752. There are traces of them in Union Township, where a
David Stephens held land in 1728; he was probably (5), (This from a
letter I have from the secretary of the Pennsylvania Historical
Society). In 1752, a "David Stephens, Jr.," died in Britain Township,
Bucks County, not far from Union, who had a brother Samuel, and a
"Cousin John," (probably 7), which fits our history. (From documents in
my posession from Register of Wills, Philadelphia). His father, David
Stephens, Sr., was probably (5). Nothing would be more natural than that
David Stephens, (5), should have a son named for him, and that that son
should seek lands over in Bucks, and that the family name of John should
descend, as it has through many generations in our own lines, to his.
David's brother Joshua had a son John, (7). It was while the three
brothers, Joshua, Ebenezer and David, were living under the jurisdiction
of Philadelphia County, that they received their shares of the Welsh
estate. Hence, searches for this should be confined to records prior to
1752, the time Berkes was set off from Philadelphia.




FOURTH GENERATION


JOSHUA STEPHENS, Sr., (3), the name now being changed, lived in what is
now Berkes County, and probably in Union Township, near the David
Stephens above mentioned. His children were:

     6. JOSHUA, born in 1733, the immediate ancester of the family, and
        with whom the certain history of the family begins.

     7. JOHN     }
                 }
     8. STEPHENS } Of these two brothers nothing is further known than
        that from a family tradition they "went South", whatever that
        means: "South" being an indefinite term from a standpoint in
        Berkes County. John was a tory during the Revolution. The
        existence of Stephens depends upon the testimony of Joshua
        Bowen Stephens of Hardin, Ohio, in a conversation with me there
        in 1886. To these three brothers Dr. John Wesley Stephens of
        State Line, Indiana, added a sister, in a letter to me, (182):

     9. HETTY "who married a rich man named Humphrey, had liveried
        servants," etc. If so, they probably lived in Philadelphia.

JOSHUA STEPHENS, Jr., (6), was the founder of that particular line of
the family of which we have any definite knowledge. His father was
Joshua Stephens, (3), the immigrant ancestor, who settled in what is now
Berkes County, Pennsylvania.

Berkes was then a "howling wilderness" full of Indians and wild beasts.
It was here in 1733, that Joshua Stephens, Jr., was born. Neighbors were
like Angel's visits, "few and far between". In Amity Township on the
east lived Mordecai Lincoln, in A. D. 1725, the ancestor of the
illustrious President. In Exeter Township to the north-east lived George
Boone, in A. D. 1717, the ancestor of Daniel Boone, the celebrated
pioneer of Kentucky. Our family tradition is that the Stephens and the
Boones were intermarried, and it is known that the Boones and Lincolns
formed such alliances. (See Century Magazine for November, 1886). Joshua
became an expert in the use of the rifle. His early life was spent on
his father's farm and in hunting, in which he became very proficient and
for which he acquired considerable notoriety. Schools were scarce in
those days and his literary education was probably poor. No writings of
his are known to be in existence to-day. To his out-door life must be
attributed the cause of his longevity, extending to a period of ninety
years. He did not marry until he was 38 years of age. In 1771 he married
Priscilla Humphreys. The fact that she was a member of the Seventh-day
Baptist Church, who were then quite numerous in Chester County to the
South of Berkes, and that his son E. D. Stephens was born in Chester,
suggests that at an early date in his life Joshua left Berkes and
settled in Chester, which he did at any rate, and lived not far from
Valley Forge. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War he identified
himself with the patriot cause, and, according to the statement of his
son, E. D. Stephens, was commissioned Captain of a Company of
sharpshooters. During the famine of the American army in the winter of
1777-8 at Valley Forge, he hauled corn to relieve their distress. On one
occasion he obtained a furlough to return home during harvest. With a
Quaker and his brother John he was in the orchard gathering apples. The
Quaker was up in the apple tree, picking fruit, and improved the
opportunity to expostulate with Joshua over the wickedness of war, and
arguing that Joshua should stay at home like his brother John, the tory.
In the midst of his argument the Quaker fell out of the tree, and
striking the ground violently, broke his neck, and was picked up dead.
This was regarded as an act of Divine Judgment in favor of the war, and
probably went far toward encouraging the despairing hearts of the
patriots about them.

A few years after the war he moved with his family to a place "near the
Warm Springs, Virginia," said E. D. Stephens. Whether this was the Warm
Springs in Bath County, is hard to determine. "And then in a few years"
said the same person, "to near LEXINGTON, (Carlisle) Kentucky." These
residences are indefinitely located. "The Warm Springs" may have been in
what is now KENAWHA County, West Virginia for there are such there, and
according to Mr. Jordan, above quoted, they lived "near a river, in the
vicinity of the residence of Daniel Boone," who lived in KENAWHA. (See
Hale's "Trans-Allegheny Pioneers"). It was while here, said Jordan, that
Boone was a frequent visitor to the place of Joshua, whom he invariably
greeted as "Cousin." Just what the relationship was is unknown, but it
undoubtedly existed. One evening Boone came to the Stephens' place,
weary, and said "Twenty-one less." They understood from this laconic
remark, that he referred to the number of Indians he had killed that
day.

Joshua was accompanied or followed to "near Lexington" by two of his
brothers-in-law, Joshua and Jonathan Humphreys. Here two of his sons
left to find homes for themselves--David Humphreys, (10), who settled in
Evansville, Indiana, and Silas, (14), who settled in Nashville, Tenn.
Katie, (12), a daughter died in Kentucky at a tender age.

It was while in Kentucky that he knocked a Dutchman down for insulting
his daughter Hannah, and dislocated his (Stephen's) thumb.

It must have been about 1798 when he decided to remove to near
Chillicothe, Ohio, for that year his son, E. D. Stephens was fourteen
years old, and was apprenticed to a tanner, which naturally was on his
mother's death. This occured while they were on the Pickaway Plains, in
Ohio. As they were travelling, the women of the party took off their
shoes to walk on the cool grass on account of the heat. His wife was
bitten by a copper-head snake, and shortly died, her body turning to the
color of the snake.

JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), was over six feet high, kept his face shaven
smoothly, had blue eyes and dark hair, and was powerful physically, and
kept a straight figure of his body until his death.--Statement of Joshua
Stephens, (32).

JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), a Revolutionary soldier and ancestor of the
Stephens family, was born in Union Township, Berkes County, Penn., in
1733. John Stephens, (15), his son, father of Nancy Stephens Mitchell,
was born in Chester County, Penn., Dec. 23, 1781. Union Township is
separated from Amity and from Exeter Township by the Schuylkill River.
In Exeter Township lived George Boone, A. D. 1717, ancestor of Daniel
Boone, who intermarried with the Stephens. And in Amity Township lived
Mordecai Lincoln, A. D. 1725, and probably also the Stephens. At an
early date in his life, Joshua Stephens left Berkes County and settled
in Chester County, not far from Valley Forge. His early life was spent
on his father's farm in hunting. He was an expert rifleman, and his
proficiency acquired for him considerable notoriety. In 1771, when he
was thirty-eight years of age, he married Priscilla Humphreys, who was a
Seventh-day Baptist. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War Joshua
Stephens, (6), identified himself with the patriot cause, and was
commissioned by General Washington as Captain of a Company of
Sharpshooters. During the famine of the American Army in the winter of
1777-8 at Valley Forge, he hauled corn from his farm to relieve their
distress. On one occasion he was granted a furlough to return home
during harvest.

A few years after the war he moved with his family to a place near Warm
Springs, Virginia. After another few years to Lexington, Kentucky. While
there, Daniel Boone was a frequent visitor and greeted him as "Cousin".
About 1798, he decided to remove to near Chillicothe, Ohio, lived in
either Ross County or Franklin County until about 1816, when he followed
his two sons, John, (15), and E. D., (16), to Shelby County, where he
lived with them on their farm near Hardin. His grand-children remember
his old Revolutionary Army great coat and his stories of Revolutionary
times. His love for the chase never forsook him. He attributes his
longevity to his outdoor life. He was over six feet in height, kept his
face smoothly shaved, had blue eyes and dark hair; was powerful
physically and kept an erect figure till his death. He lived to be
ninety years of age. He died in March, in 1823, on the farm of his son
John, (15), near Hardin and was buried in the old Hardin graveyard.

until 1816, when he followed his two sons, John, (15), and E. D., (16),
to Shelby County, where he lived with them on their farms near Hardin.
His grand-children remember how the old gentlemen used to sit around the
fire-place while they teased him by slyly pouring corn into the huge
pockets of his old Revolutionary Army coat. Although over eighty years
of age, the love of the chase never died, and he often took his old
rifle and spectacles and sat by the old salt lick and waited for the
deer which never came. (So said Richard Cannon, of Hardin, to me in
1886, who knew him well, and also spoke of his Revolutionary services).
He died in March, 1823, on the farm of his son John, (15), near Hardin,
and was buried in the old Hardin graveyard. The grave was identified to
me in 1886, and marked by me then with a wooden head board. His children
were:




FIFTH GENERATION


     10. DAVID HUMPHREYS, born in Penn., m. Eliza Wing, A. D. 1843.

     11. SARAH, m. Chas. Vandever, d. 1846.

     12. CATHERINE, died young in Kentucky.

     13. HANNAH, b. May 2. 1776; m. Thomas McClish: d. Mar. 13, 1840.

     14. SILAS

     15. JOHN, b. Dec. 23, 1781; m. 2ts; d. Sept. 12, 1873.

     16. EBENEZER DAVID, b. May 7, 1784; m. S. Groom; d. Sept. 20, 1868.

     17. PRISCILLA, b. Nov. 30, 1786; m. 2ts; d. April 24, 1849.

DAVID HUMPHREYS STEPHENS, (10), a son of Joshua Stephens, (6), was born
in Pennsylvania; accompanied his parents to Lexington, Kentucky; settled
in Evansville, Indiana, of which city he was a pioneer; married Eliza
Wing, a native of North Carolina, by whom he had five children; she
dying, he married a second time (name of his wife not given); he had no
children by her; he was born about 1772, and died about 1843. Search
into early history of Evansville should throw considerable light on his
history, as he must have been quite a prominent citizen, one of his
sons, (20), marrying the only daughter of General Evans, the founder of
the city. He lived with Charles, (19), till his death. Was a Justice of
the Peace. His children were:




SIXTH GENERATION.


     18. JOSHUA, m. Nancy Gibson.

     19. CHARLES, m. Malinda Carr, of Kentucky.

     20. SILAS, b. Feb. 24, 1801; m. Julienne Evans; d. Mar. 28, 1876.

     21. ELIZA, m. ---- Vance; d. April 11, 1876 sine prole.

     22. THOMAS DAVID, d. unm.; was in U. S. Army.

SARAH STEPHENS, (11), daughter of Joshua Stephens, (6), married Charles
Vandever, of the Vandever family of New Jersey, then living (about
1802), in Chillicothe, Ohio. They moved with the others of the Stephens
family to Shelby County about 1816, where she died about 1846, and was
buried in the old Hardin graveyard. Subject of a poem by B. A. C.
Stephens (182); she had four children:

     23. MARY, m. John Wilson.

     24. CATHERINE, b. Mar. 21, 1804; m. Josiah Gaskill; d. Nov. 3,
         1845.

     25. RACHEL, b. May 9, 1809; m. John Garnahan; d. Dec. 3, 1850.

     26. JOSHUA, b. Sept. 9, 1812; m. Susanna Burton; d. ----.

HANNAH STEPHENS, (13), daughter of Joshua Stephens, (6), is described as
having been a very "beautiful woman" and was widely courted on that
account, her father having been compelled to chastise a Dutchman, who
became too familiar. She was born in Penn., May 2, 1776; accompanied her
parents to Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. She married Thomas McClish in
Ross County about 1803. About 1816, or perhaps a little earlier, they
moved to Shelby County, where he founded the town of Hardin, Oct. 5,
1816, naming it for the famous Kentucky general, (General Hardin was
killed near there) which was the first County Seat. He dedicated a
square to the county on the condition that it should be used solely for
the Court House, which it never was, and is still unused. At an early
date they moved over in Putnam County, then a dence wilderness, and
lived with no neighbors nearer than 40 miles amid Indians and wild
beasts. She died March 13, 1840. Her husband was born July 1, 1776, and
died of a nasal hemmorrage Dec. 26, 1826. They were buried near Dupont,
where their graves are yet to be seen. (I have a page of their family
record taken from their old family Bible). Their children were:

     27. SILAS, b. Oct. 15, 1804; m. Nancy Mellinger; d. June 16, 1860.

     28. ELIZA, b. Dec. 26, 1806; m. John Bush; d. Nov. 24, 1827.

     29. JOHN JACKSON, b. March 5, 1808; d. unm., Oct. 25, 1841.

     30. THOMAS, b. March 3, 1816; d. unm., April 3, 1846.

SILAS STEPHENS, (14), son of Joshua Stephens, (6), left his father's
home, "near Lexington, Kentucky," and settled near Nashville, Tenn.,
where he married and acquired considerable property in land and slaves;
these latter he freed just before the war (about 1859), and one of them
came to Shelby County, Ohio, which is the only information ever had from
Silas. He died sine prolos about 1865.

JOHN STEPHENS, (15), son of Joshua Stephens, (6), was born Dec. 23,
1781, in Penn., accompanied his parents to Ross County, Ohio; voted for
the adoption of the first constitution of that state November 29, 1802,
being just about of age; enlisted in the U. S. Army for the war of 1812;
was present at the surrender of General Hull, Sunday, August 16, 1812;
and witnessed the victory of Commodore Perry, September 10, 1813, from
the shores of Lake Erie. Rev. M. A. Jordon, his step-son said that John
entered the Army as an ensign, and rose to the rank of Colonel, and
after the war was high sheriff of Western Ohio. He was commissioned
Captain of the State Militia in 1822. (I have the original commission
issued by Governor E. A. Brown). About 1816, he moved to near St. Paris,
Champaign County, where he died on his farm September 12, 1873. He had
been a lay preacher of the Methodist Protestant Church. He was twice
married, first to Nancy Brown, (about 1810), by whom he had nine
children; he married secondly Mrs. ---- Jordan, by whom he had no
children. Nancy Brown Stephens was born Feb. 4, 1787. His children were:

     31. ELIZABETH, d. unm., aged 18 years.

     32. JOSHUA, b. Jan. 4, 1812; m. Nancy Creegan; d. Feb. 1, 1891.

     33. DAVID HUMPHREYS, b. Nov. 8, 1813; d. Aug. 23, 1846; m. S. A.
         Burton.

     34. MARIA, d. 1848; m. John Blake.

     35. RACHEL, d. young.

     36. OLIVER PERRY, b. June 20, 1820; d. Nov. 6, 1873; m. 2 times.

     37. SARAH, b. Aug. 4, 1822; m. Smith Wallace; d. June 3, 1868.

     38. CATHERINE, b. Nov. 13, 1824; m. Robert Bower, died Dec. 6,
         1905.

     39. NANCY, b. March 22, 1827; m. T. T. Mitchell, died Jan. 8, 1909.

EBENEZER DAVID STEPHENS, (16), son of Joshua Stephens, (6), was born in
Chester County, Penn., May 7, 1784; accompanied his parents to Kentucky,
where, in 1798, (probably on the death of his mother), he was
apprenticed to a tanner at "Yellow Springs, Kentucky," but disliking his
master, ran away, and followed his father to Ross County, Ohio. He is
said to have burned the brick for the first house of that kind in
Chillicothe, and refused to take a piece of land in the proposed city of
Columbus, in payment for a kiln of brick; he served six weeks in the war
of 1812; in 1816, he settled on the S. E. 1/4 of section 18 Turtle Creek
Township, Shelby County, where he farmed till his death, on September
20, 1868. He married Jan. 11, 1811, Sarah Groome, daughter of Ezekiel
Groome and Rhoda (Brittain) Groome, formerly of Trenton, N. J.; she was
born May 23, 1792, and died Jan. 13, 1871; their children were:

     40. HETTY, b. Oct. 28, 1811; m. John Lennox; d. May 30, 1860.

     41. WILLIAM HUMPHREYS, b. Feb. 25, 1813; m. 3ts.; d. Dec. 13, 1879.

     42. JOSHUA M., b. Dec. 12, 1814; m. Minerva Metcalf; d. July 5,

CONCLUSION.


The foregoing seventy-three pages include all the names and date of
birth, deaths and marriages of the descendents of Joshua Stephens, (6),
which I have to date. The subject matter is merely a skeleton of the
mass of family history data, which I have on hand, including
biographies, pictures, manuscripts, letters, papers, relics, etc. I have
put it in this shape for the reasons:

1. That it is impossible just now to publish the family history in full
as it should be.

2. Fearing possibly a destruction of the data, etc., on hand, in this
shape it can at least be preserved, as one copy will be deposited in the
archives of the "Historical Society of Southern California," at Los
Angeles, California, and one copy in the archives of the "Ohio State
Archaeological and Historical Society" at Columbus, Ohio; so that, if
fortunately any relative should have a sufficiency of that commendable
family love and pride to perpetuate the record, he will have a
foundation on which to build, by going to those archives.

I am aware that this work must contain errors. Many letters are vague;
hand-writing hard to understand; correspondents are often contradictory,
and many of their statements are known by me to be erroneous. I have
endeavored to verify each report, and have, in many instances,
successfully. I will reserve an account of my very interesting
experience in digging up family history for the to be published work.
There are undoubtedly clerical errors in this work, which I have
corrected with ink so far as detected.

THIS WORK OF GATHERING family was begun in April, 1881, and has been
continued by me unremittingly ever since, and will be so long as I live.
Due acknowledgements will be made in the to-be published work, of all
assistance.

ADDITIONAL FACTS OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE FAMILY.


A church of Seventh-Day Baptists was established on French Creek, in the
Northern part of Chester County, Colony of Pennsylvania, in the year
1722. It became extinct after 1812. The name of Stephens is on the list
of Members.--Letter of Charles H. Greene, of Alfred, N. Y., July 11,
1901.

JOSHUA HUMPHREYS was granted 400 acres near where the town of Carlisle
now stands, in Fayette County, Virginia, (near Kentucky in the year
1785) upon a Land Office Treasury Warrant issued July 1, 1780, and
survey made Feb. 26, 1873.--Letter of J. D. Hudgens, Clerk of the U. S.
Office at Frankfort, Ky.

JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), was over six feet high, kept his face shaven
smoothly, had blue eyes and dark hair, and was powerful physically, and
kept a straight figure of his body until his death.--Statement of Joshua
Stephens, (32).




NOTE


Desiring for myself a copy of the generalogy of the Stephens family I
found on investigating, that a number of printed copies could be secured
at the cost of one typewritten one, and after deciding to print I
concluded to have a number printed for distribution.

All who may receive one of these histories will appreciate the greatness
of the task accomplished by our esteemed relative, Bascom A. C. Stephens
of California, who searched out the historical facts and family
traditions. The family is fortunate to have one of its members able and
willing to devote the time and labor necessary to gather this
information.

I am under obligation to W. G. Stephens of Chattanooga from whose book
this copy is taken.

I am taking some liberties in having a number of copies printed, knowing
that many members of the family would never have an opportunity to see
and a much less chance to own one of these histories unless someone
would assume this responsibility.


   Respectfully, A. S. BOWER

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
