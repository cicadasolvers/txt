PREFACE


The art of using one's native tongue correctly and forcibly is acquired
for the most part through imitation and practice, and is not so much a
matter of knowledge as of habit. As regards English, then, the first duty
of our schools is to set before pupils excellent models, and, in all
departments of school-work, to keep a watchful eye on the innumerable acts
of expression, oral and written, which go to form habit. Since, however,
pupils come to school with many of their habits of expression already
formed on bad models, our schools must give some attention to the special
work of pointing out common errors of speech, and of leading pupils to
convert knowledge of these errors into new and correct habits of
expression. This is the branch of English teaching in which this little
book hopes to be useful.

All the "Exercises in English" with which I am acquainted consist chiefly
of "sentences to be corrected." To such exercises there are grave
objections. If, on the one hand, the fault in the given sentence is not
seen at a glance, the pupil is likely, as experience has shown, to pass it
by and to change something that is not wrong. If, on the other hand, the
fault is obvious, the exercise has no value in the formation of habit.
Take, for example, two "sentences for correction" which I select at random
from one of the most widely used books of its class: "I knew it was him,"
and "Sit the plates on the table." A pupil of any wit will at once see
that the mistakes must be in "him" and "sit," and knowing that the
alternatives are "he" and "set," he will at once correct the sentences
without knowing, perhaps, why one form is wrong, the other right. He has
not gained anything valuable; he has simply "slid" through his exercise.
Moreover, such "sentences for correction" violate a fundamental principle
of teaching English by setting before the impressionable minds of pupils
bad models. Finally, such exercises are unnatural, because the habit which
we hope to form in our pupils is not the habit of correcting mistakes, but
the habit of avoiding them.

Correct English is largely a matter of correct choice between two or more
forms of expression, and in this book an attempt has been made, as a
glance at the pages will show, to throw the exercises, whenever possible,
into a form consistent with this truth. Though a pupil may _change_ "who"
to "whom" without knowing why, he cannot repeatedly _choose_ correctly
between these forms without strengthening his own habit of correct
expression.

This book has been prepared primarily as a companion to Professor A.S.
Hill's "Foundations of Rhetoric," in answer to the request of many
teachers for exercises to use with that admirable work.[1] Without the
friendly encouragement of Professor Hill the task would not have been
undertaken, and to him above all others I am indebted for assistance in
completing it. He has permitted me to draw freely on his published works;
he has provided me with advance sheets of the revised edition of
"Principles of Rhetoric;" he has put at my disposal much useful material
gleaned from his own experience; he has read the manuscript and proofs,
and, without assuming any responsibility for shortcomings, he has
suggested many improvements. I am also indebted to Mr. E.G. Coy,
Headmaster of the Hotchkiss School, for many valuable suggestions, and to
my colleague, Mr. J.E. Barss, for assistance in the proof-reading.

The quotations from "The Century Dictionary" are made under an arrangement
with the owners of the copyright of that work. I am also indebted to
Professor Barrett Wendell, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., and Messrs.
Macmillan & Co. for permission to use brief quotations from their works.

CHAPTER I.

OF GOOD USE


Why is it that for the purposes of English composition one word is not so
good as another? To this question we shall get a general answer if we
examine the effect of certain classes of expressions.

PRESENT USE.--Let us examine first the effect produced by three
passages in the authorized version of the English Bible--a version made by
order of King James in 1611:--

"For these two years hath the famine been in the land, and yet there are
five years, in the which there shall neither be _earing_ nor harvest"
(Gen. xlv. 6).

"O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long
will ye love vanity, and seek after _leasing_?" (Psa. iv. 2).

"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed
to come unto you, but was _let_ hitherto" (Rom. i. 18).

See also Gen. xxv. 29; Matt. iii 8; Acts viii. 3; 1 Thess. iv. 15.

An ordinary reader of our time cannot without assistance fully understand
these passages, because the words "earing," "leasing," and "let" convey to
his mind either no idea at all or a wrong idea. Two hundred and eighty
years ago, when this translation of the Bible was made, these words were
common words with plain meanings; but "earing" and "leasing" have since
dropped out of common use, and "let" has acquired a different meaning;
consequently an ordinary reader of the present time must consult a
dictionary before he can be sure what the passages mean. Words and
meanings which have gone out of use are called _obsolete_. There is not
much temptation to use obsolete words; but the temptation sometimes comes.
Therefore we note, as our first conclusion, that a person who wishes to be
understood must avoid expressions and meanings which are not in _present
use_.

NATIONAL USE.--A boy from southern Pennsylvania was visiting in New
York State. In the midst of some preparations for a fishing excursion he
said to his host, "Shall I take my _gums_ along?" His host burst out
laughing and said, "Of course; did you think of taking them out of your
mouth and leaving them at home?"[2] Unconsciously the boy had used a good
English word in a sense peculiar to the district in which he lived; his
host had understood the word in its proper sense.

On another occasion a gentleman who had just arrived at a hotel in
Kennebunkport, Me., agreed to a proposal to "go down to the beach in the
_barge_." Going to his room, he prepared for a little excursion on the
river which flowed by the hotel. When he returned, he was greatly
surprised to find his friends about to start for the beach in _a large
omnibus_. Another gentleman once asked a young lady to go "_riding_" with
him. At the appointed hour he drove to her house in a buggy, and she came
down to meet him in her riding habit.

These incidents show that if we use expressions that are only local, or
use words in local senses, we are liable either to be misunderstood or not
to be understood at all. Obscurity also arises from the use of words in
senses which are peculiar to a certain class or profession. For example,
to a person who is not familiar with commercial slang, this sentence from
the market columns of a newspaper is a puzzle:--

"Java coffees are _dull_ and _easy_, though they are _statistically
strong_."

The following directions for anchoring in a gale of wind are taken from a
book called "How to Sail a Boat":--

    "When everything is ready, bring the yacht _to the wind_, and let
    the sails shake _in the wind's eye_; and, so soon as she gets
    _stern-way_, let go the _best bower_ anchor, taking care not to
    _snub her_ too quickly, but to let considerable of the cable run
    out before checking her; then take a turn or two around the
    _knight-heads_," etc.


If a landsman's safety depended on his understanding these directions,
there would not be much hope for him.

The following extract is from a newspaper report of a game of ball:--

    "In the eighth inning Anson jumped from one box into the other and
    whacked a wide one into extreme right. It was a three-base jolt
    and was made when Gastright intended to force the old man to
    first. The Brooklyns howled and claimed that Anson was out, but
    McQuaid thought differently. Both teams were crippled. Lange will
    be laid up for a week or so. One pitcher was batted out of the
    box."

This narrative may seem commonplace to school-boys, but to their mothers
and sisters it must seem alarming.

Our second conclusion, therefore, is that a person who wishes to be
understood must avoid words and phrases that are not understood, and
understood in the same sense, in every part of the country, and in every
class or profession.[3]

REPUTABLE USE.--Let us examine now the effect produced by a third
kind of expression, namely, words and phrases "not used by writers and
speakers of established reputation."[4] Let us take as our illustrations
the familiar expressions, "He _done_ it" and "Please _set_ in this seat."
Each of these expressions is common at the present time, and its meaning
is instantly clear to any one who speaks English. But these expressions,
not being used by well-informed and careful speakers, produce in the mind
of a well-informed bearer an impression of vulgarity like that which we
get from seeing a person eat with his knife. In language, as in manners
and fashions, the law is found in the custom of the best people; and
persons who wish to be classed as cultivated people must speak and write
like cultivated people. There is no moral wrong in a person's saying
"Please _set_ in this seat," and if he does say it he will probably be
understood; but persons who use this or any other expression which is not
in reputable use run the risk of being classed as ignorant, affected, or
vulgar.

GOOD USE.--It appears, therefore, that words and phrases, in order to
be proper expressions for use in English prose, (1) must be in common use
at the present time; (2) they must be used, and used in the same sense, in
every part of the country, and in every class and profession; (3) they
must be expressions used by writers and speakers of established
reputation. In other words, our expressions must be in _present,
national_, and _reputable_ use. Expressions which fulfil these three
conditions are said to be in _good use_.

The next question that presents itself to one who wishes to use English
correctly is, How am I to know what words and expressions are in good use?

CONVERSATION AND GOOD USE.--Good use cannot be determined solely by
observing the conversation of our associates; for the chances are that
they use many local expressions, some slang, and possibly some vulgarisms.
"You often hear it" is not proof that an expression is in good use.

NEWSPAPERS AND GOOD USE.--Nor can good use be learned from what we
see in newspapers. Newspapers of high rank contain from time to time,
especially in their editorial columns, some of the best modern prose, and
much literature that has become standard was first printed in periodicals;
but most of the prose in newspapers is written necessarily by contributors
who do not belong to the class of "speakers or writers whom the world
deems the best." As the newspaper in its news records the life of every
day, so in its style it too frequently records the slang of daily life and
the faults of ordinary conversation. A newspaper contains bits of English
prose from hundreds of different pens, some skilled, some unskilled; and
this jumble of styles does not determine good use.

NO ONE BOOK OR WRITER DECISIVE.--Nor is good use to be learned from
our favorite author, unsupported by other authority; not even, as we have
seen, from the English Bible, when it stands alone. No writer, even the
greatest, is free from occasional errors; but these accidental slips are
not to be considered in determining good use. Good use is decided by the
prevailing usage of the writers whose works make up permanent English
literature, not by their inadvertencies. "The fact that Shakspere uses a
word, or Sir Walter Scott, or Burke, or Washington Irving, or whoever
happens to be writing earnestly in Melbourne or Sidney, does not make it
reputable. The fact that all five of these authorities use the word in
the same sense would go very far to establish the usage. On the other
hand, the fact that any number of newspaper reporters agree in usage does
not make the usage reputable. The style of newspaper reporters is not
without merit; it is very rarely unreadable; but for all its virtue it is
rarely a well of English undefiled."[5]

"Reputable use is fixed, not by the practice of those whom A or B deems
the best speakers or writers, but by the practice of those whom the world
deems the best,--those who are in the best repute, not indeed as to
thought, but as to expression, the manner of communicating thought. The
practice of no one writer, however high he may stand in the public
estimation, is enough to settle a point; but the uniform or nearly uniform
practice of reputable speakers or writers is decisive."[6]

GOOD READING THE FOUNDATION OF GOOD SPEAKING AND WRITING.--To the
question how to become familiar with good use the first answer is, read
the best literature. Language, like manners, is learned for the most part
by imitation; and a person who is familiar with the language of reputable
writers and speakers will use good English without conscious effort, just
as a child brought up among refined people generally has good manners
without knowing it. Good reading is indispensable to good speaking or
writing. Without this, rules and dictionaries are of no avail. In reading
the biographies of eminent writers, it is interesting to note how many of
them were great readers when they were young; and teachers can testify
that the best writers among their pupils are those who have read good
literature or who have been accustomed to hear good English at home. The
student of expression should begin at once to make the acquaintance of
good literature.

THE USE OF DICTIONARIES.--To become acquainted with good literature,
however, takes a long time; and to decide, by direct reference to the
usage of the best writers, every question that arises in composition, is
not possible for beginners. In certain cases beginners must go to
dictionaries to learn what good use approves. Dictionaries do not make
good use, but by recording the facts learned by professional investigators
they answer many questions regarding it. To one who wishes to speak and
write well a good dictionary is indispensable.

"THE FOUNDATIONS OF RHETORIC."--Dictionaries, however, are not always
a sufficient guide; for, being records, they aim to give _all_ the senses
in which a word is used, and do not always tell which sense is approved by
the best usage. Large dictionaries contain many words which have gone out
of good use and other words which have not yet come into good use.
Moreover, they treat of words only, not of constructions and long
expressions. Additional help in determining good use is required by
beginners, and this help is to be found in such books as Professor A.S.
Hill's "Foundations of Rhetoric." The investigations of a specialist are
there recorded in a convenient form, with particular reference to the
needs of beginners and of those who have been under the influence of bad
models. Common errors are explained and corrected, and the fundamental
merits of good expression are set forth and illustrated.

PURPOSE OF THESE EXERCISES.--In the following exercises, which are
intended for drill on some of these elements of good expression, care has
been taken to put the questions into the forms in which they arise in
actual composition. The notes which precede the exercises are only hints;
for full discussions of the principles involved the student must consult
larger works.

SOME CONVENIENT NAMES

                              /Phrases that have gone out of use, said
                             | to be ARCHAIC or OBSOLETE.
                             |
                             | Brand-new words which have not become
                             | established in good use: as, "burglarize,"
                             | "enthuse," "electrocute."
                             |
BARBARISMS: Words and        | Phrases introduced from foreign countries
phrases not English; _i.e.,_ | (called FOREIGNISMS, ALIENISMS), or
not authorized by good       | peculiar to some district or province
English use. The name       <  (called PROVINCIALISMS). A phrase introduced
comes from a Greek           | from France is called a _Gallicism_;
word meaning "foreign,"      | from England, an _Anglicism_. A
"strange."                   | phrase peculiar to America is called an
                             | _Americanism_. Similarly we have the
                             | terms _Latinism, Hellenism, Teutonism_,
                             | etc. All these names may be applied
                             | also to certain kinds of Improprieties
                              \and Solecisms.


IMPROPRIETIES: Good           \
English words or phrases       |  Most errors in the use of English
used in wrong senses:          |  are Improprieties, which are far more
as, "I _guess_ I'll go to       > common than Barbarisms and Solecisms.

for a week at the Berkshire    |  attempted.
Inn."                         /

SOLECISMS: Constructions not English, commonly called cases of "bad
grammar" or "false syntax": as, "She invited Mrs. Roe and _I_ to go
driving with her." "Solecism" is derived from _Soli_, the name of a Greek
tribe who lived in Cilicia and spoke bad Greek.

SLANG is a general name for current, vulgar, unauthorized language. It may
take the form of barbarism, impropriety, or solecism.

A COLLOQUIALISM is an expression peculiar to familiar conversation.

A VULGARISM is an expression peculiar to vulgar or ignorant people.

   posted (informed), to watch out, right (very).
2. Give good English equivalents for the words which are not in good use.




CHAPTER II.


OF ARTICLES

A or AN.[7]--The choice between these forms is determined by
sound, not by spelling. Before a consonant sound "a" is used; before a
vowel sound "an" is used.

[7] "Foundations," pp. 32-36.


EXERCISE IV.

_Put the proper form, "a" or "an," before each of these
expressions_:--Elephant, apple, egg, union of states, uniform, uninformed
person, universal custom, umpire, Unitarian church, anthem, unfortunate
man, united people, American, European, Englishman, one, high hill, horse,
honorable career, hypocrite, humble spirit, honest boy, hypothesis,
history, historical sketch, heir, hundred, hereditary disease, household.

THE or A.[8]--"The" is a broken-down form of the old English
_thoet_, from which we also get "that," and is used to point out some
particular person, thing, or class: as, "_The_ headmaster of _the_ school
gave _the_ boys permission." When "the" is used before the name of a
particular class of persons or things it is called the "generic" article
(from _genus_, "a class"): as, "None but _the_ brave deserve _the_ fair";
"_The_ eagle is our national bird."

"An" ("a") is a broken-down form of the old English word _ane_, meaning
"one." It is properly used when the object is thought of as one of a
class: as, "There is _an_ eagle in the zoological garden." It cannot
properly be used before a word which is used as a class name, because a
class name includes in its meaning more than "one."

SUPERFLUOUS and OMITTED ARTICLES.[9]--The use of a superfluous
"a" or "an" before a class name, especially after the words "sort" and
"kind," is a common and obstinate error. We may say, "This is an eagle,"
meaning "one eagle." But we may not say, "_An_ eagle is our national
bird," "This is a rare kind of _an_ eagle," or, "It is not worthy of the
name of _an_ eagle"; because in these sentences "eagle" is used as the
name, not of a single bird, but of a class of birds, and includes in its
meaning all the birds which belong to the class called "eagle." The
sentences are equivalent to: "The kind of bird called 'eagle' is our
national bird;" "This is a rare species of the class of birds called
'eagle;'" "It is not worthy of the name given to the birds which belong to
the class called 'eagle.'"

[8] Ibid., pp. 33-34.


EXERCISE V.

_Tell the difference in meaning between_:--


1. The (a) house is on fire.
2. Yes, I heard (the) shouts in the street.
3. About eight o'clock (the) guests began to come.
4. Yes, I heard (the) noises in the next room.

CHAPTER III.

OF NOUNS


HOW TO FORM THE POSSESSIVE CASE.[10]--As a rule, the possessive of
nouns in the SINGULAR number is formed by adding an apostrophe and "s"
('s): as, "The _boy's_ coat." Often the pronunciation of the added "s"
makes a new syllable; and if this additional syllable makes an unpleasant
sound, the possessive is indicated by the apostrophe alone ('): as, "For
_goodness'_ sake." The putting in or the leaving out of the "s" in such
cases is chiefly a matter of taste. If the "s" is sounded, it is always
written; and whenever there is doubt, it is well to follow the regular
rule: as, "_Horace's_ odes," "_Charles's_ ball," "_Dickens's_ David
Copperfield."

In the PLURAL number, when the nominative plural ends in "s," the
possessive case is formed by adding an apostrophe alone ('). If the
nominative plural does not end in "s," an apostrophe and an "s" ('s) are
both added, as in the singular: as, "_Men's_ and _boys'_ shoes."

The possessive case of COMPOUND nouns and expressions used as compound
nouns is formed by adding the proper sign of the possessive to the end of
the compound: as, "That is my _sister-in-law's_ pony," "This is the
_Prince of Wales's_ palace."

[10] "Foundations," pp. 41-43.


EXERCISE VII.[11]

1. _Write the possessive case, singular and plural, of:_ Actor, king,
   fairy, calf, child, goose, lady, monkey, mouse, ox, woman, deer, eagle,
   princess, elephant, man, witness, prince, fox, farmer, countess, mouth,
   horse, day, year, lion, wolf, thief, Englishman.
2. _Write the possessive case of:_ James, Dickens, his sister Mary,
   Miss Austen, the Prince of Wales, Frederick the Great, Harper and
   Brothers, father-in-law, Charles, Jones, William the Conqueror,
   Henry the Eighth, man-of-war, Douglas, Eggleston and Company.

USE and MISUSE of the POSSESSIVE CASE.[12]--It is
sometimes a question whether to use the possessive form or the
preposition _of_. "As a general rule, the possessive case should
be confined to cases of possession."[13]

[11] TO THE TEACHER.--To have its full value this should be given as a
dictation exercise.
[12] "Foundations," pp. 43-44.
[13] Ibid., p. 44.


EXERCISE VIII.

_Express relation between the words in the following pairs by putting one
of them in the possessive case or by using the preposition "of," as may
seem best:--_

Charles the Second, reign; witness, testimony; horse, hoof; the President,
public reception; Partridge, restaurant; aide-de-camp, horse; General
Armistead, death; Henry the Eighth, wives; Napoleon, Berlin decree;
teacher, advice; eagle, talons; enemy, repulse;[14] book, cover; princess,
evening gowns; France, army; Napoleon, defeat; Napoleon, camp-chest; Major
AndrA(C), capture; Demosthenes, orations; gunpowder, invention; mountain,
top; summer, end; Washington, sword; Franklin, staff; torrent, force;
America, metropolis; city, streets; strike, beginning; church, spire; we
(our, us), midst; year, events; Guiteau, trial; sea, bottom; Essex, death;
Adams, administration; six months, wages; world, government.

[14] There is, properly, no "objective possessive" in English
corresponding to the "objective genitive" in other languages. It seems
best to say "The siege of Paris," rather than "Paris's siege."


EXERCISE IX.

_Distinguish between the following:--_
1. The President's reception. The reception of the President.
2. Mother's love. Love of mother.
3. A sister's care. Care of a sister.
4. A brother's picture. The picture of a brother.
5. Clive's reception in London. The reception of Clive in London.
6. Charles and Harry's toys. Charles's and Harry's toys.
7. Let me tell you a story of Doctor Brown (Brown's).


EXERCISE X.


_Correct the following, giving the reason for each correction:--_
1. A dog and a cat's head are differently shaped.
2. Whose Greek grammar do you prefer--Goodwin or Hadley?
3. It is neither the captain nor the manager's duty.
4. I consulted Webster, Stormonth, and Worcester's dictionary.
5. I like Hawthorne better than Irving's style.
6. John, Henry and William's nose resembled one another.
7. The novel is one of Scott.
8. I have no time to listen to either John or Joseph's talk.

SINGULAR and PLURAL.[15]--In modern English most nouns form the
plural by adding "s" to the singular. The following variations from this
rule are important:--

1. When the added sound of "s" makes an additional syllable, "es" is used:
   as, box, boxes; church, churches.

2. NOUNS ENDING IN "O." If the final "o" is preceded by a vowel, the
   plural is formed regularly, i.e., by adding "s": as, cameo, cameos. If
   the final "o" is preceded by a consonant, the tendency of modern usage
   is to form the plural by adding "es": as, hero, heroes; potato,
   potatoes. The following common words, however, seem still to form the
   plural by adding "s" alone:--

  canto            lasso             proviso            torso
  duodecimo        memento           quarto              tyro
  halo             octavo            solo
  junto            piano             stiletto

3. NOUNS ENDING IN "Y." If the "y" is preceded by a vowel, the plural
   is regular: as, valley, valleys.

If the "y" is preceded by a consonant, "y" is changed to "i" and "es" is
added to form the plural: as, lady, ladies; city, cities.

4. PROPER NOUNS are changed as little as possible: as, Henry, Henrys;
   Mary, Marys; Cicero, Ciceros; Nero, Neros.
5. Most COMPOUND NOUNS form the plural by adding the proper sign of the
   plural to the fundamental part of the word, i.e., to the part which
   is described by the rest of the phrase: as, ox-cart, ox-carts;
   court-martial, courts-martial; aide-de-camp, aides-de-camp.

Note the difference between the _plural_ and the _possessive_ of compound
nouns,--forms which are often confounded. See page 16.

6. Letters, figures, and other symbols are made plural by adding an
   apostrophe and "s" ('s): as, "There are more _e's_ than _a's_
   in this word"; "Dot your _i's_ and cross your _t's_."

7. Some nouns have two plurals, which differ in meaning:--


_Singular.     Plural_.

brother          brothers (by birth), brethren (of a society).
die              dies (for coining or stamping), dice (for play).
fish             fishes (separate fish), fish (collective).
index            indexes (in books), indices (in algebra).
penny            pennies (separate coins), pence (sum of money).
shot             shots (discharges), shot (balls).
staff            staves (poles), staffs (bodies of assistants).

portfolio, ally, money, solo, memento, mosquito, bamboo, ditch, chimney,
man, Norman,[17] Mussulman, city, negro, baby, calf, man-of-war, attorney,
goose-quill, canon, quail, mystery, turkey, wife, body, snipe,
knight-errant,[17] donkey, spoonful, aide-de-camp, Ottoman,
commander-in-chief, major-general, pony, reply, talisman, court-martial,
father-in-law, court-yard, man-trap, Brahman, journey, Henry, stepson,
deer, mouthful, Miss Clark,[18] Mr. Jones, Dr. Brown, Dutchman, German,
forget-me-not, poet-laureate, minister-plenipotentiary, hero, fish, trout,
Mary, George, bill-of-fare.

[16] To THE TEACHER.--To have its full value this should be given as a
dictation exercise.
[17] Consult a dictionary for this and similar nouns.
[18] Proper names preceded by a title are made plural by changing either
the name or the title, and using "the" before the expression. We may say
"the Miss Smiths" or "the Misses Smith," "the Doctors Young" or "the
Doctor Youngs."

MISUSED NOUNS.[22]--Many errors in English consist in using words in
senses which are not authorized. Sometimes the use of a word in a wrong
sense makes the speaker's meaning obscure. Sometimes it makes him seem
ridiculous, as when a person of the writer's acquaintance told a friend to
clean an oil-painting by washing it in "torpid" water. In every case the
misuse of a word leaves an unpleasant impression on the mind of a
cultivated person, and, like all bad English, should be avoided as we
avoid bad manners. In the following definitions and exercises a few
nouns[23] are selected for study. The distinctions given are not always
observed by reputable authors, but they indicate the _tendency_ of the
best modern usage.

I. A RESEMBLANCE IN SENSE MISLEADS.[24]

HOUSE, HOME.--A _house_ is a building. _Home_ means one's habitual
abode, "the abiding place of the affections." It may or may not be in a
house, and it may include the surroundings of a house.

PERSON, PARTY.--A _person_ is an individual, a _party_ is a company
of persons, or, in legal usage, a person who is concerned in a contention
or agreement.

SERIES, SUCCESSION.--A _series_ is a succession of similar things
mutually related according to some law. _Succession_ is properly used of
several things following one after the other; it denotes order of
occurrence only, and does not imply any connection.

STATEMENT, ASSERTION.--A _statement_ is a formal setting forth of
fact or opinion; an _assertion_ is simply an affirmation of fact or
opinion.

VERDICT, TESTIMONY.--A _verdict_ is a decision made by a number of
men acting as a single body. _Testimony_ is an expression of individual
knowledge or belief.

THE WHOLE, ALL.--_The whole_ is properly used of something which is
considered as one thing. When a number of persons or things are spoken of,
the proper word is _all._

[22] TO THE TEACHER.--It may not be desirable to drill pupils on all the
words whose meanings are discriminated here and in chapters V. and VI. In
that case it will be easy to select for study those words which the pupils
are most likely to misuse. The words discriminated in this book are for
the most part those which are mentioned in the "Foundations of Rhetoric,"
and they have been arranged in the same order. A few other words often
misused by my pupils have been added.
[23] For misused _verbs_ and _adjectives_ see pages 92 and 119.
[24] "Foundations," pp. 50-53.

II. A RESEMBLANCE IN SOUND MISLEADS.[25]

ACCEPTANCE, ACCEPTATION.--_Acceptance_ is the "act of accepting";
also "favorable reception": as, "The acceptance of a gift," "She sang with
marked acceptance." _Acceptation_ now means "the sense in which an
expression is generally understood or accepted."

ACCESS, ACCESSION.--_Access_ has several meanings authorized by good
use: (1) outburst; (2) admission; (3) way of entrance. _Accession_ means
(1) the coming into possession of a right; or (2) an addition.

ACTS, ACTIONS.--"_Acts_, in the sense of 'things done,' is preferable
to _actions_, since _actions_ also means 'processes of doing.'"[26]

ADVANCE, ADVANCEMENT.--_Advance_ is used in speaking of something as
moving forward; _advancement_, as being moved forward.

ALLUSION, ILLUSION, DELUSION.--An _allusion_ is an indirect
reference to something not definitely mentioned. Roughly speaking, an
_illusion_ is an error of vision; _delusion_, of judgment. "In
literary and popular use an _illusion_ is an unreal appearance presented
in any way to the bodily or the mental vision; it is often pleasing,
harmless, or even useful.... A _delusion_ is a mental error or deception,
and may have regard to things actually existing, as well as to
_illusions_. _Delusions_ are ordinarily repulsive and discreditable,
and may even be mischievous."[27]

AVOCATION, VOCATION.--"_Vocation_ means 'calling' or 'profession';
_avocation_, 'something aside from one's regular calling, a by-work.'"[28]

COMPLETION, COMPLETENESS.--_Completion_ is "the act of completing";
_completeness_ is "the state of being complete."

OBSERVATION, OBSERVANCE.--_Observation_ contains the idea of "looking at";
_observance_, of "keeping," "celebrating." "We speak of the _observation_
of a fact, of a star; of the _observance_ of a festival, of a rule."[29]

PROPOSAL, PROPOSITION.--"A _proposal_ is something proposed to be
done, which may be accepted or rejected. A _proposition_ is something
proposed for discussion, with a view to determining the truth
or wisdom of it."[30]

RELATIONSHIP, RELATION.--_Relationship_ properly means "the state of
being related by kindred or alliance": as, "A relationship existed
between the two families." _Relation_ is a word of much broader
meaning. It does not necessarily imply kinship.

SOLICITUDE, SOLICITATION.--_Solicitude_ is "anxiety"; _solicitation_ is
"the act of soliciting or earnestly asking."

STIMULATION, STIMULUS, STIMULANT.--_Stimulation_ is "the act of stimulating
or inciting to action"; _stimulus_, originally "a goad," now denotes
that which stimulates, the means by which one is incited to
action; _stimulant_ has a medical sense, being used of that which
stimulates the body or any of its organs. We speak of ambition as
a _stimulus_, of alcohol as a _stimulant_.

III. ADDITIONAL NOUNS SOMETIMES MISUSED.[31]

ABILITY, CAPACITY.--_Ability_ is the power of doing; _capacity_, the
power of containing, of understanding, of acquiring.

ADHERENCE, ADHESION.--_Adherence_ is used of moral relations,
_adhesion_, of physical connection. We speak of the _adhesion_ of glue to
wood, of a man's _adherence_ to the principles of his party.

AMOUNT, QUANTITY, NUMBER.--_Amount_ means "sum total," and is used of
numbers or quantities; _quantity_ is used of things which are measured;
_number_, of things which are counted.

ARGUMENT, PLEA.--"_Plea_ (in the legal sense) is properly used of the
pleadings or the arraignment before a trial, not of the _argument_ at a
trial. A _plea_ is always addressed to the court; an _argument_ may be
addressed either to the court or to the jury. A similar remark applies to
the verbs _plead_ and _argue_."[32]

BALANCE, REST, REMAINDER.--_Balance_, meaning "the difference between
two sides of an account," is a commercial term, and cannot properly be
used for _rest_ or _remainder. Rest_ is used of persons or things, and of
large as well as of small parts. _Remainder_ is used only of things, and
denotes a comparatively small part.

CENTRE, MIDDLE.--The _centre_ is a point, or a definite place; the
_middle_ is a line, or a space, and is less definite than _centre_.

CHARACTER, REPUTATION.--_Character_ is what a man is; _reputation_ is
the prevailing opinion of his character.

COMPLEMENT, COMPLIMENT.--A _complement_ is a "full quantity or
number" or "that which is needed to complete"; a _compliment_ is "an
expression of praise."

CONSCIENCE, CONSCIOUSNESS.--_Conscience_ is that within us which
distinguishes right from wrong. _Consciousness_ is the state of being
aware of one's existence, thoughts, and surroundings.

COUNCIL, COUNSEL.--A _council_ is "a body of persons convened for
consultation." _Counsel_ denotes "advice," or "a person, as a lawyer,
engaged to give advice."

CUSTOM, HABIT.--_Custom_ denotes the frequent repetition of the same
act, and may be used of a number of persons taken together. _Habit_ is the
effect of custom in a person. _Custom_ is voluntary; _habit_ is
involuntary, often uncontrollable, sometimes unconscious.

DECEPTION, DECEIT.--_Deception_ is "the act of deceiving"; _deceit_
is "deceitfulness," a trait of character; or a "trick," an "artifice."

EGOISTS, EGOISM, EGOTISM.--"The disciples of Descartes were
_egoists_, the _ego_ being the basis of their philosophy." _Egoism_ is the
name of their system. _Egoism_ is sometimes used also in the sense of
undue admiration of self, the outward expression of which is _egotism_.
But "_egotism_, in the sense of 'self-worship,' is preferable to _egoism_,
since _egoism_ also designates a system of philosophy."[33]

EMIGRATION, IMMIGRATION.--_Emigration_ is the moving out from a
country; _immigration_, the moving into it. Foreigners who come to live in
America are _emigrants_ from their fatherland, _immigrants_ to America.

ENORMITY, ENORMOUSNESS.--"_Enormity_ is used of deeds of unusual
horror; _enormousness_, of things of unusual size. We speak of the
_enormity_ of CA|sar Borgia's crimes, of the _enormousness_ of the
Rothschilds' wealth."[34]

ESTEEM, ESTIMATE, ESTIMATION.--_Esteem_ as a noun seems to be going
out of use; the word now commonly used in the sense of "opinion" or
"regard" is _estimation_. An _estimate_ is "an approximate judgment, based
on considerations of probability, of the number, amount, magnitude, or
position of anything."

FALSITY, FALSENESS.--"_Falsity_, in the sense of 'non-conformity to
truth,' without any suggestion of blame, is preferable to _falseness_,
since _falseness_ usually implies blame."[35]

IDENTITY, IDENTIFICATION.--_Identity_ is "the state of being the
same." _Identification_ denotes "the act of determining what a given
thing, or who a given person, is."

IMPORT, IMPORTANCE.--_Import_, in the sense of "meaning," must be
distinguished from _importance_, "the quality of being important."

INVENTION, DISCOVERY.--We _invent_ something new, contrived or
produced for the first time. We _discover_ what existed before, but
remained unknown.

LIMIT, LIMITATION.--_Limit_, in the sense of "bound," is preferable
to _limitation_, since _limitation_ also means "the act of limiting," or a
"restriction."

LOT, NUMBER.--_Lot_ denotes "a distinct part or parcel": as, "The
auctioneer sold the goods in ten _lots_." The word does not mean "a great
number"; therefore it is improperly used in the sentences: "He has _lots_
of money," and "I know a _lot_ of people in New York."

MAJORITY, PLURALITY.--A _majority_ is more than half the whole
number; a _plurality_ is the excess of votes given for one candidate over
those given for another, and is not necessarily a _majority_ when there
are more than two candidates.

NEGLIGENCE, NEGLECT.--"_Negligence_ is used of a habit or trait;
_neglect_, of an act or succession of acts."[36]

NOVICE, NOVITIATE.--_Novice_ properly means one who is new in any
business or calling; _novitiate_, the state or time of being a _novice_.

ORGANISM, ORGANIZATION.--An _organism_ is a "living body composed of
a number of essential parts." _Organization_ denotes "the act of
organizing," or "an organized body of persons," as a literary society.

PART, PORTION.--"_Part_ is the general word for that which is less
than the whole: as, the whole is equal to the sum of all its _parts_....
_Portion_ is often used in a stilted way where _part_ would be simpler and
better; _portion_ has always some suggestion of allotment or assignment:
as, this is my _portion_; a _portion_ of Scripture. 'Father, give me the
_portion_ of goods that falleth to me.'"[37]

PLENTY, ABUNDANCE.--_Plenty_ is enough; _abundance_, more than enough.

PRODUCE, PRODUCT, PRODUCTION.--_Produce_ is always collective, and is
used only of raw products: as, the _produce_ of the soil, of the flock.
_Product_ denotes the result of some operation, usually physical labor.
_Production_, meaning "the act of producing," is also applied to a
work of literature or art, as a book, a statue, or a painting. "_Product_,
in the sense of 'thing produced,' is preferable to _production_, since
_production_ is also used in an abstract sense."[38]

PROMINENCE, PREDOMINANCE.--_Prominence_ means "a standing out
from something, so as to be conspicuous." _Predominance_ denotes
"ascendency," "a superiority in strength or influence," "an over-ruling."
There may be many _prominent_ traits in a person's character;
there can be only one _predominant_ trait.

RECEIPT, RECIPE.--"_Receipt_, in the sense of 'formula for a pudding,
etc.,' is preferable to _recipe_, since _recipe_ is commonly restricted to
medical prescriptions."[38]

RELATIVE, RELATION.--"_Relative_, in the sense of 'member of a family,' is
preferable to _relation_, since _relation_ is also used in an abstract
sense."[38]

REQUIREMENT, REQUISITE, REQUISITION.--A _requirement_ is something
required by a person or persons. A _requisite_ is something required
by the nature of the case. A _requisition_ is an authoritative demand
or official request for a supply of something.

RESORT, RECOURSE, RESOURCE.--_Resort_ denotes "the act of going to
some person or thing"; or "that which is resorted to or habitually
visited." _Recourse_ means "resort for help or protection." _Resource_
denotes "something which is a source of help or support."

SECRETING, SECRETION.--_Secreting_ is the act of hiding; _secretion_, a
physiological process or fluid.

SEWAGE, SEWERAGE.--_Sewage_ means the contents, _sewerage_, the
system, of sewers.

SITUATION, SITE.--"_Situation_ embraces all the local aspects and
relationships[39] in which a thing is placed. The _site_ is confined to the
ground on which it is erected or reposes."[40]

SPECIALITY, SPECIALTY.--"_Speciality_, in the sense of 'distinctive
quality,' is preferable to _specialty_, since _specialty_ is also used in
the sense of 'distinctive thing.'"[41]

UNION, UNITY.--_Union_ is "the joining of two or more things into
one." _Unity_ means "oneness," "harmony."

VISITANT, VISITOR.--_Visitant_ was formerly used to denote a supernatural
being; _visitor_, a human one. _Visitant_ seems now to be going
out of use, _visitor_ being used in both senses.

[45] TO THE TEACHER.--It is easy to underestimate the difficulty which
this exercise presents to pupils. In assigning the lesson care must be
taken not to call for more of this kind of work than can be done well.
Constructing a sentence to illustrate the correct use of a word is a
valuable exercise, but it is a difficult one; and persons who know the
correct use of a word may be put to their wit's end to illustrate that
use. It will be well to assign this exercise little by little, while the
class works through the definitions and exercises on pages 23-41; or else
to select from the list the words on which the class needs most drill.
With some pupils it may be wise to omit the exercise entirely.




CHAPTER IV

OF PRONOUNS


POSSESSIVE FORMS.[46]--No apostrophe is used in forming the possessive
case of personal pronouns. We write "ours," "yours," "hers," "its,"
"theirs." "It's" is a contraction for "it is."

[46] "Foundations," p. 60.


EXERCISE XXVI.

_Write from dictation_--
1. John's hat is old, yours is new.
2. The bear was lying on its side, dead.
3. The Browns' house is larger than ours, but ours is more convenient than
   theirs.
4. Yours very respectfully, John Smith.
5. See the yacht! it's coining into the harbor under full sail.
6. Show Mary your doll; it should not grieve you that yours is not so
   pretty as hers.
7. That fault was not yours.
8. Helen's eyes followed the direction of hers.

NOMINATIVE OR OBJECTIVE CASE.[47]--There are only seven words in the
English language that now have different forms for the nominative and
objective cases; therefore it is only in the use of these words that we
need to observe any rules about "nominative" or "objective." Since,
however, these seven words are more frequently used than any other words,
the possibilities of error in choosing between the nominative and the
objective are many. Mistakes of this kind are common, and produce a very
unpleasant effect on cultivated people. The seven words that have
different forms for the nominative and objective cases are the following
pronouns[48]:--

_Nominative. Objective._
     I           me
     we          us
     thou        thee
     he          him
     she         her
     they        them
     who         whom

It is taken for granted that the student has already learned the following
principles of syntax:--

1. _Words used absolutely_ and the _subjects of finite verbs_ should in
   English be put in the NOMINATIVE form.
2. The _subjects of infinitives_ and the _objects_ of verbs and
   prepositions should be in the OBJECTIVE form.
3. Words in _apposition_ should be in the same case.
4. The verb "_to be,"_ or any of its forms _(am, is, are, were,_ etc.),
   does not take an object, but, being equivalent in meaning to the symbol
   "=," takes the same case after it as before it: the nominative,
   if the form is "finite"; the objective, if the form is "infinitive" and
   has a subject of its own. "I know it is _he_," "I know it to be _him,"_
   and "The stranger is thought to be _he_" are grammatically correct.

Sentences like "She invited Mrs. R. and _I_ to go driving" are common,
even among people generally well-informed. Such mistakes will be avoided
if the speaker stops to think what the form would be if the pronoun were
not coupled with a noun. No one would think of saying, "She invited _I_ to
go driving."

Persons who are in doubt as to which form of the pronoun to use often try
to avoid the difficulty by using one of the pronouns ending in
"-self"--pronouns which have the same form for both the nominative and the
objective case. Thus many persons, uncertain whether to use "I" or "me" in
the sentence quoted above, would say instead, "She invited Mrs. R. and
_myself_ to go driving." This is no better than "Mrs. R. and _I_," or
"her and _I_." The pronouns in "-self" are properly used only for emphasis
or in a reflexive sense.[49] It is right to say: "I will go _myself_";
"Carrie _herself_ went to the door"; "God helps those who help
_themselves_." It would be wrong to say, "Harry and _myself_ have bought a
horse together."

When a pronoun in "-self" is used reflexively, it refers to the subject of
the clause in which it stands.

In sentences like "This advice is free to _whoever_ will take it," the
word ending in "-ever" is the subject of the verb "will take," not the
object of the preposition "to." The right form, therefore, is "whoever,"
not "whomever." The object or, better, the "base" of the preposition "to"
is the whole clause, "whoever will take it."

[48] I omit _ye, you,_ because they are used interchangeably. I omit also
compounds of _who, whom._

PRONOUNS BEFORE VERBAL NOUNS.[52]--Grammarians distinguish three kinds
of words formed from verbs by the adding of "-ing."

1. "We found Katharine _singing_ a merry song." In this sentence
   "singing"--equivalent to "who was singing"--describes Katharine, and is
   therefore used as an adjective; but it also partakes of the nature of a
   verb, for it has a direct object, "song." Such words, partaking of the
   nature of both adjective and verb, are called PARTICIPLES.
2. "Blithely _singing_ pretty songs keeps one's spirits up."

Here "singing" is a noun, the subject of the sentence; yet it has a direct
object, "songs," and is modified by the adverb "blithely." Such words,
partaking of the nature of both noun and verb, are called GERUNDS.

A noun or a pronoun used before a gerund to denote the subject of the
action should be put in the possessive case. The reason for this becomes
evident if, in the sentence "Do you remember _Katharine (Katharine's)
singing?"_ we substitute for the noun "singing" another noun, "song;"
thus, "Do you remember _Katharine (Katharine's) song?"_ The direct object
of "remember" is "singing," which is described by the possessive
"Katharine's."

3. "Katharine's blithe _singing_ of merry songs helps to make home happy."
Here, too, "singing" is a noun; but now its verbal character has
disappeared, for it is modified by an adjective "blithe," and instead of a
direct object we have the prepositional phrase "of merry songs." Such
words derived from verbs are ABSTRACT VERBAL NOUNS.

When a word in "-ing" is modified by "the" or some other adjective, it is
an abstract verbal noun, and cannot have an object. Conversely, if it, is
followed by "of" and a noun instead of by a direct object, it should be
modified by "the" or some other adjective.

[51] In the first of these sentences the pronoun to be supplied is the
subject of "is honest," and "I know" is parenthetical. In the second
sentence, the pronoun to be supplied is the subject of "to be honest,"
which is the complement of "I know."

CHOICE OF RELATIVE PRONOUNS.[53]--_Who_ is now used only of persons;
_which_, of things; _that_, of either persons or things. As a rule,
euphony decides between _who_ or _which_ and _that_.

"_Who_ is used chiefly of persons (though also often of the higher
animals), _which_ almost only of animals and things (in old English also
of persons), and _that_ indifferently of either, except after a
preposition, where only _who_ [_whom_] or _which_ can stand. Some recent
authorities teach that only _that_ should be used when the relative clause
is limiting or defining: as, the man _that_ runs fastest wins the race;
but _who_ or _which_ when it is descriptive or co-ordinating: as, this
man, _who_ ran fastest, won the race; but, though present usage is perhaps
tending in the direction of such a distinction, it neither has been nor is
a rule of English speech, nor is it likely to become one, especially on
account of the impossibility of setting _that_ after a preposition; for to
turn all relative clauses into the form 'the house _that_ Jack lived _in_'
(instead of 'the house _in which_ Jack lived') would be intolerable. In
good punctuation the defining relative is distinguished (as in the
examples above) by never taking a comma before it, whether it be _who_ or
_which_ or _that_. Wherever _that_ could be properly used, but only there,
the relative may be, and very often is, omitted altogether; thus, the
house Jack built or lived in; the man he built it for."[54]

When the antecedent includes both persons and things,
_that_ is preferable to _who_ or _which_.

"When the antecedent is a neuter noun not personified, a writer should
prefer _of which_ to _whose_, unless euphony requires the latter."[55]

_What_, as a relative pronoun, is equivalent to "that which." It is never
used with an antecedent, since the antecedent is included in the meaning
of the word.

The word _as_ is a relative pronoun only after "such" or "same." After
"such" the proper relative is "as"; after "same" it is "as" or "that."
"_Same as_ usually expresses identity of kind, _same that_ absolute
identity, except in contracted sentences where _same as_ is alone found:
cf. 'he uses the same books _as_ you do,' 'he uses the same books _that_
you do,' he uses the same books as you.'"[56]

37. We saw the men and arms ---- were captured.

EITHER or ANY ONE, NEITHER or NO ONE.[58]--_Either_ means
"one of the two"; _neither_, "no one of the two." When more than two
persons or things are spoken of, "any one" is preferable to "either," and
"no one" to "neither."

   us.
7. ---- of them did his (their) duty.

CHANGE OF PRONOUN.[60]--In referring to the same person or thing a
writer should not change from one pronoun to another.

The possessive of "one" is "one's" (not "his"), except in such
expressions as "every one," "no one," "many a one." The reflexive is
"one's self."

It is a common but serious fault to begin to write in the third person,
and then to change to the first or second.

SINGULAR or PLURAL PRONOUNS.[62]--The rule that a pronoun should
be in the same number as its antecedent is violated most commonly in
connection with such expressions as "any one," "each," "either," "every,"
"man after man," "neither," "nobody." Grammatically such expressions are
singular.

"He" ("his," "him") may stand for mankind in general and include women as
well as men.

[61] Quoted in "Foundations," p. 74.

OMITTED PRONOUNS.[63]--The omission of necessary pronouns--an
omission especially common in business letters--cannot be justified on
the ground of brevity.

[63] "Foundations," pp. 77, 78.


EXERCISE XXXVII.

5. She didn't trouble to make any excuse to her husband.

REDUNDANT PRONOUNS.--A vulgarism not often seen in writing, but
common in conversation, consists in the use of an unnecessary pronoun
after the subject of a sentence. Thus,

  _Teacher_: Who was Benjamin Franklin?
  _Pupil_: Benjamin Franklin, _he_ was a great American philosopher and
  statesman.




CHAPTER V.

OF VERBS

CORRECT and INCORRECT FORMS.[64]--It is not enough to learn by
heart the "principal parts" of a verb; the habit of using them correctly
should be acquired. The following verb-forms are often misused:--

_Present.                  Past Indicative.  Past Participle._

awake (intransitive)         awoke             awaked

go                           went              gone
hang                         hung, hanged[67]   hung, hanged[67]
lay ("to cause to lie")      laid              laid

set  ("to put"; of the sun,  set               set
     moon, etc., "to sink")
sit                          sat               sat
shake                        shook             shaken

write                        wrote             written


In using the verbs _drink, ring, shrink, sing, sink, spring, swim,_ it
seems better to confine the forms in "a" to the preterite tense, and the
forms in "u" to the past participle: as, "The bell _rang_ five minutes
ago"; "Yes, the bell has _rung_."[69]

The following forms also should be distinguished:--

_Present.                    Past.           Participle._
alight  ("to get down from,"   alighted        alighted
        "to dismount")
light   ("to ignite,"          lighted[7]      lighted[70]
        "to shed light on")
light   ("to settle down as   lighted or lit  lighted or lit
        a bird from flight," or
        "to come upon by chance")

[64] "Foundations," pp.78-81, 91-93.
[65] "Broke," as a form of the past participle, is still found in verse.
[66] "Gotten" is an old form not sanctioned by the best modern usage.
[67] "Clothes are 'hung' on the line; men are 'hanged' on the
gallows."--"Foundations," p. 79.
[68] "'Proven' is borrowed from the Scotch legal dialect."--"Foundations,"
p.92
[69] Ibid., p. 91.
[70] "'Lighted' seems preferable to 'lit'; but 'lit' is used by some
writers of reputation."--Ibid., p. 92.

NOTE.--If the teacher thinks that the class needs more drill of this kind,
Exercises XXXVIII. and XXXIX. may be reversed, that is, the verbs in
XXXVIII. may be changed to perfect or passive forms; the verbs in XXXIX.
to the past tense. If this is done, some of the sentences will have to be
slightly recast. In the next exercise drill on the same forms is continued
in a different way.

EXERCISE XLI.

_Illustrate by original sentences the proper use of the past indicative
and the past participle of each of the following verbs, thus: A swallow
FLEW into my room, but before I recovered from my surprise it had FLOWN
out again. Give to the sentences variety:_--

Awake, beat, begin, beseech, blow, bid (to order), bid (to offer), break,
burst, choose, come, dive, do, drive, eat, flee, fly, flow, forget,
freeze, get, go, hang, lay, lie (to recline), plead, prove, ride, rise,
run, see, set, sit, shake, shoe, show, speak, slay, steal, take, throw,
wake, write.

CONTRACTIONS.[71]--Some writers hold that in careful writing
contracted forms should be avoided; but all are agreed that in
conversation some contractions, if correctly used, are natural and proper.
The conversation of a person who never said "can't" for "can not," "don't"
for "do not," or "doesn't" for "does not," would seem stiff. Care should,
however, be taken not to use plural contractions for singular, or singular
for plural. _Don't_ is a contraction of "do not," _doesn't_ of "does not."
The proper contraction of "is not" is _isn't;_ of "are not," _aren't.
Daresn't_, if used at all, should be used only when "dares not" might be
substituted. _Ain't_ is a gross vulgarism.

[71] "Foundations," pp. 81-82.


EXERCISE XLII.

_Insert the proper contraction (doesn't, don't) in each of the blank
places_:--

1. It--- seem possible.
2. The captain--- know what it is to be afraid.

4. Why--- she come?
5.--- it seem strange that they--- come?
6. Waldo--- improve in penmanship as fast as he should.
7. It--- look like pure water.
8. Why--- he answer?
9. The boy will fail, but he--- seem to care much.

MAY (MIGHT) or CAN (COULD).[72]--_Can_ and _could_, which denote
"ability" or "possibility," are often wrongly used in the place of _may_
and _might_, which are the proper words to denote "permission."

[72] Ibid., pp. 82-83.


EXERCISE XLIII.

_Fill the blanks with the right words:_--

2. You ---- go to the concert, but I doubt whether you ---- get a seat.

4. ---- I have some more lemonade?
5. ---- I have another piece of cake?
6. ---- you tell me which is Mr. Ames's house?
7. Mother says I--invite the girls to tea.
8. A man who knows himself to be right ---- afford to await the judgment of
   posterity.
9. ---- I write at your desk?

14. ---- I trouble you to get me a glass of water?

WILL OR SHALL.[73]--Some grammarians teach that the future tense of
"go" is: "I _shall_ or _will_ go," "You _shall_ or _will_ go," "He _shall_
or _will_ go," etc. The fact seems to be that there is only one form for
the future; the other form, often given as an alternative, expresses
something more than futurity, and is somewhat like a distinct mode.

A help to the proper use of _shall_ and _will_ is found in the original
meaning of the words. At first _shall_ and _will_ were notional verbs,[74]
_shall_ meaning "to owe," "to be obliged," and _will_ meaning "to wish:"
as, "That faith I _shall_ (owe) to God."[75] At present _shall_ and _will_
often retain some trace of their original meaning, _will_ implying a
reference to the will of the subject, and _shall_ implying obligation or
compulsion: as, "I _will_ follow him to the end;" "He _shall_ be brought
to justice;" sometimes they are mere auxiliaries, with no trace of their
original meaning: as, "It _will_ rain to-day;" "I _shall_ be glad."

[73] "Foundations," pp. 83-88.
[74] By "notional verb" is meant a verb that has some distinct idea or
notion of its own: as, "I _have_ a ball." Here "have" expresses the idea
of possession. In the sentence "I _have_ lost my ball," the word "have"
does not express a distinct idea; it only helps to form a tense of the
verb "lose": that is, it is not notional, but auxiliary.
[75] Chaucer.


For practical purposes the distinction between _shall_ and _will_ may be
exhibited as follows:--


I. IN INDEPENDENT SENTENCES.

_Simple Futurity.           Volition,_
                              implying that the matter is within
                               the control of the speaker.
I (we) _shall_  \           I (we) _will_       \
you _will_[76]    } go.      you _shall_          } go.
he (they) _will_/           he (they) _shall_[77]/

[76] Sometimes used in a courteous command to a subordinate officer.
[77] Also used in speaking of what is destined to take place, or of what
is willed by some ruling power.


II. IN DEPENDENT SENTENCES.

In noun clauses introduced by "that," expressed or understood, if the noun
clause and the principal clause have _different subjects,_ the distinction
between _shall_ and _will_ is the same as in independent sentences: as,

My sister says (that) Dorothy _will_ be glad to go with us. (Futurity; the
same as, "Dorothy _will_ be glad to go with us.")

My sister says (that) Dorothy _shall_ not be left behind. (Volition; the
same as, "Dorothy _shall_ not be left behind.")

In all other dependent clauses, _shall_ is in all persons the proper
auxiliary to express simple futurity; _will_ in all persons implies an
exercise of will on the part of the subject of the clause: as,

Dorothy says (that) she _shall_ (futurity) be able to go with us.
She says (that) she _will_ (volition) meet us at the corner.
If Bessie _will_ come (volition), we will try to make her visit pleasant.
When He _shall_ appear (futurity) we shall be like Him.

REMARK.--It is worthy of notice that in noun clauses introduced by
"that"--clauses which are really indirect quotations--the same auxiliary
is generally used that would be used were the quotation in the direct
form: as, "My sister says, 'Dorothy _will_ be glad to go with you,'" "My
sister says that Dorothy _will_ be glad to go with us;" "Dorothy says, 'I
_shall_ be glad to go with you,'" "Dorothy says that she _shall_ be glad
to go with us." This remark, however, is not an adequate statement of the
best usage, for it is not true of such sentences as 21, p. 76, and 8, 22,
p. 77.


III. IN QUESTIONS.

In _the first person_ "will" is never proper, except when it repeats a
question asked by another person. "Will I go?" would mean, "Is it my
intention to go?"--a useless question, since the speaker must know his own
will without asking.

In the _second and third persons_ the auxiliary which is expected in the
answer should be used.

Will you dine with me to-morrow? I will. (Volition.) Shall you be glad to
come? I shall. (Futurity.) Will your brother be there, too? He will.
(Futurity.)

WOULD OR SHOULD.[78]--"_Should_ and _would_ follow the same rules as
_shall_ and _will_, but they have in addition certain meanings peculiarly
their own.

"_Should_ is sometimes used in its original sense of 'ought,' as in 'You
should not do that.'

"_Would_ is sometimes used to signify habitual action, as in 'The 'Squire
would sometimes fall asleep in the most pathetic part of my sermon;' and
to express a wish, as, 'Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
my son!'"[79]

QUESTIONS OF TENSE.[80]--The tense of a verb should correctly express
the time referred to. Most errors in the use of tenses are violations of
some one of the following principles, which are established by good
usage:--

1. Principal verbs referring to the same time should be in the same tense.
2. The _perfect indicative_ represents something as now completed--as
   begun in the past but continuing till the present, at least in its
   consequences: as, "I _have lost_ my book" (so that now I do not have
   it); "This house _has stood_ for ninety years" (it is still standing);
   "Bishop Brooks _has died,_ but he _has left_ us his example" (he is not
   now among us, but we have his example).
3. The tense of the verb in a dependent clause varies with the tense of
   the principal verb:[81] as,
      I _know_ he _will_ come.
      I _knew_ he _would_ come.
      I _have taken_ the first train, that I _may_ arrive early.
      I _had taken_ the first train, that I _might_ arrive early.
      Blanche _will be_ frightened if she _sees_ the bat.
      Blanche _would be_ frightened if she _saw_ the bat.
      Blanche _would have been_ frightened if she _had seen_ the bat.
  Present facts and unchangeable truths, however, should be expressed in
  the present tense, regardless of the tense of the principal verb: as,
  "What did you say his name _is_?"
4. The _perfect infinitive_ is properly used to denote action which is
   completed at the time denoted by the principal verb: as, "I am glad _to
   have seen_ Niagara Falls;" "He felt sorry _to have hurt_ your feelings."

EXCEPTION.--_Ought, must, need,_ and _should_ (in the sense of "ought")
have no distinctive form to denote past time; with these verbs present
time is denoted by putting the complementary infinitive in the present
tense, past time is denoted by putting the complementary infinitive in the
perfect tense: as, "You ought _to go_," "You ought _to have gone_;" "He
should _be_ careful," "He should _have been_ careful." A similar change
from the present to the perfect infinitive is found after _could_ and
_might_ in some of their uses: as, "I could _go_," "I could _have gone_;"
"You might _have answered_."

INDICATIVE OR SUBJUNCTIVE.[82]--The modern tendency to drop the
subjunctive is unfortunate, for the distinction between the subjunctive
and the indicative is too useful to be abandoned.[83] A knowledge of the
difference between these modes in English is especially important in view
of the difficulty which pupils complain of in mastering the uses of the
Latin subjunctive or the Greek subjunctive and optative.[84] For these
reasons more space is given to the subjunctive in this book than would be
called for by a mere discussion of modern English usage.

FORMS of the SUBJUNCTIVE--In form the English
subjunctive differs from the indicative in several ways:--

1. In the single case of the verb _to be_ there are distinct
forms for the present and past tenses, namely:--


_Present_.                            _Past_
I,    we  \                 I _were_,    we  \
thou, you  } _be_.     thou _wert_, you  } _were_.
he,   they/                 he _were_,   they/



EXAMPLES.--"See that my room _be_[85] got ready at once." "I will work you
a banner if you _be_[85] victorious." "The headsman feels if the axe
_be_[85] sharp." "Take care lest you _be_ deceived." "Judge not that ye
_be_ not judged." "I will beard them, though they _be_[85] more fanged than
wolves and bears." "If I _were_ you, I would not say that." "If you
_were_ more studious, you would rank high." "Would that my parents _were_
here!"

2. In _other verbs_ the subjunctive form is distinguishable
from the indicative in the second and third persons singular
by the absence of the personal endings _-th,-s_, or _-st_: as,

_Present Indicative_: I have, thou hast, he has (hath).
       _Subjunctive_: I have, thou have, he have.
   _Past Indicative_: I had, thou hadst, he had.
       _Subjunctive_: I had, thou had, he had.

_Present Indicative_: I come, thou comest, he comes (cometh).
       _Subjunctive_: I come, thou come, he come.
   _Past Indicative_: I came, thou earnest, he came.
       _Subjunctive_: I came, thou came, he came.


[82] "Foundations," pp. 98-101.
[83] "Some people seem to think that the subjunctive mood is as good as
lost, that it is doomed, and that its retention is hopeless. If its
function were generally appreciated, it might even now be saved.... If we
lose the Subjunctive Verb, it will certainly be a grievous impoverishment
to our literary language, were it only for its value in giving variation
to diction--and I make bold to assert that the writer who helps to keep it
up deserves public gratitude."--John Earle: English Prose, its Elements,
History, and Usage, p. 172.
[84] "The lecturer also put in a plea for more vitality in the teaching of
English, which ought to be made the gate to other languages. Many of the
difficult questions of Latin syntax might be examined in the field of
English, if only we were careful to treat our English critically. Whereas
most grammars cut the ground from under them by denying the existence of a
Subjunctive Mood. Until teachers recognize generally that, in such a
sentence as 'If he had done it, it had been better,' we have a Subjunctive
in both clauses, and a sentence essentially different from 'If he had
loved her before, he now adored her,' English must forfeit half its value,
both as a mental discipline and as a means of approach to Latin, Greek,
and German."--From a report of a Lecture by Prof. Sonnenschein, of the
Mason College, quoted in Earle's "English Prose," p. 55.
[85] In such sentences the indicative would be, according to modern usage,
correct, and it is more common.

EXAMPLES.--"Long _live_ the king!" "If thou _go_, see that thou _offend_
not." "It is better he _die_." "Though he _slay_ me, yet will I trust
him." "Unless he _behave_[86] better, he will be punished." "If I will that
he _tarry_ till I come, what is that to thee?" "Govern well thy appetite,
lest sin _surprise_ thee." "If my sister _saw_ this snake, she would be
frightened." "I wish I _knew_ where Charles is."

The perfect and pluperfect subjunctives are of course formed by means of
the subjunctive present and past tenses of "have."

3. Very often, instead of the simple subjunctive forms, we use auxiliary
verbs--_may_ (past, _might_) and _would_ or _should_--to express the
subjunctive idea. "May" ("might") is common as an equivalent for the
subjunctive mode in clauses denoting a purpose, a wish, a hope, or a fear:
as, "Bring him the book, that he _may read_ to us;" "_May_ he _rest_ in
peace;" "I hope you _may succeed_;" "They were afraid we _might lose_ the
way." "Would" and "should" are common substitutes for all tenses of the
subjunctive: as, "Walk carefully lest you (stumble) _should stumble_;" "If
he (come) _should come_, he will find me at home;" "It (were) _would be_
better if he (went) _should go_ alone;" "If my sister had seen this mouse,
she (had been) _would have been_ frightened." In these sentences either
the form in parenthesis or the italicized form is correct, though the
latter is more common.


NOTE.--It does not follow that the verbs "may," "would," and "should"
always express the subjunctive idea. In the following sentences, for
instance, they express the indicative idea: "You _may_ (_i.e_., are
permitted to) stay an hour;" "You _should_ (_i.e_., ought to) be
punctual;" "Edith _would_ not (_i.e_., was unwilling to) come." In such
sentences "may," "should," and "would" make simple statements of fact.

USES of the SUBJUNCTIVE.--The indicative form is used in
expressing a fact or what is assumed to be a fact: as "He _thinks_ he _is_
ill;" the subjunctive form indicates some uncertainty or doubt in the
speaker's mind: as, "Whether it _rain_ or not, I will go."

The subjunctive idea occurs most frequently, perhaps, in _conditional
sentences_. A conditional sentence is one that contains a condition or
supposition. A supposition may refer to present, past, or future time. If
it refers to present or past time, it may be viewed by the speaker as
true, untrue, or as a mere supposition with nothing implied as to its
truth; if it refers to the future, it may be viewed as either likely or
unlikely. A supposition which is assumed to be true, or which is made
without any hint as to its correctness, is expressed by the indicative. A
supposition which is viewed by the speaker as untrue or unlikely is
expressed by the subjunctive or a periphrase[87] for the subjunctive. When
the character of the supposition makes the conclusion untrue or unlikely,
the conclusion also is expressed by the subjunctive or a periphrase[87] for
the subjunctive. The use of tenses is peculiar, as will be seen from the
following table of a few common forms of conditional sentences. The tenses
should be carefully noted:--

    PRESENT:
    If it _rains_ (_is raining_) now, I am sorry.
    _Present indicative_: A simple supposition without any hint as to its
    correctness.

    If it _rained_ (_were raining_), I _should be_ sorry.
    _Past subjunctive, both clauses_: The speaker implies that it is
    not raining.

    PAST:
    If it _rained_ (_was raining_), I was sorry.
    _Past indicative_: No suggestion of doubt.

    If it _had rained_, I _should have been_ sorry.
    _Past perfect subjunctive, both clauses_: The speaker implies that it
    did not rain.

    FUTURE:
    If it _rains_, I shall be sorry.
    _Present indicative_: The common, though inexact, form of a simple
    future supposition.

    If it _rain_, I shall be sorry.
   _Present subjunctive_: Less common, but more exact. The future is
   uncertain.

   If it _should_ (_were to_) _rain_, I _should be_
   sorry. _Subjunctive, both clauses_: The uncertainty is emphasized
   by the auxiliary form; the chances of rain seem more remote.

NOTE 1.--When _if_ is equivalent to "whenever", the condition is called
"general", to distinguish it from "particular" conditions, which refer to
some particular act at some particular time. General conditions always
take the indicative: as, "If (whenever) it _rains_, I stay at home."

NOTE 2.--Sometimes there is no "if", and then the verb or a part of the
verb precedes the subject: as, "Were it raining, I should be sorry;" "Had
it been raining, I should have been sorry."

NOTE 3.--In such sentences as "If thou hadst been here, my brother had not
died," it may perhaps be questioned whether "had not died" is indicative,
as in the Greek, or subjunctive, as in the Latin, idiom.

NOTE 4.--Clauses introduced by _though_ and _unless_ take the same forms
as clauses introduced by _if_.

_Wishes_ are naturally expressed in the subjunctive. The _present_
subjunctive denotes a wish for the future: as, "Thy kingdom _come_." The
_past_ subjunctive denotes a wish for the present which is unfulfilled:
as, "I wish I _were_ a bird." The _past perfect_ subjunctive denotes a
wish contrary to a past fact: as, "I wish you _had been_ there."

[86] In such sentences the indicative would be, according to modern usage,
correct, and it is more common.
[87] See paragraph 3, page 84. The forms in "would" and "should" in
conditional sentences, though they express the subjunctive idea, can
hardly be called the "subjunctive mood". Sometimes they are called the
"conditional mood."

SINGULAR or PLURAL.[88]--The following principles, established by
good usage, writers or speakers are liable to forget:--

1. The expressions _each, every, many a, either_, and _neither_ are
   singular.
2. When the subject consists of singular nouns or pronouns connected by
   _or, either_--_or_, or _neither_--_nor_, the verb must be singular.
3. Words joined to the subject by _with, together with, in addition to_,
   or _as well as_, are not a part of the grammatical subject, but are
   parenthetical, and therefore do not affect the number of the verb.
4. Since a relative pronoun has the number and person of its antecedent,
   a verb whose subject is a relative pronoun agrees in person and number
   with the antecedent of the relative.
5. "When the subject though plural in form is singular in sense, the verb
   should be singular; when the subject though singular in form is plural
   in sense, the verb should be plural:"[89] as, "'Gulliver's Travels'
   _was_ written by Swift;" "Five hundred dollars _is_ a large sum;" "Half
   of them _are_ gone."
6. "A collective noun, when it refers to the collection as a whole, is
   singular in sense, and therefore requires a singular verb; when it
   refers to the individual persons or things of the collection, it is
   plural and requires a plural verb."[90]

ARISE, RISE.--"The choice between these words was primarily, and
still often is, a matter of rhythm [euphony]. The literal meanings,
however, or those which seem literal, have become more associated with
_rise_, and the consciously figurative with _arise_: as, he _rose_ from
the chair; the sun _rose_; the provinces _rose_ in revolt: trouble
_arose;_ 'music _arose_ with its voluptuous swell.'"[93]

CAPTIVATE, CAPTURE.--_To captivate_ means "to fascinate"; _to
capture_, "to take prisoner."

DEPRECIATE, DEPRECATE.--_To depreciate_ means "to bring down in
value," "to disparage;" _to deprecate_ means "to argue earnestly against"

IMPUGN, IMPUTE.--_To impugn_ means "to call in question;" _to impute_
means "to ascribe to."

Loan, lend.--The use of _loan_ as a verb is not sanctioned by good use.
Properly the word is a noun. A _loan_ is money which a person _lends_.

II. A RESEMBLANCE IN SENSE MISLEADS.[94]

ANTAGONIZE, OPPOSE.--To _antagonize_ means properly "to struggle
against," "to oppose actively," or "to counteract." "In England,
antagonizing forces must be of the same kind, but in the political
phraseology of the United States a person may antagonize (i.e., oppose) a
measure."[95]

CALCULATE, INTEND.--To _calculate_ means properly "to compute
mathematically," or "to adjust or adapt" for something. In the sense of
_intend_ it is not in good use.

CARRY, BRING, FETCH.--To _carry_ means "to take along in going;" to
_bring_ means "to take along in coming;" to _fetch_ means "to go, get, and
bring."

CHAMPION, SUPPORT.--The word _champion_ is very much overworked,
being often used in the general sense of "support." It should be
restricted to cases in which there is the idea of entering the lists as
champion of a cause.

CLAIM, ASSERT, ALLEGE, MAINTAIN, DECLARE, AFFIRM, STATE.--To _claim_
means properly "to demand as one's own or one's due." It is often loosely
used, especially in the United States, for "assert," "allege," "maintain,"
"declare," or "affirm." To _assert_ is "to say or declare in the face of
implied denial or doubt." To _allege_ is "to assert without proof." To
_maintain_ is "to uphold by argument." To _declare_ is "to say publicly,
clearly, or emphatically." To _affirm_ is "to assert on one's reputation
for knowledge or truthfulness." To _state_, which is also often misused in
the sense of "say," "assert," "allege," "declare," or "affirm," means
properly "to express formally and in detail;" it always implies detail.
(See "Foundations," pp. 113, 114, and "Practical Exercises," p. 99.)

CONFESS, ADMIT.--"_Admit_, in cases into which the idea of confession
does not enter, is preferable to _confess_. On grounds of idiom, however,
'I must confess' and the parenthetical 'I confess' are exempt from the
operation of this rule."[96]

DEMAND, ASK.--_To demand_ means "_to ask_ for with authority or with
insistence." The use of "demand" in the sense of "ask" is borrowed,
possibly, from the French use of _demander_.

HIRE, LET, LEASE.--_To hire_ means "to obtain the use of;" _to let_,
"to give the use of." _To lease_ means "to give the use of by lease." The
owner of a house _leases_ it; the person who occupies it _takes a lease_
of it.

LEARN, TEACH.--_Learn_ means to "acquire" knowledge, not to "impart"
it. In the latter sense the proper word is _teach_.

"I have more information to-day than I had before," said Mr. Sheehan.

"This has learned you something," said Mr. Goff.

"Oh no," replied Mr. Sheehan, "it has taught me something."[97]

LIKE, LOVE.--_Like_ and _love_ differ greatly in strength or warmth,
and may differ in kind. _Like_ may be feeble and cool, and it never has
the intensity of _love_. We may _like_ or even _love_ a person; we only
_like_ the most palatable kind of food. With an infinitive, _like_ is the
common word, _love_ being appropriate only in the hyperbole of poetical or
rhetorical feeling.[98]

MATERIALIZE, APPEAR.--_To materialize_ properly means "to make or to
become physically perceptible;" as, "by means of letters we materialize
our ideas and make them as lasting as ink and paper;" "the ideas of the
sculptor materialize in marble."

PLEAD, ARGUE.--See _plea, argument,_ p. 29.

STAY, STOP.--"_Stay,_ as in 'At what hotel are you staying?' is
preferable to _stop_, since _stop_ also means 'to stop without
staying.'"[99]

TRANSPIRE, HAPPEN.--_To transpire_ means properly "to escape from
secrecy to notice," "to leak out;" it should not be used in the sense of
_to happen._

is "to foretell," "to forebode."

COMPARE WITH, COMPARE TO, CONTRAST.--"Two things are _compared_ in
order to note the points of resemblance and difference between them; they
are _contrasted_ in order to note the points of difference only. When one
thing is _compared to_ another, it is to show that the first is like the
second; when one thing is _compared with_ another, it is to show either
difference or similarity, especially difference."[102]

CONSTRUE, CONSTRUCT.--"_To construe_ means 'to interpret,' 'to show
the meaning;' _to construct_ means 'to build;' we may _construe_ a
sentence as in translation, or _construct_ it as in composition."[103]

CONVINCE, CONVICT.--"_To convince_ is 'to satisfy the understanding;'
_to convict_, 'to pronounce guilty.' 'The jury having been _convinced_ of
the prisoner's guilt, he was _convicted_.'"

DETECT, DISCRIMINATE.--_To detect_ is "to find out;" _to
discriminate_ is "to distinguish between."

DISCLOSE, DISCOVER.--To _disclose_ is "to uncover," "to reveal;" _to
discover_ is, in modern usage, "to find."

DOMINATE, DOMINEER.--_To dominate_ is "to rule;" _to domineer_ is "to
rule in an overbearing manner."

DRIVE, RIDE.--We go _driving_ in carriages, _riding_ in saddles. We
_drive_ behind horses, we _ride_ on them.

ELIMINATE, ELICIT.--_To eliminate_ is "to remove," "to get rid of;"
_to elicit_ is "to draw out."

ESTIMATE, ESTEEM.--_To estimate_ is "to judge the value of;" _to
esteem_ is "to set a high value on," especially of persons.

EXPOSE, EXPOUND.--_To expose_ is "to lay bare to view;" _to expound_
is "to explain the meaning of."

FRIGHTEN.--_Frighten_ is a transitive verb, and is used correctly in
"The locomotive _frightened_ the horse;" "The horse _was frightened_ by
the locomotive;" "The horse became _frightened_." It should not be used
intransitively, as in the sentence "The _horse frightened_ at the
locomotive."

INQUIRE, INVESTIGATE.--To _inquire_ is "to ask for information;" _to
investigate_ is "to make a thorough examination."

INSURE, SECURE.--_Secure_, in the sense of "to guard from danger,"
"to make safe," is preferable to _insure_, since _insure_ also means "to
guarantee indemnity for future loss or damage."

LET, LEAVE.--_Let_ means "to permit;" _leave_, "to let remain," or
"to go away from."

LOCATE, FIND.--_Locate_ properly means "to place in a particular

remedy;" _to proscribe_ is "to condemn to death or to loss of rights."

PURPOSE, PROPOSE.--"The verb _purpose_, in the sense of 'intend,' is
preferable to _propose_, since _to propose_ also means 'to offer for
consideration:' the noun answering to the former is _purpose_; to the
latter, _proposal_ or _proposition_."[104]

REPULSE, REPEL.--_Repulse_ usually implies hostility; _repel_ is a
milder term. We _repulse_ an enemy or an assailant; we _repel_ an
officious person or the unwelcome advances of a lover.

START, BEGIN, COMMENCE.--To _start_ is "to set out" or "to set
going," and is not followed by an infinitive. Before an infinitive,
"begin" or "commence" is used. "_Begin_ is preferred in ordinary use;
_commence_ has more formal associations with law and procedure, combat,
divine service, and ceremonial."[105]

SUSPECT, EXPECT, ANTICIPATE.--_To suspect_ is "to mistrust," "to
surmise." _Expect_, in the sense of "look forward to," is preferable to
_anticipate_, since _anticipate_ also means "take up, perform, or realize
beforehand;" as, "Some real lives do actually _anticipate_ the happiness
of heaven."

CHAPTER VI.

OF ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS


AN ADJECTIVE is a word joined by way of description or
limitation to a noun or a pronoun.

An ADVERB is a word joined by way of limitation or emphasis
to a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.

VULGARISMS.[110]--Every educated person is expected to
know the correct use of the following words:--

GOOD, WELL.--_Good_ is an adjective: the adverb corresponding to it
is _well_. We say, "He had a _good_ sleep;" "He slept _well_." _Well_ is
sometimes an adjective, as in "You look _well_."

LIKELY, PROBABLY, LIKE.--_Likely_ is now used as an adjective only,
except in the phrase "As _likely_ as not;" ad the corresponding adverb is
_probably_. We say, "He is _likely_ to come;" "He will _probably_ come."
_Like_ as an adjective means "similar," as, "Men of _like_ excellence;"
"He looks _like_ his grandfather;" "He was a man of _like_ passions as we
are." In the sense of "in the same manner as" _like_ is followed by a noun
or a pronoun in the objective case, and is called by some an adverb, by
others a preposition: as, "He talks _like_ her."

LESS, FEWER, SMALLER.--_Less_ refers to quantity, _fewer_ to number,
_smaller_ to size.

MOST, ALMOST.--_Most_ denotes "the greatest number, quantity, or
degree." It is always superlative and never means "nearly," which is the
proper meaning of _almost_. We say, "_Most_ of the boys are here; the time
has _almost_ come."

NEAR, NEARLY.--_Near_ is an adjective; the corresponding adverb is
_nearly_.

PLENTY is now in good use as a noun only, as "_Plenty_ of corn and
wine."[111] Shakespeare used the word as an adjective in "Reasons as
_plenty_ as blackberries," but this use is obsolete. The use of _plenty_
as an adverb, as "The food is _plenty_ good enough," is a vulgarism.

SOME, SOMEWHAT, SOMETHING.--_Some_ is an adjective, as, "_Some_
water;" "_Some_ brighter clime." _Somewhat_ is an adverb, as, "He is
_somewhat_ better." "Somewhat" is occasionally used as a noun, as,
"_Somewhat_ of doubt remains," but in this sense _something_ is more
common.

THIS, THESE; THAT, THOSE.--_This_ (plural _these_) and _that_ (plural
_those_) are the only adjectives in English that have distinct forms for
the plural. A common mistake is to use the plural forms with singular
collective nouns, as "kind," "class," "sort."

FIRST, SECOND, SECONDLY, etc.--_First_ is both adjective and adverb.
_Second, third_ etc., are adjectives only; the corresponding adverbs are
_secondly, thirdly_, etc. _Firstly_ is a vulgarism.

_Everywheres, illy, lesser, light-complected, muchly, nowhere near,
unbeknown_ are not in reputable use.

ADJECTIVE or ADVERB.[112]--Illiterate persons often forget that
adjectives go with nouns and pronouns, but adverbs with verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs. Even cultivated persons are sometimes in doubt whether to use
an adjective or an adverb after certain verbs, as "grow," "look," "sound,"
"smell," "taste." If the added word applies to the subject of the verb, it
should be an adjective; if to the verb, it should be an adverb. We say "We
feel _warm_" when we mean that we are warm; we say "We feel _warmly_ on
this subject," when we mean that our feeling is warm. "As a rule, it is
proper to use an adjective whenever some form of the verb 'to be' or 'to
seem' may be substituted for the verb, an adverb when no such substitution
can be made."[113] Thus, "He looked _angry_; he spoke _angrily_." Sometimes
we may use either adjective or adverb with no difference in meaning: as,
"We were sitting _quiet_ (_quietly_) round the fire."

Regarding the _form_ of adverbs, ill-taught pupils often suppose that all
words ending in "-ly" are adverbs, and that all adverbs end in "-ly." A
glance at the italicized words in the following expressions will remove
this delusion: "Come _here_;" "_very_ pretty;" "he _then_ rose;" "lay it
_lengthwise_;" "he fell _backward_;" "run _fast_;" "_now_ it is done;" "a
_friendly_ Indian;" "a buzzing _fly_." Though no comprehensive rule can be
given for the form of adverbs, which must be learned for the most part by
observation, it may be helpful to know that most "adjectives of quality,"
like _gentle, true,_ take the suffix "-ly" to make a corresponding adverb;
and that the comparative and superlative degrees of adverbs ending in
"-ly" usually prefix _more_ and _most_.

OMITTED ADVERBS.[117]--Adverbs necessary to the sense should not be
omitted. This fault is especially common after _so, too,_ and
_very_--words which, as they express degree, properly qualify adjectives
or adverbs, and not verbs or participles; also after _behave_, which, like
the noun "behavior," requires a qualifying word to determine the meaning.

MISUSED ADJECTIVES and ADVERBS.[119]--See the remarks under
"Misused Nouns." An amusing illustration of misused adjectives was
furnished by an illiterate man who introduced his second wife to a friend
as "My _late_ wife."

I.

AGGRAVATING, IRRITATING.--In good use _aggravating_ means "making
heavier, more grave, worse in some way." It is often misused for
_irritating, exasperating,_ or _provoking_.

ALL, THE WHOLE.--See page 120.

APT, LIKELY, LIABLE.--_Apt_ implies a natural predisposition, an
habitual tendency. "_Likely_ implies a probability of whatever character;
_liable_, an unpleasant probability."[120] One is _apt_ to speak quickly,
_likely_ to hear good news, _liable_ to be hurt.

BOTH, EACH, EVERY.--_Both_, meaning "the two, and not merely one of
them," groups objects, as, "_Both_ were men of hot temper." _Each_ means
"all of any number, considered one by one," as, "_Each_ boy recited in his
turn." _Every_ means "all of any number, considered as composing a group
or class," as, "_Every_ pupil should have a dictionary and use it freely."
"_Every_ directs attention chiefly to the totality, _each_ chiefly to the
individuals composing it. It may also be observed that _each_ usually
refers to a numerically definite group.... Thus, 'Each theory is open to
objection' relates to an understood enumeration of theories, but 'Every
theory is open to objection' refers to all theories that may exist."[121]

MANY, MUCH.--_Many_ refers to number, _much_ to quantity.

MUTUAL, COMMON.--_Mutual_ properly means "reciprocal,"
"interchanged." It is often misused for _common_ in the sense of
"belonging equally to both or all," especially in the phrase, "A _mutual_
friend."

PARTLY, PARTIALLY.--"_Partly_, in the sense of 'in part,' is preferable
to _partially_, since _partially_ also means 'with partiality.'"[122]

QUITE, VERY.--_Quite_ properly means "entirely"; in the sense of
"very" or "to a considerable degree" it is not in good use.

SO-AS, AS-AS.--Both _so_ and _as_ are used as adverbs of degree
correlative with the conjunction "as": unless there is a negative in the
clause _as_ is generally used; with a negative _so_ is preferable to
_as_. We say "It is _as_ cold as ice," "It is not _so_ good as it looks."

II.

APPARENTLY, EVIDENTLY, MANIFESTLY.--"_Apparently_ is properly used of
that which seems, but may not be, real; _evidently_, of that which both
seems and is real."[123] _Manifestly_ is stronger than _evidently_.

AVERAGE, ORDINARY.--_Average_ implies an arithmetical computation; if
four persons lose respectively $10, $20, $30, and $40, the _average_ loss
is $25. The word is used figuratively by Dr. O.W. Holmes in "The _average_
intellect of five hundred persons, taken as they come, is not very high."
In the sense of "usual," "common in occurrence," "of the usual standard,"
_ordinary_ is preferable to _average_.

BOUND, DETERMINED.--_Bound_ properly means "obliged," "fated," or
"under necessity": as, "A man is _bound_ by his word;" "We hold ourselves
in gratitude _bound_ to receive ... all such persons." In the sense of
"determined" _hound_ is not in good use. In the sense of "sure" it is in
colloquial, but not in literary, use.

CONTINUAL, CONTINUOUS.--"_Continual_ is used of frequently repeated
acts, as, 'Continual dropping wears away a stone;' _continuous_, of
uninterrupted action, as, 'the continuous flowing of a river.'"[125]

DEADLY, DEATHLY.--"_Deathly_, in the sense of 'resembling death,' as,
'She was deathly pale,' is preferable to _deadly_, since _deadly_ also
means 'inflicting death.'"[124]

DECIDED, DECISIVE.--"A _decided_ opinion is a strong opinion, which
perhaps decides nothing; a _decisive_ opinion settles the question at
issue. A lawyer may have _decided_ views on a case; the judgment of a
court is _decisive_."[125]

DUMB, STUPID.--_Dumb_ properly means "mute," "silent." Its misuse for
_stupid_ is partly due, especially in Pennsylvania, to its resemblance to
the German _dumm_.

EXISTING, EXTANT.--That is _extant_ which has escaped the ravages of
time (used chiefly of books, manuscripts, etc.); that is _existing_ which
has existence.

FUNNY, ODD.--_Funny_ means "comical;" in the sense of "strange" or
"odd" it is not in good use.

HEALTHY, HEALTHFUL, WHOLESOME.--That is _healthy_ which is in good
health; that is _healthful_ or _wholesome_ which produces health.
_Wholesome_ commonly applies to food.

HUMAN, HUMANE.--_Human_ denotes what pertains to man as man;
as, "_human_ nature," "_human_ sacrifices." _Humane_ means "compassionate."

LATEST, LAST.--_Latest_, like the word "late," contains a distinct
reference to time; that is _latest_ which comes after all others in time:
as, "The _latest_ news;" "The _latest_ fashion." _Last_, which was
originally a contraction of "latest," is now used without any distinct
reference to time, and denotes that which comes after all others in space
or in a series: as, "The _last_ house on the street;" "The _Last_ of the
Mohicans."

LENGTHY, LONG.--_Lengthy_ is said to have originated in the United
States, but the earliest quotations found are from British authors. In the
introduction to the second series of The Biglow Papers, Mr. Lowell wrote:
"We have given back to England the excellent adjective _lengthy_ ... thus
enabling their journalists to characterize our President's messages by a
word civilly compromising between _long_ and _tedious_, so as not to
endanger the peace of the two countries by wounding our national
sensitiveness to British criticism." _Lengthy_ is used chiefly of
discourses or writings, and implies tediousness. _Long_ is used of
anything that has length.

MAD, ANGRY.--_Mad_ means "insane;" in the sense of "angry" it is not
in good use.

NEW, NOVEL.--That is _new_ which is not old; that is _novel_ which is
both new and strange.

ORAL, VERBAL.--"_Oral_, in the sense of 'in spoken words,' is
preferable to _verbal_, since _verbal_ means 'in words' whether spoken or
written."[126]

PITIABLE, PITIFUL.--"_Pitiable,_ in the sense of 'deserving pity,' is
preferable to _pitiful,_ since _pitiful_ also means 'compassionate,' as,
'The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.'"[126]

PRACTICABLE, PRACTICAL.--That is _practicable_ which can be done;
that is _practical_ which is not theoretical only: as, "a _practicable_
plan," "a _practical_ electrician."

PROMINENT, EMINENT.--_Prominent_ means "conspicuous," "standing out
so as to be easily seen;" _eminent_ means "distinguished in character or
rank."

REAL, REALLY, VERY.--_Real_ is properly an adjective, meaning "not
imaginary or counterfeit," as, "_real_ diamonds." Its misuse for the
adverbs _really_ and _very_, as, "This is _real_ pretty," is a vulgarism.

SCARED, AFRAID.--The participle _scared_ means "frightened;" _afraid_
is an adjective meaning "in fear." Before "of," the proper word is
_afraid_: as, "She is _afraid_ of horses." _Scared of_ is not in good use.

GRAND, GORGEOUS, AWFUL, SPLENDID, ELEGANT, LOVELY,
MAGNIFICENT.--_Grand_ properly implies "grandeur;" _gorgeous_,
"splendid colors;" _awful_, "awe;" _elegant_, "elegance;" _splendid_,
"splendor;" _lovely,_ "surpassing loveliness;" _magnificent_,
"magnificence."

"We talk, sometimes, with people whose conversation would lead you to
suppose that they had lived in a museum, where all the objects were
monsters and extremes.... They use the superlative of grammar: 'most
perfect,' 'most exquisite,' 'most horrible.' Like the French, they are
enchanted, they are desolate, because you have got or have not got a
shoestring or a wafer you happen to want--not perceiving that superlatives
are diminutives and weaken.... All this comes of poverty. We are unskilful
definers. From want of skill to convey quality, we hope to move admiration
by quantity. Language should aim to describe the fact.... 'Tis very
wearisome, this straining talk, these experiences all exquisite, intense,
and tremendous."[127]

_Illustrate by original sentences the correct use of each of these words:_
--Both, each, every, aggravating, liable, likely, apt, mutual, partially,
quite, average, bound, continual, continuous, deadly, deathly, decided,

wholesome, human, humane, latest, last, lengthy, mad, novel, verbal,
pitiable, pitiful, practicable, practical, prominent, eminent, real,
really, scared, grand, gorgeous, awful, splendid, elegant, lovely,
magnificent.

USE of the COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE.--The comparative degree
is preferable when two things or sets of things are compared, the
superlative when three or more are compared.

To say "Iron is more useful than _any_ metal" is clearly incorrect,
because iron is included in "any metal," and of course iron is not more
useful than itself. We must in thought set iron off in a class by itself,
which we can do by inserting "other" after "any." "Iron is more useful
than _any other_ metal" is correct. After comparatives accompanied by
"than," the words "any" and "all" should be followed by "other."

To say "Iron is the most useful of _any_ (or, _any other_) metal" is also
clearly incorrect, because we mean that iron is the most useful, not of
"one metal (no matter which)" or of "some metals (no matter which)," but
of all metals. We should therefore omit the word "any," saying simply
"Iron is the most useful of (all) metals." It is also incorrect to say
"Iron is the most useful of all _other_ metals," for iron is not one of
the "other metals." Beware of using "any" or "other" with superlatives
followed by "of."

ADJECTIVES and ADVERBS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON.[129]--
Some adjectives and adverbs have meanings which do not vary in degree: as,
_dead, perfect, wooden._ Such adjectives cannot properly be compared or
modified by the words "more," "most," "so," "too," and "very."

[129] "Foundations," p. 135.

inseparable, intangible, intolerable, invariable, long, masterly, round,
sharp, square, sufficient, unanimous, unbearable, unbounded, unerring,
unique, universally, unparalleled, unprecedented.

MISPLACED ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS.[130]--A word, a phrase, or a clause
used as an adjective or an adverb should come next to the word, or words,
which it modifies.

The word _only_ requires special care. Observe how the position of _only_
affects the meaning in the following sentences: "Only he lost his hat;"
"He only lost his hat;" "He lost only his hat," or "He lost his hat only;"
"He lost his only hat."

    had for our tea.
21. I scarcely ever remember to have had a rougher walk.

ADVERBS between TO and THE INFINITIVE.--"A careful writer
will do well to avoid the construction which places the adverb between
_to_ and the infinitive. It is true that the construction is a common one;
but it is also true that those who are most addicted to the practice are
not those who count most as authorities on questions of good usage."[131]

CHAPTER VII.

OF PREPOSITIONS


MISUSED PREPOSITIONS.[132]--A writer, in choosing the proper
preposition to express his meaning, must rely chiefly on his sense of
idiom, that is, his knowledge of English usage, but he may find the
following notes helpful.

AMONG, BETWEEN.--"_Among_ is the proper word when the reference is to
more than two persons or things, or groups of persons or things;
_between_, when the reference is to two only."[133]

AT, IN.--Before names of places to denote "where," _at_ is used when
the place is so small as to be treated as a mere point, or when, although
large, it is viewed as a mere point; _in_ is used when it is desired to
make prominent the idea "within the bounds of:" as, "He arrived _at_
Liverpool in the morning and remained _in_ that city two days." Before the
name of the place in which the speaker dwells, if the place is of any
size, _in_ is generally preferred to _at_, unless the place is so remote
that it dwindles in the mental vision to a point.

BACK OF.--_Back of_, though frequently heard in conversation and
sometimes seen in print, is not in good use.

BESIDE, BESIDES.--_Beside_ means "by the side of;" _besides_ is now
used only in the sense of "in addition to," "other than:" as, "Who sits
_beside_ you?" "Who _besides_ us knows this?"

BY, WITH.--To introduce the agent of an action _by_ is now commonly
used; the material instrument or tool is usually introduced by _with_: as,
"Duncan was murdered _by_ Macbeth _with_ a dagger."

DIFFERENT FROM, DIFFERENT TO.--_Different from_ is preferable to
_different to_ and _different than_.

IN, INTO.--"_In_ implies presence inside of, or within; _into_
implies movement to the inside of. Before a man can move _in_ a room, he
must already have moved _into_ it."[134]

IN, ON.--Before names of streets, _in_ implies some reference to
surroundings; _on_ is less definite, indicating location only.

ON TO, ONTO.--"Good use does not support either _on to_ or
_onto_."[135]

WAIT FOR, WAIT ON.--_To wait for_ means "to await," as, "We will
_wait for_ you at the corner." _To wait on_ means "to attend on," as, "At
dinner the women _waited on_ the men."

CHAPTER VIII.


OF CONJUNCTIONS

VULGARISMS.[141]--Every educated person is expected to know the correct
use of the following words:--

LIKE, AS.--In good use _like_ is never a conjunction, and therefore
it cannot be used instead of _as_ to introduce a clause. It is incorrect
to say, "Walk _like_ I walk," but one may say, "He walks _like_ me," or
"He looks _like_ his grandfather."[142]

EXCEPT, WITHOUT, UNLESS.--_Except_, which was originally a
past-participle, was once in good use as a conjunction; but in modern use
it has been displaced as a conjunction by _unless_, and is now a
preposition only. We may say, "All went _except_ me," but we may not say,
"_Except_ you go with me, I will stay at home." Another word not in good
use as a conjunction, but often heard instead of "unless," is _without_.

MISUSED CONJUNCTIONS.[143]--Conjunctions are few in number and are more
definite in their meanings than prepositions. Most errors in using them
spring from confused thinking or hasty writing. "A close reasoner and a
good writer in general may be known by his pertinent use of
connectives."[144]

AND.--_And_ has, generally speaking, the meaning of "in addition to."

BUT.--_But_ implies some exception, opposition, or contrast.
Equivalent, or nearly equivalent, expressions are "however," "on the other
hand," "yet," "nevertheless."

AS.--"_As_ has so many meanings that it is better, when possible, to
use a conjunction that covers less ground."[145]

BECAUSE, FOR, SINCE.--The difference between these words is chiefly a
difference in emphasis. "We will not go, _because_ it is raining" is the
strongest way of expressing the relation of cause and effect. In "_Since_
it is raining, we will not go," the emphasis is shifted from the cause to
the effect, which becomes the prominent idea. In "We will not go, _for_ it
is raining," the reason, "it is raining," is announced as itself a bit of
news. Often the choice between these words is decided by the ear.

HOW.--_How_ properly means "in what manner" or "to what extent." It
is often misused for "that" to introduce an object clause.

NOR, OR.--_Nor_ is the correlative of _neither_, sometimes of other
negatives. _Or_ is the correlative of _either_.

THEREFORE, SO.--In the sense of "for this reason," _therefore_ is
preferable to _so_, since _so_ has other meanings.

THOUGH.--_Though_ means "notwithstanding," "in spite of the fact
that."

AS IF, AS THOUGH.--"_As if_ is, on the whole, preferable to _as
though."[146]

WHEN, WHILE.--_When_ means "at the time that;" _while_, "during the
time that," "as long as." "_When_ fixes attention on a date or period;
_while_ fixes attention on the lapse of time."[147]

OMITTED CONJUNCTIONS.--Careless writers sometimes omit conjunctions
that are necessary either to the grammar or to the sense. A common form of
this fault is illustrated in "This is as good if not better than that"--a
sentence in which "as" is omitted after "as good." The best way to correct
the sentence is to recast it, thus: "This is as good as that, if not
better."


EXERCISE LXXXVIII.

_Correct the faults in these sentences:_--

1. Ralph is as young or younger than Harry.
2. Cedar is more durable but not so hard as oak.
3. I never heard any one speak more fluently or so wittily as he.
4. She is fairer but not so amiable as her sister.
5. Though not so old, he is wiser than his brother.

REDUNDANT CONJUNCTIONS.--[148] Careless writers sometimes insert
conjunctions that are useless or worse than useless.
A common form of this fault is the use in certain cases of "and" or "but"
before the words "who," "which," "when," or "where," which are themselves
connectives: as, "The challenge was accepted by Orlando, a young man
little known up to that time, _but_ to _whom_ Rosalind had taken a great
liking." If the relative clause introduced by "who," "which," "when," or
"where" is to be joined to a preceding relative clause, the conjunction is
proper: as, "The challenge was accepted by Orlando, a young man _who_ was
little known at that time, _but_ to whom Rosalind had taken a great
liking."

[148] See "Foundations," pp. 208-211.


EXERCISE LXXXIX.

_Which conjunctions in these sentences are redundant_?--

1. I have again been so fortunate as to obtain the assistance of Dr.
   Jones, a teacher of great experience, and whose ideas are quite in
   harmony with my own.
2. Franklin had noticed for some time the extreme dirtiness of the
   streets, and especially of the street that he lived on.
3. This animal was considered as irresistible.
4. But how to get him there was a problem. But it was decided to convey
   him on one of the wagons used in carrying the Emperor's men-of-war from
   the woods, where they were made, to the water.
5. He forgot to pay for the wine--a shortness of memory common with such
   men, and which his host did not presume to correct.
6. Next came Louis, Duke of Orleans, the first prince of the blood royal,
   and to whom the attendants rendered homage as the future king.
7. So from all this you can see that such things are not impossible.
8. Her expression of countenance induced most persons to address her with
   a deference inconsistent with her station, and which nevertheless she
   received with easy composure.
9. Our escort consisted of MacGregor, and five or six of the handsomest,
   best armed, and most athletic mountaineers of his band, and whom he had
   generally in immediate attendance upon his own person.
10. The little town of Lambtos, Mrs. Gardiner's former home, and where
    she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained.
11. He spoke in a deep and low tone, but which nevertheless was heard from
    one end of the hall to the other.

MISPLACED CORRELATIVES.--When conjunctions are used as correlatives,
as "both-and," "either-or," each of the correlated words should be so
placed as to indicate clearly what ideas are to be connected in thought.
This principle is violated in "He _not only_ visited Paris, _but_ Berlin
_also._" In this sentence the position of "not only" before the verb
"visited" leads one to expect some corresponding verb in the second part
of the sentence; in fact, however, the two connected words are "Paris" and
"Berlin;" "visited" applies to both. This meaning is clearly indicated by
putting "not only" before "Paris:" thus, "He visited _not only_ Paris,
_but_ Berlin _also_." As a rule the word after the first correlative
should be the same part of speech as the word after the second
correlative.

13. In estimating the work of Luther, we must neither forget the temper of
    the man nor the age in which he lived.

APPENDIX

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS


The following suggestions are made in answer to many inquiries from
teachers who perceive the rare excellence of the "Foundations of
Rhetoric," but who do not clearly see, because of the novel method of the
book, how to turn its merits to account in their class-rooms. The
suggestions outline one way in which the book has been used to great
advantage.

It should never be forgotten that the illustrative sentences in the
"Foundations" have no value except as they help the student to grasp a
principle that he can apply in his own use of language. In every case the
emphasis should be laid on the principle which is announced or
illustrated. Merely learning the corrected sentences by heart is useless
and should not be permitted.

In taking a class over PART I., which treats of words, it is the writer's
practice to assign a short lesson--from one to three pages--in connection
with every recitation in English. The leading ideas and most typical
sentences in each lesson are privately marked in the teacher's book with
colored pencil, so that they may readily catch his eye, and from five to
twelve minutes of each recitation period are taken up with a rapid
questioning on these leading ideas and typical sentences. Corrections or
answers unaccompanied by reasons are not accepted. Attention is always
fixed, not on the form of the illustrative sentence, but on the principle
of usage under discussion. Pupils would rather commit to memory the
sentences than trouble themselves about reasons; but they will master
reasons when they find they must. After principles have been mastered,
exercises in the choice of forms and words are needed in order that
knowledge may be converted into habit.

In PARTS II. and III. the lessons are equally short and the emphasis is
unceasingly laid on the question "Why?" If the subject is difficult, it is
desirable, at the time that the lesson is assigned, to lead the class over
the text and some of the illustrative sentences in order to open, as it
were, the eyes of the pupils. Since these parts of the book treat not of
single words, but of sentences and paragraphs, recitations on them seem to
call for the use of pencil or chalk. One successful teacher conducts the
recitation with books open, requiring her pupils to cover the correct
sentences with a strip of paper while they explain and correct the faults
in the incorrect sentences. The writer's practice is to paste the faulty
sentences on cards of convenient size and thickness--the arrangement of
columns is such that the sentences can all be cut from _one_ old book--and
to distribute them among eight or ten pupils at the beginning of the
recitation hour. While other matters are being attended to, these pupils
write the sentences in correct form on the blackboard, and, when the time
comes, give their reasons for the changes which they have made. Their work
is discussed, if necessary, by the whole class. Reviews and written tests
should be frequent. As fast as the various principles explained and
illustrated in PARTS II. and III. are studied, the attention of pupils
should be immediately turned to their own writing. It will be far more
profitable for them to correct their own offences against clearness,
force, ease, and unity than to correct similar offences committed by
others. For this reason the PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISH contains no
exercises on the subjects discussed in PARTS II. and III. of the
"Foundations."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
