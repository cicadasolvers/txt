Dedication

[In The Third Edition]

_To His Grace_

_Edward, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury_.

MY LORD ARCHBISHOP,

Nearly forty years ago, under encouragement from your venerated
predecessor Archbishop Howley, and with the friendly help of his Librarian
Dr. Maitland, I entered upon the work of collating manuscripts of the
Greek New Testament by examining the copies brought from the East by
Professor Carlyle, and purchased for the Lambeth Library in 1805. I was
soon called away from this employment--{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}--to less
congenial duties in that remote county, wherein long after it was your
Grace's happy privilege to refresh the spirits of Churchmen and
Churchwomen, by giving them pious work to do, and an example in the doing
of it. What I have since been able to accomplish in the pursuits of sacred
criticism, although very much less than I once anticipated, has proved, I
would fain hope, not without its use to those who love Holy Scripture, and
the studies which help to the understanding of the same.

Among the scholars whose sympathy cheered and aided my Biblical labours
from time to time, I have had the honour of including your Grace; yet it
would be at once unseemly and fallacious to assume from that circumstance,
that the principles of textual criticism which I have consistently
advocated have approved themselves to your judgement. All that I can look
for or desire in this respect is that I may seem to you to have stated my
case fairly and temperately, in earnest controversy with opponents far my
superiors in learning and dialectic power, and for whom, in spite of
literary differences, I entertain deep respect and true regard.

My Lord, you have been called by Divine Providence to the first place in
our Communion, and have entered upon your great office attended by the
applauses, the hopeful wishes, and the hearty prayers of the whole Church.
May it please God to endow you richly with the Christian gifts as well of
wisdom as of courage: for indeed the highest minister of the Church of
England, no less than the humblest, will need courage in the coming time,
now that faith is waxing cold and adversaries are many.

I am, my Lord Archbishop,

Your obliged and faithful servant,

F. H. A. Scrivener.

PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION.


At the time of the lamented death of Dr. Scrivener a new edition of his
standard work was called for, and it was supposed that the great Master of
Textual Criticism had himself made sufficient corrections and additions
for the purpose in the margin of his copy. When the publishers committed
to me the task of preparation, I was fully aware of the absolute necessity
of going far beyond the materials placed at my disposal, if the book were
to be really useful as being abreast of the very great progress
accomplished in the last ten years. But it was not till I had laboured
with absolute loyalty for some months that I discovered from my own
observation, and from the advice of some of the first textual critics, how
much alteration must at once be made.

Dr. Scrivener evidently prepared the Third Edition under great
disadvantage. He had a parish of more than 5,500 inhabitants upon his
hands, with the necessity of making provision for increase in the
population. The result was that after adding 125 pages to his book he had
an attack of paralysis, and so it is not surprising that his work was not
wholly conducted upon the high level of his previous publications. The
book has also laboured under another and greater disadvantage of too
rapid, though unavoidable, growth. The 506 pages of the First Edition have
been successively expanded into 626 pages in the Second, 751 in the Third,
and 874 in the Fourth; while the framework originally adopted, consisting
only of nine chapters, was manifestly inadequate to the mass of material
ultimately gathered. It has therefore been found necessary, as the work
proceeded, to do violence, amidst much delicate embarrassment, to feelings
of loyalty to the author forbidding alteration. The chief changes that
have been made are as follows:--

The first intention of keeping the materials within the compass of one
volume has been abandoned, and it has been divided into two volumes, with
an increase of chapters in each.

Instead of 2,094 manuscripts, as reckoned in the third edition under the
six classes, no less than 3,791 have been recorded in this edition, being
an increase of 236 beyond the 3,555 of Dr. Gregory, without counting the
numerous vacant places which have been filled up.

Most of the accounts of ancient versions have been rewritten by
distinguished scholars, who are leaders in their several departments.

The early part of Volume I has been enriched from the admirable book on
"Greek and Latin Palaeography," by Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, who with great
kindness placed the proof-sheets at my disposal before publication.

Changes have been made in the headlines, the indexes, and in the printing,
and sometimes in the arrangement, which will, I trust, enable the reader
to find his way more easily about the treatise.

And many corrections suggested by eminent scholars have been introduced in
different places all through the work.

A most pleasing duty now is to tender my best thanks to the Right Reverend
the Lord Bishop of Salisbury and the Rev. H. J. White, M.A., for the
rewriting of the chapter on Latin Versions by the latter under Dr. John
Wordsworth's supervision, with help from M. Samuel Berger; to the Rev. G.
H. Gwilliam, B.D., Fellow of Hertford College, now editing the Peshitto
for the University of Oxford, for the improvement of the passages upon the
Peshitto and the Curetonian; the Rev. H. Deane, B.D., for additions to the
treatment of the Harkleian; and the Rev. Dr. Walker, Principal of St.
John's Hall, Highbury, for the results of a collation of the Peshitto and
Curetonian; to the Rev. A. C. Headlam, M.A., Fellow of All Souls College,
for a revision of the long chapter upon Egyptian Versions; to F. C.
Conybeare, Esq., M.A., late Fellow of University College, for rewriting
the sections on the Armenian and Georgian Versions; to Professor
Margoliouth, M.A., Fellow of New College, for rewriting the sections on
the Arabic and Ethiopic Versions; to the Rev. Ll. J. M. Bebb, M.A., Fellow
of Brasenose College, for rewriting the section upon the Slavonic Version;
to Dr. James W. Bright, Assistant-Professor in the Johns Hopkins
University, for rewriting the section on the Anglo-Saxon Version, through
Mr. White's kind offices; to E. Maunde Thompson, Esq., D.C.L., LL.D.,
F.S.A., &c., for kindness already mentioned, and other help, and to G. F.
Warner, Esq., M.A., of the Manuscript Department of the British Museum,
for correction of some of the notices of cursive MSS. belonging to the
Museum, and for other assistance; to J. Rendel Harris, Esq., M.A., Fellow
of Clare College and Reader in Palaeology in the University of Cambridge,
for much help of a varied nature; to Professor Isaac H. Hall, Ph.D., of
New York City, for sending and placing at my disposal many of his
publications; to the lamented Professor Bensly, for writing me a letter
upon the Syriac Versions; to the Rev. Nicholas Pocock, M.A., of Clifton,
for some results of a collation of F and G of St. Paul; to Professor
Bernard, D.D., Trinity College, Dublin, for a paper of suggestions; to the
Rev. Walter Slater, M.A., for preparing Index II in Vol. I; and to several
other kind friends, for assistance of various kinds freely given. The
generosity of scholars in communicating out of their stores of learning is
a most pleasing feature in the study of the present day. Whatever may be
my own shortcomings--and I fear that they have been enhanced by limitations
of time and space, and through the effects of ill-health and sorrow--the
contributions enumerated cannot but render the present edition of Dr.
Scrivener's great work eminently useful to students.

[Transcriber's Note: This book contains much Greek text, which will not be
well-rendered in plain text versions of this E-book. Also, there is much
use of Greek characters with a vertical bar across the tops of the letters
to indicate abbreviations; because the coding system used in this e-book
does not have such an "overline", they are rendered here with underlines.]

CHAPTER I. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.


1. When God was pleased to make known to man His purpose of redeeming us
through the death of His Son, He employed for this end the general laws,
and worked according to the ordinary course of His Providential
government, so far as they were available for the furtherance of His
merciful design. A revelation from heaven, in its very notion, implies
supernatural interposition; yet neither in the first promulgation nor in
the subsequent propagation of Christ's religion, can we mark any _waste_
of miracles. So far as they were needed for the assurance of honest
seekers after truth, they were freely resorted to: whensoever the
principles which move mankind in the affairs of common life were adequate
to the exigences of the case, more unusual and (as we might have thought)
more powerful means of producing conviction were withheld, as at once
superfluous and ineffectual. Those who heard not Moses and the prophets
would scarcely be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

2. As it was with respect to the _evidences_ of our faith, so also with
regard to the volume of Scripture. God willed that His Church should enjoy
the benefit of His written word, at once as a rule of doctrine and as a
guide unto holy living. For this cause He so enlightened the minds of the
Apostles and Evangelists by His Spirit, that they recorded what He had
imprinted on their hearts or brought to their remembrance, without the
risk of error in anything essential to the verity of the Gospel. But this
main point once secured, the rest was left, in a great measure, to
themselves. The style, the tone, the language, perhaps the special
occasion of writing, seem to have depended much on the taste and judgement
of the several penmen. Thus in St. Paul's Epistles we note the profound
thinker, the great scholar, the consummate orator: St. John pours forth
the simple utterings of his gentle, untutored, affectionate soul: in St.
Peter's speeches and letters may be traced the impetuous earnestness of
his noble yet not faultless character. Their individual tempers and
faculties and intellectual habits are clearly discernible, even while they
are speaking to us in the power and by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.

3. Now this self-same parsimony in the employment of miracles which we
observe with reference to Christian evidences and to the inspiration of
Scripture, we might look for beforehand, from the analogy of divine
things, when we proceed to consider the methods by which Scripture has
been preserved and handed down to us. God _might_, if He would, have
stamped His revealed will visibly on the heavens, that all should read it
there: He _might_ have so completely filled the minds of His servants the
Prophets and Evangelists, that they should have become mere passive
instruments in the promulgation of His counsel, and the writings they have
delivered to us have borne no traces whatever of their individual
characters: but for certain causes which we can perceive, and doubtless
for others beyond the reach of our capacities, He has chosen to do neither
the one nor the other. And so again with the subject we propose to discuss
in the present work, namely, the relation our existing text of the New
Testament bears to that which originally came from the hands of the sacred
penmen. Their autographs _might_ have been preserved in the Church as the
perfect standards by which all accidental variations of the numberless
copies scattered throughout the world should be corrected to the end of
time: but we know that these autographs perished utterly in the very
infancy of Christian history. Or if it be too much to expect that the
autographs of the inspired writers should escape the fate which has
overtaken that of every other known relique of ancient literature, God
_might_ have so guided the hand or fixed the devout attention both of
copyists during the long space of fourteen hundred years before the
invention of printing, and of compositors and printers of the Bible for
the last four centuries, that no jot or tittle should have been changed of
all that was written therein. Such a course of Providential arrangement we
must confess to be quite possible, but it could have been brought about
and maintained by nothing short of a continuous, unceasing miracle;--by
making fallible men (nay, many such in every generation) for one purpose
absolutely infallible. If the complete identity of all copies of Holy
Scripture prove to be a fact, we must of course receive it as such, and
refer it to its sole Author: yet we may confidently pronounce beforehand,
that such a fact could not have been reasonably anticipated, and is not at
all agreeable to the general tenour of God's dealings with us.

4. No one who has taken the trouble to examine any two editions of the
Greek New Testament needs be told that this supposed complete resemblance
in various copies of the holy books is not founded on fact. Even several
impressions derived from the same standard edition, and professing to
exhibit a text positively the same, differ from their archetype and from
each other, in errors of the press which no amount of care or diligence
has yet been able to get rid of. If we extend our researches to the
manuscript copies of Scripture or of its versions which abound in every
great library in Christendom, we see in the very best of them variations
which we must at once impute to the fault of the scribe, together with
many others of a graver and more perplexing nature, regarding which we can
form no probable judgement, without calling to our aid the resources of
critical learning. The more numerous and venerable the documents within
our reach, the more extensive is the view we obtain of the variations (or
VARIOUS READINGS as they are called) that prevail in manuscripts. If the
number of these variations was rightly computed at thirty thousand in
Mill's time, a century and a half ago, they must at present amount to at
least fourfold that quantity.

5. As the New Testament far surpasses all other remains of antiquity in
value and interest, so are the copies of it yet existing in manuscript and
dating from the fourth century of our era downwards, far more numerous
than those of the most celebrated writers of Greece or Rome. Such as have
been already discovered and set down in catalogues are hardly fewer than
three thousand six hundred, and more must still linger unknown in the
monastic libraries of the East. On the other hand, manuscripts of the most
illustrious classic poets and philosophers are far rarer and comparatively
modern. We have no complete copy of Homer himself prior to the thirteenth
century, though some considerable fragments have been recently brought to
light which may plausibly be assigned to the fifth century; while more
than one work of high and deserved repute has been preserved to our times
only in a single copy. Now the experience we gain from a critical
examination of the few classical manuscripts that survive should make us
thankful for the quality and abundance of those of the New Testament.
These last present us with a vast and almost inexhaustible supply of
materials for tracing the history, and upholding (at least within certain
limits) the purity of the sacred text: every copy, if used diligently and
with judgement, will contribute somewhat to these ends. So far is the
copiousness of our stores from causing doubt or perplexity to the genuine
student of Holy Scripture, that it leads him to recognize the more fully
its general integrity in the midst of partial variation. What would the
thoughtful reader of Aeschylus give for the like guidance through the
obscurities which vex his patience, and mar his enjoyment of that sublime
poet?

6. In regard to modern works, it is fortunate that the art of printing has
wellnigh superseded the use of _verbal_ or (as it has been termed)
_Textual_ criticism. When a book once issues from the press, its author's
words are for the most part fixed, beyond all danger of change; graven as
with an iron pen upon the rock for ever. Yet even in modern times, as in
the case of Barrow's posthumous works and Pepys's Diary and Lord
Clarendon's History of the Rebellion, it has been occasionally found
necessary to correct or enlarge the early editions, from the original
autographs, where they have been preserved. The text of some of our older
English writers (Beaumont and Fletcher's plays are a notable instance)
would doubtless have been much improved by the same process, had it been
possible; but the criticism of Shakespeare's dramas is perhaps the most
delicate and difficult problem in the whole history of literature since
that great genius was so strangely contemptuous of the praise of
posterity, that even of the few plays that were published in his lifetime
the text seems but a gathering from the scraps of their respective parts
which had been negligently copied out for the use of the actors.

7. The design of the science of TEXTUAL CRITICISM, as applied to the Greek
New Testament, will now be readily understood. By collecting and comparing
and weighing the variations of the text to which we have access, it aims
at bringing back that text, so far as may be, to the condition in which it
stood in the sacred autographs; at removing all spurious additions, if
such be found in our present printed copies; at restoring whatsoever may
have been lost or corrupted or accidentally changed in the lapse of
eighteen hundred years. We need spend no time in proving the value of such
a science, if it affords us a fair prospect of appreciable results,
resting on grounds of satisfactory evidence. Those who believe the study
of the Scriptures to be alike their duty and privilege, will surely grudge
no pains when called upon to separate the pure gold of God's word from the
dross which has mingled with it through the accretions of so many
centuries. Though the criticism of the sacred volume is inferior to its
right interpretation in point of dignity and practical results, yet it
must take precedence in order of time: for how can we reasonably proceed
to investigate the sense of holy writ, till we have done our utmost to
ascertain its precise language?

8. The importance of the study of Textual criticism is sometimes freely
admitted by those who deem its successful cultivation difficult, or its
conclusions precarious; the rather as Biblical scholars of deserved repute
are constantly putting forth their several recensions of the text,
differing not a little from each other. Now on this point it is right to
speak clearly and decidedly. There is certainly nothing in the nature of
critical science which ought to be thought hard or abstruse, or even
remarkably dry and repulsive. It is conversant with varied, curious, and
interesting researches, which have given a certain serious pleasure to
many intelligent minds; it patiently gathers and arranges those facts of
_external_ evidence on which alone it ventures to construct a revised
text, and applies them according to rules or canons of _internal_
evidence, whether suggested by experience, or resting for their proof on
the plain dictates of common sense. The more industry is brought to these
studies, the greater the store of materials accumulated, so much the more
fruitful and trustworthy the results have usually proved; although beyond
question the true application even of the simplest principles calls for
discretion, keenness of intellect, innate tact ripened by constant use, a
sound and impartial judgement. No man ever attained eminence in this, or
in any other worthy accomplishment, without much labour and some natural
aptitude for the pursuit; but the criticism of the Greek Testament is a
field in whose culture the humblest student may contribute a little that
shall be really serviceable; few branches of theology are able to promise,
even to those who seek but a moderate acquaintance with it, so early and
abundant reward for their pains.

9. Nor can Textual criticism be reasonably disparaged as tending to
precarious conclusions, or helping to unsettle the text of Scripture. Even
putting the matter on the lowest ground, critics have not _created_ the
variations they have discovered in manuscripts or versions. They have only
taught us how to look ascertained phenomena in the face, and try to
account for them; they would fain lead us to estimate the relative value
of various readings, to decide upon their respective worth, and thus at
length to eliminate them. While we confess that much remains to be done in
this department of Biblical learning, we are yet bound to say that,
chiefly by the exertions of scholars of the last and present generations,
the debateable ground is gradually becoming narrower, not a few strong
controversies have been decided beyond the possibility of reversal, and
while new facts are daily coming to light, critics of very opposite
sympathies are learning to agree better as to the right mode of
classifying and applying them. But even were the progress of the science
less hopeful than we believe it to be, one great truth is admitted on all
hands;--the almost complete freedom of Holy Scripture from the bare
suspicion of wilful corruption; the absolute identity of the testimony of
every known copy in respect to doctrine, and spirit, and the main drift of
every argument and every narrative through the entire volume of
Inspiration. On a point of such vital moment I am glad to cite the
well-known and powerful statement of the great Bentley, at once the
profoundest and the most daring of English critics: "The real text of the
sacred writers does not now (since the originals have been so long lost)
lie in any MS. or edition, but is dispersed in them all. 'Tis competently
exact indeed in the worst MS. now extant; nor is one article of faith or
moral precept either perverted or lost in them; choose as awkwardly as you
will, choose the worst by design, out of the whole lump of readings." And
again: "Make your 30,000 [variations] as many more, if numbers of copies
can ever reach that sum: all the better to a knowing and a serious reader,
who is thereby more richly furnished to select what he sees genuine. But
even put them into the hands of a knave or a fool, and yet with the most
sinistrous and absurd choice, he shall not extinguish the light of any one
chapter, nor so disguise Christianity, but that every feature of it will
still be the same(4)." Thus hath God's Providence kept from harm the
treasure of His written word, so far as is needful for the quiet assurance
of His church and people.

10. It is now time for us to afford to the uninitiated reader some general
notion of the nature and extent of the various readings met with in
manuscripts and versions of the Greek Testament. We shall try to reduce
them under a few distinct heads, reserving all formal discussion of their
respective characters and of the authenticity of the texts we cite for the
next volume (Chapter XI).

(1) To begin with variations of the gravest kind. In two, though happily
in only two instances, the genuineness of whole passages of considerable
extent, which are read in our printed copies of the New Testament, has
been brought into question. These are the weighty and characteristic
paragraphs Mark xvi. 9-20 and John vii. 53-viii. 11. We shall hereafter
defend these passages, the first without the slightest misgiving, the
second with certain reservations, as entitled to be regarded authentic
portions of the Gospels in which they stand.

(2) Akin to these omissions are several considerable interpolations,
which, though they have never obtained a place in the printed text, nor
been approved by any critical editor, are supported by authority too
respectable to be set aside without some inquiry. One of the longest and
best attested of these paragraphs has been appended to Matt. xx. 28, and
has been largely borrowed from other passages in the Gospels (see below,
class 9). It appears in several forms, slightly varying from each other,
and is represented as follows in a document as old as the fifth century:


    "But you, seek ye that from little things ye may become great, and
    not from great things may become little. Whenever ye are invited
    to the house of a supper, be not sitting down in the honoured
    place, lest should come he that is more honoured than thou, and to
    thee the Lord of the supper should say, Come near below, and thou
    be ashamed in the eyes of the guests. But if thou sit down in the
    little place, and he that is less than thee should come, and to
    thee the Lord of the supper shall say, Come near, and come up and
    sit down, thou also shalt have more glory in the eyes of the
    guests(5)."


We subjoin another paragraph, inserted after Luke vi. 4 in only a single
copy, the celebrated Codex Bezae, now at Cambridge: "On the same day he
beheld a certain man working on the sabbath, and said unto him, Man,
blessed art thou if thou knowest what thou doest; but if thou knowest not,
thou art cursed and a transgressor of the law.'"

(3) A shorter passage or mere clause, whether inserted or not in our
printed books, may have appeared originally in the form of a marginal
note, and from the margin have crept into the text, through the wrong
judgement or mere oversight of the scribe. Such we have reason to think is
the history of 1 John v. 7, the verse relating to the Three Heavenly
Witnesses, once so earnestly maintained, but now generally given up as
spurious. Thus too Acts viii. 37 may have been derived from some Church
Ordinal: the last clause of Rom. viii. 1 ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}) is perhaps like a gloss on {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~} in
Matt. v. 22(6) and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in 1 Cor. xi. 29 might have been inserted to
modify statements that seemed too strong: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} Gal.
iii. 1 is precisely such an addition as would help to round an abrupt
sentence (compare Gal. v. 7). Some critics would account in this way for
the adoption of the doxology Matt. vi. 13; of the section relating to the
bloody sweat Luke xxii. 43, 44; and of that remarkable verse, John v. 4:
but we may well hesitate before we assent to their views.

(4) Or a genuine clause is lost by means of what is technically called
Homoeoteleuton ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}), when the clause ends in the same word as
closed the preceding sentence, and the transcriber's eye has wandered from
the one to the other, to the entire omission of the whole passage lying
between them. This source of error (though too freely appealed to by Meyer
and some other commentators hardly less eminent than he) is familiar to
all who are engaged in copying writing, and is far more serious than might
be supposed prior to experience. In 1 John ii. 23 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} is omitted in many manuscripts, because {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
had ended the preceding clause: it is not found in our commonly received
Greek text, and even in the Authorized English version is printed in
italics. The whole verse Luke xvii. 36, were it less slenderly supported,
might possibly have been early lost through the same cause, since vv. 34,
35, 36 all end in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}. A safer example is Luke xviii. 39, which a
few copies omit for this reason only. Thus perhaps we might defend in
Matt. x. 23 the addition after {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} being substituted for the
first {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}), the eye having passed from the first {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} to the
second. The same effect is produced, though less frequently, when two or
more sentences _begin_ with the same words, as in Matt. xxiii. 14, 15, 16
(each of which commences with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}), one of the verses being left out
in some manuscripts.

(5) Numerous variations occur in the order of words, the sense being
slightly or not at all affected; on which account this species of various
readings was at first much neglected by collators. Examples abound
everywhere: e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} Luke xi. 36; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} or
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} Acts ix. 12; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
Apoc. iii. 16. The order of the sacred names {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} is perpetually
changed, especially in St. Paul's Epistles.

(6) Sometimes the scribe has mistaken one word for another, which differs
from it only in one or two letters. This happens chiefly in cases when the
_uncial_ or capital letters in which the oldest manuscripts are written
resemble each other, except in some fine stroke which may have decayed
through age. Hence in Mark v. 14 we find {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}; in Luke
xvi. 20 {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}; so we read {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~} indifferently,
as, in the later or _cursive_ character, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} have nearly the same
shape. Akin to these errors of the eye are such transpositions as {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}
for {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}, Mark xiv. 65: omissions or insertions of the same
or similar letters, as {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~} Apoc. xvi. 10: {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}

a similar syllable, as {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~} Luke ix.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~} 1 Pet. iii. 20. It is easy to see how the ancient practice of
writing uncial letters without leaving a space between the words must have
increased the risk of such variations as the foregoing.

(7) Another source of error is described by some critics as proceeding _ex
ore dictantis_, in consequence of the scribe writing from dictation,
without having a copy before him. One is not, however, very willing to
believe that manuscripts of the better class were executed on so slovenly
and careless a plan. It seems more simple to account for the _itacisms_(7)
or confusion of certain vowels and diphthongs having nearly the same
sound, which exist more or less in manuscripts of every age, by assuming
that a vicious pronunciation gradually led to a loose mode of orthography
adapted to it. Certain it is that itacisms are much more plentiful in the
original subscriptions and marginal notes of the writers of mediaeval
books, than in the text which they copied from older documents. Itacisms
prevailed the most extensively from the eighth to the twelfth century, but
not by any means during that period exclusively:--indeed, they are found
frequently in the oldest existing manuscripts. In the most ancient
manuscripts the principal changes are between {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, though
others occur: in later times {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}, even {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} and
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, are used almost promiscuously. Hence it arises that a very large
portion of the various readings brought together by collators are of this
description, and although in the vast majority of instances they serve but
to illustrate the character of the manuscripts which exhibit them, or the
fashion of the age in which they were written, they sometimes affect the
grammatical form (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} Mark iii. 3; Acts iii. 6;
_passim_: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} Phil. i. 30), or the construction (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} Matt. xiii. 15: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} Matt. xv. 5: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} 1 Cor. xiii. 3, compare 1 Pet. iii. 1), or
even the sense (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} Matt. xi. 16: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} or, as
in a few copies, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Mark x. 30: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} or
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} 2 Cor. xii. 1: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} 1 Pet. ii. 3). To this cause we may refer the perpetual
interchange of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, with their oblique cases, throughout the
whole Greek Testament: e.g. in the single epistle of 1 Peter, ch. i. 3;
12; ii. 21 _bis_; iii. 18; 21; v. 10. Hence we must pay the less regard to
the reading {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Luke xvi. 12, though found in two or three of our
chief authorities: in Acts xvii. 28 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, the reading of the
great Codex Vaticanus and a few late copies, is plainly absurd. On the
other hand, a few cases occur wherein that which at first sight seems a
mere _itacism_, when once understood, affords an excellent sense, e.g.
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Mark iii. 19, and may be really the true form.

(8) Introductory clauses or Proper Names are frequently interpolated at
the commencement of Church-lessons ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}), whether from the margin of
ordinary manuscripts of the Greek Testament (where they are usually placed
for the convenience of the reader), or from the Lectionaries or proper
Service Books, especially those of the Gospels (Evangelistaria). Thus in
our English Book of Common Prayer the name of Jesus is introduced into the
Gospels for the 14th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Sundays after Trinity; and
whole clauses into those for the 3rd and 4th Sundays after Easter, and the
6th and 24th after Trinity(8). To this cause may be due the prefix {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} Luke vii. 31; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} Luke x. 22; and
such appellations as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} (after {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~} in 2 Tim. iv.
5) in some copies of the Epistles. The inserted prefix in Greek
Lectionaries is sometimes rather long, as in the lesson for the Liturgy on
Sept. 14 (John xix. 6-35). Hence the frequent interpolation (e.g. Matt.
iv. 18; viii. 5; xiv. 22) or changed position (John i. 44) of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}. A
peculiarity of style in 1, 2 Thess. is kept out of sight by the addition
of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in the common text of 1 Thess. ii. 19; iii. 13: 2 Thess. i. 8,
12.

(9) A more extensive and perplexing species of various readings arises
from bringing into the text of one of the three earlier Evangelists
expressions or whole sentences which of right belong not to him, but to
one or both the others(9). This natural tendency to assimilate the several
Gospels must have been aggravated by the laudable efforts of Biblical
scholars (beginning with Tatian's {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} in the second century) to
construct a satisfactory Harmony of them all. Some of these variations
also may possibly have been mere marginal notes in the first instance. As
examples of this class we will name {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} interpolated from Luke
v. 32 into Mark ii. 17: the prophetic citation Matt. xxvii. 35 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. to the end of the verse, unquestionably borrowed from John xix. 24,
although the fourth Gospel seldom lends itself to corruptions of this
kind. Mark xiii. 14 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}, is probably taken
from Matt. xxiv. 15: Luke v. 38 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} from Matt. ix.
17 (where {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} is the true reading): the whole verse Mark xv. 28
seems spurious, being received from Luke xxii. 37. Even in the same book
we observe an anxiety to harmonize two separate narratives of the same
event, as in Acts ix. 5, 6 compared with xxvi. 14, 15.

(10) In like manner transcribers sometimes quote passages from the Old
Testament more fully than the writers of the New Testament had judged
necessary for their purpose. Thus {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} ... {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}
Matt. xv. 8: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Luke iv. 18: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} Acts vii. 37: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} Rom. xiii. 9; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} Heb. xii. 20, and (less certainly) {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} Heb. ii. 7, are all open to suspicion as being
genuine portions of the Old Testament text, but not also of the New. In
Acts xiii. 33, the Codex Bezae at Cambridge stands almost alone in adding
Ps. ii. 8 to that portion of the previous verse which was unquestionably
cited by St. Paul.

(11) Synonymous words are often interchanged, and so form various
readings, the sense undergoing some slight and refined modification, or
else being quite unaltered. Thus {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} should be preferred to {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Matt.
xxii. 37, where {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} of the common text is supported only by two known
manuscripts, that at Leicester, and one used by Erasmus. So also {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
is put for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Matt. ix. 29 by the Codex Bezae. In Matt. xxv. 16 the
evidence is almost evenly balanced between {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (cf.
ver. 17). Where simple verbs are interchanged with their compounds (e.g.

of the same verb (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Acts xiv. 24; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} with

should be chosen rather than the other, if the _external_ evidence on the
other side does not greatly preponderate. When one of two terms is
employed in a sense peculiar to the New Testament dialect, the easier
synonym may be suspected of having originated in a gloss or marginal
interpretation. Hence _caeteris paribus_ we should adopt {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
rather than {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} in Matt. vi. 1; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} rather than {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
ix. 36; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} rather than {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} xxvii. 4.

(12) An irregular, obscure, or incomplete construction will often be
_explained_ or _supplied_ in the margin by words that are subsequently
brought into the text. Of this character is {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} Mark vii. 2;

ver. 17), and perhaps {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} 1 Tim. vi. 7. More considerable is the change
in Acts viii. 7, where the true reading {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} ... {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~},
if translated with grammatical rigour, affords an almost impossible sense.
Or an elegant Greek idiom may be transformed into simpler language, as in
Acts xvi. 3 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND OXIA AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND OXIA AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}

omitted by many in Luke x. 30; compare also Acts xviii. 26 _fin._; xix. 8,
34 _init._ The classical {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} has often been inserted against the best
evidence: e.g. Acts v. 23: xix. 4, 15; 1 Cor. xii. 20; 2 Cor. iv. 12; Heb.
vi. 16. On the other hand a Hebraism may be softened by transcribers, as
in Matt. xxi. 23, where for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} many copies prefer the easier
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} before {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, and in Matt. xv. 5; Mark
vii. 12 (to which perhaps we may add Luke v. 35), where {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} is dropped in
some copies to facilitate the sense. Hence {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} may be upheld
before {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in Luke ii. 15. This perpetual correction of harsh,
ungrammatical, or Oriental constructions characterizes the printed text of
the Apocalypse and the recent manuscripts on which it is founded (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} ii. 20, for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}).

(13) Hence too arises the habit of changing ancient dialectic forms into
those in vogue in the transcriber's age. The whole subject will be more
fitly discussed at length hereafter (vol. ii. c. x.); we will here merely
note a few peculiarities of this kind adopted by some recent critics from
the oldest manuscripts, but which have gradually though not entirely
disappeared in copies of lower date. Thus in recent critical editions
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} are substituted for {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~},

even before a consonant; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} are preferred

appended to the usual third persons of verbs, even though a consonant
follow. On the other hand the more Attic {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} ought not to be
converted into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in Acts xiv. 8.

(14) Trifling variations in spelling, though very proper to be noted by a
faithful collator, are obviously of little consequence. Such is the choice
between {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~},

To this head may be referred the question whether
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}(10), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~} &c. should have their final vowel elided
or not when the next word begins with a vowel.

(15) A large portion of our various readings arises from the omission or
insertion of such words as cause little appreciable difference in the
sense. To this class belong the pronouns {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, the
particles {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, and the interchange of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, as also of
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~} at the opening of a sentence.

(16) Manuscripts greatly fluctuate in adding and rejecting the Greek
article, and the sense is often seriously influenced by these variations,
though they seem so minute. In Mark ii. 26 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} "in the
time that Abiathar was high priest" would be historically incorrect, while
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} "in the days of Abiathar the high priest" is
suitable enough. The article will often impart vividness and reality to an
expression, where its presence is not indispensable: e.g. Luke xii. 54 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (if {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} be authentic, as looks probable) is the peculiar cloud
spoken of in 1 Kings xviii. 44 as portending rain. Bishop Middleton's
monograph ("Doctrine of the Greek Article applied to the Criticism and
Illustration of the New Testament"), though apparently little known to
certain of our most highly esteemed Biblical scholars, even if its
philological groundwork be thought a little precarious, must always be
regarded as the text-book on this interesting subject, and is a lasting
monument of intellectual acuteness and exact learning.

(17) Not a few various readings may be imputed to the peculiarities of the
style of writing adopted in the oldest manuscripts. Thus
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} Acts xvii. 26 may be divided into two words or
three; {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~} ibid. ver. 25, by a slight change, has degenerated into
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}. The habitual abridgement of such words as {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
sometimes leads to a corruption of the text. Hence possibly comes the
grave variation {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} for _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_ 1 Tim. iii. 16, and the singular reading {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} Rom. xii. 11, where the true word {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} was first
shortened into _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}_(11), and then read as {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~} being employed to
indicate {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~} in very early times(12). Or a large initial letter, which the
scribe usually reserved for a subsequent review, may have been altogether
neglected: whence we have {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} for {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} before {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~} Matt. vii. 14. Or
overscores, placed over a letter (especially at the end of a line and
word) to denote {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, may have been lost sight of; e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} Matt.
xxvii. 60 in several copies, for {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~} [with a line over the final {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}]. The
use of the symbol [symbol composed of Pi and Rho together], which in the
Herculanean rolls and now and then in Codex Sinaiticus stands for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} and
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} indifferently, may have produced that remarkable confusion of the two
prepositions when compounded with verbs which we notice in Matt. xxvi. 39;
Mark xiv. 35; Acts xii. 6; xvii. 5, 26; xx. 5, 13; xxii. 25. It will be
seen hereafter that as the earliest manuscripts have few marks of
punctuation, breathing or accent, these points (often far from
indifferent) must be left in a great measure to an editor's taste and
judgement.

(18) Slips of the pen, whereby words are manifestly lost or repeated,
mis-spelt or half-finished, though of no interest to the critic, must yet
be noted by a faithful collator, as they will occasionally throw light on
the history of some particular copy in connexion with others, and always
indicate the degree of care or skill employed by the scribe, and
consequently the weight due to his general testimony.

The great mass of various readings we have hitherto attempted to classify
(to our _first_ and _second_ heads we will recur presently) are manifestly
due to mere inadvertence or human frailty, and certainly cannot be imputed
to any deliberate intention of transcribers to tamper with the text of
Scripture. We must give a different account of a few passages (we are glad
they are only a few) which yet remain to be noticed.

(19) The copyist may be tempted to forsake his proper function for that of
a reviser, or critical corrector. He may simply omit what he does not
understand (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} Luke vi. 1; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} 1 Tim. ii. 6), or
may attempt to get over a difficulty by inversions and other changes. Thus
the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} spoken of by St. Paul 1 Cor. xv. 51, which rightly stands in
the received text {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, was
easily varied into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., as if in mere
perplexity. From this source must arise the omission in a few manuscripts
of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} in Matt. xxiii. 35; of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} in Matt. xxvii. 9; the
insertion of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} before {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} in Apoc. xvi. 7; perhaps the
substitution of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} for {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} in Mark i. 2, of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} in John vii. 8, and certainly of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}
in John xix. 14. The variations between {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Matt.
viii. 28, and between {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} John i. 28, have been
attributed, we hope and believe unjustly, to the misplaced conjectures of
Origen.

Some would impute such readings as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Rom. v. 1; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} 1 Cor. xv. 49, to a desire on the part of copyists to
_improve_ an assertion into an ethical exhortation, especially in the
Apostolical Epistles; but it is at once safer and more simple to regard
them with Bishop Chr. Wordsworth (N. T. 1 Cor. xv. 49) as instances of
_itacism_: see class (7) above.

(20) Finally, whatever conclusion we arrive at respecting the true reading
in the following passages, the discrepancy could hardly have arisen except
from doctrinal preconceptions. Matt. xix. 17 {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}? {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}

common editions is supported by almost no evidence whatever.

11. It is very possible that some scattered readings cannot be reduced to
any of the above-named classes, but enough has been said to afford the
student a general notion of the nature and extent of the subject(13). It
may be reasonably thought that a portion of these variations, and those
among the most considerable, had their origin in a cause which must have
operated at least as much in ancient as in modern times, the changes
gradually introduced after publication by the authors themselves into the
various copies yet within their reach. Such revised copies would circulate
independently of those issued previously, and now beyond the writer's
control; and thus becoming the parents of a new family of copies, would
originate and keep up diversities from the first edition, without any
fault on the part of transcribers(14). It is thus perhaps we may best
account for the omission or insertion of whole paragraphs or verses in
manuscripts of a certain class [see above (1), (2), (3)]; or, in cases
where the work was in much request, for those minute touches and trifling
improvements in words, in construction, in tone, or in the mere colouring
of the style [(5), (11), (12)], which few authors can help attempting,
when engaged on revising their favourite compositions. Even in the Old
Testament, the song of David in 2 Sam. xxii is evidently an early draft of
the more finished composition, Ps. xviii. Traces of the writer's _curae
secundae_ may possibly be found in John v. 3, 4; vii. 53-viii. 11; xiii.
26; Acts xx. 4, 15; xxiv. 6-8. To this list some critics feel disposed to
add portions of Luke xxi-xxiv.

12. The fullest critical edition of the Greek Testament hitherto published
contains but a comparatively small portion of the whole mass of variations
already known; as a rule, the editors neglect, and rightly neglect, mere
errors of transcription. Such things must be recorded for several reasons,
but neither they, nor real various readings that are slenderly supported,
can produce any effect in the task of amending or restoring the sacred
text. Those who wish to see for themselves how far the common printed
editions of what is called the "textus receptus" differ from the judgement
of the most recent critics, may refer if they please to the small Greek
Testament published in the series of "Cambridge Greek and Latin
Texts(15)," which exhibits in a thicker type all words and clauses wherein
Robert Stephen's edition of 1550 (which is taken as a convenient standard)
differs from the other chief modifications of the _textus receptus_ (viz.
Beza's 1565 and Elzevir's 1624), as also from the revised texts of
Lachmann 1842-50, of Tischendorf 1865-72, of Tregelles 1857-72, of the
Revisers of the English New Testament (1881), and of Westcott and Hort
(1881). The student will thus be enabled to estimate for himself the
limits within which the text of the Greek Testament may be regarded as
still open to discussion, and to take a general survey of the questions on
which the theologian is bound to form an intelligent opinion.

13. The work that lies before us naturally divides itself into three
distinct parts.

I. A description of the sources from which various readings are derived
(or of their EXTERNAL EVIDENCE), comprising:

(_a_) Manuscripts of the Greek New Testament or of portions thereof.

(_b_) Ancient versions of the New Testament in various languages.

(_c_) Citations from the Greek Testament or its versions made by early
ecclesiastical writers, especially by the Fathers of the Christian Church.

(_d_) Early printed or later critical editions of the Greek Testament.

II. A discussion of the principles on which external evidence should be
applied to the recension of the sacred volume, embracing

(_a_) The laws of INTERNAL EVIDENCE, and the limits of their legitimate
use.

(_b_) The history of the text and of the principal schemes which have been
proposed for restoring it to its primitive state, including recent views
of Comparative Criticism.

(_c_) Considerations derived from the peculiar character and grammatical
form of the dialect of the Greek Testament.

III. The application of the foregoing materials and principles to the
investigation of the true reading in the chief passages of the New
Testament, on which authorities are at variance.

In this edition, as has already been explained in the preface, it has been
found necessary to divide the treatise into two volumes, which will
contain respectively--

I. First Volume:--Ancient Manuscripts.

II. Second Volume:--Versions, Citations, Editions, Principles, and Selected
Passages.

It will be found desirable to read the following pages in the order
wherein they stand, although the chief part of Chapters VII-XIV of the
first volume and some portions elsewhere (indicated by being printed like
them in smaller type) are obviously intended chiefly for reference, or for
less searching examination.





CHAPTER II. GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE GREEK MANUSCRIPTS OF THE NEW
TESTAMENT.


As the extant Greek manuscripts of the New Testament supply both the most
copious and the purest sources of Textual Criticism, we propose to present
to the reader some account of their peculiarities in regard to material,
form, style of writing, date and contents, before we enter into details
respecting individual copies, under the several subdivisions to which it
is usual to refer them.

1. The subject of the present section has been systematically discussed in
the "Palaeographia Graeca" (Paris, 1708, folio) of Bernard de Montfaucon
[1655-1741(16)], the most illustrious member of the learned Society of the
Benedictines of St. Maur. This truly great work, although its materials
are rather too exclusively drawn from manuscripts deposited in French
libraries, and its many illustrative facsimiles are somewhat rudely
engraved, still maintains a high authority on all points relating to Greek
manuscripts, even after more recent discoveries, especially among the
papyri of Egypt and Herculaneum, have necessarily modified not a few of
its statements. The four splendid volumes of M. J. B. Silvestre's
"Paleographie Universelle" (Paris, 1839-41, &c. folio) afford us no less
than 300 plates of the Greek writing of various ages, sumptuously
executed; though the accompanying letter-press descriptions, by F. and A.
Champollion Fils, seem in this branch of the subject a little
disappointing; nor are the valuable notes appended to his translation of
their work by Sir Frederick Madden (London, 2 vols. 1850, 8vo)
sufficiently numerous or elaborate to supply the Champollions' defects.
Much, however, may also be learnt from the "Herculanensium voluminum quae
supersunt" (Naples, 10 tom. 1793-1850, fol.); from Mr. Babington's three
volumes of papyrus fragments of Hyperides, respectively published in 1850,
1853 and 1858; and especially from the Prolegomena to Tischendorf's
editions of the Codices Ephraemi (1843), Friderico-Augustanus (1846),
Claromontanus (1852), Sinaiticus (1862), Vaticanus (1867), and those other
like publications (e.g. Monumenta sacra inedita 1846-1870, and Anecdota
sacra et profana 1855) which have rendered his name perhaps the very
highest among scholars in this department of sacred literature. What I
have been able to add from my own observation, has been gathered from the
study of Biblical manuscripts now in England. To these sources of
information may now be added Professor Wattenbach's "Anleitung zur
griechischen Palaeographie" second edition, Leipsic, 1877, Gardthausen's
"Griechische Palaeographie," Leipsic, 1879; Dr. C. R. Gregory's
"Prolegomena" to the eighth edition of Tischendorf, and especially the
publication of "The Palaeographical Society Greek Testament," Parts I and
II, Leipsic, 1884, 1891, "Facsimiles of Manuscripts and Inscriptions"
edited by E. A. Bond and E. M. Thompson, Parts I-XII, London, 1873-82, and
a Manual on "Greek and Latin Palaeography" from the hands of Mr. E. Maunde
Thompson, of which the proof-sheets have been most kindly placed by the
accomplished author at the disposal of the editor of this work, and have
furnished to this chapter many elements of enrichment. It may be added,
that since manuscripts have been photographed, all other facsimiles have
been put in the shade: and in this edition references as a rule will be
given only to photographed copies.

2. The _materials_ on which writing has been impressed at different
periods and stages of civilization are the following:--Leaves, bark,
especially of the lime (_liber_), linen, clay and pottery, wall-spaces,
metals, lead, bronze, wood, waxen and other tablets, papyrus, skins,
parchment and vellum, and from an early date amongst the Chinese, and in
the West after the capture of Samarcand by the Arabs in A.D. 704, paper
manufactured from fibrous substances(17). The most ancient manuscripts of
the New Testament now existing are composed of vellum or parchment
(_membrana_), the term vellum being strictly applied to the delicate skins
of very young calves, and parchment to the integuments of sheep and goats,
though the terms are as a rule employed convertibly. The word parchment
seems to be a corruption of _charta pergamena_, a name first given to
skins prepared by some improved process for Eumenes, king of Pergamum,
about B.C. 150. In judging of the date of a manuscript on skins, attention
must be paid to the quality of the material, the oldest being almost
invariably written on the thinnest and whitest vellum that could be
procured; while manuscripts of later ages, being usually composed of
parchment, are thick, discoloured, and coarsely grained. Thus the Codex
Sinaiticus of the fourth century is made of the finest skins of antelopes,
the leaves being so large, that a single animal would furnish only two
(Tischendorf, Cod. Frid.-August. Prolegomena, . 1). Its contemporary, the
far-famed Codex Vaticanus, challenges universal admiration for the beauty
of its vellum: every visitor at the British Museum can observe the
excellence of that of the Codex Alexandrinus of the fifth century: that of
the Codex Claromontanus of the sixth century is even more remarkable: the
material of those purple-dyed fragments of the Gospels which Tischendorf
denominates N, also of the sixth century, is so subtle and delicate, that
some persons have mistaken the leaves preserved in England (Brit. Mus.
Cotton, Titus C xv) for Egyptian papyrus. Paper made of cotton(18)
(_charta bombycina_, called also _charta Damascena_ from its place of
manufacture) may have been fabricated in the ninth(19) or tenth century,
and linen paper (_charta_ proper) as early as 1242 A.D.; but they were
seldom used for Biblical manuscripts sooner than the thirteenth, and had
not entirely displaced parchment at the era of the invention of printing,
about A.D. 1450. Lost portions of parchment or vellum manuscripts are
often supplied in paper by some later hand; but the Codex Leicestrensis of
the fourteenth century is composed of a mixture of inferior vellum and
worse paper, regularly arranged in the proportion of two parchment to
three paper leaves, recurring alternately throughout the whole volume.
Like it, in the mixture of parchment and paper, are codd. 233 and Brit.
Mus. Harl. 3,161--the latter however not being a New Testament MS.

3. Although parchment was in occasional, if not familiar, use at the
period when the New Testament was written ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} 2 Tim. iv. 13), yet the more perishable papyrus of Egypt was
chiefly employed for ordinary purposes. This vegetable production had been
used for literary purposes from the earliest times. "Papyrus rolls are
represented on the sculptured walls of Egyptian temples." The oldest roll
now extant is the papyrus Prisse at Paris, which dates from 2500 B.C., or
even earlier, unless those which have been lately discovered by Mr.
Flinders Petrie reach as far, or even farther, back(20). The ordinary name
applied in Greek to this material was {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} (2 John 12), though Herodotus
terms it {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} (ii. 100, v. 58), and in Latin _charta_ (2 Esdr. xv. 2;
Tobit vii. 14--Old Latin Version). Papyrus was in those days esteemed more
highly than skins: for Herodotus expressly states that the Ionians had
been compelled to have recourse to goats and sheep for lack of byblus or
papyrus; and Eumenes was driven to prepare parchment because the
Alexandrians were too jealous to supply him with the material which he
coveted(21). Indeed, papyrus was used far beyond the borders of Egypt, and
was plentiful in Rome under the Empire, being in fact the common material
among the Romans during that period: and as many of the manuscripts of the
New Testament must have been written upon so perishable a substance in the
earliest centuries since the Christian era, this probably is one of the
reasons why we possess no considerable copies from before the second
quarter of the fourth century. Only a few fragments of the New Testament
on papyrus remain. We find a minute, if not a very clear description of
the mode of preparing the papyrus for the scribe in the works of the elder
Pliny (Hist. Nat. xiii. 11, 12). The plant grew in Egypt, also in Syria,
and on the Niger and the Euphrates. Mainly under Christian influence it
was supplanted by parchment and vellum, which had superior claims to
durability, and its manufacture ceased altogether on the conquest of Egypt
by the Mohammedans (A.D. 638).

4. Parchment is said to have been introduced at Rome not long after its
employment by Attalus. Nevertheless, if it had been in constant and
ordinary use under the first Emperors, we can hardly suppose that
specimens of secular writing would have failed to come down to us. Its
increased growth and prevalence about synchronize with the rise of
Constantinopolitan influence. It may readily be imagined that vellum
(especially that fine sort by praiseworthy custom required for copies of
Holy Scripture) could never have been otherwise than scarce and dear.
Hence arose, at a very early period of the Christian era, the practice and
almost the necessity of erasing ancient writing from skins, in order to
make room for works in which the living generation felt more interest,
especially when clean vellum failed the scribe towards the end of his
task. This process of destruction, however, was seldom so fully carried
out, but that the strokes of the elder hand might still be traced, more or
less completely, under the more modern writing. Such manuscripts are
called _codices rescripti_ or palimpsests ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}(22)), and several of
the most precious monuments of sacred learning are of this description.
The Codex Ephraemi at Paris contains large fragments both of the Old and
New Testament under the later Greek works of St. Ephraem the Syrian: and
the Codex Nitriensis, more recently disinterred from a monastery in the
Egyptian desert and brought to the British Museum, comprises a portion of
St. Luke's Gospel, nearly obliterated, and covered over by a Syriac
treatise of Severus of Antioch against Grammaticus, comparatively of no
value whatever. It will be easily believed that the collating or
transcribing of palimpsests has cost much toil and patience to those whose
loving zeal has led them to the attempt: and after all the true readings
will be sometimes (not often) rather uncertain, even though chemical
mixtures (of which "the most harmless is probably hydrosulphuret of
ammonia") have recently been applied with much success to restore the
faded lines and letters of these venerable records.

5. We need say but little of a practice which St. Jerome(23) and others
speak of as prevalent towards the end of the fourth century, that of
dyeing the vellum purple, and of stamping rather than writing the letters
in silver and gold. The Cotton fragment of the Gospels, mentioned above
(p. 23), is one of the few remaining copies of this kind, as are the newly
discovered Codex Rossanensis and the Codex Beratinus, and it is not
unlikely that the great Dublin palimpsest of St. Matthew owes its present
wretched discoloration to some such dye. But, as Davidson sensibly
observes, "the value of a manuscript does not depend on such things"
(Biblical Criticism, vol. ii. p. 264). We care for them only as they serve
to indicate the reverence paid to the Scriptures by men of old. The style,
however, of the pictures, illustrations, arabesques and initial ornaments
that prevail in later copies from the eighth century downwards, whose
colours and gilding are sometimes as fresh and bright as if laid on but
yesterday(24), will not only interest the student by tending to throw
light on mediaeval art and habits and modes of thought, but will often fix
the date of the books which contain them with a precision otherwise quite
beyond our reach.

6. The ink found upon ancient manuscripts is of various colours(25). Black
ink, the ordinary writing fluid of centuries ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, _atramentum_, &c.)
differs in tint at various periods and in different countries. In early
MSS. it is either pure black or slightly brown; in the Middle Ages it
varies a good deal according to age and locality. In Italy and Southern
Europe it is generally blacker than in the North, in France and Flanders
it is generally darker than in England; a Spanish MS. of the fourteenth or
fifteenth century may usually be recognized by the peculiar blackness of
the ink. Deterioration is observable in the course of time. The ink of the
fifteenth century particularly is often of a faded grey colour. Inks of
green, yellow, and other colours, are also found, but generally only for
ornamental purposes. Red, either in the form of a pigment or fluid ink, is
of very ancient and common use, being seen even in early Egyptian papyri.
Gold was also used as a writing fluid at a very early period.
Purple-stained vellum MSS. were usually written upon in gold or silver
letters, and ordinary white vellum MSS. were also written in gold,
particularly in the ninth and tenth centuries, in the reigns of the
Carlovingian kings. Gold writing _as a practice_ died out in the
thirteenth century: and writing in silver appears to have ceased
contemporaneously with the disuse of stained vellum. The ancients used the
liquid of cuttle-fish. Pliny mentions soot and gum as the ingredients of
writing-ink. Other later authors add gall-apples: metallic infusions at an
early period, and vitriol in the Middle Ages were also employed.

7. While papyrus remained in common use, the chief instrument employed was
a reed ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} 3 John ver. 13, _canna_), such as are common in the East
at present: a few existing manuscripts (e.g. the Codd. Leicestrensis and
Lambeth 1350) appear to have been thus written. Yet the firmness and
regularity of the strokes, which often remain impressed on the vellum or
paper after the ink has utterly gone, seem to prove that in the great
majority of cases the _stilus_ made of iron, bronze, or other metal, or
ivory or bone, sharp at one end to scratch the letters, and furnished with
a knob or flat head at the other for purposes of erasure, had not gone
wholly out of use. We must add to our list of Writing materials a bodkin
or needle (_acus_), by means of which and a ruler the blank leaf was
carefully divided, generally on the outer side of the skin, into columns
and lines, whose regularity much enhances the beauty of our best copies.
The vestiges of such points and marks may yet be seen deeply indented on
the surface of nearly all manuscripts, those on one side of each leaf
being usually sufficiently visible to guide the scribe when he came to
write on the reverse. The quill pen probably came into use with vellum,
for which it is obviously suited. The first notices of it occur in a story
respecting Theodoric the Ostrogoth, and in a passage of Isidore's
"Origines"(26) (vi. 13).

8. Little need be said respecting the _form_ of manuscripts, which in this
particular (_codices_) much resemble printed books. A few are in large
folio; the greater part in small folio or quarto, the prevailing shape
being a quarto (_quaternio_ or quire) whose height but little exceeds its
breadth; some are in octavo, a not inconsiderable number smaller still:
and quires of three sheets or six leaves, and five sheets or ten leaves
(Cod. Vaticanus), are to be met with. In some copies the sheets have marks
in the lower margin of their first or last pages, like the _signatures_ of
a modern volume, the folio at intervals of two, the quarto at intervals of
four leaves, as in the Codex Bezae of the Gospels and Acts (D), and the
Codex Augiensis of St. Paul's Epistles (F). Not to speak at present of
those manuscripts which have a Latin translation in a column parallel to
the Greek, as the Codex Bezae, the Codex Laudianus of the Acts, and the
Codices Claromontanus and Augiensis of St. Paul, many copies of every age
have two Greek columns on each page; of these the Codex Alexandrinus is
the oldest: the Codex Vaticanus has three columns on a page, the Codex
Sinaiticus four. The unique arrangement(27) of these last two has been
urged as an argument for their higher antiquity, as if they were designed
to imitate _rolled_ books, whose several skins or leaves were fastened
together lengthwise, so that their contents always appeared in parallel
columns; they were kept in scrolls which were unrolled at one end for
reading, and when read rolled up at the other. This fashion prevails in
the papyrus fragments yet remaining, and in the most venerated copies of
the Old Testament preserved in Jewish synagogues.

9. We now approach a more important question, the _style_ of writing
adopted in manuscripts, and the shapes of the several letters. These
varied widely in different ages, and form the simplest and surest criteria
for approximating to the date of the documents themselves. Greek
characters are properly divided into "majuscules" and "minuscules," or by
a subdivision of the former, into Capitals, which are generally of a
square kind, fitted for inscriptions on stones like {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}; Uncials, or large
letters(28), and a modification of Capitals, with a free introduction of
curves, and better suited for writing, like {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}; and Cursives, or small
letters, adapted for the running hand. _Uncial_ manuscripts were written
in what have frequently been regarded as capital letters, formed
separately, having no connexion with each other, and (in the earlier
specimens) without any space between the words, the marks of punctuation
being few: the _cursive_ or running hand comprising letters more easily
and rapidly made, those in the same word being usually joined together,
with a complete system of punctuation not widely removed from that of
printed books. Speaking generally, and limiting our statement to Greek
manuscripts of the New Testament, Uncial letters or the Literary or
Book-hand prevailed from the fourth to the tenth, or (in the case of
liturgical books) as late as the eleventh century; Cursive letters were
employed as early as the ninth or tenth century, and continued in use
until the invention of printing superseded the humble labours of the
scribe. But cursive writing existed before the Christian era: and it seems
impossible to suppose that so very convenient a form of penmanship could
have fallen into abeyance in ordinary life, although few documents have
come down to us to demonstrate the truth of this supposition.

Besides the broad and palpable distinction between uncial and cursive
letters, persons who have had much experience in the study of manuscripts
are able to distinguish those of either class from one another in respect
of style and character; so that the period at which each was written can
be determined within certain inconsiderable limits. After the tenth
century many manuscripts bear dates, and such become standards to which we
can refer others resembling them which are undated. But since the earliest
dated Biblical manuscript yet discovered (Cursive Evan. 481, see below
Chap. VII) bears the date May 7, A.D. 835, we must resort to other means
for estimating the age of more venerable, and therefore more important,
copies. By studying the style and shape of the letters on Greek
inscriptions, Montfaucon was led to conclude that the more simple,
upright, and regular the form of uncial letters; the less flourish or
ornament they exhibit; the nearer their breadth is equal to their height;
so much the more ancient they ought to be considered. These results have
been signally confirmed by the subsequent discovery of Greek papyri in
Egyptian tombs especially in the third century before the Christian era;
and yet further from numerous fragments of Philodemus, of Epicurus, and
other philosophers, which were buried in the ruins of Herculaneum in A.D.
79 ("Fragmenta Herculanensia," Walter Scott). The evidence of these
papyri, indeed, is even more weighty than that of inscriptions, inasmuch
as workers in stone, as has been remarked, were often compelled to prefer
straight lines, as better adapted to the hardness of their material, where
writings on papyrus or vellum would naturally flow into curves.

10. While we freely grant that a certain tact, the fruit of study and
minute observation, can alone make us capable of forming a trustworthy
opinion on the age of manuscripts; it is worth while to point out the
_principles_ on which a true judgement must be grounded, and to submit to
the reader a few leading facts, which his own research may hereafter
enable him to apply and to extend.

The first three plates at the beginning of this volume represent the Greek
alphabet, as found in the seven following monuments:

(1) The celebrated Rosetta stone, discovered near that place during the
French occupation of Egypt in 1799, and now in the British Museum. This
most important inscription, which in the hands of Young and Champollion
has proved the key to the mysteries of Egyptian hieroglyphics, records
events of no intrinsic consequence that occurred B.C. 196, in the reign of
Ptolemy V Epiphanes. It is written in the three several forms of
hieroglyphics, of the demotic or common characters of the country, and of
Greek Capitals, which last may represent the _lapidary_ style of the
second century before our era. The words are undivided, without
breathings, accents, or marks of punctuation, and the uncial letters
(excepting [symbol like capital Roman I] for _zeta_) approach very nearly
to our modern capital type. In shape they are simple, perhaps a little
rude; rather square than oblong: and as the carver on this hard black
stone was obliged to avoid curve lines whenever he could, the forms of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~},
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} differ considerably from the specimens we shall produce from
documents described on soft materials. Plate I. No. (1).

(2) The Codex Friderico-Augustanus of the fourth century, published in
lithographed facsimile in 1846, contains on forty-three leaves fragments
of the Septuagint version, chiefly from 1 Chronicles and Jeremiah, with
Nehemiah and Esther complete, in oblong folio, with four columns on each
page. The plates are so carefully executed that the very form of the
ancient letters and the colour of the ink are represented to us by
Tischendorf, who discovered it in the East. In 1859 the same indefatigable
scholar brought to Europe the remainder of this manuscript, which seems as
old as the fourth century, anterior (as he thinks) to the Codex Vaticanus
itself, and published it in 1862, in facsimile type cast for the purpose,
4 tom., with twenty pages lithographed or photographed, at the expense of
the Emperor Alexander II of Russia, to whom the original had been
presented. This book, which Tischendorf calls Codex Sinaiticus, contains,
besides much more of the Septuagint, _the whole New Testament_ with
Barnabas' Epistle and a part of Hermas' Shepherd annexed. As a kind of
_avant-courier_ to his great work he had previously put forth a tract
entitled "Notitia Editionis Codicis Bibliorum Sinaitici Auspiciis
Imperatoris Alexandri II susceptae" (Leipsic, 1860). Of this most valuable
manuscript a complete account will be given in the opening of the fourth
chapter, under the appellation of _Aleph_ ({~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}), assigned to it by
Tischendorf, in the exercise of his right as its discoverer. Plate I. No.

The leading features of these manuscripts will be described in the fourth
and fifth chapters. At present we wish to compare them with each other for
the purpose of tracing, as closely as we may, the different styles and
fashions of uncial letters which prevailed from the fourth to the tenth or
eleventh century of the Christian era. The varying appearance of cursive
manuscripts cannot so well be seen by exhibiting their alphabets, for
since each letter is for the most part joined to the others in the same
word, _connected_ passages alone will afford us a correct notion of their
character and general features. For the moment we are considering the
uncials only.

If the Rosetta stone, by its necessary avoiding of curve lines, gives only
a notion of the manner adopted on stone and not in common writing, it
resembles our earliest uncials at least in one respect, that the letters,
being as broad as they are high, are all capable of being included within
circumscribed squares. Indeed, yet earlier inscriptions are found almost
totally destitute of curves, even {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~} being represented by simple
squares, with or without a bisecting horizontal line (see _theta_, p.
35)(29). The Herculanean papyri, however (a specimen of which we have
given in Plate iv. No. 10), are much better suited than inscriptions can
be for comparison with our earliest copies of Scripture(30). Nothing can
well be conceived more elegant than these simply-formed graceful little
letters (somewhat diminished in size perhaps by the effects of heat)
running across the volume, thirty-nine lines in a column, without capitals
or breaks between the words. There are scarcely any stops, no breathings,
accents, or marks of any kind; only that >, < or [right-pointing triangle]
are now and then found at the end of a line, to fill up the space, or to
join a word or syllable with what follows. A very few abbreviations occur,
such as [symbol like Pi with Rho] in the first line of our specimen, taken
from Philodemus {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (Hercul. Volum. Tom. iii. Col. xx. ll. 6-15),
the very manuscript to which Tischendorf compared his Cod.
Friderico-Augustanus (Proleg.  11). The papyri, buried for so many ages
from A.D. 79 downwards, may probably be a century older still, since
Philodemus the Epicurean was the contemporary and almost the friend of
Cicero(31). Hence from three to four hundred years must have elapsed
betwixt the date of the Herculanean rolls and that of our earliest
Biblical manuscripts. Yet the fashion of writing changed but little during
the interval, far less in every respect than in the four centuries which
next followed, wherein the plain, firm, upright and square uncials were
giving place to the compressed, oblong, ornamented, or even sloping forms
which predominate from the seventh or eighth century downwards. While
advising the reader to exercise his skill on facsimiles of _entire
passages_, especially in contrasting the lines from Philodemus (No. 10)
with those from the oldest uncials of the New Testament (Nos. 11-14; 17;
18; 20; 24); we purpose to examine the several alphabets (Nos. 1-7) letter
by letter, pointing out to the student those variations in shape which
palaeographers have judged the safest criteria of their relative ages.
_Alpha_, _delta_, _theta_, _xi_, _pi_, _omega_, are among the best tests
for this purpose.


    _Alpha_ is not often found in its present familiar shape, except
    in inscriptions, where the cross line is sometimes broken into an
    angle with the vertex downwards ([Symbol]). Even on the Rosetta
    stone the left limb leans against the upper part of the right
    limb, but does not form an angle with its extremity, while the
    cross line, springing not far from the bottom of the left limb,
    _ascends_ to meet the right about half way down. Modifications of
    this form may be seen in the Herculanean rolls, only that the
    cross line more nearly approaches the horizontal, and sometimes is
    almost entirely so. The Cod. Frid.-August.(32) does not vary much
    from this form, but the three generating lines are often somewhat
    curved. In other books, while the right limb is quite straight,
    the left and cross line form a kind of loop or curve, as is very
    observable in the Nitrian fragment R, and often in Codd. Alex.,
    Ephraemi, Bezae, the newly discovered Rossanensis, and in the
    Vatican more frequently still, in all which _alpha_ often
    approximates to the shape of our English _a_. _And this curve may
    be regarded as a proof of antiquity_; indeed Tischendorf (Proleg.
    Cod. Sin. p. xxx, 1863) considers it almost peculiar to the papyri
    and the Coptic character. Cod. N (which is more recent than those
    named above) makes the two lines on the left form a sharp angle,
    as do the Cotton fragment of Genesis (see p. 32, note 1) and Cod.
    Claromontanus, Plate xiv. No. 41, only that the lines which
    contain the angle in this last are very fine. In later times, as
    the letters grew tall and narrow, the modern type of A became more
    marked, as in the first letter of Arundel 547 (No. 16), of about
    the tenth century, though the form and thickness seen in the Cod.
    Claromontanus continued much in vogue to the last. Yet _alpha_
    even in Cod. Claromontanus and Cotton Genesis occasionally passes
    from the angle into the loop, though not so often as in Cod. A and
    its companions. Cod. Borgianus (T), early in the fifth century,
    exaggerated this loop into a large ellipse, if Giorgi's facsimile
    may be trusted. In Cod. Laudianus E of the Acts and Cureton's
    palimpsest Homer too the loop is very decided, the Greek and Latin
    _a_ in Laud. (No. 25) being alike. Mark also its form in the
    papyrus scrawl No. 9 (from one of the orations of Hyperides edited
    by Mr. Babington), which _may_ be as old as the Rosetta stone. The
    angular shape adopted in Cod. Z (Nos. 6, 18) is unsightly enough,
    and (I believe) unique.

    _Beta_ varies less than _Alpha_. Originally it consisted of a tall
    perpendicular line, on the right side of which four straight lines
    are so placed as to form two triangles, whereof the vertical line
    comprises the bases, while a small portion of that vertical line
    entirely separates the triangles ([Symbol]). This ungraceful
    figure was modified very early, even in inscriptions. On the
    Rosetta stone (No. 1) the triangles are rounded off into
    semicircles, and the lower end of the vertical curved. Yet the
    shape in manuscripts is not quite so elegant. The lower curve is
    usually the larger, and the curves rarely touch each other. Such
    are Codd. ANRZ, Rossanensis (sometimes), and the Cotton Genesis.
    In the Herculanean rolls the letter comes near the common cursive
    {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}; in some others (as Cod. Rossanensis at times) its shape is
    quite like the modern {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}. When oblong letters became common, the
    top (e.g. in Cod. Bezae) and bottom extremities of the curve ran
    into straight lines, by way of return into the primitive shape
    (see No. 36, _dated_ A.D. 980). In the very early papyrus fragment
    of Hyperides it looks like the English R standing on a base (No.
    9, l. 4). But this specimen rather belongs to the semi-cursive
    hand of common life, than to that of books.

    _Gamma_ in its simplest form consists of two lines of equal
    thickness, the shorter so placed upon the longer, which is
    vertical, as to make one right angle with it on the right side.
    Thus we find it in the Rosetta stone, the papyrus of Hyperides,
    the Herculanean rolls, and very often in Cod. A. The next step was
    to make the horizontal line very thin, and to strengthen its
    extremity by a point, or knob, as in Codd. Ephraemi (No. 24), RZ:
    or the point was thus strengthened without thinning the line, e.g.
    Codd. Vatican., Rossanensis, N and most later copies, such as
    Harl. 5598 (No. 7) or its contemporary Parham 18 (No. 36). In Cod.
    Bezae (No. 42) _gamma_ much resembles the Latin r.

    _Delta_ should be closely scrutinized. Its most ancient shape is
    an equilateral triangle, the sides being all of the same thickness
    ([symbol]). Cod. Claromontanus, though of the sixth century, is in
    this instance as simple as any: the Herculanean rolls, Codd.
    Vatican., Sinait., and the very old copy of the Pentateuch at
    Paris (Colbert) or "Cod. Sarravianus" and Leyden, much resemble
    it, only that sometimes the Herculanean sides are slightly curved,
    and the right descending stroke of Cod. Vatican, is thickened. In
    Cod. A begins a tendency to prolong the base on one or both sides,
    and to strengthen one or both ends by points. We see a little more
    of this in Cod. Rossanensis and in the palimpsest Homer of the
    fifth century, published by Cureton. The habit increases and
    gradually becomes confirmed in Codd. Ephraemi (No. 24), the
    Vatican Dio Cassius of the fifth or sixth century, in Cod. R, and
    particularly in N and E of the Acts (Nos. 4, 14, 25). In the
    oblong later uncials it becomes quite elaborate, e.g. Cod. B of
    the Apocalypse, or Nos. 7, 21, 36. On the Rosetta stone and in the
    Cod. Bezae the right side is produced beyond the triangle, and is
    produced and slightly curved in Hyperides, curved and strongly
    pointed in Cod. Z.

    _Epsilon_ has its angular form on the Rosetta marble and other
    inscriptions in stone; in the oldest manuscripts it consists as an
    uncial of a semicircle, from whose centre to the right of it a
    horizontal radius is drawn to the concave circumference. Thus it
    appears in the Herculanean rolls (only that here the radius is
    usually broken off before it meets the circle), in Codd.
    Frid-August., Vatican., the two Paris Pentateuchs (Colbert-Leyden
    fifth century, Coislin. sixth) and the Cotton Genesis. In Cod.
    Alex. a slight trace is found of the more recent practice of
    strengthening each of the three extremities with knobs, but only
    the radius at times in Cod. Rossanensis. The custom increases in
    Codd. Ephraemi, Bezae, and still more in Codd. NRZ, wherein the
    curve becomes greater than a semicircle. In Hyperides (and in a
    slighter degree in Cod. Claromon. No. 41) the shape almost
    resembles the Latin _e_. The form of this and the other round
    letters was afterwards much affected in the narrow oblong uncials:
    see Nos, 7, 16, 36.

    _Zeta_ on the Rosetta stone maintains its old form ([Symbol rather
    like a Roman capital I]), which is indeed but the next letter
    reversed. In manuscripts it receives its usual modern shape (Z),
    the ends being pointed decidedly, slightly, or not at all, much
    after the manner described for _epsilon_. In old copies the lower
    horizontal line is a trifle curved (Cod. R, No. 5), or even both
    the extreme lines (Cod. Z, No. 6, and Cod. Augiensis of St. Paul).
    In such late books as Parham 18 (A.D. 980, facsim. No. 36) _Zeta_
    is so large as to run far below the line, ending in a kind of
    tail.

    _Eta_ does not depart from its normal shape ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}) except that in
    Cod. Ephraemi (No. 24) and some narrow and late uncials (e.g. Nos.
    7, 36) the cross line is often more than half way up the letter.
    In a few later uncials the cross line passes _outside_ the two
    perpendiculars, as in the Cod. Augiensis, twenty-six times on the
    photographed page of Scrivener's edition.

    _Theta_ deserves close attention. In some early inscriptions it is
    found as a square, bisected horizontally ([Symbol]). On the
    Rosetta stone and most others (but only in such monuments) it is a
    circle, with a strong central _point_. On the Herculanean rolls
    the central point is spread into a short horizontal line, yet not
    reaching the circumference (No. 10, l. 8). Thence in our uncials
    from the fourth to the sixth century the line becomes a horizontal
    diameter to a true circle (Codd. Vatican., Sinait., Codd. ANRZ,
    Ephraemi, Claromont., Rossanensis, and Cureton's Homer). In the
    seventh century the diameter began to pass out of the circle on
    both sides: thence the circle came to be compressed into an
    ellipse (sometimes very narrow), and the ends of the minor axis to
    be ornamented with knobs, as in Cod. B of the Apocalypse (eighth
    century), Cod. Augiensis (ninth century), LX of the Gospels, after
    the manner of the tenth century (Nos. 7, 16, 21, 36, 38).

    _Iota_ would need no remark but for the custom of placing over it
    an _upsilon_, when they commence a syllable, either a very short
    straight line, or one or two dots. After the papyrus rolls no copy
    is quite without them, from the Codex Alexandrinus, the Cotton
    Genesis and Paris-Leyden Pentateuch, Cod. Z and the Isaiah
    included in it, to the more recent cursives; although in some
    manuscripts they are much rarer than in others. By far the most
    usual practice is to put two points, but Cod. Ephraemi, in its
    _New_ Testament portion, stands nearly alone with the Cotton
    Genesis (ch. xviii. 9) in exhibiting the straight line; Cod.
    Alexandrinus in the Old Testament, but not in the New, frequently
    resembles Codd. Ephraemi and the Cotton Genesis in placing a
    straight line over _iota_, and more rarely over _upsilon_, instead
    of the single or double dots; Cod. Sinaiticus employs two points
    or a straight line (as in Z's Isaiah) promiscuously over both
    vowels, and in Wake 12, a cursive of the eleventh century, the
    former frequently pass into the latter in writing. Codd. Borgianus
    (T) and Claromont. have but one point; Codd. N and Rossanensis
    have two for _iota_, one for _upsilon_.

    _Kappa_ deserves notice chiefly because the vertex of the angle
    formed by the two inclined lines very frequently does not meet the
    perpendicular line, but falls short of it a little to the right:
    we observe this in Codd. ANR, Ephraemi, Rossanensis, and later
    books. The copies that have strong points at the end of _epsilon_
    &c. (e.g. Codd. NR and AZ partly) have the same at the extremity
    of the thin or upper limb of _Kappa_. In Cod. D a fine horizontal
    stroke runs a little to the left from the bottom of the vertical
    line. Compare also the initial letter in Cod. M, No. 32.

    _Lambda_ much resembles _alpha_, but is less complicated. All our
    models (except Harl. 5598, No. 7), from the Rosetta stone
    downwards, have the right limb longer than the left, which thus
    leans against its side, but the length of the projection varies
    even in the same passage (e.g. No. 10). In most copies later than
    the Herculanean rolls and Cod. Sinaiticus the shorter line is much
    the thinner, and the longer slightly curved. In Cod. Z (Nos. 6,
    18) the projection is curved elegantly at the end, as we saw in
    _delta_.

    _Mu_ varies as much as most letters. Its normal shape, resembling
    the English M, is retained in the Rosetta stone and most
    inscriptions, but at an early period there was a tendency to make
    the letter broader, and not to bring the re-entering or middle
    angle so low as in English (e.g. Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus).
    In Cod. Ephraemi this central angle is sometimes a little rounded:
    in Codd. Alex. and Parham 18 the lines forming the angle do not
    always spring from the top of the vertical lines: in Arund. 547
    (No. 16) they spring almost from their foot, forming a thick
    inelegant loop below the line, the letter being rather narrow:
    Harl. 5598 (No. 7) somewhat resembles this last, only that the
    loop is higher up. In the Herculanean rolls (and to a less extent
    in the Cotton Genesis) the two outer lines cease to be
    perpendicular, and lean outwards until the letter looks much like
    an inverted W (No. 10). In the papyrus Hyperides (No. 9) these
    outer lines are low curves, and the central lines rise in a kind
    of flourish above them. _Mu_ assumes this shape also in Cod. T,
    and at the end of a line even in Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus.
    This form is so much exaggerated in some examples, that by
    discarding the outer curves we obtain the shape seen in Cod. Z
    (Nos. 6, 18) and one or two others (e.g. Paul M in Harl. 5613, No.
    34), almost exactly resembling an inverted pi. So also in the
    Isaiah of Cod. Z, only that the left side and base line were made
    by one stroke of the pen.

    _Nu_ is easier, the only change (besides the universal transition
    from the square to the oblong in the later uncials) being that in
    a few cases the thin cross line does not pass from the top of the
    left to the bottom of the right vertical line as in English (N),
    but only from about half-way or two-thirds down the left vertical
    in the Cotton Genesis, Codd. A, Rossanensis, Harl. 5598 (No. 7),
    and others; in Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}NR Parham 18 it often neither springs from
    the top of one, nor reaches the foot of the other (Nos. 4, 5, 11b,
    12, 36); while in Cod. Claromont. (No. 41) it is here and there
    not far from horizontal. In a few _cursives_ (e.g. 440 Evan. at
    Cambridge, and Tischendorf's loti or 61 of the Acts), H and N
    almost interchange their shapes: so in Evan. 66 and Wake 34 at the
    end of a line only.

    _Xi_ in the Rosetta stone and Herculanean rolls consists of three
    parallel straight lines, the middle one being the shortest, as in
    modern printed Greek: but all our Biblical manuscripts exhibit
    modifications of the small printed {~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}, such as must be closely
    inspected, but cannot easily be described. In the Cotton Genesis
    this _xi_ is narrow and smaller than its fellows, much like an old
    English [Symbol: yogh] resting on a horizontal base which curves
    downwards: while in late uncials, as B of the Apocalypse, Cod.
    Augiensis (l. 13 Scrivener's _photographed page_), and especially
    in Parham 18 (No. 36), the letter and its flourished finial are
    continued far below the line. For the rest we must refer to our
    facsimile alphabets, &c. The figures in Cod. Frid.-August. (Nos.
    2, 11a, ll. 3, 8) look particularly awkward, nor does the shape in
    Cod. Rossanensis much differ from these. In Cod. E, the Zurich
    Psalter of the seventh century, and Mr. W. White's fragment Wd,
    _xi_ is the common Z with a large horizontal line over it,
    strengthened by knobs at each end.

    _Omicron_ is unchanged, excepting that in the latest uncials (No.
    16, 36) the circle is mostly compressed, like _theta_, into a very
    eccentric ellipse.

    _Pi_ requires attention. Its original shape was doubtless two
    vertical straight lines joined at top by another horizontal,
    thinner perhaps but not much shorter than they. Thus we meet with
    it on the Rosetta stone, Codd. R, Vatican., Sinaiticus, Ephraemi,
    Claromontanus, Laud. of the Acts, the two Pentateuchs, Cureton's
    Homer, and sometimes Cod. A (No. 12). The fine horizontal line is,
    however, slightly produced on both sides in such early documents
    as the papyri of Hyperides and Herculaneum, and in the Cotton
    Genesis, as well as in Cod. A occasionally(33). Both extremities
    of this line are fortified by strong points in Codd. N and
    Rossanensis, and mostly in Cod. A, but the left side only in Cod.
    Z, and this in Cod. Bezae occasionally becomes a sort of hooked
    curve. The later oblong _pi_ was usually very plain, with thick
    vertical lines and a very fine horizontal, in Arund. 547 (No. 16)
    not at all produced; in Harl. 5598 (No. 7) slightly produced on
    both sides; in Parham 18 (No. 36) produced only on the right.

    _Rho_ is otherwise simple, but in all our authorities except
    inscriptions is produced below the line of writing, least perhaps
    in the papyri and Cod. Claromont., considerably in Codd. AX (Nos.
    12, 38), most in Parham 18 (No. 36): Codd. N, Rossanensis, and
    many later copies have the lower extremity boldly _bevelled_. The
    form is [Symbol like sans-serif bold Roman capital P] rather than
    [Symbol like serif Roman capital P] in Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}A. In Cod. D a
    horizontal stroke, longer and thicker than in _kappa_, runs to the
    left from the bottom of the vertical line.

    _Sigma_ retains its angular shape ([Symbol] or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}) only on
    inscriptions, as the Rosetta, and that long after the square
    shapes of _omicron_ and _theta_ were discarded. The uncial or
    semicircular form, however, arose early, and to this letter must
    be applied all that was said of _epsilon_ as regards terminal
    points (a knob at the lower extremity occurs even in Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, e.g.
    Acts ii. 31), and its cramped shape in later ages.

    _Tau_ in its oldest form consists of two straight lines of like
    thickness, the horizontal being bisected by the lower and vertical
    one. As early as in Cod. Sinaiticus the horizontal line is made
    thin, and strengthened on the left side _only_ by a point or small
    knob (Nos. 3, 11): thus we find it in Cod. Laud. of the Acts
    sometimes. In Cod. Alex. _both_ ends are slightly pointed, in
    Codd. Ephraemi, Rossanensis, and others much more. In Cod. Bezae
    the horizontal is curved and flourished; in the late uncials the
    vertical is very thick, the horizontal fine, and the ends formed
    into heavy triangles (e.g. No. 16).

    _Upsilon_ on the Rosetta stone and Herculanean rolls is like our
    {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}, all the strokes being of equal thickness and not running below
    the line: nor do they in Hyperides or in Codd. XZ and Augiensis,
    which have the upper lines neatly curved (Nos. 6, 9, 18, 38). The
    right limb of many of the rest is sometimes, but not always
    curved; the vertical line in Codd. Vatican. and Sinaiticus drops
    slightly below the line; in Codd. A, Ephraemi, Cotton Genesis,
    Cureton's Homer, Laud. of the Acts and Rossanensis somewhat more;
    in others (as Codd. Bezae NR) considerably. In the subscription to
    St. Matthew's Gospel, which may be by a somewhat later hand, a
    horizontal line crosses the vertical a little below the curved
    lines in Cod. Rossanensis. In later uncials (Nos. 7, 36) it
    becomes a long or awkward Y, or even degenerates into a long V
    (No. 16); or, in copies written by Latin scribes, into Y reversed.
    We have described under _iota_ the custom of placing dots, &c.
    over _upsilon_. But in Tischendorf's Leipzig II. (fragments from
    Numbers to Judges of the seventh or eighth century) _upsilon_
    receives two dots, _iota_ only one. Once in Cod. Z (Matt. xxi. 5)
    and oftener in its Isaiah a convex semicircle, like a circumflex,
    stands over _upsilon_.

    _Phi_ is a remarkable letter. In most copies it is the largest in
    the alphabet, quite disproportionately large in Codd. ZL (Paris
    62) and others, and to some extent in Codd. AR, Ephraemi,
    Rossanensis, and Claromont. The circle (which in the Cotton
    Genesis is _sometimes_ still a lozenge, see above, p. 32, note 1),
    though large and in some copies even too broad (e.g. No. 18), is
    usually in the line of the other letters, the vertical line being
    produced _far_ upwards (Cod. Augiens. and Nos. 16, 41), or
    downwards (No. 10), or both (No. 36). On the Rosetta stone the
    circle is very small and the straight line short.

    _Chi_ is a simple transverse cross ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}) and never goes above or
    below the line. The limb that inclines from left to right is in
    the uncial form for the most part thick, the other thin (with
    final points according to the practice stated for _epsilon_), and
    this limb or both (as in Cod. Z) a little curved.

    _Psi_ is a rare but trying letter. Its oldest form resembled an
    English V with a straight line running up bisecting its interior
    angle. On the Rosetta stone it had already changed into its
    present form ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PSI~}), the curve being a small semicircle, the vertical
    rising above the other letters and falling a little below the
    line. In the Cotton Genesis _psi_ is rather taller than the rest,
    but the vertical line does not rise above the level of the circle.
    In Codd. ANR and Rossanensis the under line is prolonged: in R the
    two limbs are straight lines making an angle of about 45 deg. with the
    vertical, while oftentimes in Hyperides and Cod. Augiensis
    (Scrivener's _photograph_, ll. 18, 23) they curve _downwards_; the
    limbs in N and R being strongly (slightly in Rossanensis) pointed
    at the ends, and the bottom of the vertical bevelled as usual. In
    Cod. B of the Apocalypse, in Evan. OWd{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}, and even in Hyperides,
    the limbs (strongly pointed) fall into a straight line, and the
    figure becomes a large cross (No. 7). In Evan. 66 the vertical is
    crossed above the semicircle by a minute horizontal line.

    _Omega_ took the form {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}, even when _omicron_ and _theta_ were
    square; thus it appears on the Rosetta stone, but in the Hyperides
    and Herculaneum rolls it is a single curve, much like the w of
    English writing, only that the central part is sometimes only a
    low double curve (No. 10, l. 6). In the Cotton Genesis, Codd.
    Vatican., Sinaiticus, Alex., Ephraemi, Bezae, Claromont.,
    Nitriens., Rossanensis, there is little difference in shape,
    though sometimes Cod. Vatican. comes near the Herculanean rolls,
    and Cod. Alex, next to it: elsewhere their strokes (especially
    those in the centre) are fuller and more laboured. Yet in Cod. N
    it is often but a plain semicircle, bisected by a perpendicular
    radius, with the ends of the curve bent inwards (No. 14, l. 2). In
    the late uncials (Nos. 7, 16) it almost degenerates into an
    ungraceful W, while in Cod. Augiensis (_photograph_, l. 18) the
    first limb is occasionally a complete circle.


These details might be indefinitely added to by references to other
codices and monuments of antiquity, but we have employed most of the
principal copies of the Greek Testament, and have indicated to the student
the chief points to which his attention should be drawn. Three leading
principles have perhaps been sufficiently established by the foregoing
examples:

First, that the uncials used in writing differ from the capitals cut in
stone by the curved shapes which the writing hand naturally adopts(34).

Secondly, that the upright uncials of square dimensions are more ancient
than those which are narrow, oblong, or _leaning_(35).

Thirdly, that the simpler and less elaborate the style of writing, the
more remote is its probable date.

Copies of a later age occasionally aim at imitating the fashion of an
earlier period, or possibly the style of the older book from which their
text is drawn. But this anachronism of fashion may be detected, as well by
other circumstances we are soon to mention, as from the air of constraint
which pervades the whole manuscript: the rather as the scribe will now and
then fall into the more familiar manner of his contemporaries; especially
when writing those small letters which our Biblical manuscripts of all
dates (even the most venerable) perpetually crowd into the ends of lines,
in order to save space.

11. We do not intend to dwell much on the cursive handwriting. No books of
the Greek Scriptures earlier than the ninth century in this style are now
extant(36), though it was prevalent long before in the intercourse of
business or common life. The papyri of Hyperides (e.g. No. 9) and the
Herculanean rolls, in a few places, show that the process had then
commenced, for the letters of each word are often joined, and their shapes
prove that swiftness of execution was more aimed at than distinctness.
This is seen even more clearly in a petition to Ptolemy Philometor (B.C.
164) represented in the "Paleographie Universelle" (No. 56). The same
great work contains (No. 66) two really cursive charters of the Emperors
Maurice (A.D. 600) and Heraclius (A.D. 616). Other instances of early
cursive writing may be found in two Deeds of Sale, A.D. 616, and 599, a
Manumission in 355, an Official Deed in 233, a Deed of Sale in 154, in
Aristotle on the Constitution of Athens, about 100, in a Farm Account in
78-79, in a Receipt in A.D. 20, in the Casati contract in B.C. 114, in a
Letter on Egyptian Contracts in 146, a Treasury Circular in 170, in a
Steward's letter of the third century B.C., in various documents of the
same century lying in the British Museum, at Paris, Berlin, Leyden, and
elsewhere, of which the oldest, being amongst the papyri discovered by Dr.
Flinders Petrie at Gurob is referred to B.C. 268, and the Leyden papyrus
to 260(37). Yet the earliest books of a later age known to be written in
cursive letters are Cod. 481 (Scholz 461, dated A.D. 835) the Bodleian
Euclid (dated A.D. 888) and the twenty-four dialogues of Plato in the same
Library (dated A.D. 895)(38). There is reason to believe, from the
comparatively unformed character of the writing in them all, that Burney
19 in the British Museum (from which we have extracted the alphabet No. 8,
Plate iii), and the minute, beautiful and important Codex l of the Gospels
at Basle (of which see a facsimile No. 23), are but little later than the
Oxford books, and may be referred to the tenth century. Books copied after
the cursive hand had become regularly formed, in the eleventh, twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, are hard to be distinguished by the mere
handwriting, though they are often dated, or their age fixed by the
material (see p. 23), or the style of their illuminations. Colbert. 2844,
or 33 of the Gospels (facsim. No. 39), is attributed to the eleventh
century, and Burney 21 (No. 15)(39), is dated A.D. 1292, and afford good
examples of their respective dates. _Beta_ (l. 1 letter 4), _when joined
to other letters_, is barely distinguishable from _upsilon_(40); _nu_ is
even nearer to _mu_; the tall forms of _eta_ and _epsilon_ are very
graceful, the whole style elegant and, after a little practice, easily
read. Burney 22 (facsimile No. 37) is dated about the same time, A.D.
1319, and the four Biblical lines much resemble Burney 21(41). In the
fourteenth century a careless style came into fashion, of which Cod.
Leicestrensis (No. 40) is an exaggerated instance, and during this century
and the next our manuscripts, though not devoid of a certain beauty of
appearance, are too full of arbitrary and elaborate contractions to be
conveniently read. The formidable list of abbreviations and ligatures
represented in Donaldson's Greek Grammar (p. 20, third edition)(42)
originated at this period in the perverse ingenuity of the Greek emigrants
in the West of Europe, who subsisted by their skill as copyists; and these
pretty puzzles (for such they now are to many a fair classical scholar),
by being introduced into early printed books(43), have largely helped to
withdraw them from use in modern times.

12. We have now to describe the practice of Biblical manuscripts as
regards the insertion of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} forming a diphthong with the long vowels _eta_
and _omega_, also with _alpha_ long, whether by being _ascript_, i.e.
written by their side, or _subscript_, i.e. written under them. In the
earliest inscriptions and in the papyri of Thebes {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _ascript_ (the iota
not smaller than other letters) is invariably found. In the petition to
Ptolemy Philometor (_above_, p. 41) it occurs four times in the first
line, three times in the third: in the fragments of Hyperides it is
perpetually though not always read, even where (especially with verbs) it
has no rightful place, e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} (facsimile No. 9, ll. 3, 4)
for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}. A little before the Christian era it began to grow
obsolete, probably from its being lost in pronunciation. In the
Herculanean Philodemus (the possible limits of whose date are from B.C. 50
to A.D. 79) as in Evann. 556, 604 (Matt. ii. 12, 13), it is often dropped,
though more usually written. In Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus it is
probably not found, and from this period it almost disappears from
Biblical uncials(44); in Cureton's Homer, of the fifth or perhaps of the
sixth century, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _ascript_ is sometimes neglected, but usually inserted;
sometimes also {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} is placed _above_ {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~} or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}, an arrangement neither neat nor
convenient. With the cursive character {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _ascript_ came in again, as may
be seen from the subscriptions in the Bodleian Euclid and Plato (p. 42,
note 1). The _semicursive_ fragment of St. Paul's Epistles in red letters
(M of St. Paul, Plate xii No. 34), used for the binding of Harleian 5613,
contains {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _ascript_ twice, but I have tried in vain to verify Griesbach's
statement (Symbol. Crit. ii. p. 166) that it has {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _subscript_ "bis tantum
aut ter." I can find no such instance in these leaves. The cursive
manuscripts, speaking generally, either entirely omit both forms, or, if
they give either, far more often neglect than insert them. Cod. 1 of the
Gospels exhibits the _ascript_ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}. Of forty-three codices now in England
which have been examined with a view to this matter, twelve have no
vestige of either fashion, fifteen represent the _ascript_ use, nine the
_subscript_ exclusively, while the few that remain exhibit both
indifferently(45). The earliest cursive copy ascertained to exhibit {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
_subscript_ is Matthaei's r (Apoc. 502 [x]), and after that the Cod.
Ephesius (Evan. 71), dated A.D. 1160. The _subscript_ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} came much into
vogue during the fifteenth century, and thus was adopted in printed books.

13. Breathings (_spiritus_) and accents(46) were not applied
systematically to Greek Texts before the seventh century. But a practice
prevailed in that and the succeeding century of inserting them in older
manuscripts, where they were absent _prima manu_. That such was done in
many instances (e.g. in Codd. Vatican. and Coislin. 202 or H of St. Paul)
appears clearly from the fact that the passages which the scribe who
retouched the old letters for any cause left unaltered, are destitute of
these marks, though they appear in all other places. Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} exhibits
breathings, apparently by the original scribe, in Tobit vi. 9; Gal. v. 21
only. The case of Cod. Alexandrinus is less easy. Though the rest of the
book has neither breathings (except a few here and there) nor accents, the
first four lines of _each_ column of the book of Genesis (see facsimile
No. 12), which are written in red, are fully furnished with them. These
marks Baber, who edited the Old Testament portion of Cod. A, pronounced to
be by a second hand (Notae, p. 1); Sir Frederick Madden, a more competent
judge, declares them the work of the original scribe (Madden's Silvestre,
Vol. i. p. 194, note), and after repeated examination we know not how to
dissent from his view(47). So too in the Sarravian Pentateuch of the fifth
century we read {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~} [with several symbols written over the {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}] (Lev. xi.
7) by the first hand. The Cureton palimpsest of Homer also has them,
though they are occasionally obliterated, and some few are evidently
inserted by a corrector; the case is nearly so with the Milan Homer edited
by Mai; and the same must be stated of the Vienna Dioscorides (Silvestre,
No. 62), whose date is fixed by internal evidence to about A.D. 500. In
the papyrus fragment of the Psalms, now in the British Museum, the accents
are very accurate, and the work of the original scribe. These facts, and
others like these, may make us hesitate to adopt the notion generally
received among scholars on the authority of Montfaucon (Palaeogr. Graec.
p. 33), that breathings and accents were not introduced _prima manu_
before the seventh or eighth century; although up to that period, no
doubt, they were placed very incorrectly, and often omitted altogether.
The breathings are much the more ancient and important of the two. The
_spiritus lenis_ indeed may be a mere invention of the Alexandrian
grammarians of the second or third century before Christ, but the
_spiritus asper_ is in fact the substitute for a real letter (H) which
appears on the oldest inscriptions; its original shape being the first
half of the H ([symbol like the left half of a Roman capital letter H]),
of which the second half was subsequently adopted for the _lenis_ ([symbol
like the right half of a Roman capital H]). This form is sometimes found
in manuscripts of about the eleventh century (e.g. Lebanon, B.M. Addit.
11300 or kscr, and usually in Lambeth 1178 or dscr) ed. of 1550, but even
in the Cod. Alexandrinus the comma and inverted comma are several times
substituted to represent the _lenis_ and _asper_ respectively (facsimile
No. 12): and at a later period this last was the ordinary, though not
quite the invariable, mode of expressing the breathings. Aristophanes of
Byzantium (keeper of the famous Library at Alexandria under Ptolemy
Euergetes, about B.C. 240), though probably not the inventor of the Greek
accents, was the first to arrange them in a system. Accentuation must have
been a welcome aid to those who employed Greek as a learned, though not as
their vernacular tongue, and is so convenient and suggestive that no
modern scholar can afford to dispense with its familiar use: yet not
being, like the rough breathing, an essential portion of the language, it
was but slowly brought into general vogue. It would seem that in
Augustine's age [354-430] the distinction between the smooth and rough
breathing in the manuscripts was just such a point as a careful reader
would mark, a hasty one overlook(48). Hence it is not surprising that
though these marks are entirely absent both from the Theban and
Herculanean papyri, a few breathings are apparently by the first hand in
Cod. Borgianus or T (Tischendorf, N. T. 1859, Proleg. p. cxxxi). One rough
breathing is just visible in that early palimpsest of St. John's Gospel,
Ib or Nb. Such as appear, together with some accents, in the Coislin
Octateuch of the sixth or seventh century, may not the less be _prima
manu_ because many pages are destitute of them; those of Cod.
Claromontanus, which were once deemed original, are now pronounced by its
editor Tischendorf to be a later addition. Cod. N, the purple fragment so
often spoken of already, exhibits _prima manu_ over certain vowels a kind
of smooth breathing or slight acute accent, sometimes little larger than a
point, but inserted on no intelligible principle, so far as we can see,
and far oftener omitted entirely. All copies of Scripture which have not
been specified, down to the end of the seventh century, are quite
destitute of breathings and accents. An important manuscript of the eighth
or ninth century, Cod. L or Paris 62 of the Gospels, has them for the most
part, but not always; though often in the wrong place, and at times in
utter defiance of all grammatical rules. Cod. B of the Apocalypse,
however, though of the same age, has breathings and accents as constantly
and correctly as most. Codices of the ninth century, with the exception of
three written in the West of Europe (Codd. Augiensis or Paul F,
Sangallensis or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} of the Gospels, and Boernerianus or Paul G, which will
be particularly described afterwards), are all accompanied with these
marks in full, though often set down without any precise rule, so far as
our experience has enabled us to observe. The uncial Evangelistaria (e.g.
Arundel 547; Parham 18; Harleian 5598), especially, are much addicted to
prefixing the _spiritus asper_ improperly; chiefly, perhaps, to words
beginning with H, so that documents of that age are but slender
authorities on such points. Of the cursives the general tendency is to be
more and more accurate as regards the accentuation, the later the date:
but this is only a general rule, as some that are early are as careful,
and certain of the latest as negligent, as can well be imagined. All of
them are partial to placing accents or breathings over both parts of a
word compounded with a preposition (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}), and on the other
hand often drop them between a preposition and its case (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}).

14. The punctuation in early times was very simple. In the papyri of
Hyperides there are no stops at all, in the Herculanean rolls exceeding
few: Codd. Sinaiticus and Vaticanus (the latter very rarely by the first
hand) have a single point here and there on a level with the top of the
letters, and occasionally a very small break in the continuous uncials,
with or (as always in Cod. Ib of the sixth century) without the point, to
denote a pause in the sense. Codd. A N have the same point a little
oftener; in Codd. C Wa (Paris 314) Z and the Cotton Genesis the single
point stands indiscriminately at the head, middle, or foot of the letters,
while in E (Basil. A. N. iii. 12) of the Gospels and B of the Apocalypse,
as in Cod. Marchalianus of the Prophets (sixth or seventh century), this
change in the position of the point indicates a full-stop, half stop, or
comma respectively. In Cod. L, of the same date as Codd. E and B (Apoc.),
besides the full point we have the comma (::.) and semicolon (::), with a
cross also for a stop. In Codd. Y {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}a (of about the eighth century) the
single point has its various powers as in Cod. E, &c., but besides this
are double, treble, and in Cod. Y quadruple, points with different powers.
In late uncials, especially Evangelistaria, the chief stop is a cross,
often in red (e.g. Arund. 547); while in Harleian 5598 [symbol like three
ovals] seems to be the note of interrogation(49). When the continuous
writing came to be broken up into separate words (of which Cod. Augiensis
in the ninth century affords one of the earliest examples) the single
point was intended to be placed after the last letter of each word, on a
level with the middle of the letters. But even in this copy it is often
omitted in parts, and in Codd. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}G, written on the same plan, more
frequently still. Our statements refer only to the Greek portions of these
copies; the Latin semicolon (;) and the note of interrogation (?) occur in
their Latin versions. The Greek interrogation (;) first occurs about the
ninth century, and (,) used as a stop a little later. The Bodleian Genesis
of this date, or a little earlier, uses (,) also as an interrogative: so
in later times B-C. iii. 5 [xii], and Evan. 556 [xii]. In the earliest
cursives the system of punctuation is much the same as that of printed
books: the English colon (:) not being much used, but the upper single
point in its stead(50). In a few cursives (e.g. Gonville or 59 of the
Gospels), this upper point, set in a larger space, stands also for a full
stop: indeed (.) is the only stop found in Tischendorf's loti or 61 of the
Acts (Brit. Mus. Add. 20,003): while (;) and (.) are often confused in 440
of the Gospels (Cantab. Mm. 6. 9). The English comma, placed above a
letter, is used for the apostrophus, which occurs in the very oldest
uncials, especially at the end of proper names, or to separate compounds
(e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in Cod. Clarom.), or when the word ends in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}
(e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} in Cod. B, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} in Codd. Sinait. and A, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} in Cod. A,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} in the Dioscorides, A.D. 500), or even to divide syllables (e.g.
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in Cod. Frid.-August., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in Cod.
Sinaiticus). In Cod. Z it is found only after {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}, but in Z's
Isaiah it indicates other elisions (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}). This mark is more rare in
Cod. Ephraemi than in some others, but is used more or less by all, and is
found after {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}, or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}, and a few like words, even in the most recent
cursives. In Cod. Bezae and others it assumes the shape of > rather than

seldom abridges, and all copies often set {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in full. A few dots
sometimes supply the place of the line denoting abbreviation (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}
[with dots over the letters] Cotton Genesis, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~} [with dots over the
letters] Colbert. Pentateuch). A straight line over the last letter of a
line, sometimes over any vowel, indicates N (or also M in the Latin of
Codd. Bezae and Claromont.) in all the Biblical uncials, but is placed
only over numerals in the Herculanean rolls: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} [with tilde below and to
the right], {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~} [with tilde below and to the right], and less often {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~} [with

met with in Cod. Sinaiticus and all later except Cod. Z: [symbol somewhat
like Arabic number 8] for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} chiefly in Codd. L, Augiensis, B of the
Apocalypse, and the more recent uncials. Such _compendia scribendi_ as
[symbol like Pi with Rho] in the Herculanean rolls (above p. 33) occur
mostly at the end of lines: that form, with {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~} [with small circle between
the letters] (No. 11 a, l. 4), and a few more even in the Cod. Sinaiticus;
in Cod. Sarrav. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~} [with small circle over the letter] stands for both {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}
and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}; in Cureton's Homer we have {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} for -{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} and such
like. In later books they are more numerous and complicated, particularly
in cursive writing. The terminations [small raised circle] for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~},

{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~} in Burney 19, and Burdett-Coutts i. 4, h for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}, b for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}, -- for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~},

Parham 17 of the Apocalypse. Other more rare abridgements are [symbol like
two raised small sigmas] for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in Wake 12, [square root sign]
(Burdett-Coutts I. 4) or < or [raised small alpha] for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, [symbol like

The
mark > is not only met with in the Herculanean rolls, but in the Hyperides
(facsimile 9, l. 6), in Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, the two
Pentateuchs, Codd. Augiensis, Sangall. and Boernerianus, and seems merely
designed to fill up vacant space, like the flourishes in a legal
instrument(54).

16. Capital letters of a larger size than the rest at the beginning of
clauses, &c. are freely met with in all documents excepting in the oldest
papyri, the Herculanean rolls, Codd. Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, the Colbert
Pentateuch, Isaiah in Cod. Z, and one or two fragments besides(55). Their
absence is a proof of high antiquity. Yet even in Codd. Vaticanus,
Sinaiticus, and Sarravianus, which is the other part of the Colbert
Pentateuch (in the first most frequently in the earlier portions of the
Old Testament), the initial letter stands a little outside the line of
writing after a break in the sense, whether the preceding line had been
quite filled up or not. Such breaks occur more regularly in Codex Bezae,
as will appear when we come to describe it(56). Smaller capitals occur in
the middle of lines in Codd. Bezae and Marchalianus, of the sixth and
seventh centuries respectively. Moreover, all copies of whatever date are
apt to crowd small letters into the end of a line to save room, and if
these small letters preserve the form of the larger, it is reasonable to
conclude that the scribe is writing in a natural hand, not an assumed one,
and the argument for the antiquity of such a document, derived from the
shape of its letters, thus becomes all the stronger. The continuous form
of writing separate words must have prevailed in manuscripts long after it
was obsolete in common life: Cod. Claromont., whose text is continuous
even in its Latin version, divides the words in the inscriptions and
subscriptions to the several books.

17. The stichometry of the sacred books has next to be considered. The
Greeks and Romans measured the contents of their MSS. by lines, not only
in poetry, but also artificially in prose for a standard line of fifteen
or sixteen syllables, called by the earliest writers {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, afterwards
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}(57). Not only do Athanasius [d. 373], Gregory Nyssen [d. 396],
Epiphanius [d. 403], and Chrysostom [d. 407] inform us that in their time
the Book of Psalms was already divided into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, while Jerome [d. 420?]
testifies the same for the prophecies of Isaiah; but Origen also [d. 254]
speaks of the second and third Epistles of St. John as both of them not
exceeding one hundred {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, of St. Paul's Epistles as consisting of few,
St. John's first Epistle as of very few (Euseb. Hist. Eccles. vi. 25,
cited by Tischendorf, Cod. Sinait., Proleg. p. xxi, note 2, 1863). Even
the apocryphal letter of our Lord to Abgarus is described as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} (Euseb. H. E. i. 13): while Eustathius of
Antioch in the fourth century reckoned 135 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} between John viii. 59
and x. 41. More general is the use of the word in Ephraem the Syrian [d.
378], {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (tom. iii. 101). As regards the Psalms,
we may see their arrangement for ourselves in Codd. Vaticanus and
Sinaiticus, wherein, according to the true principles of Hebrew poetry,
the verses do not correspond in metre or quantity of syllables, but in the
parallelism or relationship subsisting between the several members of the
same sentence or stanza(58). Such {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} were therefore not "space-lines,"
but "sense-lines." It seems to have occurred to Euthalius, a deacon of
Alexandria, as it did long afterwards to Bishop Jebb when he wrote his
"Sacred Literature," that a large portion of the New Testament might be
divided into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} on the same principles: and that even where that
distribution should prove but artificial, it would guide the public reader
in the management of his voice, and remove the necessity for an elaborate
system of punctuation. Such, therefore, we conceive to be the use and
design of stichometry, as applied to the Greek Testament by Euthalius(59),
whose edition of the Acts and Epistles was published A.D. 490. Who
distributed the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} of the Gospels (which are in truth better suited
for such a process than the Epistles) does not appear. Although but few
manuscripts now exist that are written {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} (a plan which
consumed too much vellum to become general), we read in many copies, added
usually to the subscription at the foot of each of the books of the New
Testament, a calculation of the number of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} it contained, the numbers
being sufficiently unlike to show that the arrangement was not the same in
all codices, yet near enough to prove that they were divided on the same
principle(60). In the few documents written {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} that survive, the
length of the clauses is very unequal; some (e.g. Cod. Bezae, _see_ the
description below and the facsimile, No. 42) containing as much in a line
as might be conveniently read aloud in a breath, others (e.g. Cod. Laud.
of the Acts, Plate x. No. 25) having only one or two words in a line. The
Cod. Claromontanus (facsim. No. 41) in this respect lies between those
extremes, and the fourth great example of this class (Cod. Coislin. 202, H

Sangallensis {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}. In Cod. Claromontanus there are scarcely any stops (the
middle point being chiefly reserved to follow abridgements or numerals),
the stichometry being of itself an elaborate scheme of punctuation; but
the longer {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} of Cod. Bezae are often divided by a single point.

18. In using manuscripts of the Greek Testament, we must carefully note
whether a reading is _prima manu_ (*) or by some subsequent corrector
(**). It will often happen that these last are utterly valueless, having
been inserted even from printed copies by a modern owner (like some
marginal variations of the Cod. Leicestrensis)(61), and such as these
really ought not to have been extracted by collators at all; while others
by the second hand are almost as weighty, for age and goodness, as the
text itself. All these points are explained by critical editors for each
document separately; in fact to discriminate the different corrections in
regard to their antiquity and importance is often the most difficult
portion of such editor's task (e.g. in Codd. Bezae and Claromontanus), and
one on which he often feels it hard to satisfy his own judgement.
Corrections by the original scribe, or by a contemporary reviser, where
they can be satisfactorily distinguished, must be regarded as a portion of
the testimony of the manuscript itself, inasmuch as every carefully
prepared copy was reviewed and compared ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}), if not by the writer
himself, by a skilful person appointed for the task ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}), whose duty it was to amend manifest errors, sometimes also to
insert ornamental capitals in places which had been reserved for them; in
later times (and as some believe at a very early period) to set in stops,
breathings and accents; in copies destined for ecclesiastical use to
arrange the musical notes that were to guide the intonation of the reader.
Notices of this kind of revision are sometimes met with at the end of the
best manuscripts. Such is the note in Cod. H of St. Paul: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}

CHAPTER III. DIVISIONS OF THE TEXT, AND OTHER PARTICULARS.


We have next to give some account of ancient divisions of the text, as
found in manuscripts of the New Testament; and these must be carefully
noted by the student, since few copies are without one or more of them.

1. So far as we know at present, the oldest sections still extant are
those of the Codex Vaticanus. These seem to have been formed for the
purpose of reference, and a new one always commences where there is some
break in the sense. Many, however, at least in the Gospels, consist of but
one of our modern verses, and they are so unequal in length as to be
rather inconvenient for actual use. In the four Gospels only the marginal
numerals are in red, St. Matthew containing 170 of these divisions, St.
Mark 62, St. Luke 152, St. John 80. In the Acts of the Apostles are two
sets of sections, thirty-six longer and in an older hand, sixty-nine
smaller and more recent(63). Each of these also begins after a break in
the sense, but they are quite independent of each other, as a larger
section will sometimes commence in the middle of a smaller, the latter
being in no wise a subdivision of the former. Thus the greater {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~} opens
Acts ii. 1, in the middle of the lesser {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}, which extends from Acts i. 15
to ii. 4. The first forty-two of the lesser chapters, down to Acts xv. 40,
are found also with slight variations in the margin of Codex Sinaiticus,
written by a very old hand. As in most manuscripts, so in Codex Vaticanus,
the Catholic Epistles follow the Acts, and in them also and in St. Paul's
Epistles there are two sets of sections, only that in the Epistles the
older sections are the more numerous. The Pauline Epistles are reckoned
throughout as one book in the elder notation, with however this remarkable
peculiarity, that though in the Cod. Vatican. itself the Epistle to the
Hebrews stands next after the second to the Thessalonians, _and on the
same leaf with it_, the sections are arranged as if it stood between the
Epistles to the Galatians and Ephesians. For whereas that to the Galatians
ends with  58, that to the Ephesians begins with  70, and the numbers
proceed regularly down to  93, with which the second to the Thessalonians
ends. The Epistle to the Hebrews which then follows opens with  59; the
last section extant ( 64) begins at Heb. ix. 11, and the manuscript ends
abruptly at {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} ver. 14. It plainly appears, then, that the sections of
the Codex Vaticanus must have been copied from some yet older document, in
which the Epistle to the Hebrews preceded that to the Ephesians. It will
be found hereafter (vol. ii) that in the Thebaic version the Epistle to
the Hebrews preceded that to the Galatians, instead of following it, as
here. For a list of the more modern divisions in the Epistles, see the
Table given below. The Vatican sections of the Gospels have also been
discovered by Tregelles in one other copy, the palimpsest Codex Zacynthius
of St. Luke ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}), which he published in 1861.

2. Hardly less ancient, and indeed ascribed by some to Tatian the
Harmonist, the disciple of Justin Martyr, is the division of the Gospels
into larger chapters or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} _majora_(64). It may be noticed that in
none of the four Gospels does the first chapter stand at its commencement.
In St. Matthew chapter A begins at chap. ii. verse 1, and has for its
title {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}: in St. Mark at chap. i. ver. 23 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA AND PERISPOMENI~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}: in St. Luke at chap. ii. ver. 1 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}: in St.
John at chap. ii. ver. 1 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}. Mill accounts for this
circumstance by supposing that in the first copies the titles at the head
of each Gospel were reserved till last for more splendid illumination, and
were thus eventually forgotten (Proleg. N. T.  355); Griesbach holds,
that the general inscriptions of each Gospel, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~},
&c., were regarded as the special titles of the first chapters also. On
either supposition, however, it would be hard to explain how what was
really the second chapter came to be _numbered_ as the first; and it is
worth notice that the same arrangement takes place in the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} (though
these are of a later date) of all the other books of the New Testament
except the Acts, 2 Corinth., Ephes., 1 Thess., Hebrews, James, 1 and 2
Peter, 1 John, and the Apocalypse: e.g. the first chapter of the Epistle
to the Romans opens ch. i. ver. 18 {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}. But the fact is that this
arrangement, strange as it may seem, is conformable to the practice of the
times when these divisions were finally settled. Both in the Institutes
and in the Digest of Justinian the first paragraph is always cited as pr.
(i.e. _principium_, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, _Preface_), and what we should regard as
the second paragraph is numbered as the first, and so on throughout the
whole work(65).

The {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in St. Matthew amount to sixty-eight, in St. Mark to
forty-eight, in St. Luke to eighty-three, in St. John to eighteen. This
mode of division, although not met with in the Vatican and Sinaitic
manuscripts, is found in the Codices Alexandrinus and Ephraemi of the
fifth century, and in the Codex Nitriensis of the sixth, each of which has
tables of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} prefixed to the several Gospels: but the Codices
Alexandrinus, Rossanensis, and Dublinensis of St. Matthew, and that
portion of the purple Cotton fragment which is in the Vatican, exhibit
them in their usual position, at the top and bottom of the pages. Thus it
appears that they were too generally diffused in the fifth century not to
have originated at an earlier period; although we must concede that the
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} spoken of by Clement of Alexandria (Stromat. i) when quoting
Dan. xii. 12, or by Athanasius (contra Arium) on Act. ii, and the
_Capitulum_ mentioned by Tertullian (ad Uxorem ii. 2) in reference to 1
Cor. vii. 12, contain no certain allusions to any specific divisions of
the sacred text, but only to the particular paragraphs or passages in
which their citations stand. Except that the contrary habit has grown
inveterate(66), it were much to be desired that the term {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} should be
applied to these longer divisions, at least in the Gospels; but since
usage has affixed the term {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} to the larger chapters and sections to
the smaller, and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} only to the subjects or headings of the former, it
would be useless to follow any other system of names.

3. The Ammonian Sections were not constructed, like the Vatican divisions
and the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, for the purpose of easy reference, or distributed like
them according to the breaks in the sense, but for a wholly different
purpose. So far as we can ascertain, the design of Tatian's Harmony was
simply to present to Christian readers a single connected history of our
Lord, by taking from the four Evangelists indifferently whatsoever best
suited his purpose(67). As this plan could scarcely be executed without
_omitting_ some portions of the sacred text, it is not surprising that
Tatian, possibly without any evil intention, should have incurred the
grave charge of mutilating Holy Scripture(68). A more scholar-like and
useful attempt was subsequently made by Ammonius of Alexandria, early in
the third century [A.D. 220], who, by the side of St. Matthew's Gospel,
which he selected as his standard, arranged in parallel columns, as it
would seem, the corresponding passages of the other three Evangelists, so
as to exhibit them all at once to the reader's eye; St. Matthew in his
proper order, the rest as the necessity of abiding by St. Matthew's order
prescribed. This is the account given by the celebrated Eusebius, Bishop
of Caesarea, the Church historian, who in the fourth century, in his
letter to Carpianus, described his own most ingenious system of Harmony,
as founded on, or at least as suggested by, the labours of Ammonius(69).
It has been generally thought that the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, of which St. Matthew
contains 355, St. Mark 236(70), St. Luke 342, St. John 232, in all 1165,
were made by Ammonius for the purpose of his work, and they have commonly
received the name of the Ammonian sections: but this opinion was called in
question by Bp. Lloyd (Nov. Test. Oxon. 1827, Monitum, pp. viii-xi), who
strongly urges that, in his Epistle to Carpianus, Eusebius not only
refrains from ascribing these numerical divisions to Ammonius (whose
labours in this particular, as once seemed the case with Tatian's, must in
that case be deemed to have perished utterly), but he almost implies that
they had their origin at the same time with his own ten canons, with which
they are so intimately connected(71). That they were essential to
Eusebius' scheme is plain enough; their place in Ammonius' parallel
Harmony is not easily understood, unless indeed (what is nowhere stated,
but rather the contrary) he did not set the passages from the other
Gospels at full length by the side of St. Matthew's, but only these
numerical references to them(72).

There is, however, one ground for hesitation before we ascribe the
sections, as well as the canons, to Eusebius; namely, that not a few
ancient manuscripts (e.g. Codd. FHY) contain the former, while they omit
the latter. Of palimpsests indeed it might be said with reason, that the
rough process which so nearly obliterated the ink of the older writing,
would completely remove the coloured paint ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, _vermilion_,
prescribed by Eusebius, though blue or green is occasionally found) in
which the canons were invariably noted; hence we need not wonder at their
absence from the Codices Ephraemi, Nitriensis (R), Dublinensis (Z), Codd.
IWb of Tischendorf, and the Wolfenbuettel fragments (PQ), in all which the
sections are yet legible in ink. The Codex Sinaiticus contains both; but
Tischendorf decidedly pronounces them to be in a later hand. In the Codex
Bezae too, as well as the Codex Cyprius (K), even the Ammonian sections,
without the canons, are by later hands, though the latter has prefixed the
list or table of the canons. Of the oldest copies the Cod. Alex. (A),
Tischendorf's Codd. Wa{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}, the Cotton frag. (N), and Codd. Beratinus and
Rossanensis alone contain both the sections and the canons. Even in more
modern cursive books the latter are often deficient, though the former are
present. This peculiarity we have observed in Burney 23, in the British
Museum, of the twelfth century, although the Epistle to Carpianus stands
at the beginning; in a rather remarkable copy of about the twelfth
century, in the Cambridge University Library (Mm. 6. 9, Scholz Evan. 440),
in which, however, the table of canons but not the Epistle to Carpianus
precedes; in the Gonville and Caius Gospels of the twelfth century (Evan.
59), and in a manuscript of about the thirteenth century at Trinity
College, Cambridge (B. x. 17)(73). These facts certainly seem to indicate
that in the judgement of critics and transcribers, whatever that judgement
may be deemed worth, the Ammonian sections had a previous existence to the
Eusebian canons, as well as served for an independent purpose(74).

In his letter to Carpianus, their inventor clearly yet briefly describes
the purpose of his canons, ten in number. The first contains a list of
seventy-one places in which all the four Evangelists have a narrative,
discourse, or saying in common: the second of 111 places in which the
three Matthew, Mark, Luke agree: the third of twenty-two places common to
Matthew, Luke, John: the fourth of twenty-six passages common to Matthew,
Mark, John: the fifth of eighty-two places in which the two Matthew, Luke
coincide: the sixth of forty-seven places wherein Matthew, Mark agree: the
seventh of seven places common to Matthew and John: the eighth of fourteen
places common to Luke and Mark: the ninth of twenty-one places in which
Luke and John agree: the tenth of sixty-two passages of Matthew,
twenty-one of Mark, seventy-one of Luke, and ninety-seven of John which
have no parallels, but are peculiar to a single Evangelist. Under each of
the 1165 so-named Ammonian sections, in its proper place in the margin of
a manuscript, is put in coloured ink the number of that Eusebian canon to
which it refers. On looking for that section in the proper table or canon,
there will also be found the parallel place or places in the other
Gospels, each indicated by its proper numeral, and so readily searched
out. A single example will serve to explain our meaning. In the facsimile
of the Cotton fragment (Plate v. No. 14), in the margin of the passage
(John xv. 20) we see _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}_ over {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}, where {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~} (139) is the proper section
of St. John, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~} (3) the number of the canon. On searching the third
Eusebian table we read MT. [symbol], {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}. _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}_, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}. _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}_ and thus we learn
that the first clause of John xv. 20 is parallel in sense to the ninetieth
([symbol]) section of St. Matthew (x. 24), and to the fifty-eighth (_{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}_)
of St. Luke (vi. 40). The advantage of such a system of parallels to the
exact study of the Gospels is too evident to need insisting on.

4. The Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles are also divided into
_chapters_ ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}), in design precisely the same as the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} or
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} of the Gospels, and nearly like them in length. Since there is no
trace of these chapters in the two great Codices Alexandrinus and
Ephraemi, of the fifth century (which yet exhibit the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, the
sections, and one of them the canons), it seems reasonable to assume that
they are of later date. They are sometimes connected with the name of
Euthalius, deacon of Alexandria, afterwards Bishop of Sulci(75), whom we
have already spoken of as the reputed author of Scriptural stichometry
(_above_, p. 53). We learn, however, from Euthalius' own Prologue to his
edition of St. Paul's Epistles (A.D. 458,) that the "summary of the
chapters" (and consequently the numbers of the chapters themselves) was
taken from the work of "one of our wisest and pious fathers(76)," i.e.
some Bishop that he does not wish to particularize, whom Mill (Proleg. N.
T.  907) conjectures to be Theodore of Mopsuestia, who lay under the
censure of the Church. Soon after(77) the publication of St. Paul's
Epistles, on the suggestion of one Athanasius, then a priest and
afterwards Patriarch of Alexandria, Euthalius put forth a similar edition
of the Acts and Catholic Epistles(78), also divided into chapters, with a
summary of contents at the head of each chapter. Even these he is thought
to have derived (at least in the Acts) from the manuscript of Pamphilus
the Martyr [d. 308], to whom the same order of chapters is ascribed in a
document published by Montfaucon (Bibliotheca Coislin. p. 78); the rather
as Euthalius fairly professes to have compared his book in the Acts and
Catholic Epistles "with the copies in the library at Caesarea" which once
belonged to "Eusebius the friend of Pamphilus(79)." The Apocalypse still
remains. It was divided, about the end of the fifth century, by Andreas,
Archbishop of the Cappadocian Caesarea, into twenty-four _paragraphs_
({~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}), corresponding to the number of the elders about the throne (Apoc.
iv. 4); each paragraph being subdivided into three _chapters_
({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~})(80). The summaries which Andreas wrote of his seventy-two
chapters are still reprinted in Mill's and other large editions of the
Greek Testament.

5. To Euthalius has been also referred a division of the Acts into sixteen
lessons ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}) and of the Pauline Epistles into thirty-one (see
table on p. 67); but these lessons are quite different from the much
shorter ones adopted by the Greek Church. He is also said to have numbered
in each Epistle of St. Paul the quotations from the Old Testament(81),
which are still noted in many of our manuscripts, and is the first known
to have used that reckoning of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} which was formerly annexed we
know not when to the Gospels and Epistles, as well as to the Acts. Besides
the division of the text into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} or _lines_ (_above_, p. 52) we find
in the Gospels alone another division into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} "sentences,"
differing but little from the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in number. Of these last the precise
numbers vary in different copies, though not considerably: whether that
variation arose from the circumstance that ancient numbers were
represented by letters and so easily became corrupted, or from a different
mode of arranging the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} adopted by the various scribes.

6. It is proper to state that the _subscriptions_ ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}) appended to
St. Paul's Epistles in many manuscripts, and retained even in the
Authorized English version of the New Testament, are also said to be the
composition of Euthalius. In the best copies they are somewhat shorter in
form, but in any shape they do no credit to the care or skill of their
author, whoever he may be. "Six of these subscriptions," writes Paley in
that masterpiece of acute reasoning, the Horae Paulinae, "are false or
improbable;" that is, they are either absolutely contradicted by the
contents of the epistle [1 Cor., Galat., 1 Tim.], or are difficult to be
reconciled with them [1, 2 Thess., Tit.].

The _subscriptions_ to the Gospels have not, we believe, been assigned to
any particular author, and being seldom found in printed copies of the
Greek Testament or in modern versions, are little known to the general
reader. In the earliest manuscripts the subscriptions, as well as the
_titles_ of the books, were of the simplest character. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, &c. is all that the Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus have, whether
at the beginning or the end. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} is the subscription
to the first Gospel in the Codex Alexandrinus; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} is
placed at the beginning of the second Gospel in the same manuscript, and
the self-same words at the end of it by Codices Alex. and Ephraemi: in the
Codex Bezae (in which St. John stands second in order) we merely read
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. The
same is the case throughout the New Testament. After a while the titles
become more elaborate, and the subscriptions afford more information, the
truth of which it would hardly be safe to vouch for. The earliest worth
notice are found in the Codex Cyprius (K) of the eighth or ninth century,
which, together with those of several other copies, are given in Scholz's
Prolegomena N. T. vol. i. pp. xxix, xxx. _ad fin. Matthaei_: {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}

Those to
the other two Gospels exactly resemble St. Mark's, that of St. Luke
however being dated fifteen, that of St. John thirty-two years after our
Lord's Ascension, periods in all probability far too early to be correct.

7. The foreign matter so often inserted in later manuscripts has more
value for the antiquarian than for the critic. That splendid copy of the
Gospels Lambeth 1178, of the tenth or eleventh century, contains more such
than is often found, set off by fine illuminations. At the end of each of
the first three Gospels (but not of the fourth) are several pages relating
to them extracted from Cosmas Indicopleustes, who made the voyage which
procured him his cognomen about A.D. 522; also some iambic verses of no

8. The oldest manuscript known to be accompanied by a _catena_ (or
continuous commentary by different authors) is the palimpsest Codex
Zacynthius ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~} of Tregelles), an uncial of the eighth century. Such books
are not common, but there is a very full commentary in minute letters,
surrounding the large text in a noble copy of the Gospels, of the twelfth
century, which belonged to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps (Middle Hill
13975, since removed to Cheltenham), yet uncollated; another of St. Paul's
Epistles (No. 27) belongs to the University Library at Cambridge (Ff. 1.
30). The Apocalypse is often attended with the exposition of Andreas (p.
64), or of Arethas, also Archbishop of the Cappadocian Caesarea in the
tenth century, or (what is more usual) with a sort of epitome of the two
(e.g. Parham No. 17), above, below, and in the margin beside the text, in
much smaller characters. In _cursive_ manuscripts only the subject
({~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}), especially that written by Oecumenius in the tenth century,
sometimes stands as a _Prologue_ before each book, but not so often before
the Gospels or Apocalypse as the Acts and Epistles. Before the Acts we
occasionally meet with Euthalius' Chronology of St. Paul's Travels, or
another {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}. The Leicester manuscript contains between the
Pauline Epistles and the Acts (1) An Exposition of the Creed and statement
of the errors condemned by the seven general Councils, ending with the
second at Nice. (2) Lives of the Apostles, followed by an exact
description of the limits of the five Patriarchates. The Christ Church
copy Wake 12 also has after the Apocalypse some seven or eight pages of a
Treatise {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}_ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, including some

9. We have not thought it needful to insert in this place either a list of
the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} of the Gospels, or of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of the rest of the New
Testament, or the tables of the Eusebian canons, inasmuch as they are all
accessible in such ordinary books as Stephen's Greek Testament 1550 and
Mill's of 1707, 1710. The Eusebian canons are given in Bishop Lloyd's
Oxford Greek Test. of 1827 &c. and in Tischendorf's of 1859. We exhibit,
however, for the sake of comparison, a tabular view of "Ancient and Modern
Divisions of the New Testament." The numbers of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in
the Gospels are derived from the most approved sources, but a synopsis of
the variations of manuscripts in this respect has been drawn up by Scholz,
Prolegomena N. T. vol. i. Cap. v, pp. xxviii, xxix(84). A computation of
their number, as also of that of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, is often given in the
subscription at the end of a book.

10. On the divisions into chapters and verses prevailing in our modern
Bibles we need not dwell long. For many centuries the Latin Church used
the Greek {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} (which they called _breves_) with the Euthalian {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~},
and some of their copies even retained the calculation by {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}: but
about A.D. 1248 Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro, while preparing a
Concordance, or index of declinable words, for the _whole Bible_, divided
it into its present chapters, subdividing them in turn into several parts
by placing the letters A, B, C, D &c. in the margin, at equal distances
from each other, as we still see in many old printed books, e.g. Stephen's
N. T. of 1550. Cardinal Hugo's divisions, unless indeed he merely adopted
them from Lanfranc or some other scholar, such as was very probably
Stephen Langton the celebrated Archbishop of Canterbury, soon took
possession of copies of the Latin Vulgate; they gradually obtained a place
in later Greek manuscripts, especially those written in the West of
Europe, and are found in the earliest printed and all later editions of
the Greek Testament, though still unknown to the Eastern Church. They
certainly possess no strong claim on our preference, although they cannot
now be superseded. The chapters are inconveniently and capriciously
unequal in length; occasionally too they are distributed with much lack of
judgement. Thus Matt. xv. 39 belongs to ch. xvi, and perhaps ch. xix. 30
to ch. xx; Mark ix. 1 properly appertains to the preceding chapter; Luke
xxi. 1-4 had better be united with ch. xx, as in Mark xii. 41-44; Acts v
might as well commence with Acts iv. 32; Acts viii. 1 (or at least its
first clause) should not have been separated from ch. vii; Acts xxi
concludes with strange abruptness. Bp. Terrot (on Ernesti's Institutes,
vol. ii. p. 21) rightly affixes 1 Cor. iv. 1-5 to ch. iii. Add that 1 Cor.
xi. 1 belongs to ch. x; 2 Cor. iv. 18 and vi. 18 to ch. v and ch. vii
respectively: Col. iv. 1 must clearly go with ch. iii.

In commendation of the modern verses still less can be said. As they are
stated to have been constructed after the model of the ancient {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
(called "_versus_" in the Latin manuscripts), we have placed in the Table
the exact number of each for every book in the New Testament. Of the
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} we reckon 19241 in all, of the modern verses 7959(85), so that on
the average (for we have seen that the manuscript variations in the number
of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} are but inconsiderable) we may calculate about five {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} to
every two modern verses. The fact is that some such division is, simply
indispensable to every accurate reader of Scripture; and Cardinal Hugo's
divisions by letters of the alphabet, as well as those adopted by Sanctes
Pagninus in his Latin version of the whole Bible (1528), having proved
inconveniently large, Robert Stephen, the justly celebrated printer and
editor of the Greek Testament, undertook to form a system of
verse-divisions, taking for his model the short verses into which the
Hebrew Bible had already been divided, as it would seem by Rabbi Nathan,
in the preceding century. We are told by Henry Stephen (Praef.
Concordantiae) that his father Robert executed this design on a journey
from Paris to Lyons "_inter equitandum_(86);" that is, we presume, while
resting at the inns on the road. Certain it is that, although every such
division must be in some measure arbitrary, a very little care would have
spared us many of the disadvantages attending that which Robert Stephen
first published at Geneva in his Greek Testament of 1551, from which it
was introduced into the text of the Genevan English Testament of 1557,
into Beza's Greek Testament of 1565, and thence into subsequent editions.
It is now too late to correct the errors of the verse-divisions, but they
can be neutralized, at least in a great degree, by the plan adopted by
modern critics, of banishing both the verses and the chapters into the
margin, and breaking the text into paragraphs, better suited to the sense.
The _pericopae_ or sections of Bengel(87) (whose labours will be described
in their proper place) have been received with general approbation, and
adopted, with some modification, by several recent editors. Much pains
were bestowed on their arrangement of the paragraphs by the Revisers of
the English version of 1881.

11. We now come to the _contents_ of manuscripts of the Greek Testament,
and must distinguish regular copies of the sacred volume or of parts of it
from Lectionaries, or Church-lesson books, containing only extracts,
arranged in the order of Divine Service daily throughout the year. The
latter we will consider presently: with regard to the former it is right
to bear in mind, that comparatively few copies of the whole New Testament
remain; the usual practice being to write the four Gospels in one volume,
the Acts and Epistles in another: manuscripts of the Apocalypse, which was
little used for public worship, being much rarer than those of the other
books. Occasionally the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles form a single volume;
sometimes the Apocalypse is added to other books; as to the Pauline
Epistles in Lambeth 1186, or even to the Gospels, in a later hand (e.g.
Cambridge University Libr. Dd. 9. 69: Gospels No. 60, _dated_ A.D. 1297).
The Apocalypse, being a short work, is often found bound up in volumes
containing very miscellaneous matter (e.g. Vatican. 2066 or B; Brit. Mus.
Harleian. 5678, No. 31; and Oxon. Barocc. 48, No. 28). The Codex
Sinaiticus of Tischendorf is the more precious, in that it happily
exhibits the whole New Testament complete: so would also the Codices
Alexandrinus and Ephraemi, but that they are sadly mutilated: no other
uncial copies have this advantage, and very few cursives. In England only
five such are known, the great Codex Leicestrensis, which is imperfect at
the beginning and end; Butler 2 (Evan. 201) Additional 11837, dated A.D.
1357, and (Evan. 584) Additional 17469, both in the British Museum;
Canonici 34 (Evan. 488) in the Bodleian, dated A.D. 1515-16. Additional
MS. 28815 (Evan. 603, and Paul 266, and Apoc. 89) in the British Museum
and B-C. II. 4 at Sir Roger Cholmely's School, Highgate, are separated
portions of one complete copy. The Apocalypse in the well-known Codex
Montfortianus at Dublin is usually considered to be by a later hand.
Besides these Scholz enumerates only nineteen foreign copies of the whole
New Testament(88); making but twenty-four in all, as far as was then
known, out of the vast mass of extant documents.

12. Whether copies contain the whole or a part of the sacred volume, the
general _order_ of the books is the following: Gospels, Acts, Catholic
Epistles, Pauline Epistles, Apocalypse. A solitary manuscript of the
fifteenth century (Venet. 10, Evan. 209) places the Gospels between the
Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse(89); in the Codices Sinaiticus,
Leicestrensis, Fabri (Evan. 90), and Montfortianus, as in the Bodleian
Canonici 34, the copy in the King's Library Brit. Mus. (Act. 20), and the
Complutensian edition (1514), the Pauline Epistles precede the Acts. The
Pauline Epistles stand between the Acts and the Catholic Epistles in
Phillipps 1284, Evan. 527; Parham 71. 6, Evan. 534; Upsal, Sparfwenfeldt
42, Acts 68; Paris Reg. 102 A, Acts 119; Reg. 103 A, Acts 120. In Oxford
Bodl. Miscell. 74 the order is Acts, Cath. Epp., Apocalypse, Paul. Epp.,
but an earlier hand wrote from 3 John onwards. In Evan. 51 Dr. C. R.
Gregory points out minute indications that the scribe, not the binder, set
the Gospels last. In the Memphitic and Thebaic the Acts follow the
Catholic Epistles (_see_ below, vol. ii, chap. iii). The Codex Basiliensis
(No. 4 of the Epistles), Acts Cod. 134, Brit. Mus. Addl. 19388, Lambeth
1182, 1183, and Burdett-Coutts III. 1, have the Pauline Epistles
immediately after the Acts and before the Catholic Epistles, as in our
present Bibles. Scholz's Evan. 368 stands thus, St. John's Gospel,
Apocalypse, then all the Epistles; in Havniens. 1 (Cod. 234 of the
Gospels, A.D. 1278) the order appears to be Acts, Paul. Ep., Cath. Ep.,
Gospels; in Ambros. Z 34 _sup._ at Milan, Dean Burgon testifies that the
Catholic and Pauline Epistles are followed by the Gospels; in Basil. B.
vi. 27 or Cod. 1, the Gospels have been bound after the Acts and Epistles;
while in Evan. 175 the Apocalypse stands between the Acts and Catholic
Epistles; in Evan. 51 the binder has set the Gospels last: these, however,
are mere accidental exceptions to the prevailing rule(90). The four
Gospels are almost invariably found in their familiar order, although in
the Codex Bezae (as we partly saw above, p. 65) they stand Matthew, John,
Luke, Mark(91); in the Codex Monacensis (X) John, Luke, Mark, Matthew (but
two leaves of Matthew _also_ stand before John), also in the Latin _k_; in
Cod. 90 (Fabri) John, Luke, Matthew, Mark; in Cod. 399 at Turin John,
Luke, Matthew, an arrangement which Dr. Hort refers to the Commentary of
Titus of Bostra on St. Luke which accompanies it; in the Curetonian Syriac
version Matthew, Mark, John, Luke. In the Pauline Epistles that to the
Hebrews immediately follows the second to the Thessalonians in the four
great Codices Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, and Ephraemi(92): in
the copy from which the Cod. Vatican. was taken the Hebrews followed the
Galatians (_above_, p. 57). The Codex Claromontanus, the document next in
importance to these four, sets the Colossians appropriately enough next to
its kindred and contemporaneous Epistle to the Ephesians, but postpones
that to the Hebrews to Philemon, as in our present Bibles: an arrangement
which at first, no doubt, originated in the early scruples prevailing in
the Western Church, with respect to the authorship and canonical authority
of that divine epistle.

13. We must now describe the _Lectionaries_ or Service-books of the Greek
Church, in which the portions of Scripture publicly read throughout the
year are set down in chronological order, without regard to their actual
places in the sacred volume. In length and general arrangement they
resemble not so much the Lessons as the Epistles and Gospels in our
English Book of Common Prayer, only that every day in the year has its own
proper portion, and the numerous Saints' days independent services of
their own. These Lectionaries consist either of lessons from the Gospels,
and are then called _Evangelistaria_ or _Evangeliaria_
({~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~})(93); or from the Acts and Epistles; termed
_Praxapostolos_ ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}) or _Apostolos_(94): the general name of
Lectionary is often, though incorrectly, confined to the latter class. A
few books called {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} have lessons taken both from the
Gospels and the Apostolic writings. In _Euchologies_, or Books of Offices,
wherein both the _Apostolos_ and the _Gospels_ are found, the former
always precede in each Office, just as the Epistle precedes the Gospel in
the Service-books of Western Christendom. The peculiar arrangement of
Lectionaries renders them very unfit for the hasty, partial, cursory
collation which has befallen too many manuscripts of the other class, and
this circumstance, joined with the irksomeness of using Service-books
never familiar to the habits even of scholars in this part of Europe, has
caused these documents to be so little consulted, that the contents of the
very best and oldest among them have until recently been little known.
Matthaei, of whose elaborate and important edition of the Greek Testament
(12 tom. Riga 1782-88) we shall give an account hereafter, has done
excellent service in this department; two of his best copies, the uncials
B and H (Nos. 47, 50), being Evangelistaria. The present writer also has
collated three noble uncials of the same rank, Arundel 547 being of the
ninth century, Parham 18 bearing date A.D. 980, Harleian 5598, A.D. 995.
Not a few other uncial Lectionaries remain quite neglected, for though
none of them perhaps are older than the eighth century, the ancient
character was retained for these costly and splendid Service-books till
about the eleventh century (Montfaucon, Palaeogr. Graec. p. 260), before
which time the cursive hand was generally used in other Biblical
manuscripts. There is, of course, no place in a Lectionary for divisions
by {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, for the so-called Ammonian sections, or for the canons of
Eusebius.

The division of the New Testament into Church-lessons was, however, of far
more remote antiquity than the employment of separate volumes to contain
them. Towards the end of the fourth century, that golden age of Patristic
theology, Chrysostom recognizes some stated order of the lessons as
familiar to all his hearers, for he exhorts them to peruse and mark
beforehand the passages ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}(95)) of the Gospels which were to be
publicly read to them the ensuing Sunday or Saturday(96). All the
information we can gather favours the notion that there was no great
difference between the calendar of Church-lessons in earlier and later
stages. Not only do they correspond in all cases where such agreement is
natural, as in the proper services for the great feasts and fasts, but in
such purely arbitrary arrangements as the reading of the book of Genesis,
instead of the Gospels, on the week days of Lent; of the Acts all the time
between Easter and Pentecost(97); and the selection of St. Matthew's
history of the Passion alone at the Liturgy on Good Friday(98). The
earliest formal _Menologium_, or Table of proper lessons, now extant is
prefixed to the Codex Cyprius (K) of the eighth or ninth century; another
is found in the Codex Campianus (M), which is perhaps a little later; they
are more frequently found than the contrary in later manuscripts of every
kind; while there are comparatively few copies that have not been
accommodated to ecclesiastical use either by their original scribe or a
later hand, by means of noting the proper days for each lesson (often in
red ink) at the top or bottom or in the margin of the several pages. Not
only in the margin, but even in the text itself are perpetually
interpolated, mostly in vermilion or red ink, the beginning ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~})
and ending ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}) of each lesson, and the several words to be
inserted or substituted in order to suit the purpose of public reading;
from which source (as we have stated above, p. 11) various readings have
almost unavoidably sprung: e.g. in Acts iii. 11 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} of the
Lectionaries ultimately displaced {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} from the text itself.

We purpose to annex to this Chapter a table of lessons throughout the
year, according to the use laid down in Synaxaria, Menologies, and
Lectionaries, as well to enable the student to compare the proper lessons
of the Greek Church with our own, as to facilitate reference to the
manuscripts themselves, which are now placed almost out of the reach of
the inexperienced. On comparing the manner in which the terms are used by
different scribes and authors, we conceive that _Synaxarion_ ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~})
is, like Eclogadion, a name used for a table of daily lessons for the year
beginning at Easter, and that these have varied but slightly in the course
of many ages throughout the whole Eastern Church; that tables of Saints'
day lessons, called _Menologies_, ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}), distributed in order of
the months from September (when the new year and the indiction began) to
August, differed widely from each other, both in respect to the lessons
read and the days kept holy(99). While the great feasts remained entirely
the same, different generations and provinces and even dioceses had their
favourite worthies, whose memory they specially cherished; so that the
character of the menology (which sometimes forms a larger, sometimes but a
small portion of a Lectionary) will often guide us to the country and
district in which the volume itself was written. The Parham
Evangelistarium 18 affords us a conspicuous example of this fact: coming
from a region of which we know but little (Ciscissa in Cappadocia Prima),
its menology in many particulars but little resembles those usually met
with(100).

14. It only remains to say a few words about the _notation_ adopted to
indicate the several classes of manuscripts of the Greek Testament. These
classes are six in number; that containing the Gospels (_Evangelia_ or
_Evan._), or the Acts and Catholic Epistles (_Act._ and _Cath._), or the
Pauline Epistles (_Paul._), or the Apocalypse (_Apoc._), or Lectionaries
of the Gospels (_Evangelistaria_ or _Evst._), or those of the Acts and
Epistles (_Apostolos_ or _Apost._). When one manuscript (as often happens)
belongs to more than one of these classes, its distinct parts are numbered
separately, so that a copy of the whole New Testament will appear in four
lists, and be reckoned four times over. All critics are agreed in
distinguishing the documents written in the uncial character by capital
letters; the custom having originated in the accidental circumstance that
the Codex Alexandrinus was designated as Cod. A in the lower margin of
Walton's Polyglott. Lectionaries in uncial letters are not marked by
capitals, but by Arabic numerals, like cursive manuscripts of all
classes(101). Of course no system can escape some attendant evils. Even
the catalogue of the later manuscripts is often upon its first appearance
full of mis-statements, of repetitions and loose descriptions, which must
be remedied and supplied in subsequent examination, so far as opportunity
is granted from time to time. In describing the uncials (as we purpose to
do in the two next chapters) our course is tolerably plain; but the lists
that comprise the last eight chapters of this volume, and which
respectively detail the cursive manuscripts and the Lectionaries of the
Greek Testament, must be regarded only as an approximation to what such an
enumeration ought to be, though much pains and time have been spent upon
them: the comparatively few copies which seem to be sufficiently known are
distinguished by an asterisk from their less fortunate kindred.

For indeed the only method of grappling with the perplexity produced by
the large additions of manuscripts, especially of the cursive character,
which constant discovery has effected during late years, is to enumerate
arithmetically those which have been supplied from time to time, as was
done in the last edition of this work, carefully noting if they have been
examined by a competent judge or especially if they have been properly
collated. In the Appendix of the third edition, the late Dean Burgon
continued his work in this direction by adding a list of some three
hundred and seventy-four cursives, besides the others with which he had
previously increased the number before known. That list, as was stated in
the Postscript to the Preface, awaited an examination and collation by
competent persons. Such an examination has been made in many instances by
Dr. C. R. Gregory, who also, whether fired by Dean Burgon's example as
shown in his published letters in the _Guardian_ or not, has in his turn
added with most commendable diligence in research a very large number of
MSS. previously unknown. Some more have been added in this edition, but
much work is still required of scholars, before this mass of materials can
be used with effect by Textual students.

We have now traced the daily service of the Greek Church, as derived from
the Gospels, throughout the whole year, from Easter Day to Easter Even,
only that in Lent the lessons from the 2nd to the 6th days inclusive in
each week are taken from the book of Genesis. The reader will observe that
from Easter to Pentecost St. John and the Acts are read for seven weeks,
or eight Sundays. The first Sunday after Pentecost is the Greek All
Saints' Day, their Trinity Sunday being virtually kept a fortnight
earlier; but from the Monday next after the day of Pentecost (Whit-Monday)
St. Matthew is used continuously every day for eleven weeks and as many
Sundays. For six weeks more, St. Matthew is appointed for the Saturday and
Sunday lessons, St. Mark for the other days of the week. But inasmuch as
St. Luke was to be taken up with the new year, the year of the indiction
[Arund. 547], which in this case must be September 24(105), if all the
lessons in Matthew and Mark were not read out by this time (which, unless
Easter was very early, would not be the case), they were at once broken
off, and (after proper lessons had been employed for the Sunday before and
the Saturday and Sunday which followed(106) the feast of the Elevation of
the Cross, Sept. 14) the lessons from St. Luke (seventeen weeks and
sixteen Sundays in all) were taken up and read on as far as was necessary:
only that the 17th Sunday of St. Matthew (called from the subject of its
Gospel _the Canaanitess_) was always resumed on the Sunday preceding that
before the Carnival ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}), which is also named from its Gospel
that of _the Prodigal_, and answers to the Latin _Septuagesima_. Then
follow the Sunday of the Carnival ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}) or _Sexagesima_, that of the
_Cheese-eater_ ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}) or _Quinquagesima_, and the six Sundays in
Lent. The whole number of Sunday Gospels in the year (even reckoning the
two interpolated about September 14) is thus only fifty-three, the
_Canaanitess_ coming twice over: but in the Menology or Catalogue of
immoveable feasts will be found proper lessons for three Saturdays and
Sundays about Christmas and Epiphany, which could either be substituted
for, or added to the ordinary Gospels for the year, according as the
distance from Easter in one year to Easter in the next exceeded or fell
short of fifty-two weeks. The system of lessons from the Acts and Epistles
is much simpler than that of the Gospels: it exhibits fifty-two Sundays in
the year, without any of the complicated arrangements of the other scheme.
Since the Epistles from the Saturday of the 16th week after Pentecost to
the Sunday of the Prodigal could not be set (like the rest) by the side of
their corresponding Gospels, they are given separately in the following
table(107).

ON THE MENOLOGY, OR CALENDAR OF IMMOVEABLE FESTIVALS AND SAINTS' DAYS.


We cannot in this place enter very fully into this portion of the contents
of Lectionaries, inasmuch as, for reasons we have assigned above, the
investigation would be both tedious and difficult. All the great
feast-days, however, as well as the commemorations of the Apostles and of
a few other Saints, occur alike in all the books, and ought not to be
omitted here. We commence with the month of September (the opening of the
year at Constantinople), as do all the Lectionaries and Synaxaria we have
seen(108).

CHAPTER IV. THE LARGER UNCIAL MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GREEK TESTAMENT.


We proceed to describe in detail the uncial manuscripts of the Greek
Testament, arranged separately as copies of the Gospels, of the Acts and
Catholic Epistles, of the Pauline Epistles, and of the Apocalypse. They
are usually indicated by the capital letters of the English and Greek
alphabets, and stand on the list not in the order of their relative value
or antiquity, but mainly as they were applied from time to time to the
purposes of Textual criticism.

{~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} (_Aleph_). CODEX SINAITICUS, now at St. Petersburg, the justly
celebrated copy which sometime ago for a quarter of a century attracted
general attention in the learned world. Tischendorf (Notitia Ed. Cod.
Sinaitici, pp. 5, 6) when travelling in 1844 under the patronage of his
own sovereign, King Frederick Augustus of Saxony, picked out of a basket
full of papers destined to light the oven of the Convent of St. Catherine
on Mount Sinai, the forty-three leaves of the Septuagint which he
published in 1846 as the Codex Friderico-Augustanus (_see_ p. 32). These,
of course, he easily got for the asking, but finding that further portions
of the same codex (e.g. the whole of Isaiah and 1, 4 Maccabees) were
extant, he rescued them from their probable fate, by enlightening the
brotherhood as to their value. He was permitted to copy one page of what
yet remained, containing the end of Isaiah and the beginning of Jeremiah,
which he afterwards published in the first volume of his "Monumenta Sacra
Inedita" (1855), pp. xxx. and 213-16; and he departed in the full hope
that he should be allowed to purchase the whole. But he had taught the
monks a sharp lesson, and neither then, nor on his subsequent visit in
1853, could he gain any tidings of the leaves he had left behind;--he even
seems to have concluded that they had been carried into Europe by some
richer or more fortunate collector. At the beginning of 1859, after the
care of the seventh edition of his N. T. was happily over, he went for a
third time into the East, under the well-deserved patronage of the Emperor
of Russia, the great protector of the Oriental Church; and the treasure
which had been twice withdrawn from him as a private traveller, was now,
on the occasion of some chance conversation, spontaneously put into the
hands of one sent from the champion and benefactor of the oppressed
Church. Tischendorf touchingly describes his surprise, his joy, his
midnight studies over the priceless volume ("_quippe dormire nefas
videbatur_") on that memorable 4th of February, 1859. The rest was easy;
he was allowed to copy his prize at Cairo, and ultimately to bring it to
Europe, as a tribute of duty and gratitude to the Emperor Alexander II. To
that monarch's wise munificence both the larger edition (1862), and the
smaller of the New Testament only (1863), are mainly due.

The Codex Sinaiticus is 13-1/2 inches in length by 14-7/8 inches high, and
consists of 346-1/2 leaves of the same beautiful vellum as the Cod.
Friderico-Augustanus which is really a part of it whereof 199 contain
portions of the Septuagint version, 147-1/2 the whole New Testament,
Barnabas' Epistle, and a considerable fragment of Hermas' Shepherd. It has
subsequently appeared that the Russian Archimandrite (afterwards Bishop)
Porphyry had brought with him from Sinai in 1845 some pieces of Genesis
xxiii, xxiv, and of Numbers v, vi, and vii, which had been applied long
before to the binding of other books(113). Each page comprises four
columns (_see_ p. 27), with forty-eight lines in each column, of those
continuous, noble, simple uncials (_compare_ Plate iv. 11 a _with_ 11 b).
The poetical books of the Old Testament, however, being written in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~},
admit of only two columns on a page (_above_, p. 52). "In the Catholic
Epistles the scribe has frequently contented himself with a column of
forty-seven lines(114)." The order of the sacred books is remarkable,
though by no means unprecedented. St. Paul's Epistles precede the Acts,
and amongst them, that to the Hebrews follows 2 Thess., standing on the
same page with it (p. 74). Although this manuscript has hitherto been
inspected by few Englishmen (Tregelles, however, and Dean Stanley were
among the number), yet its general aspect has grown familiar to us by the
means of photographs of its most important pages taken for the use of
private scholars(115), as well as from the facsimiles contained in
Tischendorf's several editions. Breathings and accents there are none
except in Tobit vi. 9, and Gal. v. 21, as has been already mentioned: the
apostrophus and the single point for punctuation are entirely absent for
pages together, yet occasionally are rather thickly studded, not only in
places where a later hand has been unusually busy (e.g. Isaiah i. 1-iii.
2, two pages), but in some others (e.g. in 2 Cor. xii. 20 there are eight
stops). Even words very usually abridged (except _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}_,
_{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}_ which are constant) are here written in full though the practice
varies, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}: we find {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~} or
_{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}_: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK OXIA~}, _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}_, _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}_, _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK OXIA~}_. Tischendorf considers the two
points over iota and upsilon (which are sometimes wanting) as seldom from
the first hand: the mark >, besides its rather rare marginal use in
citations (_see_ p. 64, note 4), we notice in the text oftener in the Old
Testament than in the New. Words are divided at the end of a line: thus {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}
in {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}, and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~} in {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~} are separated(116). Small letters, of the most
perfect shape, freely occur in all places, especially at the end of lines,
where the _superscript_ (_see_ p. 50) is almost always made to represent {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}
(e.g. seventeen times in Mark i. 1-35). Other _compendia scribendi_ are {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}
for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~} written as in Plate i. No. 2(117). Numerals are
represented by letters, with a straight line placed over them, e.g. _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}_
Mark i. 13. Although there are no capitals, the initial letter of a line
which begins a paragraph generally (not always) stands out from the rank
of the rest, as in the Old Testament portion of Cod. Vaticanus, and less
frequently in the New, after the fashion of certain earlier pieces on
papyrus. The titles and subscriptions of the several books are as short as
possible (_see_ p. 65). The {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} _majora_ are absent; the
margin contains the so-called Ammonian sections and Eusebian canons, but
Tischendorf is positive that neither they nor such notes as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}_
(_see_ p. 53, note 3) appended to 2 Thessalonians, are by the original
scribe, although they may possibly be due to a contemporary hand. From the
number of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} and other errors, one cannot affirm that it is very
carefully written. Its itacisms are of the oldest type, and those not
constant; chiefly {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, and much more rarely {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} and
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} interchanged. The grammatical forms commonly termed Alexandrian occur,
pretty much as in other manuscripts of the earliest date. The whole
manuscript is disfigured by corrections, a few by the original scribe, or
by the usual comparer or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} (_see_ p. 55); very many by an ancient
and elegant hand of the sixth century ({~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}a), whose emendations are of great
importance; some again by a hand but little later ({~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}b); far the greatest
number by a scholar of the seventh century ({~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}c), who often cancels the
changes introduced by ({~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}a); others by as many as eight several later
writers, whose varying styles Tischendorf has carefully discriminated and
illustrated by facsimiles(118).

The foregoing considerations were bringing even cautious students to a
general conviction that Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, if not, as its enthusiastic discoverer had
announced, "omnium antiquissimus" in the absolute sense of the words, was
yet but little lower in date than the Vatican manuscript itself, and a
veritable relic of the middle of the fourth century--the presence in its
margin of the sections and canons of Eusebius [d. 340?], by a hand nearly
if not quite contemporaneous, seems to preclude the notion of higher
antiquity(119)--when Constantino Simonides, a Greek of Syme, who had just
edited a few papyrus fragments of the New Testament alleged to have been
written in the first century of the Christian era, suddenly astonished the
learned world in 1862 by claiming to be himself the scribe who had penned
this manuscript in the monastery of Panteleemon on Mount Athos, as
recently as in the years 1839 and 1840. The writer of these pages must
refer to the Introduction to his Collation of the Codex Sinaiticus (pp.
lx-lxxii, 2nd edition, 1867) for a statement of the reasons which have
been universally accepted as conclusive, why the manuscript which
Simonides may very well have written under the circumstances he has
described neither was nor possibly could be that venerable document. The
discussion of the whole question, however, though painful enough in some
aspects, was the means of directing attention to certain peculiarities of
Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} which might otherwise have been overlooked. While engaged in
demonstrating that it could not have been transcribed from a
Moscow-printed Bible, as was "Cod. Simoneidos" (to borrow the designation
employed by its author), critics came to perceive that either this copy or
its immediate prototype must have been derived from a papyrus exemplar,
and that probably of Egyptian origin (Collation, &c. pp. viii; xiv;
lxviii), a confirmation of the impression conveyed to the reader by a
first glance at the eight narrow columns of each open leaf (p. 28). The
claim of Simonides to be the sole writer of a book which must have
consisted when complete of about 730 leaves, or 1460 pages of very large
size (Collation, &c. p. xxxii), and that too within the compass of eight
or ten months(120) (he inscribed on his finished work, as he tells us, the
words {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}), made it important to scrutinize the
grounds of Tischendorf's judgement that four several scribes had been
engaged upon it, one of whom, as he afterwards came to persuade himself,
was the writer of its rival, Codex Vaticanus(121). Such an investigation,
so far as it depends only on the handwriting, can scarcely be carried out
satisfactorily without actual examination of the manuscript itself, which
is unfortunately not easily within the reach of those who could use it
independently; but it is at all events quite plain, as well from internal
considerations as from minute peculiarities in the writing, such as the
frequent use of the apostrophus and of the mark > (_see above_, p. 50) on
some sheets and their complete absence from others (Collation, &c. pp.
xvi-xviii; xxxii; xxxvii), that at least two, and probably more, persons
have been employed on the several parts of the volume(122).

It is indeed a strange coincidence, although unquestionably it can be
nothing more, that Simonides should have brought to the West from Mount
Athos some years before one genuine fragment of the Shepherd of Hermas in
Greek, and the transcript of a second (both of which materially aided
Tischendorf in editing the remains of that Apostolic Father), when taken
in connexion with the fact that the worth of Codex Sinaiticus is vastly
enhanced by its exhibiting next to the Apocalypse, and on the same page
with its conclusion, the only complete extant copy, besides the one
discovered by Bryennios in 1875, of the Epistle of Barnabas in Greek,
followed by a considerable portion of this self-same Shepherd of Hermas,
much of which, as well as of Barnabas, was previously known to us only in
the Old Latin translation. Both these works are included in the list of
books of the New Testament contained in the great Codex Claromontanus D of
St. Paul's Epistles, to be described hereafter, Barnabas standing there in
an order sufficiently remarkable; and their presence, like that of the
Epistles of Clement at the end of Codex Alexandrinus (p. 99), brings us
back to a time when the Church had not yet laid aside the primitive custom
of reading publicly in the congregation certain venerated writings which
have never been regarded exactly in the same light as Holy Scripture
itself. Between the end of Barnabas and the opening of the Shepherd are
lost the last six leaves of a quaternion (which usually consists of eight)
numbered 91 at its head in a fairly ancient hand. The limited space would
not suffice for the insertion of Clement's genuine Epistle, since the head
of the next quaternion is numbered 92, but might suit one of the other
uncanonical books on the list in Cod. Claromontanus, viz. the Acts of Paul
and the Revelation of Peter.

With regard to the deeply interesting question as to the critical
character of Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, although it strongly supports the Codex Vaticanus in
many characteristic readings, yet it cannot be said to give its exclusive
adherence to any of the witnesses hitherto examined. It so lends its grave
authority, now to one and now to another, as to convince us more than ever
of the futility of seeking to derive the genuine text of the New Testament
from any one copy, however ancient and, on the whole, trustworthy, when
evidence of a wide and varied character is at hand.

A. CODEX ALEXANDRINUS in the British Museum, where the open volume of the
New Testament is publicly shown in the Manuscript room. It was placed in
that Library on its formation in 1753, having previously belonged to the
king's private collection from the year 1628, when Cyril Lucar, Patriarch
of Constantinople (whose crude attempts to reform the Eastern Church on
the model of Geneva ultimately provoked the untoward Synod of Bethlehem in
1672(123)), sent this most precious document by our Ambassador in Turkey,
Sir Thomas Roe, as a truly royal gift to Charles I. An Arabic inscription,
several centuries old, at the back of the Table of Contents on the first
leaf of the manuscript, and translated into Latin in another hand, which
Mr. W. Aldis Wright recognizes as Bentley's (Academy, April 17, 1875),
states that it was written by the hand of Thecla the Martyr(124). A recent
Latin note on the first page of the first of two fly-leaves declares that
it was given to the Patriarchal Chamber in the year of the Martyrs, 814
[A.D. 1098]. Another, and apparently the earliest inscription, in an
obscure Moorish-Arabic scrawl, set at the foot of the first page of
Genesis, was thus translated for Baber by Professor Nicoll of Oxford,
"Dicatus est Cellae Patriarchae in urbe munita Alexandria. Qui eum ex ea
extraxerit sit anathematizatus, vi avulsus. Athanasius humilis" (Cod.
Alex. V.T., Prolegomena, p. xxvi, note 92). That the book was brought from
Alexandria by Cyril (who had been Patriarch of that see from 1602 to 1621)
need not be disputed, although Wetstein, on the doubtful authority of
Matthew Muttis of Cyprus, Cyril's deacon, concludes that he procured it
from Mount Athos. In the volume itself the Patriarch has written and
subscribed the following words: "Liber iste scripturae sacrae N. et V.
Testamenti, prout ex traditione habemus, est scriptus manu Theclae,
nobilis foeminae Aegyptiae, ante mile [sic] et trecentos annos circiter,
paulo post Concilium Nicenum. Nomen Theclae in fine libri erat exaratum,
sed extincto Christianismo in Aegypto a Mahometanis, et libri una
Christianorum in similem sunt reducti conditionem. Extinctum ergo est
Theclae nomen et laceratum, sed memoria et traditio recens observat."
Cyril seems to lean wholly on the Arabic inscription on the first leaf of
the volume: independent testimony he would appear to have received none.

This celebrated manuscript, the earliest of first-rate importance applied
by scholars to the criticism of the text, and yielding in value to but one
or two at the utmost, is now bound in four volumes, whereof three contain
the Septuagint version of the Old Testament almost complete(125), the
fourth volume the New Testament with several lamentable defects. In St.
Matthew's Gospel some twenty-five leaves are wanting up to ch. xxv. 6
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, from John vi. 50 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} to viii. 52 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}(126) two leaves are
lost, and three leaves from 2 Cor. iv. 13 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} to xii. 6 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}. All
the other books of the New Testament are here entire, the Catholic
Epistles following the Acts, that to the Hebrews standing before the
Pastoral Epistles (_see above_, p. 74). After the Apocalypse we find what
was till very recently the only known extant copy of the first or genuine
Epistle of Clement of Rome, and a small fragment of a second of suspected
authenticity, both in the same hand as the latter part of the New
Testament. It would appear also that these two Epistles of Clement were
designed to form a part of the volume of Scripture, for in the Table of
Contents exhibited on the first leaf of the manuscript under the head {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}, they are represented as immediately following the
Apocalypse: next is given the number of books, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}, the numerals
being now illegible; and after this, as if distinct from Scripture, the
eighteen Psalms of Solomon. Such uncanonical works ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} ...
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}) were forbidden to be read in churches by the 59th canon
of the Council of Laodicea (A.D. 363?); whose 60th canon, which seems to
have been added a little later, enumerates the books of the N. T. in the
precise order seen in Cod. A, only that the Apocalypse and Clement's
Epistles do not stand on the list.

This manuscript is in quarto, 12-3/4 inches high and 10-1/4 broad, and
consists of 773 leaves (of which 639 contain the Old Testament), each page
being divided into two columns of fifty or fifty-one lines each, having
about twenty letters or upwards in a line. These letters are written
continuously in uncial characters, without any space between the words,
the uncials being of an elegant yet simple form, in a firm and uniform
hand, though in some places larger than in others. Specimens of both
styles may be seen in our facsimiles (Plate v, Nos. 12, 13)(127), the
first, Gen. i. 1, 2, being written in vermilion, the second, Acts xx. 28,
in the once black, but now yellowish-brown ink of the body of the Codex.
The punctuation, which no later hand has meddled with, consists merely of
a point placed at the end of a sentence, usually on a level with the top
of the preceding letter, but not always; and a vacant space follows the
point at the end of a paragraph, the space being proportioned to the break
in the sense. Capital letters of various sizes abound at the beginning of
books and sections, not painted as in later copies, but written by the
original scribe in common ink. As these capitals stand entirely outside
the column in the margin (excepting in such rare cases as Gen. i. 1), if
the section begins in the middle of a line, the capital is necessarily
postponed till the beginning of the next line, whose first letter is
always the capital, even though it be in the middle of a word (_see_ p.
51). Vermilion is freely used in the initial lines of books, and has stood
the test of time much better than the black ink: the first four lines of
each column on the first page of Genesis are in this colour, accompanied
with the only breathings and accents in the manuscript (_see above_, pp.
45, 46). The first line of St. Mark, the first three of St. Luke, the
first verse of St. John, the opening of the Acts down to {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, and so on for
other books, are in vermilion. At the end of each book are neat and unique
ornaments in the ink of the first hand: see especially those at the end of
St. Mark and the Acts. As we have before stated this codex is the earliest
which has the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} proper, the so-called Ammonian sections, and the
Eusebian canons complete. Lists of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} precede each Gospel,
except the first, where they are lost. Their titles stand or have stood at
the top of the pages, but the binder has often ruthlessly cut them short,
and committed other yet more serious mutilation at the edges. The places
at which they begin are indicated throughout, and their numbers are
moreover set in the margin of Luke and John. The sections and Eusebian
canons are conspicuous in the margin, and at the beginning of each of
these sections a capital letter is found. The rest of the New Testament
has no division into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, as was usual in later times, but paragraphs
and capitals occur as the sense requires.

The palaeographic reasons for assigning this manuscript to the beginning
or middle of the fifth century (the date now very generally acquiesced in,
though it may be referred even to the end of the fourth century, and is
certainly not much later) depend in part on the general style of the
writing, which is at once firm, elegant and simple; partly on the
formation of certain letters, in which respect it holds a middle place
between copies of the fourth and sixth centuries. The reader will recall
what we have already said (pp. 33-40) as to the shape of _alpha_, _delta_,
_epsilon_, _pi_, _sigma_, _phi_, and _omega_ in the Codex Alexandrinus.
Woide, who edited the New Testament, believes that two hands were employed
in that volume, changing in the page containing 1 Cor. v-vii, the vellum
of the latter portion being thinner and the ink more thick, so that it has
peeled off or eaten through the vellum in many places. This, however, is a
point on which those who know manuscripts best will most hesitate to speak
decidedly(128).

The external arguments for fixing the date are less weighty, but all point
to the same conclusion. On the evidence for its being written by St.
Thecla, indeed, no one has cared to lay much stress, though some have
thought that the scribe might belong to a monastery dedicated to that holy
martyr(129), whether the contemporary of St. Paul be meant, or her
namesake who suffered in the second year of Diocletian, A.D. 286 (Eusebius
de Martyr. Palaestin. c. iii). Tregelles explains the origin of the Arabic
inscription, on which Cyril's statement appears to rest, by remarking that
the New Testament in our manuscript at present commences with Matt. xxv.
6, this lesson (Matt. xxv. 1-13) _being that appointed by the Greek Church
for the festival of St. Thecla_ (_see above_, Menology, p. 87, Sept. 24).
Thus the Egyptian who wrote this Arabic note, observing the name of Thecla
in the now mutilated upper margin of the Codex, where such rubrical notes
are commonly placed by later hands, may have hastily concluded that she
wrote the book, and so perplexed our Biblical critics. It seems a fatal
objection to this shrewd conjecture, as Mr. E. Maunde Thompson points out,
that the Arabic numeration of the leaf, set in the _verso_ of the lower
margin, itself posterior in date to the Arabic note relating to Thecla, is
26(130); so that the twenty-five leaves now lost must have been still
extant when that note was written.

Other more trustworthy reasons for assigning Cod. A to the fifth century
may be summed up very briefly. The presence of the canons of Eusebius
[A.D. 268-340?], and of the epistle to Marcellinus by the great
Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria [300?-373], standing before the
Psalms, place a limit in one direction, while the absence of the Euthalian
divisions of the Acts and Epistles (_see above_, p. 64), which came into
vogue very soon after A.D. 458, and the shortness of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}
(_above_, p. 65), appear tolerably decisive against a later date than A.D.
450. The insertion of the Epistles of Clement, like that of the treatises
of Barnabas and Hermas in the Cod. Sinaiticus (p. 92), recalls us to a
period when the canon of Scripture was in some particulars a little
unsettled, that is, about the age of the Councils of Laodicea (363?) and
of Carthage (397). Other arguments have been urged both for an earlier and
a later date, but they scarcely deserve discussion. Wetstein's objection
to the name {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} as applied to the Blessed Virgin in the title to her
song, added to the Psalms, is quite groundless: that appellation was given
to her by both the Gregories in the middle of the fourth century (_vid._
Suicer, Thesaur. Eccles. i. p. 1387), as habitually as it was a century
after: nor should we insist much on the contrary upon Woide's or Schulz's
persuasion that the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}) would have been found in the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} after the Psalms, had
the manuscript been written as late as the fifth century.

Partial and inaccurate collations of the New Testament portion of this
manuscript were made by Patrick Young, Librarian to Charles I(131), who
first published from it the Epistles of Clement in 1633: then by Alexander
Huish, Prebendary of Wells, for Walton's Polyglott, and by some
others(132). The Old Testament portion was edited in 1707-20, after a not
very happy plan, but with learned Prolegomena and notes, by the Prussian
J. E. Grabe, the second and third of his four volumes being posthumous.

In 1786, Charles Godfrey Woide, preacher at the Dutch Chapel Royal and
Assistant Librarian in the British Museum, a distinguished Coptic scholar
[d. 1790], published, by the aid of 456 subscribers, a noble folio edition
of the New Testament from this manuscript, with valuable Prolegomena, a
copy of the text which, so far as it has been tested, has been found
reasonably accurate, together with notes on the changes made in the codex
by later hands, and a minute collation of its readings with the common
text as presented in Kuster's edition of Mill's N. T. (1710). In this last
point Woide has not been taken as a model by subsequent editors of
manuscripts, much to the inconvenience of the student. In 1816-28 the Old
Testament portion of the Codex Alexandrinus was published in three folio
volumes at the national expense, by the Rev. Henry Hervey Baber, also of
the British Museum, the Prolegomena to whose magnificent work are very
inferior to Woide's, but contain some additional information. Both these
performances, and many others like them which we shall have to describe,
are printed in an uncial type, bearing some general resemblance to that of
their respective originals, but which must not be supposed to convey any
adequate notion of their actual appearance. Such quasi-facsimiles (for
they are nothing more), while they add to the cost of the book, seem to
answer no useful purpose whatever; and, if taken by an incautious reader
for more than they profess to be, will seriously mislead him. In 1860 Mr.
B. H. Cowper put forth an octavo edition of the New Testament pages in
common type, but burdened with modern breathings and accents, the lacunae
of the manuscript being unwisely supplied by means of Kuster's edition of
Mill, and the original paragraphs departed from, wheresoever they were
judged to be inconvenient. These obvious faults are the more to be
regretted, inasmuch as Mr. Cowper has not shrunk from the labour of
revising Woide's edition by a comparison with the Codex itself, thus
giving to his book a distinctive value of its own. An admirable autotype
facsimile of the New Testament was published in 1879, and afterwards of
the Old Testament, by Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, then the Principal Keeper of
Manuscripts, now the Principal Librarian, of the British Museum.

The Codex Alexandrinus has been judged to be carelessly written; many
errors of transcription no doubt exist, but not so many as in some copies
(e.g. Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}), nor more than in others (as Cod. B). None other than the
ordinary abridgements are found in it (_see_ pp. 49-50): numerals are not
expressed by letters except in Apoc. vii. 4; xxi. 17: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} have usually
the dots over them at the beginning of a syllable. Of itacisms it may be
doubted whether it contains more than others of the same date: the
interchange of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, are the most frequent; but these
mutations are too common to prove anything touching the country of the
manuscript. Its external history renders it very likely that it was
written at Alexandria, that great manufactory of correct and elegant
copies, while Egypt was yet a Christian land: but such forms as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~},
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, and others named by Woide, are
peculiar to no single nation, but are found repeatedly in Greek-Latin
codices which unquestionably originated in Western Europe. This manuscript
is of the very greatest importance to the critic, inasmuch as it exhibits
(especially in the Gospels) a text more nearly approaching that found in
later copies than is read in others of its high antiquity, although some
of its errors are portentous enough, e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}_{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ for _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ in John xix. 40.
This topic, however, will be discussed at length in another place, and we
shall elsewhere consider the testimony Codex A bears in the celebrated
passage 1 Tim. iii. 16.

B. CODEX VATICANUS 1209 is probably the oldest large vellum manuscript in
existence, and is the glory of the great Vatican Library at Rome. To this
legitimate source of deep interest must be added the almost romantic
curiosity which was once excited by the jealous watchfulness of its
official guardians. But now that an acquaintance with it has been placed
within the reach of scholars through the magnificent autotype edition
issued by the authorities of the Vatican, it may be hoped that all such
mystic glamour will soon be left with the past. This book seems to have
been brought into the Vatican Library shortly after its establishment by
Pope Nicolas V in 1448, but nothing is known of its previous history(133).
It is entered in the earliest catalogue of that Library, made in 1475.
Since the missing portions at the end of the New Testament are believed to
have been supplied in the fifteenth century from a manuscript belonging to
Cardinal Bessarion, we may be allowed to conjecture, if we please, that
this learned Greek brought the Codex into the west of Europe. It was taken
to Paris by Napoleon I, where it was studied by Hug in 1809. Although this
book has not even yet been as thoroughly collated, or rendered as
available as it might be to the critical student, its general character
and appearance are sufficiently well known. It is a quarto volume,
arranged in quires of five sheets or ten leaves each, like Codex
Marchalianus of the Prophets written in the sixth or seventh century and
Cod. Rossanensis of the Gospels to be described hereafter, not of four or
three sheets as Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, the ancient, perhaps the original, numbering of
the quires being often found in the margin. The New Testament fills 142
out of its 759 thin and delicate vellum leaves, said to be made of the
skins of antelopes: it is bound in red morocco, being 10-1/2 inches high, 10
broad, 4-1/2 thick. It once contained the whole Bible in Greek, the Old
Testament of the Septuagint version (a tolerably fair representation of
which was exhibited in the Roman edition as early as 1587(134)), except
the books of the Maccabees and the Prayer of Manasses. The first forty-six
chapters of Genesis (the manuscript begins at {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, Gen. xlvi. 28) and
Psalms cv-cxxxvii, also the books of the Maccabees, are wanting. The New
Testament is complete down to Heb. ix. 14 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}: the rest of the Epistle to
the Hebrews (the Catholic Epistles had followed the Acts, _see_ p. 74),
and the Apocalypse, being written in the later hand alluded to above. The
peculiar arrangement of three columns on a page, or six on the opened leaf
of the volume, is described by eye-witnesses as very striking: in the
poetical books of the Old Testament (since they are written {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}) only
two columns fill a page. Our facsimile (Plate viii, No. 20) comprises Mark
xvi. 3 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} to the end of verse 8, where the Gospel ends
abruptly; both the arabesque ornament and the subscription {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}
being in a later hand (for M _see_ p. 37). All who have inspected the
Codex are loud in their praises of the fine thin vellum, the clear and
elegant hand of the first penman, the simplicity of the whole style of the
work: capital letters, so frequent in the Codex Alexandrinus, were totally
wanting in this document for some centuries. In several of these
particulars our manuscript resembles the Herculanean rolls, and thus
asserts a just claim to high antiquity, which the absence of the divisions
into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, of the sections and canons, and the substitution in their
room of another scheme of chapters of its own (described above, p. 56),
beyond question tend very powerfully to confirm. Each column contains
ordinarily forty-two lines(135), each line from sixteen to eighteen
letters, of a size somewhat less than in Cod. A, much less than in Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}
(though they all vary a little in this respect), with no intervals between
words, a space of the breadth of half a letter being left at the end of a
sentence, and a little more at the conclusion of a paragraph; the first
letter of the new sentence occasionally standing a little out of the line
(_see_ pp. 51, 93). It has been doubted whether any of the stops are
_prima manu_, and (contrary to the judgement of Birch and others) the
breathings and accents are now universally allowed to have been added by a
later hand. This hand, referred by some to the eighth century (although
Tischendorf, with Dr. Hort's approval, assigns it to the tenth or
eleventh(136)), retraced, with as much care as such an operation would
permit, the faint lines of the original writing (the ink whereof was
perhaps never quite black), the remains of which can even now be seen by a
keen-sighted reader by the side of the thicker and more modern strokes;
and, anxious at the same time to represent a critical revision of the
text, the writer left untouched such words or letters as he wished to
reject. In these last places, _where no breathings or accents and scarcely
any stops_(137)_ have ever been detected_, we have an opportunity of
seeing the manuscript in its primitive condition, before it had been
tampered with by the later scribe. There are occasional breaks in the
continuity of the writing, every descent in the genealogies of our Lord
(Matt. i, Luke iii(138)), each of the beatitudes (Matt. v), of the
parables in Matt. xiii, and the salutations of Rom. xvi, forming a
separate paragraph; but such a case will oftentimes not occur for several
consecutive pages. The writer's plan was to proceed regularly with a book
until it was finished: then to break off from the column he was writing,
and to begin the next book on the very next column. Thus only _one_ column
perfectly blank is found in the whole New Testament(139), that which
follows {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} in Mark xvi. 8: and since Cod. B is the only one yet
known, except Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, that actually omits the last twelve verses of that
Gospel, by leaving such a space the scribe has intimated that he was fully
aware of their existence, or even found them in the copy from which he
wrote. The capital letters at the beginning of each book are likewise due
to the corrector, who sometimes erased, sometimes merely touched slightly,
the original initial letter, which (as in the Herculanean rolls) is no
larger than any other. The _paragraph_ marks (usually straight lines, but
sometimes [symbol](140)) are seen quite frequently in some parts; whether
from the first hand is very doubtful. The note of citation > is perpetual,
not occasional as in Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}. Fewer abridgements than usual occur in this
venerable copy. The formation of _delta_, _pi_, _chi_; the loop-like curve
on the left side of _alpha_; the absence of points at the extremities of
_sigma_ or _epsilon_; the length and size of _rho_, _upsilon_, _phi_, all
point to the FOURTH century as the date of this manuscript. The smaller
letters so often found at the end of lines preserve the same firm and
simple character as the rest; of the use of the apostrophus, so frequent
in Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, A and some others, Tischendorf enumerates ten instances in the
New Testament (N. T. Vatican. Proleg. p. xxi), whereof four are
represented in the Roman edition of 1868, with two more which Tischendorf
considers as simple points (Acts vii. 13, 14).

Tischendorf says truly enough that something like a history might be
written of the futile attempts to collate Cod. B, and a very unprofitable
history it would be. The manuscript is first distinctly heard of (for it
does not appear to have been used for the Complutensian Polyglott(141))
through Sepulveda, to whose correspondence with Erasmus attention has been
seasonably recalled by Tregelles. Writing in 1533, he says, "Est enim
Graecum exemplar antiquissimum in Bibliotheca Vaticana, in quo
diligentissime et accuratissime literis majusculis conscriptum utrumque
Testamentum continetur longe diversum a vulgatis exemplaribus": and, after
noticing as a weighty proof of excellence its agreement with the Latin
version (multum convenit cum vetere nostra translatione) against the
common Greek text (vulgatam Graecorum editionem), he furnishes Erasmus
with 365 readings as a convincing argument in support of his statements.
It would probably be from this list that in his Annotations to the Acts,
published in 1535, Erasmus cites the reading {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, ch. xxvii. 16 ("quidam
admonent" is the expression he uses), from a Greek codex in the Pontifical
Library, since for this reading Cod. B is the only known _Greek_ witness,
except a corrector of Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}. It seems, however, that he had obtained some
account of this manuscript from the Papal Librarian Paul Bombasius as
early as 1521 (_see_ Wetstein's Proleg. N. T., vol. i. p. 23). Lucas
Brugensis, who published his Notationes in S. Biblia in 1580, and his
Commentary on the Four Gospels (dedicated to Cardinal Bellarmine) in 1606,
made known some twenty extracts from Cod. B taken by Werner of Nimeguen;
that most imperfect collection being the only source from which Mill and
even Wetstein had any acquaintance with the contents of this first-rate
document. More indeed might have been gleaned from the Barberini readings
gathered in or about 1625 (of which we shall speak in the next section),
but their real value and character were not known in the lifetime of
Wetstein. In 1698 Lorenzo Alexander Zacagni, Librarian of the Vatican, in
his Preface to the Collectanea Monumentorum Veterum Eccles., describes
Cod. B, and especially its peculiar division into sections, in a passage
cited by Mill (Proleg.  1480). In 1669 indeed the first real collation of
the manuscript with the Aldine edition (1518) had been attempted by
Bartolocci, then Librarian of the Vatican; from some accident, however, it
was never published, though a transcript under the feigned name of Giulio
a Sta. Anastasia yet remains in the Imperial Library of Paris (MSS. Gr.
Supplem. 53), where it was first discovered and used by Scholz in 1819,
and subsequently by Tischendorf and Muralt, the latter of whom (apparently
on but slender grounds) regards it as the best hitherto made; others have
declared it to be very imperfect, and quite inferior to those of Bentley
and Birch. The collation which bears Bentley's name (Trin. Coll. B. xvii.
3, in Cephalaeus' N. T. 1524) was procured about 1720 by his money and the
labour of the Abbate Mico, for the purpose of his projected Greek
Testament. When he had found out its defects, by means of an examination
of the original by his nephew Thomas Bentley in 1726, our great critic
engaged the Abbate Rulotta in 1729 for forty scudi (Bentley's
Correspondence, p. 706) to revise Mico's sheets, and especially to note
the changes made by the second hand. Rulotta's papers came to light in
1855 among the Bentley manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College,
Cambridge (B. xvii. 20), and have lately proved of signal value(142);
Mico's were published in 1799 at Oxford, by Henry Ford, Lord Almoner's
Reader in Arabic there (1783-1813), together with some Thebaic fragments
of the New Testament, in a volume which (since it was chiefly drawn from
Woide's posthumous papers) he was pleased to call an Appendix to the Codex
Alexandrinus. A fourth collation of the Vatican MS. was made about 1780 by
Andrew Birch of Copenhagen, and is included in the notes to the first
volume of his Greek Testament 1788, or published separately in three
volumes which were issued successively 1798 (Acts, Cath. Epp., Paul.),
1800 (Apoc.), and 1801 (Evans). Birch's collation does not extend to the
Gospels of St. Luke and St. John, and on the whole is less full and exact
than Mico's. In 1810, however, when, with the other best treasures of the
Vatican, Codex B was at Paris, the celebrated critic J. L. Hug sent forth
his treatise "de Antiquitate Vaticani Codicis Commentatio," and though
even he did not perceive the need of a new and full collation when he
examined it in 1809, he has the merit of first placing it in the paramount
rank it still holds as one of the oldest and most venerable of extant
monuments of sacred antiquity. His conclusion respecting its date, that it
is not later than the middle of the fourth century, has been acquiesced in
with little opposition, though Tischendorf declares rather pithily that he
holds this belief "non propter Hugium sed cum Hugio" (Cod. Ephraem.
Proleg. p. 19). Some of his reasons, no doubt, are weak enough(143); but
the strength of his position depends on an accumulation of minute
particulars, against which there seems nothing to set up which would
suggest a lower period. On its return to Rome, this volume was no longer
available for the free use and reference of critics. In 1843 Tischendorf,
after long and anxious expectation during a visit to Rome that lasted some
months, obtained a sight of it for two days of three hours each(144). In
1844 Edward de Muralt was admitted to the higher privilege of three days
or nine hours enjoyment of this treasure, and on the strength of the
favour published an edition of the New Testament, _ad fidem codicis
principis Vaticani_, in 1846. Tregelles, who went to Rome in 1845 for the
special purpose of consulting it, was treated even worse. He had forearmed
himself (as he fondly imagined) with recommendatory letters from Cardinal
Wiseman, and was often allowed to _see_ the manuscript, but hindered from
transcribing any of its readings(145).

What the Papal authorities would not entrust to others, they had at least
the merit of attempting and at length accomplishing themselves. As early
as 1836 Bishop Wiseman announced in his Lectures on the Connection between
Science and Revelation, vol. ii. pp. 187-191, that Cardinal Mai, whose
services to classical and ecclesiastical literature were renowned
throughout Europe, was engaged on an edition of the Codex Vaticanus,
commenced under the immediate sanction of Pope Leo XII (1823-29). As years
passed by and no such work appeared, adverse reports and evil surmises
began to take the place of hope, although the Cardinal often spoke of his
work as already finished, only that he desired to write full Prolegomena
before it should appear. In September 1854 he died, honoured and ripe in
years; and at length, when no more seemed to be looked for in that
quarter, five quarto volumes issued from the Roman press in 1857, the New
Testament comprising the fifth volume, with a slight and meagre preface by
the Cardinal, and a letter to the reader by "Carolus Vercellone, Sodalis
Barnabites," which told in a few frank manly words how little accuracy we
had to expect in a work, by the publication of which he still persuaded
himself he was decorating Mai's memory "nova usque gloria atque
splendidiore corona" (tom. i. p. iii). The cause of that long delay now
required no explanation. In fact so long as Mai lived the edition never
would have appeared; for though he had not patience or special skill
enough to accomplish his task well, he was too good a scholar not to know
that he had done it very ill. The text is broken up into paragraphs, the
numbers of the modern chapters and verses being placed in the margin; the
peculiar divisions of the Codex Vaticanus (_see_ p. 56) sometimes omitted,
sometimes tampered with. The Greek type employed is not an imitation of
the uncials in the manuscript (of which circumstance we do not complain),
but has modern stops, breathings, accents, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _subscript_, &c., as if the
venerable document were written yesterday. As regards the orthography it
is partially, and only partially, modernized; clauses or whole passages
omitted in the manuscript are supplied from other sources, although the
fact is duly notified(146); sometimes the readings of the first hand are
put in the margin, while those of the second stand in the text, sometimes
the contrary: in a word, the plan of the work exhibits all the faults such
a performance well can have. Nor is the execution at all less
objectionable. Although the five volumes were ten years in printing
(1828-38), Mai devoted to their superintendence only his scanty spare
hours, and even then worked so carelessly that after cancelling a hundred
pages for their incurable want of exactness, he was reduced to the shift
of making _manual_ corrections with moveable types, and projected huge
tables of errata, which Vercellone has in some measure tried to supply.
When once it is stated that the type was set up from the common Elzevir or
from some other printed Greek Testament, the readings of the Codex itself
being inserted as corrections, and the whole revised by means of an
assistant who read the proof-sheets to the Cardinal while he inspected the
manuscript; no one will look for accuracy from a method which could not
possibly lead to it. Accordingly, when Mai's text came to be compared with
the collations of Bartolocci, of Mico, of Rulotta, and of Birch, or with
the scattered readings which had been extracted by others, it was soon
discovered that while this edition added very considerably to our
knowledge of the Codex Vaticanus, and often enabled us to form a decision
on its readings when the others were at variance; it was in its turn
convicted by them of so many errors, oversights, and inconsistencies, that
its single evidence could never be used with confidence, especially when
it agreed with the commonly received Greek text. Immediately after the
appearance of Mai's expensive quartos, an octavo reprint of the New
Testament was struck off at Leipsic for certain London booksellers, which
proved but a hasty, slovenly, unscholarlike performance, and was put aside
in 1859 by a cheap Roman edition in octavo, prepared, as was the quarto,
by Mai, prefaced by another graceful and sensible epistle of
Vercellone(147). This last edition was undertaken by the Cardinal, after
sad experience had taught him the defects of his larger work, and he took
good care to avoid some of the worst of them: the readings of the second
hand are usually, though not always, banished to the margin, their number
on the whole is increased, gross errors are corrected, omissions supplied,
and the Vatican chapters are given faithfully and in full. But Mai's whole
procedure in this matter is so truly unfortunate, that in a person whose
fame was less solidly grounded, we should impute it to mere helpless
incapacity(148). Not only did he split up the paragraphs of his quarto
into the modern chapters and verses (in itself a most undesirable change,
_see above_, p. 70), but by omitting some things and altering others, he
introduced almost as many errors as he removed. When Dean Burgon was
permitted to examine the Codex for an hour and a half in 1860, on
consulting it for sixteen passages out of hundreds wherein the two are
utterly at variance, he discovered that the quarto was right in seven of
them, the octavo in nine: as if Mai were determined that neither of his
editions should supersede the use of the other. Dean Alford also collated
numerous passages in 1861(149), and his secretary Mr. Cure in 1862,
especially with reference to the several correcting hands: "in errorem
quidem et ipse haud raro inductus," is Tischendorf's verdict on his
labours. Thus critics of every shade of opinion became unanimous on one
point, that a new edition of the Codex Vaticanus was as imperatively
needed as ever; one which should preserve with accuracy all that the first
hand has written (transcriptural errors included), should note in every
instance the corrections made by the second hand, and, wherever any one of
the previous collators might be found in error, should expressly state the
true reading.

It would have been a grievous reproach had no efforts been made to supply
so great and acknowledged a want. Early in 1866, Tischendorf again visited
Rome, and when admitted into the presence of Pope Pius IX, boldly sought
permission to edit at his own cost such an edition of Cod. B as he had
already published of Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}. The request was denied by his Holiness, who
obscurely hinted his intention of carrying out the same design on his own
account. Tischendorf, however, obtained permission to use the manuscript
so far as to consult it in such parts of the New Testament as presented
any special difficulty, or respecting which previous collators were at
variance. He commenced his task February 28, and in the course of it could
not refrain from copying at length twenty pages of the great
Codex--nineteen from the New Testament, and one from the Old. This licence
was not unnaturally regarded as a breach of his contract, so that, after
he had used the manuscript for eight days, it was abruptly withdrawn from
him on March 12. An appeal to the generosity of Vercellone, who had been
entrusted with the care of the forthcoming edition, procured for him the
sight of this coveted treasure for six days longer between March 20 and
26, the Italian being always present on these latter occasions, and
receiving instruction for the preparation of his own work by watching the
processes of a master hand. Thus fourteen days of three hours each, used
zealously and skilfully, enabled Tischendorf to put forth an edition of
Cod. B far superior to any that preceded it(150). The Prolegomena are full
of matter from which we have drawn freely in the foregoing description,
the text is in cursive type, the nineteen pages which cost him so dearly
being arranged in their proper lines, the remainder according to columns.
Much that ought to have been noted was doubtless passed over by
Tischendorf for mere pressure of time; but he takes great pains to
distinguish the readings of the original writer or his {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} (_see_ p.
55)(151), both of whom supplied words or letters here and there in the
margin or between the lines(152), from the corrections of a second yet
ancient scribe (B2), and those of the person (B3) who retraced the faded
writing at a later period(153). One notion, taken up by Tischendorf in the
course of his collation in 1866, was received at first with general
incredulity by other scholars. He has pronounced a decided opinion, not
only that Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} and B are documents of the same age, but that the scribe
who wrote the latter is one of the four [D] to whose diligence we owe the
former. That there should be a general similarity in the style of the two
great codices is probable enough, although the letters in Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} are about
half as large again as those of its fellow, but such as are aware of the
difficulty of arriving at a safe conclusion as to identity of penmanship
after close and repeated comparison of one document with another, will
hardly attach much weight to the impression of any person, however large
his experience, who has nothing but memory to trust to. Tregelles, who has
also seen both copies, states that Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} looks much the fresher and
clearer of the two. Yet the reasons alleged above, which are quite
independent of the appearance of the handwriting, leave scarcely a doubt
that Tischendorf's judgement was correct.

The Roman edition, projected by Vercellone and Cozza under the auspices of
Pius IX, was designed to consist of six volumes, four containing the Old
Testament, one the New, another being devoted to the notes and
discrimination of corrections by later hands. The New Testament appeared
in 1868(154), a second volume in 1869, containing the text from Genesis to
Joshua; three more have since completed the Old Testament (1870, 1871,
1872). The learned, genial, and modest Vercellone (b. 1814) died early in
1869, so that the later volumes bear on their title-page the mournful
inscription "Carolum Vercellone excepit Caietanus Sergio Sodalis
Barnabites" as Cozza's associate. These editors fared but ill whether as
Biblical critics or as general scholars, under the rough handling of
Tischendorf, whom the wiser policy of Vercellone had kept in good humour,
but whose powers his successors greatly undervalued. There seems, however,
to be no great cause, in spite of their adversary's minute diligence in
fault-finding (Appendix N. T. Vatic. 1869, p. xi, &c.)(155), for doubting
their general correctness, although they persist in placing on the page
with the rest of their text readings which are known or credibly stated to
be of decidedly later date, in spite of the incongruousness of the mixture
of what was original with matter plainly adscititious(156). Thus in the
Roman edition {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} Matt. xxv. 40, imputed by Tischendorf to B2
and B3, stands in the margin just in the same way as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} Matt. xxii.
10, which he refers to the first hand. But this is only one instance of a
lack of judgement which deforms every page of their performance: e.g.
Matt. xix. 12; xxiii. 26; 37; xxv. 16; xxvii. 12; 13; 45; xxviii. 15; Acts
xv. 1: all which places exhibit, undistinguished from emendations of the
original scribe or his "corrector," readings in the margin or between the
lines which Tischendorf asserts to belong mostly to B3, a few to B2.(157)

At length, after baffling delays only too readily accounted for by the
public calamities of the Papal state, the concluding volume of this
sumptuous and important work was published late in 1881. Sergius had now
retired through failing eyesight, and his place was taken by "Henricus
Canonicus Fabiani," Cozza (who is now Abbot of the Grotta Ferrata at
Tusculum near Frascati, the chief seat of the monks of the Greek order of
St. Basil) still holding the second place. From the laudatory tone in
which the latter is spoken of (p. xiv), it would seem that the Preface was
written by his new colleague, who acknowledges the help of U. Ubaldi and
the Basilian monk Ant. Rocchi, all three "adjutoribus et administris
miratis equidem se tantis viris adjutores et successores datos" (p. xv).
This Preface consists of twenty-two pages, and contains almost nothing
that is interesting to the critic, much that displays superficial and
newly-acquired acquaintance with the whole subject. Fabiani assigns the
end of the fourth century as the date of the manuscript, regarding it as
only a few years older than the Sinaitic copy(158), whose discovery he
hails without a vestige of ungenerous jealousy: "Quorum tale est demum
par, ut potius liber Vaticanus gaudere debeat quod tam sui similem
invenerit fratrem, quam expavescere quod aemulum" (p. viii). Since that
time a splendid edition has been issued of the New Testament in 1889, and
the Old in 1890, under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi, in which the
whole is beautifully exhibited in photograph: so that all students can now
examine for themselves the readings and characteristics of this celebrated
manuscript with all but the advantage which is given in an examination of
the original vellum itself (Novum Testamentum e Codd. Vat. 1209, &c. Rom.
1889, 4to): and gratitude is due from all textual scholars to the
authorities of the Vatican.

Those who agree the most unreservedly respecting the age of the Codex
Vaticanus, vary widely in their estimate of its critical value. By some it
has been held in such undue esteem that its readings, if probable in
themselves, and supported (or even though not supported) by two or three
other copies and versions, have been accepted in preference to the united
testimony of all authorities besides: while others, admitting the interest
due to age, have spoken of its text as one of the most vicious extant.
Without anticipating what must be discussed hereafter we may say at once,
that, while we accord to Cod. B at least as much weight as to any single
document in existence, we ought never to forget that it is but one out of
many, several of them being nearly (and one quite) as old, and in other
respects not less worthy of confidence than itself. One marked feature,
characteristic of this copy, is the great number of its omissions, which
has induced Dr. Dobbin to speak of it as presenting "an abbreviated text
of the New Testament:" and certainly the facts he states on this point are
startling enough(159). He calculates that Codex B leaves out words or
whole clauses no less than 330 times in Matthew, 365 in Mark, 439 in Luke,
357 in John, 384 in the Acts, 681 in the surviving Epistles; or 2,556
times in all. That no small proportion of these are mere oversights of the
scribe seems evident from the circumstance that this same scribe has
repeatedly written words and clauses _twice over_, a class of mistakes
which Mai and the collators have seldom thought fit to notice, inasmuch as
the false addition has not been retraced by the second hand, but which by
no means enhances our estimate of the care employed in copying this
venerable record of primitive Christianity(160). Hug and others have
referred the origin of Codex B to Egypt, but (unlike in this respect to
Codex A) its history does not confirm their conjecture, and the argument
derived from orthography or grammatical forms, is now well understood to
be but slight and ambiguous(161). Dr. Hort, on no very substantial
grounds, is "inclined to surmise that B and {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} were both written in the
West, probably at Rome" (Introduction, pp. 265-7).

C. CODEX EPHRAEMI, No. 9, in the Royal Library of Paris, is a most
valuable palimpsest containing portions of the Septuagint version of the
Old Testament on sixty-four leaves, and fragments of every part of the New
on 145 leaves, amounting on the whole to less than two-thirds of the
volume(162). This manuscript seems to have been brought from the East by
Andrew John Lascar [d. 1535], a learned Greek patronized by Lorenzo de'
Medici; it once belonged to Cardinal Nicolas Ridolphi of that family, was
brought into France by Queen Catherine de' Medici of evil memory, and so
passed into the Royal Library at Paris(163). The ancient writing is barely
legible, having been almost removed about the twelfth century to receive
some Greek works of St. Ephraem, the great Syrian Father [299-378]. A
chemical preparation applied at the instance of Fleck in 1834, though it
revived much that was before illegible, has defaced the vellum with stains
of various colours, from green and blue to black and brown. The older
writing was first noticed by Peter Allix nearly two centuries ago; various
readings extracted from it were communicated by Boivin to Kuster, who
published them (under the notation of Paris 9) in his edition of Mill's N.
T., 1710. A complete collation of the New Testament was first made in 1716
by Wetstein, then very young, for Bentley's projected edition, for which
labour (as he records the fact himself) he paid Wetstein L50. This
collation Wetstein of course used for his own Greek Testament of 1751-2,
and though several persons subsequently examined the manuscript, and so
became aware that more might be gathered from it, it was not until 1843
that Tischendorf brought out at Leipsic his full and noble edition of the
New Testament portion; the Old Testament he published in 1845. Although
Tischendorf complains of the typographical errors made in his absence in
the former of these two volumes, and has corrected them in the other, they
probably comprise by far the most masterly production of this nature up to
that date published; it is said too that none but those who have seen
Codex C can appreciate the difficulty of deciphering some parts of
it(164), in fact, whatever is not patent at first sight. The Prolegomena
are especially valuable; the uncial type does not aim at being an
imitation, but the facsimile faithfully represents the original, even to
the present colour of the ink. In shape Codex C is about the size of Cod.
A, but not quite so tall; its vellum is hardly so fine as that of Cod. A
and a few others, yet sufficiently good. In this copy there is but one
column in a page, which contains from forty to forty-six lines (usually
forty-one), the characters being a little larger than those of either A or
B, and somewhat more elaborate(165). Thus the points at the ends of
_sigma_, _epsilon_, and especially of the horizontal line of _tau_ are
more decided than in Codex A; _delta_, though not so fully formed as in
later books, is less simple than in A, the strokes being of less equal
thickness, and the base more ornamented. On the other hand, _alpha_ and
_pi_ are nearer the model of Codex B. _Iota_ and _upsilon_, which in Cod.
A and many other copies have two dots over them when they commence a
syllable, and are sometimes found with one dot, have here a small straight
line in their place (_see_ p. 36). There are no breathings or accents by
the first hand: the apostrophus is found but rarely, chiefly with Proper
names, as _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}_ The uncial writing is continuous; the punctuation of Cod.
C, like that of A and B, consisting only of a single point, mostly but not
always put level with the top of the preceding letter; wherever such a
point was employed, a space of one letter broad was usually left vacant:
these points are most common in the later books of the N. T. The {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}
are not placed in the upper margin of the page as in Cod. A, but a list of
their {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} preceded each Gospel: the so-called Ammonian sections stand
in the margin, but not at present the Eusebian canons; though, since lines
of the text written in vermilion have been thoroughly washed out, the
canons (for which that colour was commonly employed) may easily have
shared the same fate (_see_ p. 61). There is no trace of chapters in the
Acts, Epistles, or Apocalypse, and both the titles and subscriptions to
the various books are very simple. Capital letters are used quite as
freely as in Cod. A, both at the commencement of the (Ammonian) sections,
and in many other places. All these circumstances taken together indicate
for Cod. C as early a date as the fifth century, though there is no
sufficient cause for deeming it at all older than Cod. A. Alexandria has
been assigned as its native country, for the very insufficient reasons
stated when we were describing A and B. It is carefully transcribed, and
of its great critical value there is no doubt; its text seems to stand
nearly midway between A and B, somewhat inclining to the latter. Two
correctors have been very busily at work on Cod. C, greatly to the
perplexity of the critical collator: they are respectively indicated by
Tischendorf as C**, C***. The earliest, or the second hand, may have been
of the sixth century, and his corrections are for some cause regarded by
Dr. Hort as almost equally valuable for critical purposes with the
manuscript itself: the second corrector, or the third hand, is perhaps of
the ninth century, and he revised such portions as were adapted to
ecclesiastical use, inserting many accents, the _rough_ breathing, and
some vocal notes. By him or more probably by a fourth hand (who did not
change the text, but added some liturgical directions in the margin) small
crosses were interpolated as stops, agreeably to the fashion of their
times.

D OF THE GOSPELS AND ACTS, CODEX BEZAE GRAECO-LATINUS, belongs to the
University Library at Cambridge, where the open volume is conspicuously
exhibited to visitors in the New Building (Nn. ii. 41). It was presented
to the University in 1581 by Theodore Beza, for whom and his master Calvin
the heads of that learned body then cherished a veneration which already
boded ill for the peace of the English Church(166). Between the Gospels
(whose order was spoken of above, pp. 72-4) and the Acts, the Catholic
Epistles once stood, of which only a few verses remain in the Latin
translation (3 John ver. 11-15), followed by the words "epistulae Johannis
III explicit, incipit actus apostolorum," as if St. Jude's Epistle were
displaced or wanting. There are not a few hiatus both in the Greek and
Latin texts(167). The contents of this remarkable document were partially
made known by numerous extracts from it, under the designation of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} in
the margin of Robert Stephen's Greek Testament of 1550, whose account of
it is that it was collated for him in Italy by his friends ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. Epistle to the
Reader)(168). It is not very easy to reconcile this statement with Beza's
account prefixed to the manuscript and still extant in his own cramped
handwriting, wherein he alleges that he obtained the volume in 1562 from
the monastery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons ("oriente ibi civili bello"), where
it had long lain buried ("postquam ibi in pulvere diu jacuisset"). This
great city, it must be remembered, was sacked in that very year by the
infamous Des Adrets, whom it suited to espouse for a while the cause of
the Huguenots; and we can hardly doubt that some one who had shared in the
plunder of the abbey(169) conveyed this portion of it to Beza, whose
influence at that juncture was paramount among the French Reformed(170).

Beza in his editions of the Greek Testament published in 1582, 1589, and
1598, made some occasional references to the readings of his manuscript.
Archbishop Whitgift borrowed it from Cambridge in 1583, and caused a poor
transcript to be made of its Greek text, which he bequeathed to Trinity
College (whereof he had been Master), in whose Library it still remains
(B. x. 3).

Patrick Young, of whom we have heard in connexion with Cod. A (p. 103 and
note 1), sent extracts from Cod. D to the brothers Dupuy at Paris, through
whom they reached Morinus and Steph. Curcellaeus. An unusually full
collation was made for Walton's Polyglott (Tom. vi, Num. xvi, 1657) by
pious Archbishop Ussher, who devoted to these studies the doleful leisure
of his latter years. Mill collated and Wetstein transcribed (1716) this
document for their great editions of the Greek Testament, but they both
did their work carelessly; and though Bentley was allowed to keep it at
home for seven years, his notices of its readings, as represented by Mr.
Ellis (Bentleii Critica Sacra, pp. 2-26), or preserved in Stephen's N. T.
of 1549 (Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 4), were put to no practical use. The best
collation by far was made about 1732 by John Dickinson of St. John's
College for John Jackson of Leicester, with whose other books it came into
Jesus College Library (O. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}. 2), where it has lain neglected. But a
manuscript replete as this is with variations from the sacred text beyond
all other example could be adequately represented only by being published
in full; a design entrusted by the University of Cambridge to Dr. Thomas
Kipling, Senior Wrangler in 1768 and afterwards Dean of Peterborough [d.
1822], whose "Codex Theodori Bezae Cantabrigiensis" 1793, 2 vols. fol. (in
type imitating the original handwriting much more closely than in Cod. A
and the rest), is a not unfaithful transcript of the text(171), though the
Prolegomena too plainly testify to the editor's pitiable ignorance of
sacred criticism, while his habit of placing the readings of the several
later hands (very loosely distinguished from each other) in the text, and
those of the first hand in the notes (a defect we have also noted in the
Roman editions of Cod. B), renders his volumes very inconvenient for use.
Let Kipling be praised for the care and exact diligence his work evinces,
but Herbert Marsh [1757-1839] was of all Cambridge men of that period the
only one known to be competent for such a task. In 1864 the present writer
was aided by the Syndics of the Cambridge Press in publishing an edition
of Codex Bezae in common type, illustrated by a copious Introduction and
critical notes, to which work the reader is referred for fuller
information respecting this manuscript.

The Codex Bezae is a quarto volume 10 inches high by 8 broad, with one
column on a page, the Greek text and its Latin version being parallel, the
Greek on the left, or _verso_ of each leaf, and the Latin on the right,
opposite to it, on the _recto_ of the next. Notwithstanding the
Alexandrian forms that abound in it as much as in any other copy, and
which have been held by some to prove the Egyptian origin of Codd. ABC,
the fact of its having a Latin version sufficiently attests its Western
origin. The vellum is not quite equal in fineness to that of a few others.
There are thirty-three lines in every page, and these of unequal length,
as this manuscript is arranged in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, being the earliest in date that
is so (_see_ p. 53). The Latin is placed in the same line and as nearly as
possible in the same order as the corresponding Greek. It has not the
larger {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} or Eusebian canons, but only the so-called Ammonian
sections, often incorrectly placed, and obviously in a later hand of about
the ninth century. The original absence of these divisions is no proof
that the book was not at first intended for ecclesiastical use (as some
have stated), inasmuch as the sections and canons were constructed for a
very different purpose (_see above_, pp. 59-63), but is another argument
for its being copied in the West, perhaps not far from the place where it
rested so long. Other proofs of its Occidental, perhaps of its Gallican
origin, especially that derived from the style of the Latin version, are
collected in Scrivener's edition (Introd. pp. xxxi, xl-xlv). The
characters are of the same size as in C, larger on the whole than in AB,
but betray a later age than any of these, although the Latin as well as
the Greek is written continuously, excepting that in the titles and
subscriptions of the several books (as in Codd. DH of St. Paul) the words
are separated. This copy has paragraph divisions of unequal length
peculiar to itself(172). They are indicated by placing the initial letter
out in the margin, that letter being usually of the same size with the
rest, though sometimes a little larger. Cod. D appears to be the earliest
which exhibits larger letters after a pause in the middle of a line; but
these are not very frequent. Instances of each case may be noticed in our
facsimile (No. 42), wherein the shapes of _kappa_, _rho_ and _phi_, as
indicated before (pp. 32, note 1, 37, 39), are very observable. The Greek
and Latin writing on the opposite pages are much like each other in
appearance, the Latin letters being round and flowing, not square as in
codices a little earlier in date, such as the Medicean and Vatican
fragments of Virgil. This manuscript has been corrected, first by the
original penman with a light stroke made by a pen nearly empty; after him
by not less than eight or nine different revisers, some nearly coeval with
the Codex itself, others not many centuries old. The changes they have
made, especially when they employed a knife to scrape away the primitive
reading, render too many places almost illegible. The first scribe often
used a sponge to wash out his error before the ink was well dried in
(_see_ p. 27). In addition to the single point about three-fourths of the
height of a letter up, which often subdivides the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in both languages
(facsimile, No. 42, l. 9) the coarse late hand which inserted the Ammonian
sections placed double dots (:) after the numerals, and often inserted
similar points in the text, before or over the first letter of a section.
Each member of the genealogy in Luke iii forms a separate {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, as in
Cod. B: quotations are indicated by throwing the commencement of the lines
which contain them, both Greek and Latin, about an inch back or less (e.g.
Matt. xxvi. 31; Mark i. 2, 3; Acts ii. 34, 35; iv. 25, 26). The first
three lines of each book, in both languages, were written in bright red
ink, which was also employed in the alternate lines of the subscriptions,
and in other slight ornaments. The traces of the scribe's needle and lines
(_see_ p. 27) are very visible, the margin ample, and the volume on the
whole in good keeping, though its first extant page (Latin) is much
decayed, and it is stained in parts by some chemical mixture that has been
applied to it. The portions supplied by a later hand are of course in the
uncial Greek and cursive Latin characters usual at the dates assigned to
them. The liturgical notes in the margin of the Saturday and Sunday
lessons ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} is the form often used) are in thick letters, of a yet
later date than the Ammonian sections. A few others for the great Feasts
and Fast days occur; and, in a hand of about the twelfth century, lessons
for the Festivals of St. George and St. Dionysius, the patron saints of
England and France, as may be seen in the table of Menology.

The vellum employed for Codex Bezae is arranged in quires of four sheets
(or eight leaves) each even throughout(173), the numeral signatures of
which are set _prima manu_ so low down in the margin at the foot of the
last page of each, that they are mostly cut off, in whole or partly, by
the binder. Assuming that it ended with the Acts of the Apostles, it
originally consisted of upwards of sixty-four (probably of sixty-seven)
quires, of which the first, forty-fourth, and sixty-fourth, have each lost
some leaves, the thirty-fourth is entire though containing but six leaves,
while those signed {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~} (3), {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} (14), {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~} (22), {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~} (45), down to {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~} (52), {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ZETA~}
(57), and all after {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} (64), are wholly wanting. The result is that out of
the 534 leaves it originally contained, only 406 now survive, about twelve
of them being more or less mutilated. It is not easy to surmise what may
have been written on the sixty-seven leaves that intervened between {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} 5
and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~} 1; the gap ends with 3 John ver. 11 (Greek), but the space is
apparently too great for the Catholic Epistles alone, even though we
suppose that Jude was inserted (as appears in some catalogues) otherwise
than in the last place. The leaves added by later hands are nine in
number. The Greek portion of the supplement to St. John (xviii. 14-xx. 13)
much resembles in text the style of the original manuscript, and is often
supported by Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}AB(C). The Latin of this portion is taken from the
Vulgate version.

The internal character of the Codex Bezae is a most difficult and indeed
an almost inexhaustible theme. No known manuscript contains so many bold
and extensive interpolations (six hundred, it is said, in the Acts alone),
countenanced, where they are not absolutely unsupported, chiefly by the
Old Latin and the Curetonian version: its own parallel Latin translation
is too servilely accommodated to the Greek text to be regarded as an
independent authority, save where the corresponding Greek is lost.

This passage was penned by Dr. Scrivener before the publication of the
highly ingenious treatise by Mr. Rendel Harris, entitled "A Study of the
Codex Bezae" (1891), being the beginning of the second volume of the
Cambridge "Texts and Studies." Mr. Harris from curious internal evidence,
such as the existence in the text of a vitiated rendering of a verse of
Homer which bears signs of having been retranslated from a Latin
translation, infers that the Greek has been made up from the Latin, and
traces the latter to the second century. He shows its affinity with the
text of Irenaeus, and discovers traces in it of Montanism. He opens up
many points of interest for any one who would examine this "singular
Codex": but injustice must not be done to the fertile author by supposing
that in what is evidently 'a Study' he concludes that he has settled all
the numerous questions which he broaches. No one however can really
investigate the Codex Bezae without studying this work, which will be
found both instructive in the highest degree and amusing.





CHAPTER V. UNCIAL MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS.


Of the manuscripts hitherto described, Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}ABC for their presumed
critical value, Cod. D for its numberless and strange deviations from
other authorities, and all five for their high antiquity, demanded a full
description. Of those which follow many contain but a few fragments of the
Gospels, and others are so recent in date that they hardly exceed in
importance some of the best cursive copies (e.g. FGHS)(174). None of these
need detain us long.

E. CODEX BASILIENSIS (B vi. 21, now A. N. iii. 12) ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am.,
Eus._ at foot of the pages) contains the four Gospels, excepting Luke iii.
4-15; xxiv. 47-53, and was written about the middle of the eighth century,
unless (with Dean Burgon) we refer it to the seventh. It measures 9 x 6-1/2
inches, and contains 318 folios. There are 247 folios _verso_, and 71
_recto_(175). Three leaves (160, 207, 214) on which are Luke i. 69-ii. 4;
xii. 58-xiii. 12; xv. 8-20 are in a cursive and later hand, above the
obliterated fragments of a homily as old as the main body of the
manuscript. There is a "liber praedicatorum" on the first folio. This copy
is one of the most notable of the later uncials, and might well have been
published at length. It was given to a religious house in Basle by
Cardinal John de Ragusio, who was sent on a mission to the Greeks by the
Council of Basle (1431), and probably brought it from Constantinople.
Erasmus much overlooked it for later books when preparing his Greek
Testament at Basle; indeed it was not brought into the Public Library
there before 1559. A collation was sent to Mill by John Battier, Greek
Professor at Basle: Mill named it B. I, and truly declared it to be
"probatae fidei et bonae notae." Bengal (who obtained a few extracts from
it) calls it Basil. _a_: but its first real collator was Wetstein, whose
native town it adorns. Since his time, Tischendorf in 1843, Professor
Mueller of Basle and Tregelles in 1846, have independently collated it
throughout. Judging from the specimen sent to him, Mill (N. T. Proleg. 
1118) thought the hand much like that of Cod. A; the uncial letters
(though not so regular or neat) are firm, round, and simple: indeed "the
penmanship is exceedingly tasteful and delicate throughout. The employment
of green, blue, and vermilion in the capitals I do not remember to have
met with elsewhere" (Burgon, _Guardian_, Jan. 29, 1873). There is but one
column of about twenty-four lines on the page; it has breathings and
accents pretty uniformly, and not ill placed; otherwise, from the shape of
most of the letters (e.g. _pi_, facsimile No. 27, lines 1, 3), it might be
judged of earlier date: observe, however, the oblong form of _omicron_
where the space is crowded in the last line of the facsimile, when the
older scribes would have retained the circular shape and made the letter
very small (_see_ facsimile No. 11 b. l. 6): _delta_ also and _xi_ betray
a less ancient scribe. The single stop in Cod. E, as was stated above (p.
48), changes its place according to the variation of its power, as in
other copies of about the same age. The capitals at the beginning of
sections stand out in the margin as in Codd. AC. The lists of the larger
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} together with the numbers of the sections in the margin and the
Eusebian canons beneath them, as well as harmonizing references to the
other Gospels at the foot of the page, names of Feast days with their
Proper lessons, and other liturgical notices, have been inserted (as some
think, but erroneously in Burgon's judgement) by a later hand. Under the
text (Mark i. 5, 6) are placed the harmonizing references, in the order
(varying in each Gospel) Mark, Luke, John, Matthew. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} (John) furnishes no
parallel on this page. The first section ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}) of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} (Mark i. 1, 2)
corresponds to the seventieth ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}) of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} (Luke vii. 27), and to the 103rd
({~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}) of M (Matt. xi. 10). Again the second ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}) of Mark (i. 3) is parallel
to the seventh ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}) of Luke (iii. 3), and to the eighth ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}) of Matt. (iii.
3). The passage given in our facsimile (No. 27) is part of the third ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~})
of Mark (i. 4-6), and answers to nothing in Luke, but to the ninth ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}) of
Matt. (iii. 4-6). See p. 60, note 4. The value of this codex, as supplying
materials for criticism, is considerable. It approaches more nearly than
some others of its date to the text now commonly received, and is an
excellent witness for it. The asterisk is much used to indicate disputed
passages: e.g. Matt. xvi. 2, 3: Luke xxii. 43, 44; xxiii. 34: John viii.
2-11. (For the fragments attached to this Codex, _see_ Apoc. 15.)

F. CODEX BOREELI, now in the Public Library at Utrecht, once belonged to
John Boreel [d. 1629], Dutch ambassador at the court of King James I.
Wetstein obtained some readings from it in 1730, as far as Luke xi, but
stated that he knew not where it then was. In 1830 Professor Heringa of
Utrecht discovered it in private hands at Arnheim, and procured it for his
University Library, where in 1850 Tregelles found it, though with some
difficulty, the leaves being torn and all loose in a box, and he then made
a facsimile; Tischendorf had looked through it in 1841. In 1843, after
Heringa's death, H. E. Vinke published that scholar's "Disputatio de
Codice Boreeliano," which includes a full and exact collation of the text.
Cod. F contains the Four Gospels with many defects, some of which have
been caused since the collation was made which Wetstein published: hence
the codex must still sometimes be cited on his authority as Fw. In fact
there are but 204 leaves and a few fragments remaining, written with two
columns of about nineteen lines each on the page, in a tall, oblong,
upright form; it was referred by Mr. H. Deane in 1876 to the eighth, by
Tischendorf to the ninth, by Tregelles to the tenth century. In St. Luke
there are no less than twenty-four gaps: in Wetstein's collation it began
at Matt. vii. 6, but now at Matt. ix. 1. Other hiatus are Matt. xii. 1-44;
xiii. 55-xiv. 9; xv. 20-31; xx. 18-xxi. 5: Mark i. 43-ii. 8; ii. 23-iii.
5; xi. 6-26; xiv. 54-xv. 5; xv. 39-xvi. 19: John iii. 5-14; iv. 23-38; v.
18-38; vi. 39-63; vii. 28-viii. 10; x. 32-xi. 3; xi. 40-xii. 3; xii.
14-25: it ends at John xiii. 34. Few manuscripts have fallen into such
unworthy hands. The Eusebian canons are wanting, the sections standing
without them in the margin. Thus in Mark x. 13 (see facsimile No. 28) the
section {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~} (106) has not under it the proper canon {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~} (2). The letters
_delta_, _epsilon_, _theta_, _omicron_, and especially the cross-like
_psi_ (_see_ p. 40), are of the most recent uncial form, _phi_ is large
and bevelled at both ends; the breathings and accents are fully and not
incorrectly given.

Fa. CODEX COISLIN. I is that great copy of the Septuagint Octateuch, the
glory of the Coislin Library, first made known by Montfaucon (Biblioth.
Coislin., 1715), and illustrated by a facsimile in Silvestre's Paleogr.
Univ. No. 65. It contains 227 leaves in two columns, 13 inches by 9: the
fine massive uncials of the sixth or seventh century are much like Cod.
A's in general appearance. In the margin _prima manu_ Wetstein found Acts
ix. 24, 25, and so inserted this as Cod. F in his list of MSS. of the
Acts. In 1842 Tischendorf observed nineteen other passages of the New
Testament, which he published in his Monumenta sacra inedita (1846, p.
400, &c.) with a facsimile. The texts are Matt. v. 48; xii. 48; xxvii. 25:
Luke i. 42; ii. 24; xxiii. 21: John v. 35; vi. 53, 55: Acts iv. 33, 34;
ix. 24, 25; x. 13, 15; xxii. 22: 1 Cor. vii. 39; xi. 29: 1 Cor. iii. 13;
ix. 7; xi. 33: Gal. iv. 21, 22: Col. ii. 16, 17; Heb. x. 26.

G. COD. HARLEIAN. 5684 or WOLFII A; H. COD. WOLFII B. These two copies
were brought from the East by Andrew Erasmus Seidel, purchased by La
Croze, and by him presented to J. C. Wolff, who published loose extracts
from them both in his "Anecdota Graeca" (vol. iii. 1723), and barbarously
mutilated them in 1721 in order to send pieces to Bentley, among whose
papers in Trinity College Library (B. XVII. 20) Tregelles found the
fragments in 1845 (Account of the Printed Text, p. 160). Subsequently Cod.
G came with the rest of the Harleian collection into the British Museum;
Cod. H, which had long been missing, was brought to light in the Public
Library of Hamburg, through Petersen the Librarian, in 1838. Codd. GH have
now been thoroughly collated both by Tischendorf and Tregelles. Cod. G
appears to be of the tenth, Cod. H of the ninth century, and is stated to
be of higher critical value. Besides the mutilated fragments at Trinity
College (Matt. v. 29-31; 39-43 of Cod. G; Luke i. 3-6; 13-15 of Cod. H),
many parts of both have perished: viz. in Cod. G 372 verses; Matt. i.
1-vi. 6; vii. 25-viii. 9; viii. 23-ix. 2; xxviii. 18-Mark i. 13; xiv.
19-25: Luke i. 1-13; v. 4-vii. 3; viii. 46-ix. 5; xii. 27-41; xxiv. 41-53:
John xviii. 5-19; xix. 4-27 (of which one later hand supplies Matt,
xxviii. 18-Mark i. 8: John xviii. 5-19; another Luke xii. 27-41): in Cod.
H 679 verses; Matt. i. 1-xv. 30; xxv. 33-xxvi. 3; Mark i. 32-ii. 4; xv.
44-xvi. 14; Luke v. 18-32; vi. 8-22; x. 2-19: John ix. 30-x. 25; xviii.
2-18; xx. 12-25. Cod. G has some Church notes in the margin; Cod. H the
sections without the Eusebian canons; G however has both sections and
canons; its {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and larger {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} are in red (those of St. John being
lost), and the Church notes seem _prima manu_. Each member of the
genealogy in Luke iii forms a separate line. Both G and H are written in a
somewhat rude style, with breathings and accents rather irregularly
placed, as was the fashion of their times; G in two columns of twenty-two
lines each on a page, H in one column of twenty-three lines. In each the
latest form of the uncial letters is very manifest (e.g. _delta_,
_theta_), but G is the neater of the two. In G the single point, in H a
kind of Maltese cross, are the prevailing marks of punctuation. Our
facsimiles (Nos. 29 of G, 31 of H) are due to Tregelles; that of G he took
from the fragment at Trinity College. Inasmuch as beside Matt. v. 30, 31
in Cod. G {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~} [with a {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~} between and above them] ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}) is conspicuous in
the margin, and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}_{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}_{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}_ ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}) stands in the text
itself, good scholars may be excused for having mistaken it for a scrap of
some Evangelistarium.

I. COD. TISCHENDORFIAN. II at St. Petersburg, consists of palimpsest
fragments found by Tischendorf in 1853 "in the dust of an Eastern
library," i.e. in the Convent of St. Saba near the Red Sea, and published
in his new series of "Monumenta sacra inedita," vol. i, 1855. On the
twenty-eight vellum leaves (eight of them on four double leaves) Georgian
writing covers the partially obliterated Greek, which is for the most part
very hard to read. They compose portions of no less than seven different
manuscripts; the first two, of the fifth century, are as old as Codd. AC
(the first having scarcely any capital letters and those very slightly
larger than the rest); the third fragment seems of the sixth century,
nearly of the date of Cod. N (p. 139), about as old as Cod. P (_see_ p.
143); the fourth scarcely less ancient: all four, like other palimpsests,
have the pseudo-Ammonian sections without the Eusebian canons (_see_ p.
61).  Of the Gospels we have 190 verses: viz. (_Frag._ 1 or Ia) John xi.
50-xii. 9; xv. 12-xvi. 2; xix. 11-24: (_Frag._ 2 or Ib) Matt. xiv. 13-16;
19-23; xxiv. 37-xxv. 1; xxv. 32-45; xxvi. 31-45: Mark ix. 14-22; xiv.
58-70: (_Frag._ 3 or Ic) Matt. xvii. 22-xviii. 3; xviii. 11-19; xix. 5-14:
Luke xviii. 14-25; John iv. 52-v. 8; xx. 17-26: (_Frag._ 4 or Id) Luke
vii. 39-49; xxiv. 10-19. The fifth fragment (Ie), containing portions of
the Acts and of St. Paul's Epistles (1 Cor. xv. 53-xvi. 9; Tit. i. 1-13;
Acts xxviii. 8-17) is as old as the third, if not as the first. The sixth
and seventh fragments are of the seventh century: viz. (_Frag._ 6 or If,
_of two leaves_) Acts ii. 6-17; xxvi. 7-18: (_Frag._ 7 or Ig, _of one
leaf_) Acts xiii. 39-46. In all seven are 255 verses. All except _Frag._ 6
are in two columns of from twenty-nine to eighteen lines each, and
unaccentuated; _Frag._ 6 has but one column on a page, with some accents.
The first five fragments, so far as they extend, must be placed in the
highest rank as critical authorities. The first, as cited in Tischendorf's
eighth edition of his Greek Testament, agrees with Cod. A thirty-four
times, four times with Cod. B, and twenty-three times with the two united;
it stands alone eleven times. The text of the second and third is more
mixed though they incline more to favour Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}B; not, however, so
decidedly as the first does Cod. A. Tischendorf gives us six facsimiles of
them in the "Monumenta sacra inedita,". Nova Collect. vol. i (1885), a
seventh in "Anecdota sacra et profana," 1855. From the same Armenian book,
as Tischendorf thinks (and he was very likely to _know_), are taken the
three palimpsest leaves of 2 and 3 Kings, and the six of Isaiah published
by him in the same volume of the "Monumenta."

Ib. See Nb, below.

K. COD. CYPRIUS, or No. 63 of the Royal Library at Paris, shares only with
Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BMSU the advantage of being a _complete_ uncial copy of the Four
Gospels. It was brought into the Colbert Library from Cyprus in 1673; Mill
inserted its readings from Simon; it was re-examined by Scholz, whose
inaccuracies (especially those committed when collating Cod. K for his
"Curae Criticae in Historiam textus Evangeliorum," Heidelberg, 1820) have
been strongly denounced by later editors, and it must be feared with too
good reason. The independent collations of Tischendorf and Tregelles have
now done all that can be needed for this copy. It is an oblong quarto, in
compressed uncials, of about the middle of the ninth century at the
latest, having one column of about twenty-one lines on each page, but the
handwriting is irregular and varies much in size. A single point being
often found where the sense does not require it, this codex has been
thought to have been copied from an older one arranged in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}; the ends
of each {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} may have been indicated in this manner by the scribe. The
subscriptions, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, the sections, and indices of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of the
last three Gospels are believed to be the work of a later hand: the
Eusebian canons are absent. The breathings and accents are _prima manu_,
but often omitted or incorrectly placed. Itacisms and permutations of
consonants are very frequent, and the text is of an unusual and
interesting character. Scholz regards the directions for the Church
lessons, even the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} in the margin at the beginning and end of
lessons, as by the original scribe. He transcribes at length the
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} and the fragments of a menology prefixed to
Cod. K (N. T. vol. i, pp. 455-493), of which tables it affords the
earliest specimen. The second hand writes at the end {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
[{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}] {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}. The style of this
copy will be seen from our facsimile (No. 19) taken from John vi. 52, 53:
the number of the section ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}) or 66 stands in the margin, but the
ordinary place of the Eusebian canon ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} or 10) under it is filled by a
simple flourish. The stop in 1. 1 after {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~} illustrates the unusual
punctuation of this copy, as may that after {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}_ in 1. 3.

L. COD. REGIUS, No. 62 in the Royal Library at Paris, is by far the most
remarkable document of its age and class. It contains the Four Gospels,
except the following passages, Matt. iv. 22-v. 14; xxviii. 17-20: Mark x.
16-30; xv. 2-20: John xxi. 15-25. It was written in about the eighth
century and consists of 257 leaves quarto, of thick vellum, 9 inches high
by 6-1/2 broad, with two columns of twenty-five lines each on a page,
regularly marked, as we so often see, by the _stilus_ and ruler (p. 27).
This is doubtless Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}, though he cites it erroneously in Acts
xxiv. 7 bis; xxv. 14; xxvii. 1; xxviii. 11: it was even then in the Royal
Library, although "Roberto Stephano" is marked in the volume. Wetstein
collated Cod. L but loosely; Griesbach, who set a very high value on it,
studied it with peculiar care; Tischendorf published it in full in his
"Monumenta sacra inedita," 1846. It is but carelessly written, and abounds
with errors of the ignorant scribe, who was more probably an Egyptian than
a native Greek. The breathings and accents are often deficient, often
added wrongly, and placed throughout without rule or propriety. The
apostrophus also is common, and frequently out of place; the points for
stops are quite irregular, as we have elsewhere stated (p. 48). Capitals
occur plentifully, often painted and in questionable taste (see facsimile
No. 21, column 2), and there is a tendency throughout to inelegant
ornament. This codex is in bad condition through damp, the ink brown or
pale, the uncial letters of a debased oblong shape: _phi_ is enormously
large and sometimes quite angular; other letters are such as might be
looked for from its date, and are neither neat nor remarkably clear. The
lessons for Sundays, festivals, &c. and the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} are marked
everywhere in the margin, especially in St. Matthew; there are also many
corrections and important critical notes (e.g. Mark xvi. 8) in the text or
margin, apparently _prima manu_. Our facsimile is taken from a photograph
of its most important page, Mark xvi. 8, 9, with part of the note cited at
length below. Before each Gospel are indices of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, now
imperfect: we find also the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} at the head and occasionally at the
foot of the several pages; the numbers of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} (usually pointed
out by the sign of the cross), the sections and Eusebian canons stand in
the inner margin(176) often ill put, as if only half understood. The
critical weight of this copy may best be discussed hereafter; it will here
suffice barely to mention its strong resemblance to Cod. B (less, however,
in St. John's Gospel than elsewhere), to the citations of Origen
[186-253], and to the margin of the Harkleian Syriac version [A.D. 616].
Cod. L abounds in what are termed Alexandrian forms, beyond any other copy
of its date.

M. COD. CAMPIANUS, No. 48 in the Royal Library at Paris, contains the Four
Gospels complete in a small quarto form, written in very elegant and
minute uncials of the end of the ninth century, with two columns of
twenty-four lines each on a page. The Abbe Francois de Camps gave it to
Louis XIV, Jan. 1, 1707. This document is Kuster's 2 (1710); it was
collated by Wetstein, Scholz, and Tregelles; transcribed in 1841 by
Tischendorf. Its synaxarion and menology have been published by Scholz in
the same place as those of Cod. K, and obviously with great carelessness.
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, i.e. notes of the Church Lessons, abound in the margin
(Tischendorf thinks them _prima manu_) in a very small hand, like in style
to the Oxford Plato (Clarke 39, _above_, p. 42). We find too Hippolytus'
Chronology of the Gospels, Eusebius' letter to Carpianus with his canons,
and some Arabic scrawl on the last leaf, of which the name of Jerusalem
alone has been read, a note in Slavonic, and others in a contemporaneous
cursive hand. Dean Burgon also observed at the foot of the several pages
the same kind of harmony as we described for Cod. E. It has breathings,
accents pretty fairly given, and a musical notation in red, so frequent in
Church manuscripts of the age. Its readings are very good; itacisms and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} are frequent. Tischendorf compares the form of its uncials to
those of Cod. V; which, judging from the facsimile given by Matthaei, we
should deem somewhat less beautiful. From our facsimile (No. 32) it will
be seen that the round letters are much narrowed, the later form of
_delta_ and _theta_ quite decided, while _alpha_ and _pi_ might look
earlier. Our specimen (John vii. 53-viii. 2) represents the celebrated
Pericope adulterae in one of its earliest forms.

N. CODEX PURPUREUS. Only twelve leaves of this beautiful copy were till
recently believed to survive, and some former possessor must have divided
them in order to obtain a better price from several purchasers than from
one. Four leaves are now in the British Museum (Cotton, Titus C. xv), six
in the Vatican (No. 3785), two at Vienna (Lambec. 2), at the end of a
fragment of Genesis in a different hand. The London fragments (Matt. xxvi.
57-65; xxvii. 26-34: John xiv. 2-10; xv. 15-22) were collated by Wetstein
on his first visit to England in 1715, and marked in his Greek Testament
by the letter J: Scrivener transcribed them in 1845, and announced that
they contained fifty-seven various readings, of which Wetstein had given
but five. The Vienna fragment (Luke xxiv. 13-21; 39-49) had long been
known by the descriptions of Lambecius: Wetstein had called it N; Treschow
in 1773 and Alter in 1787 had given imperfect collations of it. Scholz
first noticed the Vatican leaves (Matt. xix. 6-13; xx. 6-22; xx. 29-xxi.
19), denoted them by {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}, and used some readings extracted by Gaetano
Marini. It was reserved for Tischendorf (Monumenta sacra inedita, 1846) to
publish them all in full, and to determine by actual inspection that they
were portions of the same manuscript, of the date of about the end of the
sixth century. Besides these twelve leaves John Sakkelion the Librarian
saw in or about 1864 at the Monastery of St. John in Patmos thirty-three
other leaves containing portions of St. Mark's Gospel (ch. vi. 53-xv.
23)(177), whose readings were communicated to Tischendorf, and are
included in his eighth edition of the N. T. The others were probably
stolen from the same place. This book is written on the thinnest vellum
(_see_ pp. 23, 25), dyed purple, and the silver letters (which have turned
quite black) were impressed in some way upon it, but are too varied in
shape, and at the end of the lines in size, to admit the supposition of
moveable type being used, as some have thought to be the case in the Codex
Argenteus of the Gothic Gospels. The abridgements _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_, &c. are in
gold; and some changes have been made by an ancient second hand. The
so-called Ammonian sections and the Eusebian canons are faithfully given
(_see_ p. 59), and the Vatican portion has the forty-first, forty-sixth,
and forty-seventh {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} of St. Matthew at the head of the pages. Each
page has two columns of sixteen lines, and the letters (about ten or
twelve in a line) are firm, uniform, bold, and unornamented, though not
quite so much so as in a few older documents; their lower extremities are
bevelled. Their size is at least four times that of the letters in Cod. A,
the punctuation quite as simple, being a single point (and that usually
neglected) level with the top of the letter (see our facsimile, Plate v,
No. 14, l. 3), and there is no space left between words even after stops.
A few letters stand out as capitals at the beginning of lines; of the
breathings and accents, if such they be, we have spoken above (p. 47).
Letters diminished at the end of a line do not lose their ancient shape,
as in many later books: _compendia scribendi_ are rare, yet [symbol]
stands for {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~} at the end of a line no less than twenty-nine times in the
London leaves alone, but [symbol] for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} only once. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~} at the beginning of
a syllable has two dots over it, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~} but one. We have discussed above (pp.
32-39) the shape of the alphabet in {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~} (for by that single letter
Tischendorf denotes it), and compared it with others of nearly the same
date; _alpha_, _omega_, _lambda_ look more ancient than _delta_ or _xi_
(_see_ Plate ii. No. 4). It exhibits strong Alexandrian forms, e.g.
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (the latter condemned _secunda manu_), and not a few
such itacisms as the changes of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}.

COD. Nb (Ib of Tischendorf's N. T., eighth edition), MUSEI BRITANNICI
(Addit. 17136), is a 12mo volume containing the hymns of Severus in
Syriac, and is one of the books brought thither from the Nitrian desert.
It is a palimpsest, with a second Syriac work written below the first,
and, under both, _four_ leaves (117, 118, 127, 128) contain fragments of
seventeen verses of St. John (xiii. 16; 17; 19; 20; 23; 24; 26; 27; xvi.
7; 8; 9 although only one word--{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}--is preserved; 12; 13; 15; 16; 18; 19).
These Tischendorf (and Tregelles about the same time) deciphered with
great difficulty, as every one who has examined the manuscript would
anticipate, and published in the second volume of his new collection of
"Monumenta sacra inedita." Each page contained two columns. We meet with
the sections without the Eusebian canons, the earliest form of uncial
characters, no capital letters (_see_ p. 51, note 2), and only the
simplest kind of punctuation, although one rough breathing is legible.
Tischendorf hesitates whether he shall assign the fragment to the fourth
or fifth century. It agrees with Cod. A five or six times, with Cod. B
five, with the two together six, and is against them both thrice.

O. No less than nine small fragments have borne this mark. O of Wetstein
was given by Anselmo Banduri to Montfaucon, and contains only Luke xviii.
11-14: _this_ Tischendorf discards as taken from an Evangelistarium (of
the tenth century, as he judges from the writing) chiefly because it wants
the number of the section at ver. 14. In its room he puts for Cod. O
Moscow Synod. 120 (Matthaei, 15), a few leaves of about the ninth century
(containing the fifteen verses, John i. 1, 3, 4; xx. 10-13; 15-17; 20-24,
with some scholia), which had been used for binding a copy of Chrysostom's
Homilies on Genesis, brought from the monastery of Dionysius at Mount
Athos, and published in Matthaei's Greek Testament with a facsimile (_see_
ix. 257 &c., and facsimile in tom. xii). Further portions of this fragment
were seen at Athos in 1864 by Mr. Philip E. Pusey. Tregelles has also
appended it to his edition of Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}. In this fragment we find the
cross-like _psi_, the interrogative ";" (John xx. 13), and the comma (ib.
ver. 12). Alford's Frag. Ath. b=Tisch. We--p. 145--and Frag. Ath. a are
probably parts of O. The next five comprise N. T. hymns.

COD. Oa. _Magnificat_ and _Benedictus_ in Greek uncials of the eighth or
ninth century, in a Latin book at Wolfenbuettel, is published by
Tischendorf, Anecdota sacr. et prof. 1855; as is also Ob, which contains
these two and _Nunc Dimittis_, of the ninth century, and is at Oxford,
Bodleian, Misc. Gr. 5, ff. 313-4(178). Oc. _Magnificat_ in the Verona
Psalter of the sixth century (the Greek being written in Latin letters),
published by Bianchini (Vindiciae Canon. Script. 1740). Od, Oe, both
contain the three hymns, Od in the great purple and silver Zurich Psalter
of the seventh century (Tischendorf, Monum. sacra inedita, tom. iv,
1869)(179); Oe of the ninth century at St. Gall (Cod. 17), partly written
in Greek, partly in Latin. Of, also of the ninth century, is described by
Tischendorf (N. T., eighth edition) once as "Noroff. Petrop.," once as
"Mosquensis." Og (IX) in the Arsenal Library at Paris (MS. Gr. 2),
containing, besides the Psalms and Canticle of the Old Testament, the
_Magnificat_, _Benedictus_, and _Nunc Dimittis_, besides the _Lord's
Prayer_, the _Sanctus_ and other such pieces. Oh. Taurinensis Reg. B. vii.
30 (viii or ix), 5-3/4 x 4, ff. 303 (20)(180).  Psalter with Luke i. 46-55;
ii. 29-31. See Gregory, Prolegomena, p. 441.

P. CODEX GUELPHERBYTANUS A, and Q. CODEX GUELPHERBYTANUS B. These are two
palimpsests discovered by F. A. Knittel, Archdeacon of Wolfenbuettel, in
the Ducal Library of that city, which (together with some fragments of
Ulphilas' Gothic version) lie under the more modern writings of Isidore of
Seville. He published the whole in 1762(181), so far at least as he could
read them, though Tregelles believed more might be deciphered, and
Tischendorf, with his unconquerable energy, collating them both in 1854,
was able to re-edit them more accurately, Cod. Q in the third volume
(1860) and Cod. P in the sixth (1869) of his Monumenta sacra inedita. The
volume (called the Codex Carolinus) seems to have been once at Bobbio, and
has been traced from Weissenburg to Mayence and Prague, till it was bought
by a Duke of Brunswick in 1689. Codex P contains, on forty-three or
forty-four leaves, thirty-one fragments of 518 verses, taken from all the
four Evangelists(182); Codex Q, on thirteen leaves, twelve fragments of
247 verses from SS. Luke and John(183); but all can be traced only with
great difficulty. A few portions, once written in vermilion, have quite
departed, but Tischendorf has made material additions to Knittel's
labours, both in extent and accuracy. He assigns P to the sixth, Q to the
fifth century. Both are written in two columns, the uncials being bold,
round or square, those of Q not a little the smaller. The letters in P,
however, are sometimes compressed at the end of a line. The capitals in P
are large and frequent, and both have the sections without the canons of
Eusebius (_see_ p. 59). The table of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} found in the volume is written
in oblong uncials of a lower date, as Knittel thought, possibly without
good reason. Itacisms, what are termed Alexandrian forms, and the usual
contractions (_{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}_, _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}_,
_{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}_, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~} [with symbol above it]) occur in both copies. Breathings also are
seen here and there in Q. From Tischendorf's beautiful facsimiles of Codd.
PQ we observe that while _delta_ is far more elaborate in P than in Q, the
precise contrary is the case with _pi_. _Epsilon_ and _sigma_ in P have
strong points at all the extremities; _nu_ in each is of the ancient form
exhibited in Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}NR (_see_ p. 37); while in P _alpha_ resembles in
shape that of our alphabet in Plate ii. No. 5, _eta_ that in Plate iii.
No. 7. As regards their text we observe that in the first hundred verses
of St. Luke which are contained in both copies, wherein P is cited for
various readings 216 times, and Q 182 times, P stands alone fourteen
times, Q not once. P agrees with other manuscripts against AB twenty-one
times, Q nineteen: P agrees with AB united fifty times, Q also fifty: P
sides with B against A twenty-nine times, Q thirty-eight: but P accords
with A against B in 102 places, Q in seventy-five.

R. This letter, like some that precede, has been used to represent
different books by various editors, a practice the inconvenience of which
is very manifest. (1) R of Griesbach and Scholz is a fragment of one
quarto leaf containing John i. 38-50, at Tuebingen, with musical notes,
which from its thick vellum, from the want of the sections and Eusebian
canons, and the general resemblance of its uncials to those of late
Service Books, Tischendorf pronounces to be an Evangelistarium, and puts
in its room (2) in his N. T. of 1849, fourteen leaves of a palimpsest in
the Royal Library of Naples (Borbon. ii. C. 15) of the eighth century,
under a _Typicum_ (see Suicer, Thes. Eccles. tom. ii. p. 1335), or Ritual
of the Greek Church, of the fourteenth century. These are fragments from
the first three Evangelists, in oblong uncials, leaning to the right.
Tischendorf, by chemical applications, was able in 1843 to read one page,
in two columns of twenty-five lines each (Mark xiv. 32-39)(184), and saw
the sections in the margin; the Eusebian canons he thinks have been washed
out (_see_ p. 59): but in 1859 he calls this fragment Wb, reserving the
letter R for (3) CODEX NITRIENSIS, Brit. Museum, Additional 17211, the
very important palimpsest containing on forty-eight (53) leaves about 516
verses of St. Luke in twenty-five fragments(185), under the black, broad
Syriac writing, being a treatise of Severus of Antioch against Johannes
Grammaticus, of the eighth or ninth century. There are two columns of
about twenty-five lines each on a page; for their boldness and simplicity
the letters may be referred to the end of the sixth century; we have given
a facsimile of the manuscript (which cannot be read in parts but with the
utmost difficulty), and an alphabet collected from it (Nos. 5, 17). In
size and shape the letters are much like those of Codd. INP, only that
they are somewhat irregular and straggling: the punctuation is effected by
a single point almost level with the top of the letters, as in Cod. N. The
pseudo-Ammonian sections are there without the Eusebian canons, and the
first two leaves are devoted to the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} of St. Luke. This most
important palimpsest is one of the 550 manuscripts brought to England,
about 1847, from the Syrian convent of S. Mary Deipara, in the Nitrian
Desert, seventy miles N. W. of Cairo. When examined at the British Museum
by the late Canon Cureton, then one of the Librarians, he discovered in
the same volume, and published in 1851 (with six pages in facsimile), a
palimpsest of 4000 lines of Homer's Iliad not in the same hand as St.
Luke, but quite as ancient. The fragments of St. Luke were independently
transcribed, with most laudable patience, both by Tregelles in 1854, and
by Tischendorf in 1855, who afterwards re-examined the places wherein he
differed from Tregelles (e.g. chh. viii. 5; xviii. 7, 10), and discovered
by the aid of Dr. Wright a few more fragments of chh. vi-viii. Tischendorf
published an edition of Cod. R in his "Monumenta sacra inedita," vol. ii,
with a facsimile: the amended readings, together with the newly-discovered
variations in chh. vi. 31-36, 39, vii. 44, 46, 47, are inserted in the
eighth edition of his Greek Testament. In this palimpsest as at present
bound up in the Museum the fragments of St. Luke end on f. 48, and the
rest of the Greek in the volume is in later, smaller, sloping uncials, and
contains propositions from the tenth and thirteenth books of Euclid. On
the critical character of the readings of this precious fragment we shall
make some comments below.

S. CODEX VATICANUS 354 contains the four Gospels entire, and is amongst
the earliest dated manuscripts of the Greek Testament (p. 41, note 2).
This is a folio of 234 leaves, written in large oblong or compressed
uncials: the Epistle to Carpianus and Eusebian canons are prefixed, and it
contains many later corrections (e.g. Luke viii. 15) and marginal notes
(e.g. Matt. xxvii. 16, 17). Luke xxii. 43, 44; John v. 4; vii. 53-viii. 11
are obelized. At the end we read {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}

"Codicem bis diligenter contulimus," says
Birch: but collators in his day (1781-3) seldom noticed orthographical
forms or stated where the readings _agree_ with the received text, so that
a more thorough examination was still required. Tregelles only inspected
it, but Tischendorf, when at Rome in 1866, carefully re-examined it, and
has inserted many of its readings in his eighth edition and its
supplementary leaves. He states that Birch's facsimile (consisting of the
obelized John v. 4) is coarsely executed, while Bianchini's is too
elegant; he made another for himself.

T. CODEX BORGIANUS I, now in the Propaganda at Rome (_see below_, Evan.
180), contains thirteen or more quarto leaves of SS. Luke and John, with a
Thebaic or Sahidic version at their side, but on the opposite and left
page. Each page consists of two columns: a single point indicates a break
in the sense, but there are no other divisions. The fragment contains Luke
xxii. 20-xxiii. 20; John vi. 28-67; vii. 6-viii. 31 (179 verses, since
John vii. 53-viii. 11 are wanting). The portion containing St. John, both
in Greek and Egyptian, was carefully edited at Rome in 1789 by A. A.
Giorgi, an Augustinian Eremite; his facsimile, however (ch. vii. 35),
seems somewhat rough, though Tischendorf (who has inspected the codex)
says that its uncials look as if written by a Copt, from their resemblance
to Coptic letters(186): the shapes of _alpha_ and _iota_ are specially
noticeable. Birch had previously collated the Greek text. Notwithstanding
the occasional presence of the rough and smooth breathing in this copy (p.
47)(187), Giorgi refers it to the fourth century, Tischendorf to the
fifth. The Greek fragment of St. Luke was first collated by Mr. Bradley H.
Alford, and inserted by his brother, Dean Alford, in the fourth edition of
his Greek Testament, vol. i (1859). Dr. Tregelles had drawn Mr. Alford's
attention to it, from a hint thrown out by Zoega, in p. 184 of his
"Catalogus codd. Copt. MSS. qui in Museo Borgiano Velitris adservantur."
Romae, 1810.

Ts or Twoi is used by Tischendorf to indicate a few leaves in Greek and
Thebaic, which once belonged to Woide, and were published with his other
Thebaic fragments in Ford's Appendix to the Codex Alexandrinus, Oxon.
1799. They contain Luke xii. 15-xiii. 32; John viii. 33-42 (eighty-five
verses). From the second fragment it plainly appears (what the similarity
of the facsimiles had suggested to Tregelles) that T and Ts are parts of
the same manuscript, for the page of Ts which contains John viii. 33 in
Greek exhibits on its reverse the Thebaic version of John viii. 23-32, of
which T affords us only the Greek text. This fact was first noted by
Tischendorf (N. T. 1859), who adds that the Coptic scribe blundered much
over the Greek: e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} Luke xiii. 21; so {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, ver.
16. He transcribed T and Twoi (as well as Tb, Tc, Td, which we proceed to
describe), for publication in the ninth volume of his "Monumenta sacra
inedita" (1870), but owing to his death they never appeared. But Bp.
Lightfoot gives reasons (_see below_, vol. ii. c. 2) for thinking that
this fragment was not originally a portion of T.

Tb at St. Petersburg much resembles the preceding in the Coptic-like style
of writing, but is not earlier than the sixth century. It contains on six
octavo leaves John i. 25-42; ii. 9-iv. 50, spaces left in the text
answering the purpose of stops. Tb has a harmony of the Gospels at the
foot of the page.

Tc is a fragment of about twenty-one verses between Matt. xiv. 19 and xv.
8, also of the sixth century, and at St. Petersburg, in the collection of
Bishop Porphyry. Its text in the twenty-nine places cited by Tischendorf
in his eighth edition accords with Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} twenty-four times, with Cod. B
twenty times, with Codd. C and D sixteen times each, with Cod. 33 nine
times. Cod. A is wanting here. Compared with these primary authorities
severally, it agrees with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} alone once, with 33 alone twice, with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}B
united against the rest four times: so that its critical character is very
decided.

Td is a fragment of a Lectionary, Greek and Sahidic, of about the seventh
century, found by Tischendorf in 1866 among the Borgian manuscripts at
Rome. It contains Matt. xvi. 13-20; Mark i. 3-8, xii. 35-37; John xix.
23-27; xx. 30-31: twenty-four verses only. This fragment and the next have
been brought into this place, rather than inserted in the list of
Evangelistaria, because they both contained fragments of the Thebaic
version.

Te is a fragment of St. Matthew at Cambridge (Univ. Libr. Addit. 1875).
Dr. Hort communicated its readings to Dr. C. R. Gregory, for his
Prolegomena to the eighth edition of Tischendorf's N. T. It is "a tiny
morsel" of an uncial Lectionary of the sixth century, containing only
Matt. iii. 13-16, the parallel column probably in the Thebaic version
having perished. It was brought, among other Coptic fragments, from Upper
Egypt by Mr. Greville Chester. Dr. Hort kindly enables me to add to his
description of Te (Addenda to Tregelles' N. T. p. 1070) that this "tiny
morsel" is irregular in shape, frequently less than four inches in width
and height, the uncial Greek letters being three-eighths of an inch high.
There seem to have been two columns of either eight or more probably of
twenty-four lines each on a page, but no Coptic portions survive. "If of
twenty-four lines the fragment might belong to the inner column of a
bilingual MS. with the two languages in parallel columns, or to the outer
column of a wholly Greek MS. or of a bilingual MS. with the section in the
two languages consecutively, as in Mr. Horner's Graeco-Thebaic fragment
(Evst. 299: _see_ p. 398). In the latter case it might belong to the inner
column of a wholly Greek MS. or of a bilingual MS. with the section in two
consecutive languages. The size of the letters renders it improbable,
however, that the columns were of eight lines only." (Hort.)

U. CODEX NANIANUS I, so called from a former possessor, is now in the
Library of St. Mark, Venice (I. viii). It contains the four Gospels
entire, carefully and luxuriously written in two columns of twenty-one
lines each on the quarto page, scarcely before the tenth century, although
the "letters are in general an imitation of those used before the
introduction of compressed uncials; but they do not belong to the age when
full and round writing was customary or natural, so that the stiffness and
want of ease is manifest" (Tregelles' Horne, p. 202). It has _Carp._,
_Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _pict._, with much gold ornament. Thus
while the small {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} in l. 1 of our facsimile (No. 22) is in the oldest
style, the oblong _omicrons_ creep in at the end of lines 2 and 4. Muenter
sent some extracts from this copy to Birch, who used them for his edition,
and states that the book contains the Eusebian canons. Accordingly in Mark
v. 18, B (in error for H) stands under the proper section _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}_ (48).
Tischendorf in 1843 and Tregelles in 1846 collated Cod. U thoroughly and
independently, and compared their work at Leipsic for the purpose of
mutual correction.

V. CODEX MOSQUENSIS, of the Holy Synod, is known almost(188) exclusively
from Matthaei's Greek Testament: he states, no doubt most truly, that he
collated it "bis diligentissime," and gives a facsimile of it, assigning
it to the eighth century. Judging from Matthaei's plate, it is hard to say
why others have dated it in the ninth. It contained in 1779, when first
collated, the Four Gospels in 8vo with the sections and Eusebian canons,
in uncial letters down to John vii. 39, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, and from that point
in cursive letters of the thirteenth century, Matt. v. 44-vi. 12; ix.
18-x. 1 being lost: when re-collated but four years later Matt. xxii.
44-xxiii. 35; John xxi. 10-25 had disappeared. Matthaei tells us that the
manuscript is written in a kind of stichometry by a diligent scribe: its
resemblance to Cod. M has been already mentioned. The cursive portion is
Matthaei's V, Scholz's Evan. 250.

Wa. COD. REG. PARIS 314 consists of but two leaves at the end of another
book, containing Luke ix. 34-47; x. 12-22 (twenty-three verses). Its date
is about the eighth century; the uncial letters are firmly written,
_delta_ and _theta_ being of the ordinary oblong shape of that period.
Accents and breathings are usually put; all the stops are expressed by a
single point, whose position makes no difference in its power. This copy
was adapted to Church use, but is not an Evangelistarium, inasmuch as it
exhibits the sections and Eusebian canons(189), and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} twice at the
head of the page. This fragment was brought to light by Scholz, and
published by Tischendorf, Monumenta sacra inedita, 1846.

Wb. Tischendorf considers the fragment at Naples he had formerly numbered
R (2) as another portion of the same copy, and therefore indicates it in
his seventh edition of the N. T. (1859) as Wb. It has seventy-nine leaves,
of which the fourteen last are palimpsest, is written in two columns, with
twenty-five lines in each page; has the Ammonian sections and lections,
and contains Matt. xix. 14-28; xx. 23-xxi. 2; xxvi. 52-xxvii. 1; Mark
xiii. 21-xiv. 67; Luke iii. 1-iv. 20. (Prolegomena to Tischendorf, p.
395.)

Wc is assigned by Tischendorf to three leaves containing Mark ii. 8-16;
Luke i. 20-32; 64-79 (thirty-five verses), which have been washed to make
a palimpsest, and the writing erased in parts by a knife. There are also
some traces of a Latin version, but all these were used up to bind other
books in the library of St. Gall. They are of the eighth century, or the
ninth according to Tischendorf, edd. 7 and 8, and have appeared in vol.
iii of "Monumenta sacra inedita," with a facsimile, whose style closely
resembles that of Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}, and its kindred FG of St. Paul's Epistles.

Wd was discovered in 1857 by Mr. W. White, sub-librarian of Trinity
College, Cambridge, in the College Library, and was afterwards observed,
and arranged by Mr. H. Bradshaw, University Librarian, its slips (about
twenty-seven in number) having been worked into the binding of a volume of
Gregory Nazianzen: they are now carefully arranged under glass (B. viii.
5). They comprise portions of four leaves, severally containing Mark vii.
3-4; 6-8; 30-36; 36-viii. 4; 4-10; 11-16; ix. 2; 7-9, in uncial letters of
the ninth century, if not rather earlier, slightly leaning to the right.
The sections are set in the margin without the Eusebian canons, with a
table of harmony at the foot of each page of twenty-four lines. The {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
are in red at the top and bottom of the pages, their corresponding
numerals in the margin. The breathings and accents are often very faint:
lessons and musical notes, crosses, &c. are in red, and sometimes cover
the original stops. In text it much resembles Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BDL{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}: one reading
(Mark vii. 33) appears to be unique. Dr. Scrivener has included it in a
volume of fresh collations of manuscripts and editions which is shortly to
appear under the accomplished editorship of Mr. J. Rendel Harris.

We is a fragment containing John iv. 7-14, in three leaves, found by the
Very Rev. G. W. Kitchin, Dean of Winchester, in Christ Church Library,
when Tischendorf was at Oxford in 1865. It much resembles O at Moscow,
and, like it, had a commentary annexed, to which there are numeral
references set before each verse.

Wf is a palimpsest fragment of St. Matt. xxv. 31-36, and vi. 1-18
(containing the doxology in the Lord's Prayer), of about the ninth
century, underlying Wake 13 at Christ Church, Oxford (Acts 192, Paul.
246), discovered by the late Mr. A. A. Vansittart (Journal of Philology,
vol. ii. no. 4, p. 241, note 1).

X. CODEX MONACENSIS, in the University Library at Munich (No. 1/26), is a
valuable folio manuscript of the end of the ninth or early in the tenth
century, containing the Four Gospels (in the order described above, with
serious omissions)(190), and a commentary (chiefly from Chrysostom)
surrounding and interspersed with the text of all but St. Mark, in early
cursive letters, not unlike (in Tischendorf's judgement) the celebrated
Oxford Plato dated 895. The very elegant uncials of Cod. X "are small and
upright; though some of them are compressed, they seem as if they were
_partial_ imitations of those used in very early copies" (Tregelles'
Horne, p. 195). Each page has two columns of about forty-five lines each.
There are no divisions by {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} or sections, nor notes to serve for
ecclesiastical use. From a memorandum we find that it came from Rome to
Ingoldstadt, as a present from Gerard Vossius [1577-1649]; from
Ingoldstadt it was taken to Landshut in 1803, thence to Munich in 1827.
When it was at Ingoldstadt Griesbach obtained some extracts from it
through Dobrowsky; Scholz first collated it, but in his usual unhappy way;
Tischendorf in 1844, Tregelles in 1846. Dean Burgon examined it in 1872.

Y. CODEX BARBERINI 225 at Rome (in the Library founded by Cardinal
Barberini in the seventeenth century) contains on six large leaves the 137
verses John xvi. 3-xix. 41, of about the eighth century. Tischendorf
obtained access to it in 1843 for a few hours, after some difficulty with
the Prince Barberini, and published it in his first instalment of
"Monumenta sacra inedita," 1846. Scholz had first noticed, and loosely
collated it. A later hand has coarsely retraced the letters, but the
ancient writing is plain and good. Accents and breathings are most often
neglected or placed wrongly: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~} [each with a small symbol after and
below the character] are frequent at the end of lines. For punctuation
one, two, three or even four points are employed, the power of the single
point varying as in Codd. E {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}a and B of the Apocalypse. The
pseudo-Ammonian sections are without the Eusebian canons: and such forms
as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} xvi. 14, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} ver. 24 occur. These few uncial leaves are
prefixed to a cursive copy of the Gospels with Theophylact's commentary
(Evan. 392): the text is mixed, and lies about midway between that of Cod.
A and Cod. B.

Z. CODEX DUBLINENSIS RESCRIPTUS, one of the chief palimpsests extant,
contains 295 verses of St. Matthew's Gospel in twenty-two fragments(191).
It is of a small quarto size, originally 10-1/2 inches by 8, now reduced to
8-1/4 inches by 6, once containing 120 leaves arranged in quaternions, of
which the first that remains bears the _signature_ 13 ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}): fourteen
sheets or double leaves and four single leaves being all that survive. It
was discovered in 1787 by Dr. John Barrett, Senior Fellow of Trinity
College, Dublin, under some cursive writing of the tenth century or later,
consisting of Chrysostom de Sacerdotio, extracts from Epiphanius, &c. In
the same volume are portions of Isaiah (eight leaves) and of Gregory
Nazianzen, in erased uncial letters, the latter not so ancient as the
fragment of St. Matthew. All the thirty-two leaves of this Gospel that
remain were engraved in copper-plate facsimile(192) at the expense of
Trinity College, and published by Barrett in 1801, furnished with
Prolegomena, and the contents of each facsimile plate in modern Greek
characters, on the opposite page. The facsimiles are not very accurate,
and the form of the letters is stated to be less free and symmetrical than
in the original: yet from these plates (for the want of a better guide)
our alphabet (No. 6) and specimen (No. 18) have been taken. The Greek type
on the opposite page was not very well revised, and a comparison with the
copper-plate will occasionally convict it of errors, which have been
animadverted upon more severely than was quite necessary. The Prolegomena
were encumbered with a discussion of our Lord's genealogies quite foreign
to the subject, and the tone of scholarship is not very high; but
Barrett's judgement on the manuscript is correct in the main, and his
conclusion, that it is as old as the sixth century, has been generally
received. Tregelles in 1853 was permitted to apply a chemical mixture to
the vellum, which was already miserably discoloured, apparently from the
purple dye: he was thus enabled to add a little (about 200 letters) to
what Barrett had read long since(193), but he found that in most places
which that editor had left blank, the vellum had been cut away or lost: it
would no doubt have been better for Barrett to have stated, in each
particular case, why he had been unable to give the text of the passage. A
far better edition of the manuscript, including the fragment of Isaiah,
and a newly-discovered leaf of the Latin Codex Palatinus (_e_), with
Prolegomena and two plates of real facsimiles, was published in 1880 by T.
K. Abbott, B.D., Professor of Biblical Greek in the University of Dublin.
He has read 400 letters hitherto deemed illegible, and is inclined to
assign the fifth century as the date of the Codex. Codex Z, like many
others, and for the same orthographical reasons, has been referred to
Alexandria as its native country. It is written with a single column on
each page of twenty-one or twenty-three lines(194). The so-named Ammonian
sections are given, but not the Eusebian canons: the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} are written at
the top of the pages by a later hand according to Porter and Abbott,
though this may be questioned (Gebhardt and Harnack's "Texte," &c., I. iv.
p. xxiii ff., 1883), their numbers being set in the margin. The writing is
continuous, the _single_ point either rarely found or quite washed out:
the abbreviations are very few, and there are no breathings or accents.
Like Cod. B, this manuscript indicates citations by > in the margin, and
it represents N by --, but only at the end of a word and line. A space,
proportionate to the occasion, is usually left when there is a break in
the sense, and capitals extend into the margin when a new section begins.
The letters are in a plain, steady, beautiful hand: they yield in elegance
to none, and are never compressed at the end of a line. The shape of
_alpha_ (which varies a good deal), and especially that of _mu_, is very
peculiar: _phi_ is inordinately large: _delta_ has an upper curve which is
not usual: the same curves appear also in _zeta_, _lambda_, and _chi_. The
characters are less in size than in N, about equal to those in R, much
greater than in AB. In regard to the text, it agrees much with Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BD:
with Cod. A it has only twenty-three verses in common: yet in them A and Z
vary fourteen times. Mr. Abbott adds that while {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BZ stand together ten
times against other uncials, BZ are never alone, but {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}Z against B often.
It is freer than either of them from transcriptural errors. Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BCZ
combine less often than {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BDZ. On examining Cod. Z throughout twenty-six
pages, he finds it alone thirteen times, differing from {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} thirty times,
from B forty-four times, from Stephen's text ninety-five times. Thus it
approaches nearer to {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} than to B.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}. CODEX TISCHENDORFIAN. IV was brought by Tischendorf from an "eastern
monastery" (he usually describes the locality of his manuscripts in such
like general terms), and was bought of him for the Bodleian Library (Misc.
Gr. 313) in 1855. It consists of 158 leaves, 12 inches x 9-1/4, with one
column (of twenty-four not very straight or regular lines) on a page, in
uncials of the ninth century, leaning slightly back, but otherwise much
resembling Cod. K in style (facsimile No. 35). St. Luke's Gospel is
complete; the last ten leaves are hurt by damp, though still legible. In
St. Mark only 105 verses are wanting (iii. 35-vi. 20); about 531 verses of
the other Gospels survive(195). Tischendorf, and Tregelles by his leave,
have independently collated this copy, of which Tischendorf gives a
facsimile in his "Anecdota sacra et profana," 1855. Some of its peculiar
readings are very notable, and few uncials of its date deserve that more
careful study, which it has hardly yet received. In 1859 Tischendorf, on
his return from his third Eastern journey, took to St. Petersburg
ninety-nine additional leaves of this self-same manuscript, doubtless
procured from the same place as he had obtained the Bodleian portion six
years before (Notitia Cod. Sinait. p. 53). This copy of the Gospels,
though unfortunately in two distant libraries, is now nearly perfect(196),
and at the end of St. John's Gospel, in the more recently discovered
portion, we find an inscription which seems to fix the date: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}_, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}. _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}_, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}_, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}_. Tischendorf,
by the aid of Ant. Pilgrami's "Calendarium chronologum medii potissimum
aevi monumentis accommodatum," Vienn. 1781, pp. vii, 11, 105, states that
the only year between A.D. 800 and 950, on which the Indiction was eight,
and Nov. 27 fell on a Thursday, was 844(197). In the Oxford sheets we find
tables of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} before the Gospels of SS. Matthew and Luke; the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
at the heading of the pages; their numbers _rubro_ neatly set in the
margin; capitals in red at the commencement of these chapters; the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} of lections; the sections and Eusebian canons in their usual
places, and some liturgical directions. Over the original breathings and
accents some late scrawler has in many places put others, in a very
careless fashion.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}. CODEX SANGALLENSIS, was first inspected by Gerbert (1773), named by
Scholz (N. T. 1830), and made fully known to us by the admirable edition
in lithographed facsimile of every page, by H. Ch. M. Rettig [1799-1836],
published at Zurich, 1836(198), with copious and satisfactory Prolegomena.
It is preserved and was probably transcribed a thousand years since in the
great monastery of St. Gall in the north-east of Switzerland (Stifts
bibliothek, 48). It is rudely written on 197 leaves of coarse vellum
quarto, 8-7/8 inches by 7-1/8 in size, with from twenty to twenty-six
(usually twenty-one) lines on each page, in a very peculiar hand, with an
interlinear Latin version, and contains the four Gospels complete except
John xix. 17-35. Before St. Matthew's Gospel are placed Prologues, Latin
verses, the Eusebian canons in Roman letters, tables of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} both
in Greek and Latin, &c. Rettig thinks he has traced several different
scribes and inks employed on it, which might happen easily enough in the
Scriptorium of a monastery; but, if so, their style of writing is very
nearly the same, and they doubtless copied from the same archetype, about
the same time. He has produced more convincing arguments to show that Cod.
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} is part of the same book as the Codex Boernerianus, G of St. Paul's
Epistles. Not only do they exactly resemble each other in their whole
arrangement and appearance, but marginal notes by the first hand are found
in each, of precisely the same character. Thus the predestinarian
doctrines of the heretic Godeschalk [d. 866] are pointed out for
refutation at the hard texts, Luke xiii. 24; John xii. 40 in {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}, and six
times in G(199). St. Mark's Gospel represents a text different from that
of the other Evangelists, and the Latin version (which is clearly _prima
manu_) seems a mixture of the Vulgate with the older Italic, so altered
and accommodated to the Greek as to be of little critical value. The
penmen seem to have known but little Greek, and to have copied from a
manuscript written continuously, for the divisions between the words are
sometimes absurdly wrong. There are scarcely any breathings or accents,
except about the opening of St. Mark, and once an aspirate to {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}; what
we do find are often falsely given; and a dot is set in most places
regularly at the end of every _Greek_ word. The letters have but little
tendency to the oblong shape, but _delta_ and _theta_ are decidedly of the
latest uncial type. Here, as in Paul. Cod. G, the mark >>> is much used to
fill up vacant spaces. The text from which {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} was copied seems to have been
arranged in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, for almost every line has at least one Greek capital
letter, grotesquely ornamental in colours(200). We transcribe three lines,
taken almost at random, from pp. 80-1 (Matt. xx. 13-15), in order to
explain our meaning:

It will be observed that, while in Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} a line begins at any place, even
in the middle of a word; if the capital letters be assumed to commence the
lines, the text divides itself into regular {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}. See above, pp. 52-54.
Here are also the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, the sections and canons. The letters {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ZETA~}
and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~} and the Latin R are perpetually confounded. Facsimiles
of Luke i. 1-9 may be seen in Pal. Soc. xi. 179. As in the kindred Codd.
Augiensis and Boernerianus the Latin f is much like r. Tregelles has noted
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} ascript in Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}, but this is rare. There is no question that this
document was written by Latin (most probably by Irish) monks, in the west
of Europe, during the ninth century (or the tenth, Pal. Soc.).  _See
below_, Paul. Cod. G.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}a. CODEX TISCHENDORFIAN. I was brought from the East by Tischendorf in
1845, published by him in his "Monumenta sacra inedita," 1846, with a few
supplements in vol. ii of his new collection (1857), and deposited in the
University Library at Leipsic. It consists of but four leaves (all
imperfect) quarto, of very thin vellum, almost too brittle to be touched,
so that each leaf is kept separately in glass. It contains about forty-two
verses; viz. Matt. xii. 17-19; 23-25; xiii. 46-55 (in mere shreds); xiv.
8-29; xv. 4-14, with the greater {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} in red; the sections and
Eusebian canons stand in the inner margin. A few breathings are _prima
manu_, and many accents by two later correctors. The stops (which are
rather numerous) resemble those of Cod. Y, only that four points are not
found in {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}a. Tischendorf places its date towards the end of the seventh
century, assigning Mount Sinai or lower Egypt for its country. The uncials
(especially {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}) are somewhat oblong, leaning to the right (_see_ p. 41
note), but the writing is elegant and uniform; _delta_ keeps its ancient
shape, and the diameter of _theta_ does not extend beyond the curve. In
regard to the text, it much resembles {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}B, and stands alone with them in
ch. xiv. 12 ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}).

Seven other small fragments, of which four and part of another are from
the manuscripts of Bishop Porphyry at St. Petersburg, were intended to be
included in Tischendorf's ninth volume of "Monumenta sacra inedita"
(1870), but owing to Tischendorf's death they never appeared. That active
critic had brought two ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}b, d) and part of another ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}c) from the East, and
deposited them in the Library at St. Petersburg. They are described by him
as follows:

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}b, six leaves in large 8vo, of the sixth or seventh century, torn
piecemeal for binding and hard to decipher, contains Matt. xxii. 16-xxiii.
13; Mark iv. 24-35; v. 14-23.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}c, one folio leaf, of the sixth century, much like Cod. N, contains Matt.
xxi. 19-24. Another leaf contains John xviii. 29-35.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}d, half a leaf in two columns, of the seventh or eighth century, with
accents by a later hand, contains Luke xi. 37-41; 42-45.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}e, containing fragments of Matt. xxvi. 2-4; 7-9: {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}f, of Matt. xxvi.
59-70; xxvii. 44-56; Mark i. 34-ii. 12 (not continuously throughout): {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}g
of John vi. 13, 14; 22-24; are all of about the sixth century.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}h, consisting of three leaves, in Greek and Arabic of the ninth or tenth
centuries, contains imperfect portions of Matt. xiv. 6-13; xxv. 9-16;
41-xxvi. 1.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}. CODEX TISCHENDORFIAN. III(201), whose history, so far as we know it,
exactly resembles that of Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}, and like it is now in the Bodleian
(Auct. T. Infra I. 1). It contains 157 leaves, written in two columns of
twenty-three lines each, in small, oblong, clumsy, sloping uncials of the
eighth or rather of the ninth century (_see_ p. 41, note 1, and facsimile
No. 30). It has the Gospels of St. Luke and St. John complete, with the
subscription to St. Mark, each Gospel being preceded by tables of
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, with the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} at the heads of the pages; the numbers of the
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, of the sections, and of the Eusebian canons (these last _rubro_)
being set in the margin. There are also scholia interspersed, of some
critical value; a portion being in uncial characters. This copy also was
described (with a facsimile) by Tischendorf, Anecdota sacra et profana,
1855, and collated by himself and Tregelles. Its text is said to vary
greatly from that common in the later uncials, and to be very like
Scholz's 262 (Paris 53). For {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _ascriptum_ see p. 44, note 2.

Here again the history of this manuscript curiously coincides with that of
Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}. In his Notitia Cod. Sinaitici, p. 58, Tischendorf describes an
early cursive copy of St. Matthew and St. Mark (_the subscription to the
latter being wanting_), which he took to St. Petersburg in 1859, so
exactly corresponding in general appearance with Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~} (although that be
written in uncial characters), as well as in the style and character of
the marginal scholia, which are often in small uncials, that he pronounces
them part of the same codex. Very possibly he _might_ have added that he
procured the two from the same source: at any rate the subscription to St.
Matthew at St. Petersburg precisely resembles the other three
subscriptions at Oxford, and those in Paris 53 (Scholz's 262)(202), with
which Tischendorf had previously compared Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~} (N. T. Proleg. p.
clxxvii, seventh edition). These cursive leaves are preceded by Eusebius'
Epistle to Carpianus, his table of canons, and a table of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of
St. Matthew. The {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in uncials head the pages, and their numbers stand
in the margin.

From the marginal scholia Tischendorf cites the following notices of the
Jewish Gospel, or that according to the Hebrews, which certainly have
their value as helping to inform us respecting its nature: Matt. iv. 5 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}

Jerome (contra Pelag. III) expressly cites from the Gospel of the
Nazarenes. xxvi. 47 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}.
It is plain that this whole matter requires careful discussion, but at
present it would seem that the first half of Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~} was written in
cursive, the second in uncial letters; if not by the same person, yet on
the same plan and at the same place.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}. CODEX ZACYNTHIUS is a palimpsest in the Library of the British and
Foreign Bible Society in London, which, under a cursive Evangelistarium
written on coarse vellum in or about the thirteenth century, contains
large portions (342 verses) of St. Luke, down to ch. xi. 33(203), in full
well-formed uncials, but surrounded by and often interwoven with large
extracts from the Fathers, in a hand so cramped and, as regards the round
letters ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}), so oblong, that it cannot be earlier than the eighth
century, although some such compressed forms occur in Cod. P of the sixth
(_see_ p. 144). The general absence of accents and breathings also would
favour an earlier date. As the arrangement of the matter makes it certain
that the commentary is contemporaneous, Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~} must be regarded as the
earliest known, indeed as the only uncial, copy furnished with a catena.
This volume, which once belonged to "Il Principe Comuto, Zante," and is
marked as {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} 1820, was
presented to the Bible Society in 1821 by General Macaulay, who brought it
from Zante. Mr. Knolleke, one of the Secretaries, seems first to have
noticed the older writing, and on the discovery being communicated to
Tregelles in 1858 by Dr. Paul de Lagarde of Berlin, with characteristic
eagerness that critic examined, deciphered, and published the Scripture
text, together with the Moscow fragment O, in 1861: he doubted whether the
small Patristic writing could all be read without chemical restoration.
Besides the usual {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} above the text and other notations of sections,
and numbers running up from 1 to 100 which refer to the catena, this copy
is remarkable for possessing also the division into chapters, hitherto as
has been stated deemed unique in Cod. B. To this notation is commonly
prefixed _psi_, formed like a cross, in the fashion of the eighth century.
The ancient volume must have been a large folio (14 inches by 11), of
which eighty-six leaves and three half-leaves survive: of course very hard
to read. Of the ecclesiastical writers cited by name Chrysostom, Origen,
and Cyril are the best known.  In text it generally favours the B and {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}
and their company. In the 564 places wherein Tischendorf cites it in his
eighth edition, it supports Cod. L in full three cases out of four, and
those the most characteristic. It stands alone only fourteen times, and
with Cod. L or others against the five great uncials only thirty times. In
regard to these five, Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~} sides plainly with Cod. B in preference to
Cod. A, following B alone seven times, BL twenty-four times, but {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}
thirteen times, A fifteen times, C (which is often defective) five times,
D fourteen times, with none of these unsupported except with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} once. Their
combinations in agreement with {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~} are curious and complicated, but lead to
the same result.  This copy is with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}B six times, with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BL fifty-five;
with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BC twenty, but with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BD as many as fifty-four times, with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BCD
thirty-eight times; with BCD thrice, with BC six times, with BD thirteen.
It combines with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}A ten times, with AC fifteen, with AD eleven, with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}AC
sixteen, with ACD twelve, with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}AD six, with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}ACD twelve. Thus Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~}
favours B against A 226 times, A against B ninety-seven. Combinations of
its readings opposed to both A and B are {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}C six, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}D eight, CD two, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}CD
three. In the other passages it favours ABC against {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}D eleven times, ABCD
against {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} eight times, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}ABC against D eighteen times, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}ABD against C, or
where C is defective, thirty-nine times, and is expressly cited
twenty-seven times as standing with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}ABCD against later copies. The
character of the variations of Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI~} from the Received text may be judged
of by the estimate made by some scholar, that forty-seven of them are
transpositions in the order of the words, 201 are substitutions of one
word for another, 118 are omissions, while the additions do not exceed
twenty-four (_Christian Remembrancer_, January, 1862). The cursive
Evangelistarium written over the uncial is noticed below, and bears the
mark 200*.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}. CODEX PETROPOLITANUS consists of 350 vellum leaves in small quarto, and
contains the Gospels complete except Matt. iii. 12-iv. 18; xix. 12-xx. 3;
John viii. 6-39; seventy-seven verses. A century since it belonged to
Parodus, a noble Greek of Smyrna, and its last possessor was persuaded by
Tischendorf, in 1859, to present it to the Emperor of Russia. Tischendorf
states that it is of the age of the later uncials (meaning the ninth
century), but of higher critical importance than most of them, and much
like Cod. K in its rarer readings. There are many marginal and other
corrections by a later hand, and John v. 4; viii. 3-6 are obelized. In the
table of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} before St. Mark, there is a gap after _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}_: Mark xvi.
18-20; John xxi. 22-25 are in a later hand. At the end of St. Mark, the
last section inserted is _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}_ by the side of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~} ver. 9, with _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}_
under it for the Eusebian canon. Tischendorf first used its readings for
his Synopsis Evangelica 1864, then for the eighth edition of his Greek
Testament 1865, &c. This manuscript in the great majority of instances
sides with the later uncials (whether supported by Cod. A or not) against
Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BCD united.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}. COD. ROSSANENSIS, like Cod. N described above, is a manuscript written
on thin vellum leaves stained purple, in silver letters, the first three
lines of each Gospel being in gold. Like Cod. D it probably dates from the
sixth century, if not a little sooner, and is the earliest known copy of
Scripture which is adorned with miniatures in watercolours, seventeen in
number, very interesting and in good preservation. The illustrated
Dioscorides at Vienna bears about the same date. Attention was called to
the book by Cesare Malpica in 1846, but it was not seen by any one who
cared to use it before March, 1879, when Oscar von Gebhardt of Goettingen
and Adolf Harnack of Giessen, in their search for codices of Hippolytus,
of Dionysius of Alexandria, and of Cyril of Jerusalem, described by
Cardinal Sirlet in 1582, found it in the Archbishop's Library at Rossano,
a small city in Calabria, and published an account of it in 1880 in a
sumptuous form, far more satisfactory to the artist than to the Biblical
critic. Their volume is illustrated by two facsimile leaves, of one of
which a reduction may be seen in our Plate xiv, No. 43. A copy of the
manuscripts was published at Leipsic in 1883 with an Introduction by Oscar
von Gebhardt, the Text being edited by Adolf Harnack(204). The page we
have exhibited gives the earliest MS. authority, except {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI~}, for the
doxology in the Lord's Prayer, Matt. vi. 13. The manuscript is in quarto,
13-1/2 inches high by 10-1/4 broad, and now contains only the Gospels of St.
Matthew and St. Mark on 188 leaves of two columns each, there being twenty
lines in each column of very regular writing, and from nine to twelve
letters in each line. It ends abruptly at Mark xvi. 14, and the last ten
leaves have suffered from damp; otherwise the writing (especially on the
inner or smooth side of the vellum) is in good preservation, and the
colours of the paintings wonderfully fresh. The binding is of strong black
leather, about 200 years old. As in Cod. B, the sheets are ranged in
quinions, the _signatures_ in silver by the original scribe standing at
the lower border of each quire on the right, and the pages being marked in
the upper border in modern black ink. In Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} there is no separation
between the words, it has no breathings or accents. Capital letters stand
outside the columns, being about twice the size of the rest, and the
smaller letters at the end of lines are not compressed, as we find them
even in Cod. P (_see_ pp. 144, 163). The letters are round and square,
and, as was abundantly seen above (pp. 33-40), belong to the older type of
writing. The punctuation is very simple: the full stop occurs half up the
letter. There are few erasures, but transcriptural errors are mostly
corrected in silver letters by the original scribe. To St. Matthew's
Gospel is prefixed Eusebius' Epistle to Carpianus and his Tables of
Canons, both imperfect; also lists of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} _majora_ and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in
the upper margins of the several leaves, with a subscription to the first
Gospel ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}). This supplementary matter is written
somewhat smaller, but (as the editors judge) by the same hand as the text,
although the letters are somewhat more recent in general appearance, and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
_ascriptum_ occurs, as it never does in the body of the manuscript:
[symbol] also is only twice abridged in the text, but often in the smaller
writing. In the margin of the Greek text the Ammonian sections stand in
minute characters over the numbers of the Eusebian canons. The text agrees
but slightly with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} or B, and rather with the main body of uncials and
cursives, which it favours in about a proportion of three to one. With the
cognate purple manuscript Cod. N it accords so wonderfully, that although
one of them cannot have been copied directly from the other, they must
have been drawn directly or indirectly from the same source. Strong proofs
of the affinity between N and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} are Matt. xix. 7 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} added to {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}:

places the two manuscripts are either virtually or entirely alone.
Generally speaking, the Codex Rossanensis follows the Traditional Text,
but not invariably. We find here the usual itacisms, as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} for
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}, and vice versa; even {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}, which is rarer
in very ancient copies.

it in age.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}. CODEX BLENHEIMIUS. Brit. Mus. Additional 31919, formerly Blenheim 3. D.
13, purchased at Puttick's from the Sunderland sale in April, 1882. Under
a Menaeum (_see_ our Evst. 282) for the twenty-eight days of February
[A.D. 1431], 12-7/8 x 8-1/8, containing 108 leaves, Professors T. K.
Abbott and J. P. Mahaffy of Trinity College, Dublin, discovered at
Blenheim in May, 1881, _palimpsest_ fragments of the Gospels of the eighth
century, being seventeen passages scattered over thirty-three of the
leaves: viz. Matt. i. 1-14; v. 3-19; xii. 27-41; xxiii. 5-xxv. 30;
43-xxvi. 26; 50-xxvii. 17. Mark i. 1-42; ii. 21-v. 1; 29-vi. 22; x. 50-xi.
13. Luke xvi. 21-xvii. 3; 19-37; xix. 15-31. John ii. 18-iii. 5; iv.
23-37; v. 35-vi. 2: in all 484 verses. In 1883, Dr. Gregory discovered two
more leaves, making thirty-six in all, with a reduction of the passages to
sixteen by filling up an hiatus, and giving a total of 497 verses. It is
probable that writing lies under all the 108 leaves. It exhibits _Am._
(not _Eus._) in gold, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, but is very hard to read, and has
not yet been collated. Of less account are palimpsest pieces of the
eleventh century on some of the leaves, containing Matt. xi. 13, &c.; Luke
i. 64, &c.; ii. 25-34, and a later cursive patch (fol. 23) containing Mark
vi. 14-20.

{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI~}. CODEX BERATINUS. This symbol was taken by Herr Oscar von Gebhardt to
denote the imaginary parent of Cursives 13, 69, 124, 346, of which the
similarity has been traced by the late W. H. Ferrar and Dr. T. K. Abbott
in "A Collection of Four Important MSS." (1877). But it is now permanently
affixed to an Uncial MS. seen by M. Pierre Batiffol on the instigation of
Prof. Duchesne in 1875 at Berat or Belgrade in Albania. This manuscript
had been previously described by Mgr. Anthymus Alexoudi, Orthodox
Metropolitan of Belgrade, in an account of his diocese published in 1868
in Corfu. According to M. Batiffol, it is a purple manuscript, written in
silver letters on vellum, an _edition de grande luxe_, and therefore open
to the charge brought by St. Jerome in his Prolegomena to Job against the
great adornment of manuscripts, as being far from constituting an index of
accuracy. It contains 190 unpaged leaves in quaternions, firmly sewn
together, having two columns in a page of seventeen lines each, and from
eight to twelve words in a line. The leaves are in size about 12-1/4 inches
by 10-1/2, and the columns measure 8-1/4 inches high by rather more than 4-1/4
broad. The pages have the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} marked at the top, and the sections and
canons in writing of the eighth century at the side. The letters are in
silver, very regular, and clearly written. None are in gold, except the
title and the first line in St. Mark, and the words {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, and
some others in the first six folios. There is no ornamentation, but the
first letters of paragraphs are twice as large as the other letters. The
letters have no decoration, except a cross in the middle of the initial
O's. The writing is continuous in full line without stichometry.
Quotations from the Old Testament are marked with a kind of inverted
comma. There are no breathings, or accents. Punctuation is made only with
the single comma or double comma, consisting of a point slightly elongated
much like a modern written comma, and placed at about mid-height, or else
with a vacant space, or by passing to the next line. The apostrophe is not
always used to mark elisions, but is generally put after {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~} final.
Abbreviations are of the most ancient kind. The character of the letters
may be seen in the specimen given above, No. 43. Altogether, the Codex
Beratinus ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI~}) may probably be placed at the end of the fifth century, a
little before the Dioscorides (506 A.D.), and before the Codex
Rossanensis.

As to the character of the text, it inclines to the large body of Uncials
and Cursives, and is rarely found with B{~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} and Z of St. Matthew or {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} of St.
Mark. A specimen examination of fifty passages at the beginning of St.
Matthew gives forty-four instances in which it agrees with the larger body
of Uncials and Cursives, six when it passes over to the other side, whilst
in thirty-eight it agrees with {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}. In the same passages, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} agrees
thirty-eight times with the larger body, and twelve times with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} or B.
Like {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} it contains the doxology in Matt. vi. 13.

Codex {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI~} has gone through many vicissitudes. It has perhaps been at Patmos,
where it may have been mutilated by some of the Crusaders, and at Antioch.
It contains only St. Matthew and St. Mark; a note says that the
disappearance of St. Luke and St. John is due to the Franks of Champagne.
The first six folios are in a bad state, so that the text as we have it
does not begin till St. Matt. vi. 3 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. Hiatus occurs
Matt. vii. 26-viii. 7, in xviii. 23-xix. 3, and in Mark xiv. 62-fin. So
that Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI~} presents no direct evidence--only the testimony to the general
character of its companions derived from its own character and general
coincidence--upon the last twelve verses of St. Mark. Part of folio 112, at
the end of St. Matthew, is blank, and folios 113, 114, contain the
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of St. Mark.

the Bodleian at Oxford. It is a Latin-Greek copy, with two columns on a
page, the Latin version holding the post of honour on the left, and is
written in very short {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} consisting of from one to three words each,
the Latin words always standing opposite to the corresponding Greek. This
peculiar arrangement points decisively to the West of Europe as its
country, notwithstanding the abundance of Alexandrian forms has led some
to refer it to Egypt. The very large, bold, thick, rude uncials, without
break in the words and without accents, lead us up to the end of the sixth
century as its date. The Latin is not of Jerome's or the Vulgate version,
but is made to correspond closely with the Greek, even in its
interpolations and rarest various readings. The contrary supposition that
the Greek portion of this codex _Latinised_, or had been altered to
coincide with the Latin, is inconsistent with the facts of the case. This
manuscript contains only the Acts of the Apostles (from ch. xxvi. 29
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} to ch. xxviii. 26 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} being lost), and exhibits a remarkable
modification of the text, of which we shall speak in Chapter VII. That the
book was once in Sardinia, appears from an edict of Flavius Pancratius,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, appended (as also is the Apostles'
Creed in Latin, and some other foreign matter) in a later hand: Imperial
governors ruled in that island with the title of _dux_ from the reign of
Justinian, A.D. 534 to A.D. 749. It was probably among the Greek volumes
brought into England by the fellow-countryman of St. Paul, Theodore of
Tarsus(205), "the grand old man" as he has been called by one of kindred
spirit to his own (Dean Hook, Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, vol.
i. p. 150), who came to England as Primate at the age of sixty-six, A.D.
668, and died in 690. At all events, Mill (N. T. Proleg.  1022-6)(206)
has rendered it all but certain, that the Venerable Bede [d. 735] had this
very codex before him when he wrote his "Expositio Retractata" of the
Acts(207), and Woide (Notitia Cod. Alex., p. 156, &c.) has since alleged
six additional instances of agreement between them. The manuscript,
however, must have been complete when Bede used it, for he cites in the
Latin ch. xxvii. 5; xxviii. 2. Tischendorf (Proleg. p. xv) adds ch. xxvii.
1, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17: but these last instances are somewhat uncertain.
This manuscript, with many others, was presented to the University of
Oxford in the year 1636, by its munificent Chancellor, Archbishop Laud.
Thomas Hearne, the celebrated antiquary, published a full edition of it in
1715, which is now very scarce, and was long known to be far from
accurate. Sabatier in 1751 gave the Latin of it taken from Hearne.
Tischendorf has published a new edition, from two separate collations made
by himself in 1854 and 1865, in the ninth volume by way of Appendix to his
"Monumenta sacra inedita," 1870. It is also found in vol. ii of Hansell's
edition of the Ancient Texts, published at the Clarendon Press in 1864.
Cod. E has been stated to have capital letters at the commencement of each
of the Euthalian sections, but as the capitals occur at other places where
the sense is broken but slightly (e.g. ch. xvii. 20), this circumstance
does not prove that those sections were known to the scribe. It is in size
10-1/4 inches by 8-1/2, and consists of 227 leaves of twenty-three,
twenty-four, twenty-five, or twenty-six lines each; about fifteen leaves
are lost: the vellum is rather coarse in quality, and the ink in many
places very faint. There seem to be no stops nor breathings, except an
aspirate over initial _upsilon_ ([symbol] or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}, sometimes _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} [with
diaresis]) almost invariably. The shape of _xi_ is more complicated than
usual (see our facsimile, No. 25); the other letters (e.g. _delta_ or
_psi_) are such as were common in the sixth or early in the seventh
century. There are also many changes by a later uncial hand. Mr. Hansell
(Ancient Texts, Oxford, 1864), as well as Tischendorf, exhibits one whole
page in zinco-photography.

Fa. COD. COISLIN. I.

G. Tischendorf, in his eighth edition of the N. T., assigns this letter
(formerly appropriated to Cod. L) to one octavo leaf of the seventh
century, now at St. Petersburg, written in thick uncials without accents,
torn from the wooden cover of a Syriac book, and containing Acts ii.
45-iii. 8. It has a few rare and valuable readings. Dr. Hort (Supplement
to Tregelles, p. 1021) cites it as Ga.

Gregory, Prolegomena, p. 414.

H. COD. MUTINENSIS [cxcvi], ii. G. 3, of the Acts, in the Grand Ducal
Library at Modena, is an uncial copy of about the ninth century, defective
in Acts i. 1-v. 28; ix. 39-x. 19; xiii. 36-xiv. 3, all supplied by a
cursive hand [h], "in my judgement ... scarcely later" (Burgon), and in
xxvii. 4-xxviii. 31 (written in uncials of about the eleventh century).
The Epistles are in cursive letters of the twelfth century, indicated in
the Catholic Epistles by h, in the Pauline by 179. Scholz first collated
it loosely, as usual; then Tischendorf in 1843, Tregelles in 1846,
afterwards comparing their collations for mutual correction.

K. COD. MOSQUENSIS, S. Synodi No. 98, is Matthaei's g, and came from the
monastery of St. Dionysius on Mount Athos. It contains the Catholic
Epistles entire, but not the Acts; and the Pauline Epistles are defective
only in Rom. x. 18-1 Cor. vi. 13; 1 Cor. viii. 7-11. Matthaei alone has
collated this document, and judging from his facsimile (Cath. Epp. 1782)
it seems to belong to the ninth century. This copy is Scholz's Act. 102,
Paul. 117. It is not so thoroughly known but that it is often necessary to
cite its readings _ex silentio_.

L (formerly G). COD. BIBLIOTH. ANGELICAE A. 2. 15, belonging to the
Augustinian monks at Rome, formerly "Cardinalis Passionei," contains the
Acts from ch. viii. 10, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} to the end, the Catholic Epistles
complete, and the Pauline down to Heb. xiii. 10, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, of a date
not earlier than the middle of the ninth century. It was collated in part
by Bianchini and Birch, in full by Scholz (1820, J. Paul) and by F. F.
Fleck (1833). Tischendorf in 1843, Tregelles in 1845, collated it
independently, and subsequently compared their papers, as they have done
in several other instances.

M of Gregory (Gb), fol., ff. 5 (22), palimpsest, containing fragments of
Acts xvi-xviii of the eighth or ninth century, was published by Cozza
(Sacr. Bibl. Vetust. Frag. iii: Rome, 1877). It was transferred to the
Vatican (No. 9671) from the Greek convent of Grotta Ferrata.

P. COD. PORPHYRIANUS is a palimpsest containing the Acts, all the
Epistles, the Apocalypse, and a few fragments of 4 Maccabees, of the ninth
century, found by Tischendorf in 1862 at St. Petersburg in the possession
of the Archimandrite (now Bishop) Porphyry, who allowed him to take it to
Leipsic to decipher. He has published it at length in his "Monumenta sacra
inedita," vol. v, vi, whence Tregelles derived its readings for the
Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse. In the latter book it is especially
useful, and generally confirms Codd. AC, though it is often with Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~},
sometimes against all the rest. It has the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} [with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~} over them] and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}
[with circumflex over them] of Church lessons in the margin, and is
defective (besides a few words or letters lost here and there) in Acts i.
1-ii. 15; 1 John iii. 20-v. 1; Jude 4-15; Rom. ii. 16-iii. 5; viii. 33-ix.
11; xi. 22-xii. 1; 1 Cor. vii. 16, 17; xii. 23-xiii. 5; xiv. 23-39; 2 Cor.
ii. 14, 15; Col. iii. 16-iv. 8; 1 Thess. iii. 5-iv. 17; Apoc. xvi.
13-xvii. 1; xx. 1-9; xxii. 6-21. Moreover James ii. 12-21; 2 Pet. i.
20-ii. 5 are barely legible. Mr. Hammond (Outlines of Textual Criticism)
has taken from Tischendorf's fifth volume a neat facsimile of it in Acts
iv. 10-15, comprising uncials of the latest form, leaning to the right,
lying under cursive writing (Heb. vii. 17-25), some four centuries more
recent. Dr. Hort (Supplement to Tregelles, p. xxx) states that in the Acts
the text of Cod. P is almost exclusively of a very late type, but that it
contains a much larger though varying proportion of various readings
elsewhere, except in 1 Peter. The upper or later writing in this
manuscript is, for once, available for critical purposes, since it
consists of fragments of the labours of Euthalius (_see_ p. 64), and is
cited by Tischendorf under the notation of Euthal.cod.

D. COD. CLAROMONTANUS, No. 107 of the Royal Library at Paris, is a
Greek-Latin copy of St. Paul's Epistles, one of the most ancient and
important in existence. Like the Cod. Ephraemi in the same Library it has
been fortunate in such an editor as Tischendorf, who published it in 1852
with complete Prolegomena, and a facsimile traced by Tregelles. This noble
volume is in small quarto, written on 533 leaves of the thinnest and
finest vellum: indeed its extraordinary delicacy has caused the writing at
the back of every page to be rather too visible on the other side. The
words, both Greek and Latin, are written continuously (except the Latin
titles and subscriptions), but in a stichometrical form (_see_ p. 52): the
Greek, as in Cod. Bezae, stands on the left or first page of the opened
book, not on the right, as in the Cod. Laudianus. Each page has but one
column of about twenty-one lines, so that in this copy, as in the Codex
Bezae, the Greek and Latin are in parallel lines, but on separate pages.
The ink is dark and clear, and otherwise the book is in good condition. It
contains all St. Paul's Epistles (the Hebrews after Philemon), except Rom.
i. 1-7; 27-30, both Greek and Latin: Rom. i. 24-27 in the Latin is
supplied in a later but very old hand, as also are Rom. i. 27-30 and 1
Cor. xiv. 13-22 in the Greek: the Latin of 1 Cor. xiv. 8-18; Heb. xiii.
21-23 is lost. The Epistle to the Hebrews has been erroneously imputed by
some to a later scribe, inasmuch as it is not included in the list of the
sacred books and in the number of their {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} or _versus_, which stand
immediately _before_ the Hebrews in this codex(208): but the same list
overlooks the Epistle to the Philippians, which has never been doubted to
be St. Paul's: in this manuscript, however, the Epistle to the Colossians
precedes that to the Philippians. Our earliest notice of it is derived
from the Preface to Beza's third edition of the N. T. (Feb. 20, 1582): he
there describes it as of equal antiquity with his copy of the Gospels (D),
and states that it had been found "in Claromontano apud Bellovacos
coenobio," at Clermont near Beauvais. Although Beza sometimes through
inadvertence calls his codex of the Gospels Claromontanus, there seems no
reason for disputing with Wetstein the correctness of his account (see p.
125, note 2), though it throws no light on the manuscript's early history.
From Beza it passed into the possession of Claude Dupuy, Councillor of
Paris, probably on Beza's death [1605]: thence to his sons Jacques and
Pierre Dupuy: before the death of Jacques (who was the King's Librarian)
in 1656, it had been bought by Louis XIV for the Royal Library at Paris.
In 1707, John Aymont, an apostate priest, stole thirty-five leaves; one,
which he disposed of in Holland, was restored in 1720 by its possessor
Stosch; the rest were sold to that great collector, Harley, Earl of
Oxford, but sent back in 1729 by his son, who had learnt their shameful
story. Beza made some, but not a considerable, use of this document; it
was amongst the authorities consulted for Walton's Polyglott; Wetstein
collated it twice in early life (1715-16); Tregelles examined it in 1849,
and compared his results with the then unpublished transcript of
Tischendorf, which proved on its appearance (1852) the most difficult, as
well as one of the most important, of his critical works; so hard it had
been found at times to determine satisfactorily the original readings of a
manuscript which had been corrected by _nine_ different hands, ancient and
modern. The date of the codex is doubtless the sixth century, in the
middle or towards the end of it. The Latin letters, especially _d_, are
the latest in form (facsimile No. 41, 1 Cor. xiii. 5-8), and are much like
those in the Cod. Bezae (No. 42), which in many points Cod. Claromontanus
strongly resembles. Leaves 162, 163 are palimpsest, and contain part of
the Phaethon, a lost play of Euripides. We have already noticed many of
its peculiarities (pp. 33-40), and need not here repeat them. _Delta_ and
_pi_ look more ancient even than in Cod. A: the uncials are simple,
square, regular and beautiful, of about the size of those in Codd. CD, and
larger than in Cod. B. The stichometry forbids our assigning it to a
period earlier than the end of the fifth century while other circumstances
connected with the Latin version tend to put it a little lower still. The
apostrophus is frequent, but there are few stops or abridgements; no
breathings or accents are _prima manu_. Initial letters, placed at the
beginning of books or sections, are plain, and not much larger than the
rest. The comparative correctness of the Greek text, and its Alexandrian
forms, have caused certain critics to refer us as usual to Egypt for its
country: the Latin text is more faulty, and shows comparative ignorance of
the language: yet of what use a Latin version could be except in Africa or
western Europe it were hard to imagine. This Latin is more independent of
the Greek, and less altered from it than in Codd. Bezae or Laudian.,
wherein it has little critical value: that of Cod. Claromont. better
represents the African type of the Old Latin. Of the corrections, a few
were made by the original scribe when revising; a hand of the seventh
century went through the whole (D**); two others follow; then in sharp
black uncials of the ninth or tenth century another made more than two
thousand critical changes in the text, and added stops and all the
breathings and accents (D***); another D**** (among other changes) added
to the Latin subscriptions. Db supplied Rom. i. 27-30 very early; Dc, a
later hand, 1 Cor. xiv. 13-22. Tischendorf distinguishes several others
besides these.

E. COD. SANGERMANENSIS is another Greek-Latin manuscript and takes its
name from the Abbey of St. Germain des Prez near Paris. Towards the end of
the last century the Abbey (which at the Revolution had been turned into a
saltpetre manufactory) was burnt down, and many of its books were lost. In
1805 Matthaei found this copy, as might almost have been anticipated, at
St. Petersburg, where it is now deposited. The volume is a large quarto,
the Latin and Greek in parallel columns on the same page, the Greek
standing on the left; its uncials are coarse, large, and thick, not unlike
those in Cod. E of the Acts, but of later shape, with breathings and
accents _prima manu_, of about the tenth, or late in the ninth,
century(209). It was used for the Oxford New Testament of 1675: Mill
obtained some extracts from it, and noted its obvious connexion with Cod.
Claromontanus: Wetstein thoroughly collated it; and not only he but
Sabatier and Griesbach perceived that it was, at least in the Greek,
nothing better than a mere transcript of Cod. Claromontanus, made by some
ignorant person later than the corrector indicated by D****. Muralt's
endeavours to shake this conclusion have not satisfied better judges;
indeed the facts are too numerous and too plain to be resisted. Thus,
while in Rom. iv. 25 Cod. D reads {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (accentuated {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} by
D***), in which D*** changes {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, the writer of Cod. E adopts
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} with its monstrous accent: in 1 Cor. xv. 5 Cod. D reads {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, D*** {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} (again observe the accents), out
of which Cod. E makes up {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}. In Gal. iv. 31 Cod. D
has {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}, which is changed by D*** into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}: Cod. E mixes up the two into
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}. Compare Tischendorf's notes on Eph. ii. 19; Heb. x. 17, 33, and
Dr. Hort's longer specimen, Rom. xv. 31-3 (Introd. p. 254). The Latin
version also is borrowed from Cod. D, but is more mixed, and may be of
some critical use: the Greek is manifestly worthless, and should long
since have been removed from the list of authorities. This copy is
defective, Rom. viii. 21-33; ix. 15-25; 1 Tim. i. 1-vi. 15; Heb. xii.
8-xiii. 25.

Fa COD. COISLIN. I.

F. COD. AUGIENSIS in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. xvii.
1), is another Greek-Latin manuscript on 136 leaves of good vellum 4to
(the _signatures_ proving that seven more are lost, _see_ p. 28), 9 inches
by 7-1/4, with the two languages in parallel columns of twenty-eight lines
on each page, the Greek being always inside, the Latin next the edge of
the book. It is called from the monastery of Augia Dives or Major
(Reichenau, or _rich meadow_), on a fertile island in the lower part of
Lake Constance, to which it long appertained, and where it may even have
been written, a thousand years since. By notices at the beginning and end
we can trace it through the hands of G. M. Wepfer of Schaffhausen and of
L. Ch. Mieg, who covered many of its pages with Latin notes wretchedly
scrawled, but allowed Wetstein to examine it. In 1718 Bentley was induced
by Wetstein to buy it at Heidelberg for 250 Dutch florins, and both he and
Wetstein collated the Greek portion, the latter carelessly, but Bentley
somewhat more fully in the margin of a Greek Testament (Oxon. 1675) still
preserved in Trinity College (B. xvii. 8). Tischendorf in 1842, Tregelles
in 1845, re-examined the book (which had been placed where it now is on
the death of Bentley's nephew in 1787), and drew attention to the Latin
version: in 1859 Scrivener published an edition of the Codex in common
type, with Prolegomena and a photograph of one page (1 Tim. iii. 14-iv.
5)(210).  The Epistles of St. Paul are defective in Rom. i. 1-iii. 19; and
the Greek only in 1 Cor. iii. 8-16; vi. 7-14; Col. ii. 1-8; Philem. 21-25;
in which four places the Latin stands in its own column with no Greek over
against it. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Greek being quite lost, the
Latin occupies both columns: this Epistle alone has an Argument, almost
verbatim the same as we read in the great Cod. Amiatinus of the Vulgate.
At the end of the Epistle, and on the same page (fol. 139, _verso_),
commences a kind of Postscript (having little connexion with the sacred
text), the larger portion of which is met with under the title of Dicta
Abbatis Pinophi, in the works of Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mayence,
who died in A.D. 856; from which circumstance the Cod. Augiensis has been
referred to the ninth century. Palaeographical arguments also would lead
us to the same conclusion. The Latin version (a modification of the
Vulgate in its purest form, though somewhat tampered with in parts to make
it suit the Greek text(211)) is written in the cursive minuscule character
common in the age of Charlemagne. The Greek must have been taken from an
archetype with the words continuously written; for not only are they
miserably ill divided by the unlearned German(212) scribe, but his design
(not always acted upon) was to put a single middle point at the end of
each word. The Latin is exquisitely written, the Greek uncials are neat,
but evidently the work of an unpractised hand, which soon changes from
weariness. The shapes of _eta_, _theta_, _pi_, and other testing letters
are such as we might have expected from the date; some others have an
older look.  Contrary to the more ancient custom, capitals, small but
numerous, occur in the _middle_ of the lines in both languages. Of the
ordinary breathings(213) and accents there are no traces.  Here and there
we meet with a straight line, inclined between the horizontal and the
acute accent, placed over an initial vowel, usually when it should be
aspirated, but not always (e.g. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} 1 Cor. vi. 18). Over {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} double
or single points, or a comma, are frequently placed, especially if they
begin a syllable; and occasionally a large comma or kind of circumflex
over {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, and some other vowels and diphthongs. The arrangement of the
Greek forbids punctuation there; in the Latin we find the single middle
point as a colon or after an abridgement, the semicolon (;) sometimes, the
note of interrogation (?) when needed. Besides the universal forms of
abridgement (_see_ p. 49), [symbol] and [symbol] are frequent in the
Greek, but no others: in the Latin the abbreviations are numerous, and
some of them unusual: Scrivener (Cod. Augiensis Proleg. pp. xxxi-ii) has
drawn up a list of them. This copy abounds as much as any with real
variations from the common text, and with numberless errors of the pen,
itacisms of vowels, and permutations of consonants. It exhibits many
corrections, a few _prima manu_, some unfortunately very recent, but by
far the greater number in a hand almost contemporary with the manuscript,
which has also inserted over the Greek, in 106 places, Latin renderings
differing from those in the parallel column, but which in eighty-six of
these 106 instances agree with the Latin of the sister manuscript.

G. COD. BOERNERIANUS, so called from a former possessor, but now in the
Royal Library at Dresden. In the sixteenth century it belonged to Paul
Junius of Leyden: it was bought dear at the book-sale of Peter Francius,
Professor at Amsterdam, in 1705, by C. F. Boerner, a Professor at Leipsic,
who lent it to Kuster to enrich his edition of Mill (1710), and
subsequently to Bentley. The latter so earnestly wished to purchase it as
a companion to Cod. F, that though he received it in 1719, it could not be
recovered from him for five years, during which he was constantly offering
high sums for it(214): a copy, but not in Bentley's hand, had been already
made (Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 2). Cod. G was published in full by Matthaei in
1791, in common type, with two facsimile pages (1 Cor. ii. 9-iii. 3; 1
Tim. i. 1-10), and his edition is believed to be very accurate; Anger,
Tischendorf, Tregelles, Boettiger and others who have examined it have only
expressly indicated three errors(215). Rettig has abundantly proved that,
as it is exactly of the same size, so it once formed part of the same
volume with Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} (_see_ p. 157 and note): they must date towards the end
of the ninth century, and may very possibly have been written in the
monastery of St. Gall (where {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} still remains) by some of the Irish monks
who flocked to those parts. That Cod. G has been in such hands appears
from some very curious Irish lines at the foot of one of Matthaei's plates
(fol. 23), which, after having long perplexed learned men, have at length
been translated for Dr. Reeves, the eminent Celtic scholar(216). All that
we have said respecting the form of Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} applies to this portion of it:
the Latin version (a specimen of the Old Latin, but as in Codd. Bezae and
Laudianus much changed to suit the Greek) is cursive and interlinear; the
Greek uncials coarse and peculiar; the punctuation chiefly a stop at the
end of the words, which have no breathings nor accents. Its affinity to
the Cod. Augiensis has no parallel in this branch of literature. Scrivener
has noted all the differences between them at the foot of each page in his
edition of Cod. F: they amount to but 1,982 places, whereof 578 are mere
blunders of the scribe, 967 changes of vowels or itacisms, 166
interchanges of consonants, seventy-one grammatical or orthographical
forms; the remaining 200 are real various readings, thirty-two of them
relating to the article. While in Cod. F (whose first seven leaves are
lost) the text commences at Rom. iii. 19, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, this portion is found
complete in Cod. G, except Rom. i. 1-5; ii. 16-25. All the other lacunae
of Cod. F occur also in Cod. G, which ends at Philem. 20 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}_: there
is no Latin version to supply these gaps in Cod. G, but a blank space is
always left, sufficient to contain what is missing. At the end of Philemon
G writes (ad) {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} (laudicenses) {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}(217) (incipit) {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
(epistola) {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, but neither that writing nor the Epistle to the
Hebrews follows. It seems tolerably plain that one of these manuscripts
was not copied immediately from the other, for while they often accord
even in the strangest errors of the pen that men unskilled in Greek could
fall into, their division of the Greek words, though equally false and
absurd, is often quite different: it results therefore that they are
independent transcripts of the same venerable archetype (probably
stichometrical and some centuries older than themselves) which was written
without any division between the words(218). From the form of the letters
and other circumstances Cod. F may be deemed somewhat but not much the
older; its corrector _secunda manu_ evidently had both the Greek and the
Latin of Cod. G before him, and Rabanus, in whose works the Dicta Pinophi
are preserved (p. 178), was the great antagonist of Godeschalk, on whom
the annotator of Codd. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}G bears so hard. Cod. G is in 4to, of ninety-nine
leaves, with twenty-one lines in each. The line indicating breathing (if
such be its use, _see_ p. 178) and the mark > employed to fill up spaces
(p. 51), more frequent in it than in F.

                  -------------------------------------

Since Dr. Scrivener wrote the above, a very valuable little treatise--a
"specimen primum"--has been given to the learned world by Herr P.
Corssen(219), and a most clear and carefully argued paper has been sent to
the editor by the Rev. Nicholas Pocock of Clifton. Both Herr Corssen and
Mr. Pocock agree in showing that F was not derived from G, nor G from F,
but that they come from the same original. Both agree, again, that the
Greek version is derived, at least in large measure, from the Latin, as in
such instances as the following, which are supplied by Mr. Pocock, who
holds, and appears to prove, that F and G were copied from an interlinear
manuscript: _ut sciatis_, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} (F, G), 1 Thess. iii. 3; _sicut
cancer ut serpat_, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} (G), 2 Tim. ii. 17, F having
the same reading, only dividing the last word; Gal. iv. 3 _eramus autem
servientes_, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} (F, G). Herr Corssen considers that a
Latin was the scribe of the original, that it was written in Italy, and
that it was better than the Claromontanus (D), to which it had affinities,
this last having an amended text with corrections from the Greek. The
original of all three he supposes to date from not before the fifth
century. But in some of these last suppositions we are getting upon the
ocean of conjecture.

H. COD. COISLIN. 202 is a very precious fragment, of which twelve leaves
are in the Imperial Library at Paris; nine are in the monastery or laura
of St. Athanasius at Mount Athos, and have been edited by M. Duchesne in
the "Archives des missions scientifiques et litteraires" (1876); two more
are at Moscow, and have been described by Matthaei (D. Pauli Epp. ad Hebr.
et Col. Riga, 1784, p. 58); some others are in the Antonian Library of St.
Petersburg (three); some more in the Imperial Library as described by
Muralt (two), or in that of Bishop Porphyry (one), or at Turin (two). The
leaves at Paris contain 1 Cor. x. 22-29; xi. 9-16; 1 Tim. iii. 7-13; Tit.
i. 1-3; 15-ii. 5; iii. 13-15; Heb. ii. 11-16; iii. 13-18; iv. 12-15. At
Mount Athos are 2 Cor. x. 18-xi. 6; xi. 12-xii. 2; Gal. i. 1-4; ii. 4-17;
iv. 30-v. 5. At Moscow, Heb. x. 1-7; 32-38. At St. Petersburg, 2 Cor. iv.
2-7; 1 Thess. ii. 9-13; iv. 5-11 (Antonian); Gal. i. 4-10; ii. 9-14
(Imperial).  In the Library of Bishop Porphyry, Col. iii. 4-11; and at
Turin, 1 Tim. vi. 9-13; 2 Tim. ii. 1-9. They are in quarto, with large
square uncials of about sixteen lines on a page, and date from the sixth
century. Breathings and accents are added by a later hand, which retouched
this copy (_see_ Silvestre, Paleographie Universelle, Nos. 63, 64). These
leaves, which comprise one of our best authorities for stichometrical
writing, were used in A.D. 1218 to bind some other manuscripts on Mount
Athos, and thence came into the library of Coislin, Bishop of Metz.
Montfaucon has published Cod. H in his "Bibliotheca Coisliniana," but
Tischendorf, who transcribed it, projected a fuller and more accurate
edition. He observed at Paris in 1865 an additional passage, 2 Cor. iv.
4-6 (Monum. sacr. ined. vol. ix. p. xiv, note), and cites Cod. H in his
eighth edition on 1 Tim. vi. 19; Heb. x. 1-6; 34-38. The subscriptions,
which appear due to Euthalius of Sulci(220), written in vermilion, are not
retouched, and consequently have neither breathings nor accents. Besides
arguments to the Epistles, we copy the following final subscription from
Tischendorf (N. T. 1859, p. clxxxix): {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}

From this
subscription we may conclude with Dr. Field (Proleg. in Hexapla Origenis,
p. xcix) that the noble Library at Caesarea was still safe in the sixth
century, though it may have perished A.D. 638, when that city was taken by
the Saracens.

I. COD. TISCHENDORFIAN. II, at St. Petersburg. Add also two large leaves
of the sixth century, elegantly written, without breathings or accents,
containing 2 Cor. i. 20-ii. 12. Described by Tischendorf, Notitia Cod.
Sin. Append, p. 50, cited as O in his eighth edition of the N. T.

K. COD. MOSQUENSIS.

L. COD. ANGELICUS at Rome.

M. CODEX RUBER is peculiar for the beautifully bright red colour of the
ink(221), the elegance of the small uncial characters, and the excellency
and critical value of the text. Two folio leaves, containing Heb. i. 1-iv.
3; xii. 20-xiii. 25, once belonged to Uffenbach, then to J. C. Wolff, who
bequeathed them to the Public Library (Johanneum) of Hamburg (_see_ Cod. H
of the Gospels). To the same manuscript pertain fragments of two leaves
used in binding Cod. Harleian. 5613 in the British Museum, and seen at
once by Griesbach, who first collated them (Symbol. Crit. vol. ii. p. 164,
&c.), to be portions of the Hamburg fragment(222). Each page in both
contains two columns, of forty-five lines in the Hamburg, of thirty-eight
in the London leaves. The latter comprise 1 Cor. xv. 52-2 Cor. i. 15; x.
13-xii. 5; reckoning both fragments, 196 verses in all. Tischendorf has
since found one leaf more. Henke in 1800 edited the Hamburg portion,
Tregelles collated it twice, and Tischendorf in 1855 published the text of
both in full in his "Anecdota Sacra et Profana," but corrected in the
second edition, 1861 (Praef. xvi), five mistakes in his printed text. The
letters are a little unusual in form, perhaps about the tenth century in
date; but though sometimes joined in the same word, can hardly be called
_semicursive_. Our facsimile (Plate xii, No. 34) is from the London
fragment: the graceful, though peculiar, shapes both of _alpha_ and _mu_
(_see_ p. 37, ter) closely resemble those in some writing of about the
same age, added to the venerable Leyden Octateuch, on a page published in
facsimile by Tischendorf (Monum. sacr. ined. vol. iii). Accents and
breathings are given pretty correctly and constantly: _iota_ ascript
occurs three times (2 Cor. i. 1; 4; Heb. xiii. 21)(223); only ten
_itacisms_ occur, and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (as it is called) is rare. The usual
stop is the single point in its three positions, with a change in power,
as in Cod. E of the Gospels. The interrogative (;) occurs once (Heb. iii.
17), and > is often repeated to fill up space, or, in a smaller size, to
mark quotations. After the name of each of the Epistles (2 Cor. and Heb.)
in their titles we read {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, which Tischendorf thus
explains; that whereas it was customary to prefix an argument to each
Epistle, these words, originally employed to introduce the argument, were
retained even when the argument was omitted. Henke's account of the
expression looks a little less forced, that this manuscript was set forth
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, that is, in vermilion, after the pattern of Imperial letters
patent.

N. (Od Hort.) Two leaves of the ninth century at St. Petersburg,
containing Gal. v. 14-vi. 2; Heb. v. 8-vi. 10.

O. (Nc Tisch.) FRAGMENTA MOSQUENSIA used as early as A.D. 975 in binding a
volume of Gregory Nazianzen now at Moscow (S. Synodi 61). Matthaei
describes them on Heb. x. 1: they contain only the twelve verses Heb. x.
1-3; 3-7; 32-34; 35-38. These very ancient leaves may possibly be as old
as the sixth century, for their letters resemble in shape those in Cod. H
which the later hand has so coarsely renewed; but they are more probably a
little later.

Oa. One unpublished double leaf brought by Tischendorf to St. Petersburg
from the East, of the sixth century, containing 2 Cor. i. 20-ii. 12.

Ob of the same date, at Moscow, contains Eph. iv. 1-18.

P. COD. PORPHYRIANUS.

Q. Tischendorf also discovered in 1862 at St. Petersburg five or six
leaves of St. Paul, written on papyrus of the fifth century. From the
extreme brittleness of the leaves only portions can be read. He cites them
at 1 Cor. vi. 13, 14; vii. 3, 13, 14. These also Porphyry brought from the
East. It contains 1 Cor. i. 17-20; vi. 13-15; 16-18; vii. 3, 4, 10, 11,
12-14, with defects. This is the only papyrus manuscript of the New
Testament written with uncials.

R. Cod. Cryptoferratensis Z. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}. 1. is a palimpsest fragment of the end of
the seventh or the eighth century, cited by Caspar Rene Gregory as first
used by Tischendorf. It is one leaf, containing 2 Cor. xi. 9-19. Edited by
Cozza, and published amongst other old fragments at Rome in 1867 with
facsimile (Greg., p. 435).

S. From Laura of Athos.

T. Paris, Louvre, Egyptian Museum, 7332 [iv-vi], 5-3/4 x 4, two small
fragments, 1 Tim. vi. 3; iii. 15, 16. _See_ Gregory, p. 441, who, however,
unconsciously classes it as an Evan.

III. Manuscripts of the Apocalypse.


{~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}. COD. SINAITICUS.

A. COD. ALEXANDRINUS.

B. COD. VATICANUS 2066 (formerly 105 in the Library of the Basilian monks
in the city) was judiciously substituted by Wetstein for the modern
portion of the great Vatican MS., collated by Mico, and published in 1796
by Ford in his "Appendix" to Codex Alexandrinus, as also in 1868 by
Vercellone and Cozza(224). It is an uncial copy of about the end of the
eighth century, and the volume also contains in the same hand Homilies of
Basil the Great and of Gregory of Nyssa, &c. It was first known from a
notice (by Vitali) and facsimile in Bianchini's Evangeliarium Quadruplex
(1749), part i. vol. ii. p. 524 (facs. p. 505, tab. iv): Wetstein was
promised a collation of it by Cardinal Quirini, who seems to have met with
unexpected hindrances, as the papers only arrived after the text of the
New Testament was printed, and then proved very loose and defective. When
Tischendorf was at Rome in 1843, though forbidden to collate it afresh (in
consequence, as we now know, of its having been already printed in Mai's
then unpublished volumes of the Codex Vaticanus), he was permitted to make
a facsimile of a few verses, and while thus employed he so far contrived
to elude the watchful custodian, as to compare the whole manuscript with a
modern Greek Testament. The result was given in his Monumenta sacra
inedita (1846), pp. 407-432, with a good facsimile; but (as was natural
under the unpromising circumstances--"_arrepta potius quam lecta_" is his
own confession) Tregelles in 1845 was able to observe several points which
he had overlooked, and more have come to light since Mai's edition has
appeared. In 1866, however, Tischendorf was allowed to transcribe this
document at leisure, and re-published it in full in his Appendix N. T.
Vaticani, 1869, pp. 1-20.

This Codex is now known to contain the whole of the Apocalypse, a fact
which the poor collation that Wetstein managed to procure had rendered
doubtful. It is rather an octavo than a folio or quarto; the uncials being
of a peculiar kind, simple and unornamented, leaning a little to the right
(_see_ p. 41, note): they hold a sort of middle place between square and
oblong characters. The shape of _beta_ is peculiar, the two loops to the
right nowhere touching each other, and _psi_ has degenerated into the form
of a cross (_see_ Plate iii, No. 7): _delta_, _theta_, _xi_ are also of
the latest uncial fashion. The breathings and accents are _prima manu_,
and pretty correct; the rule of the grammarians respecting the change of
power of the single point in punctuation according to its change of
position is now regularly observed. The scarcity of old copies of the
Apocalypse renders this uncial of some importance, and it often confirms
the readings of the older codices {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}AC, though on the whole it resembles
them considerably less than does Cod. P, and agrees in preference with the
later or more ordinary cursives.

C. CODEX EPHRAEMI.

P. CODEX PORPHYRIANUS.


    _Note._ Of the three large uncials which contain the Apocalypse,
    {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}A are complete, but C has lost 171 verses out of 405. In the 286
    places wherein the three are available, and Lachmann, Tregelles,
    and Tischendorf, one or all, depart from the Received text, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}AC
    agree fifty-two times, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}A seventeen, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}C twenty-six, AC eighty-two,
    and this last combination supplies the best readings: {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} stands
    alone twenty-three times, A fifty-nine, C twenty-seven. When C has
    failed us {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}A agree fifty-two times and differ eighty-eight.





CHAPTER VII. CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS. PART I.


The later manuscripts of the Greek Testament, written in cursive
characters from the tenth down to the fifteenth century or later, are too
numerous to be minutely described in an elementary work like the present.

The other Abbreviations will be evident upon perusing this work. Where
_Chart._ is not printed, the MS. is written on vellum. The Latin numeral
within square brackets denotes the date of the book, whether fixed by a
subscription in the book itself, or approximated by other means, e.g.
[xiii] indicates a book of the thirteenth century. The Arabic numerals
within ordinary brackets denote the number of lines on a page. Thus 297
(38) = 297 leaves and thirty-eight lines in a page. The names within
parentheses indicate the _collators_ or _inspectors_ of each manuscript,
and if it has been satisfactorily examined, an asterisk is prefixed to the
number by which it is known. If the copy contain other portions of the New
Testament, its notation in those portions is always given. Measurements
where given are in inches(226).




(1) Manuscripts of the Gospels.


*1. (Act. 1, Paul. 1.) Basiliensis A. N. iv. 2 at Basle [x, Burgon xii or
xiii], 7-3/8 x 4-1/2, ff. 297 (38); _prol._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _syn._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}.
in Acts and Epp. by later hand. Hebrews last in Paul. Gospels bound up
last of all. Among the illuminations were what have been said to be
pictures of the Emperor Leo the Wise [886-911] and his son Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, but all the beautiful miniatures were stolen prior to
1860-2, except one before St. John's Gospel. Its later history is the same
as that of Cod. E of the Gospels: it was known to Erasmus; it was borrowed
by Reuchlin, a few extracts given by Bengel (Bas. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}), collated by
Wetstein, and recently in the Gospels by C. L. Roth and Tregelles, who
have compared their results. Our facsimile (No. 23) gives an excellent
notion of the elegant and minute style of writing, which is fully
furnished with breathings, accents, and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} ascript. The initial letters are
gilt, and on the first page of each Gospel the full point is a large gilt
ball. In the Gospels the text adheres frequently to the uncials Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}B,
BL and such cursives as 118, 131, and especially 209 (Insp. by Burgon,
Hoskier, Greg.).

2. Basil. A. N. iv. 1 [xv or earlier], 7-3/4 x 6, ff. 248 (20), _subscr._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (not John), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, is the inferior manuscript
chiefly used by Erasmus for his first edition of the N. T. (1516), with
press corrections by his hand, and barbarously scored with red chalk to
suit his pages. The monks at Basle had bought it for two Rhenish florins
(Bengel, Wetstein, Burgon, Hoskier, Greg.).

3. (Act. 3, Paul. 3.) Cod. Corsendonck. [xii], 4to, 9-3/4 x 7, ff. 451 (24),
Carp., _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _prol._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._,
_syn._, once belonging to a convent at Corsendonck near Turnhout, now in
the Imperial Library at Vienna (Forlos. 15, Kollar. 5). It was lent to
Erasmus for his second edition in 1519, as he testifies on the first leaf
(Alter). It had been collated before Alter by J. Walker for Bentley, when
in "the Dominican Library, Brussels." This collation is unpublished (Trin.
Coll. B. xvii. 34): Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, p. xxix (Greg.).

4. Cod. Regius 84 [xii], 7-1/4 x 5-3/4, ff. 212 (27), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., in the Royal
Library at Paris (designated RI by Tischendorf), was rightly recognized by
Le Long as Robert Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} (see Chap. V). Mill notices its affinity to
the Latin versions and the Complutensian edition (N. T. Prol.  1161);
_mut._ in Matt. ii. 9-20; John i. 49-iii. 11; forty-nine verses. It is
clumsily written and contains _syn._ from some Fathers (Scholz, Greg.).

5. (Act. 5, Paul. 5.) Paris, National (Library), Greek 106 [xii or later],
is Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}: 8-1/4 x 6-1/8, ff. 348 (28), _prob._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._ Carefully written and full of flourishes (Wetstein,
Scholz, Greg.).

6. (Act. 6, Paul. 6.) Par. Nat. Gr. 112 [xi or later], is Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK OXIA~}; in
text it much resembles Codd. 4, 5, and 75. 12mo, 5-1/2 x 4-1/8, ff. 235,
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _syn._ with St. Chrysostom's
Liturgy, _men._ (Wetstein, Griesbach, Scholz). This exquisite manuscript
is written in characters so small, that some pages require a glass to read
them. Scholz collated Matt., Mark i-iv, John vii, viii (Greg.).

7. Par. Nat. Gr. 71 [xi], is Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}. 8 x 6-1/4, ff. 186 (29), _prol._,
_syn._, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. with metrical paraphrase,
_Am._, _Eus._, _men._, very full _lect._ In style not unlike Cod. 4, but
neater (Wetst., Scholz, Abbe Martin, Greg.).

8. Par. Nat. Gr. 49 [xi], 11-1/4 x 8-1/2, ff. 199 (22), two columns, proved by
Mr. Vansittart to be Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}(227): beautifully written in two columns
on the page. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _lect._,
_men._, _Am._, _Eus._, _syn._ (Wetst., Scholz, Greg.).

9. Par. Nat. Gr. 83 [A.D. 1167, when "Manuel Porphyrogenitus was ruler of
Constantinople, Amauri of Jerusalem, William II of Sicily": this note
(derived from Wetstein) is now nearly obliterate], 9-1/4 x 6-3/4, ff. 298
(20), is probably Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _syn._, _mut._, _men._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. (first leaf of St. John).
It once belonged to Peter Stella. The style is rather barbarous, and
ornamentation peculiar (Kuster's Paris 3, Scholz, Greg.).

10. Par. Nat. Gr. 91 [xiii or later], 7-1/2 x 5-7/8, ff. 275 (24), given in
1439 to a library of Canons Regular at Verona by Dorotheus Archbishop of
Mitylene, when he came to the Council of Florence. Scholz tells us that it
was "antea Joannis Huraultii Boistallerii." Griesbach mistook this copy
for Reg. 95, olim  2865/3, which is Kuster's Paris 1 and Wetstein's Cod.
10, being Cod. 285 of Scholz and our own list (Burgon, _Guardian_, Jan.
15, 1873). _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._,
_lect._, _syn._, _men._ (Griesbach, Scholz, Greg.).

11. Par. Nat. Gr. 121-2 [xii or earlier], in two small volumes, 6-3/8 x
3-5/8, neatly written, ff. 230 and 274 (16), _Eus. t.,_ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _Eus._ It also once belonged to Teller (Kuster's Paris 4, Scholz,
Greg.).

12. Par. Nat. Gr. 230 [xi], 10-3/8 x 8-1/8, 294 (21), _prol._, _pict._,
_Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., with a commentary, that on St. Mark
being Victor's of Antioch (Greg.).

13. Par. Nat. Gr. 50 [xii], 9-1/4 x 7-1/2, ff. 170 (29), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., is Kuster's Paris
6, who says that it supplied him with more various readings than all the
rest of his Paris manuscripts put together. This, like Codd. 10, 11, once
belonged to Teller: it is not correctly written. _Syn._, _mut._ in Matt.
i. 1-ii. 20; xxvi. 33-53; xxvii. 26-xxviii. 10; Mark i. 20-45; John xxi.
3-25; 163 verses (Kuster, Wetstein, Griesbach, Begtrup in 1797). This
manuscript was collated in 1868 by Professor W. H. Ferrar, Fellow of
Trinity College, Dublin [d. 1871], who regarded Codd. 13, 69, 124, 346 as
transcripts of one archetype, which he proposed to restore by comparing
the four copies together. His design was carried out by Professor T. K.
Abbott, Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College. For facsimiles of them all,
&c., _see_ "Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels," &c.
Dublin, 1877 (Greg.).

14. Par. Nat. Gr. 70 [xii or xiii, Greg. x], 6-7/8 x 4-5/8, ff. 392 (17),
once Cardinal Mazarin's; was Kuster's Paris 7. A facsimile of this
beautiful copy, with round conjoined minuscule letters, regular breathings

gorgeous and "right royal" copy was never quite finished, but is unique in
respect of being written in four colours, vermilion, lake, blue, and

17. Par. Nat. Gr. 55 [xvi], 11-3/4 x 8-1/4, ff. 353 (25), 2 cols., has the
Latin Vulgate version: it was neatly written, not by George Hermonymus the
Spartan (but see Greg.), as Wetstein guesses, but by a Western
professional scribe, Burgon. It once belonged to Cardinal Bourbon. _Syn._,
_pict._ very elegant, _lect._ (Wetstein, Griesbach, Scholz).

belonged to the Medici, _pict._, with Victor's commentary on St. Mark, a
catena to St. John, and scholia to the other Gospels. In marvellous
condition, with much gold ornamentation (Scholz, Greg.).

20. Par. Nat. Gr. 188, formerly 1883 [xii], 13-1/8 x 9-1/8, a splendid
folio, ff. 274, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _subscr._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.--all by second hand (Greg.), brought from the East in 1669. It is
beautifully written, and contains catenae, Victor's commentary on St.
Mark, and other treatises enumerated by Scholz, who collated most of it.
At the end of SS. Mark, Luke, and John "dicitur etiam hoc evangelium ex
accuratis codicibus esse exscriptum, nec non collatum" (Scholz). A second
(or perhaps the original) hand has been busy here to assimilate the text
to that of Codd. 215, 300, or to some common model. In Cod. 215 the
foregoing subscription is appended to all the Four Gospels, and the other
contents correspond exactly (Burgon, Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark, pp.
119, 279). See on Evann. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}, 428. Collated by W. F. Rose.

22. Par. Nat. Gr. 72, once Colbert. 2467 [xi], 10-1/4 x 7-1/2, ff. 232 (22),
contains remarkable readings. John xiv. 22-xvi. 27. Fully collated by the
Rev. W. F. Rose (_see_ Evan. 563). It begins Matt. ii. 2, six leaves
containing Matt. v. 25-viii. 4 being misplaced before it. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,

Matt. iv. 20-v. 25; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. p. m. A beautiful copy, singularly free from
itacisms and errors from homoeoteleuton, and very carefully accentuated,
with slight illuminated headings to the Gospels, which I recently had the
pleasure of inspecting (Wetstein, Scholz, Scriv., Greg.).

23. Par. Nat. Gr. 77, Colbert. 3947 [xi], 9 x 7-1/4, 4to, ff. 230, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.

25. Par. Nat. Gr. 191, Colbert. 2259 [x, Greg. xi], 11-3/4 x 9-1/8, ff. 292,
with Victor's commentary on St. Mark, and scholia, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_lect._ (partial). "Grandly written," but very imperfect, wanting about
715 verses, viz. Matt. xxiii. 1-xxv. 42; Mark i. 1-vii. 36; Luke viii.
31-41; ix. 44-54; x. 39-xi. 4; John xiii. 19?-xxi. 25 (Griesbach, Scholz,
Greg., Martin).

26. Par. Nat. Gr. 78, Colbert. 4078 [xi], 9-1/2 x 7-1/4, ff. 179 (27), neatly
and correctly written by Paul a priest. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._ (Wetstein, Scholz, Greg.).

27. Par. Nat. Gr. 115, Colbert. 6043 [xi, Greg. x], 6-1/4 x 4-3/4, ff. 460
(19), is Mill's Colb. 1. That critic procured Larroque's collation of
Codd. 27-33 (a very imperfect one) for his edition of the New Testament.
From John xviii. 3 the text is supplied, cotton _chart_. [xiv]. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,

28. Par. Nat. Gr. 379, Colbert. 4705 [xi], 9-1/8 x 7-1/8, ff. 292 (19), is
Mill's Colb. 2, most carelessly written by an ignorant scribe; it often
resembles Cod. D, but has many unique readings and interpolations, with
"many relics of a very ancient text hereabouts" (Hort on Mark vi. 43,
Introd. p. 242). {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ (inaccurate), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._,

xii. 40-xiii. 1; xv. 24-xvi. 12; xviii. 16-28; xx. 20-xxi. 5; 18-25
(Scholz, Greg.).

29. Par. Nat. Gr. 89, Colbert. 6066 [xii, Greg. x], 7-1/8 x 5-1/2, ff. 169,
is Mill's Colb. 3, correctly written by a Latin scribe, with very many
peculiar corrections by a later hand. Lost leaves in the three later
Gospels are supplied [xv]. Scholia, _Eus. t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, _syn._, _men._ Mut. Matt. i-xv. Mill compares
its text with that of Cod. 71 (Scholz, Greg.).

30. Par. Nat. Gr. 100, Colbert. 4444 [xvi, Greg. xv], 8-7/8 x 5-7/8,
_chart._, ff. 313 (18), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (Gr. and Lat.), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., is Mill's Colb. 4,
containing all the Gospels, by the writer of Cod. 70. In text it much
resembles Cod. 17 (Scholz, Greg.).

31. Par. Nat. Gr. 94, Colbert. 6083 [xiii], 7-1/8 x 5-1/2, ff. 188, _pict._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., is also Mill's Colb. 4, but contains all the
Gospels with prayers. This copy has many erasures (Scholz, Greg.).

32. Par. Nat. Gr. 116, Colbert. 6511 [xii], 5-3/4 x 4-1/4, ff. 244 (21),
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ (_lect._ and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. later), is
Mill's Colb. 5. It begins Matt. x. 22. _Mut._ Matt. xxiv. 15-30; Luke
xxii. 35-John iv. 20 (Scholz). Mill misrepresented the contents of Codd.
30-32, through supposing that they contained no more than the small
portions which were collated for his use.

*33. (Act. 13, Paul 17.) Par. Nat. Gr. 14, Colbert. 2844 [xi, Greg. ix or
x], fol., 14-3/4 x 9-3/4, ff. 143 (52), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., is Mill's Colb. 8,
containing some of the Prophets and all the New Testament, except Mark ix.
31-xi. 11; xiii. 11-xiv. 60; Luke xxi. 38-xxiii. 26; and the Apocalypse.
In text it resembles Codd. BDL more than any other cursive manuscript.
After Larroque, Wetstein, Griesbach, Begtrup, and Scholz, it was most
laboriously collated by Tregelles in 1850. There are fifty-two long lines
in each page, in a fine round hand, the accents being sometimes neglected,
and _eta_ unusually like our English letter h. The ends of the leaves are
much damaged, and greatly misplaced by the binder; so that the Gospels now
stand last, though on comparing the style of handwriting (which undergoes
a _gradual_ change throughout the volume) at their beginning and end with
that in the Prophets which stand first, and that in the Epistles which
should follow them, it is plain that they originally occupied their usual
place. The ink too, by reason of the damp, has often left its proper page
blank, so that the writing can only be read _set off_ on the opposite
page, especially in the Acts. Hence it is no wonder that Tregelles should
say that of all the manuscripts he has collated "none has ever been so
wearisome to the eyes, and exhaustive of every faculty of attention."
(Account of the Printed Text, p. 162.)

The next eight copies, like Cod. H of St. Paul, belonged to that noble
collection made by the Chancellor Seguier, and on his death in 1672
bequeathed to Coislin, Bishop of Metz. Montfaucon has described them in
his "Bibliotheca Coisliniana," fol. 1715, and all were slightly collated
by Wetstein and Scholz.

40. Par. Nat. Coislin. 22, formerly 375 [xi], 11-3/4 x 8-1/2, ff. 312,
_Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, once
belonged to the monastery of St. Nicholas {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, with a commentary
(Victor's on St. Mark) and _Eus. t._ Ends at John xx. 25.

41. Par. Nat. Coislin. 24, formerly 241 [xi], 4to, 12 x 9-1/2, ff. 224 (32),

Matthew and Mark with a commentary (Victor's on St. Mark).

42. Cod. Medicaeus exhibits many readings of the same class as Codd. 1,
13, 33, but its authority has the less weight, since it has disappeared
under circumstances somewhat suspicious. Edward Bernard communicated to
Mill these readings, which he had found in the hand of Peter Pithaeus, a
former owner, in the margin of Stephen's N. T. of 1550: they professed to
be extracted from an "exemplar Regium Medicaeum" (which may be supposed to
mean that portion of the King's Library which Catherine de' Medici brought
to France: above, p. 117, note 3), and were inserted under the title of
_Med._ in Mill's great work, though he remarked their resemblance to the
text of Cod. K (N. T., Proleg.  1462). The braggart Denis Amelotte
[1606-78] professes to have used the manuscript about the middle of the
seventeenth century, and states that it was in a college at Troyes; but
Scholz could find it neither in that city nor elsewhere.

43. (Act. 54, Paul. 130.) Par. Biblioth. Armament. 8409, 8410, formerly
Gr. 4 [xi], in two volumes; the first containing the Gospels with _Eus.
t._, the second the Acts and Epistles, 8-1/8 x 6-3/8, ff. 199 (23) and 190
(25), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._,
_subscr._ (_lect._ and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. later, _see_ Greg.). Perhaps written at
Ephesus; given by P. de Berzi in 1661 to the Oratory of San Maglorian
(Amelotte, Simon, Scholz).

44. Lond. British Museum, Add. 4949 [xi], 12 x 9-1/4, ff. 259 (21), _syn._,

later), _subscr._ and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. in John, brought from Mount Athos by Caesar de
Missy [1703-75], George III's French chaplain, who spent his life in
collecting materials for an edition of the N. T. His collation, most
imperfectly given by Wetstein, is still preserved with the manuscript
(Bloomfield, 1860).

45. Oxford Bodleian Barocc. 31 [xii or xiii], 7-1/4 x 5-1/4, ff. 399 (20), is
Mill's Bodl. 1, a very neat copy, with _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.

Bodl. 6 and Bodl. 1 of Walton's Polyglott (Polyglott, Mill).

49. Oxf. Bodl. Roe 1, formerly 247 [xi], 5-3/4 x 4-1/8, ff. 223 (26), ll.
rubr., is also Mill's Roe 1, brought by Sir T. Roe from Turkey about 1628;
it has _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, some _Eus._, _lect._,

50. Oxf. Bodl. Laud. Gr. 33, formerly D. 122 [xi], 11 x 8-3/4, ff. 241,
_prol._ (Mark), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, some _Eus._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., is Mill's Laud. 1 (_see_ p. 170), surrounded by a catena (Victor's
or Cyril's of Alexandria in St. Mark), and attended with other matter.
_Mut._ Matt. i. 1-ix. 35; xii. 3-23; xvii. 12-24; xxv. 20-32; John v.
29-end; and Mark xiv. 40-xvi. 20 is by a later hand. It contains many
unusual readings (Mill, Griesbach).

51. (Act. 32, Paul. 38.) Oxf. Bodl. Laud. Gr. 31, formerly C. 63 [xiii],
11-3/4 x 8-3/4, ff. 325 (28), 2 cols., Mill's Laud. 2, whose resemblance to
the Complutensian text is pointed out by him (N. T., Proleg.  1437),
though, judging from his own collation of Cod. 51, his statement "per
omnia pene respondet" is rather too strong. _Prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,

_present_ order of the contents (_see_ p. 72) is Act., Paul., Cath.,
Evangelia (Mill, Griesbach): but it ought to be collated afresh. This is
Bentley's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~} in the unpublished margin of B. xvii. 5 at Trin. Coll.,
Cambridge. He calls it a quarto, 400 years old. _Mut._ 2 Pet. iii. 2-17;
Matt. xviii. 12-35; Mark ii. 8-iii. 4 (_see_ Codd. 54, 60, 113, 440, 507,
508, Acts 23, Apoc. 28, Evst. 5).

52. Oxf. Bodl. Laud. Gr. 3, formerly C. 28 [dated A.D. 1286], 6-1/2 x 5, ff.
158 (27), elegant, written by {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, is Mill's Laud. 5, with
_Pict._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._,
_subscr._, _mut._ in initio (Mill, Griesbach).

53. Oxf. Bodl. Seld. supr. 28, formerly 3416 [xiv], 6 x 4-3/4, ff. 140, is
Mill's Seld. 1, who pronounces it much like Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} (Cod. 4), having
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., beautifully written
(Mill, Griesbach).

54. Oxf. Bodl. Seld. supr. 29 (Coxe 54), formerly 3417, Mill's Seld.
2(229) [dated A.D. 1338], 4to, 6-3/8 x 4-3/4, ff. 230 (sic), _Syn._, _men._,
_Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._, _vers._ (Mill). This is
Bentley's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} (_see_ Cod. 51). _See under_ 58.

55. Oxf. Bodl. Seld. supr. 6 (Coxe 5), formerly 3394, Mill's Seld. 3
[xiii], 4to, 7-1/2 x 5-1/2, ff. 349 (21), containing also Judges vi. 1-24
(Grabe, Prol. V. T., tom. i. cap. iii.  6), has _prol._ in Matt., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._, _syn._, _men._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.
(Mill).

56. Oxf. Lincoln Coll. II (Gr.) 18 [xv or xvi], 4to, 8-1/8 x 5-5/8, ff.
232 (24), _chart._, was presented about 1502, by Edmund Audley, Bishop of
Salisbury: _prol._ (Mark, Luke), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., some {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}.,
_vers._, titles to Gospels, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. (John). Walton gives some
various readings, but confounds it with Act. 33, Paul. 39, speaking of
them as if one "vetustissimum exemplar." It has been inspected by Dobbin,
Scrivener, and Mill, but so loosely that the late Rev. R. C. Pascoe,
Fellow of Exeter College, detected thirty-four omissions for thirty-one
citations (one of them being an error) in four chapters.

57. (Act. 85, Paul. 41.) Oxf. Magdalen Coll., Greek 9 [xii, opening], 9 x
7-1/2, ff. 291 (25), _aur._ beautiful, in a small and beautiful hand, with
abbreviations. _Mut._ Mark i. 1-11, and at end. Psalms and Hymns follow
the Epistles. It has {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. (_lect._ in red, _vers._
later). Collated twice by Dr. Hammond, the great commentator, whose papers
seem to have been used for Walton's Polyglott (Magd. 1): also examined by
Dobbin (Mill).

58. Oxf. New Coll. 68 [xv], 7-3/4 x 5-1/4, ff. 342 (20), is Walton and Mill's
N. 1. This, like Codd. 56-7, has been accurately examined by Dr. Dobbin,
for the purpose of his "Collation of the Codex Montfortianus" (London,
1854), with whose readings Codd. 56, 58 have been compared in 1922 places.
He has undoubtedly proved the close connexion subsisting between the three
manuscripts (which had been observed by Mill, N. T. Proleg.  1388),
though he may not have quite demonstrated that they must be direct
transcripts from each other. _Prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (partially), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._ (partial), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. (partial), _syn._, _subscr._ (Mark), _vers._, with
scholia. The writing is very careless, and those are in error who follow
Walton in stating that it contains the Acts and Epistles (Walton's
Polyglott, Mill, Dobbin). Mr. C. Forster rightly asks for photographs and
a thorough re-collation of Codd. 56, 58, 61, "to throw light upon their
direct relationship, or non-relationship to each other" ("A New Plea for
the Three Heavenly Witnesses," 1867, p. 139). Dr. C. R. Gregory has
expressed the opinion that Codd. 47, 56, 58 are in the same hand, and one
of them copied from Cod. 54.

*59. Cambridge, Gonville and Caius Coll. 403 [xii], 8 x 6, ff. 238 (23),
an important copy, "textu notabili," as Tischendorf states (much like D,
61, 71), but carelessly written, and exhibiting no less than eighty-one
omissions by {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (_see_ p. 9). It was very poorly examined for
Walton's Polyglott, better though defectively by Mill, seen by Wetstein in
1716, minutely collated by Scrivener in 1860. It once belonged to the
House of Friars Minor at Oxford, from whence Richard Brynkley borrowed it
and took it to the Grey Friars at Cambridge, whence it went to Thomas
Hatcher, who gave it to the College in 1867 (J. Rendel Harris, The origin
of the Leicester Codex, 1887). It has {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (but not _Eus._),
and exhibits many and rare _compendia scribendi_.

60. (Apoc. 10.) Camb. University Library, Dd. ix. 69 [A.D. 1297], 8 x 6,
ff. 324 = 293 + 1 + 30 (24), but the Apocalypse is later, and has a few
scholia from Arethas about it. This copy is Mill's Moore 1(230) and is
still badly known. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_lect._ (later), _Am._ without _Eus._, _subscr._, and it is an elegant
copy (Mill). The Gospels appear to have been written in the East, the
Apocalypse in the West of Europe. This is Bentley's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} (_see_ Cod. 51).

*61. (Act. 34, Paul. 40, Apoc. 92.) Codex Montfortianus at Trinity
College, Dublin, G. 97 [xv or xvi], 6-1/4 x 4-3/4, ff. 445 (21), _chart._, so
celebrated in the controversy respecting 1 John v. 7. Its last collator,
Dr. Orlando Dobbin (_see_ on Cod. 58), has discussed in his Introduction
every point of interest connected with it. It contains the whole New
Testament, apparently the work of three or four successive scribes, paper
leaves, only one of them--that on which 1 John v. 7 stands--being
glazed(231), as if to protect it from harm. This manuscript was first
heard of between the publication of Erasmus' second (1519) and third
(1522) editions of his N. T., and after he had publicly declared, in
answer to objectors, that if any _Greek_ manuscript could be found
containing the passage, he would insert it in his revision of the text; a
promise which he fulfilled in 1522. Erasmus describes his authority as
"Codex Britannicus," "apud Anglos repertus," and there is the fullest
reason to believe that the Cod. Montfortianus is the copy referred to
(_see_ Vol. II. Chap. XI). Its earliest known owner was Froy(232), a
Franciscan friar, then Thomas Clement [fl. 1569], then William Chark [fl.
1582], then Thomas Montfort, D.D. of Cambridge, from whom it derives its
name, then Archbishop Ussher, who caused the collation to be made which
appears in Walton's Polyglott (Matt. i. 1-Acts xxii. 29; Rom. i), and
presented the manuscript to Trinity College. Dr. Barrett appended to his
edition of Cod. Z a full collation of the parts left untouched by his
predecessors; but since the work of Ussher's friends was known to be very
defective, Dobbin has re-collated the whole of that portion which Barrett
left unexamined, comparing the readings throughout with Codd. 56, 58 of
the Gospels, and Cod. 33 of the Acts. This copy has _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., besides which the division
by the Latin chapters in St. Mark is employed, a sure proof--if any were
needed--of the modern date of the manuscript. There are many corrections by
a more recent hand, erasures by the pen, &c. It has been supposed that the
Gospels were first written; then the Acts and Epistles (transcribed, in
Dobbin's judgement, from Cod. 33, Acts); the Apocalypse last; having been
added about 1580, as Tregelles and Dr. Dobbin think, from Cod. 69, when
they were both in Chark's possession. The text, however, of the Apocalypse
is not quite the same in the two codices, nor would it be easy, without
seeing them together, to verify Dobbin's conjecture, that the titles to
the sacred books, in pale red ink, were added by the same person in both
manuscripts. In the margin of this copy, as of Cod. 69, are inserted many
readings in Chark's handwriting, even the misprint of Erasmus, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} for
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, Apoc. ii. 13.

62. Walton's _Goog._, which was brought from the East, and once belonged
to Dr. Henry Googe, Fellow of Trinity College. The collations of Codd. D,
59, 61, 62 made for the London Polyglott were given in 1667 to Emmanuel
College, where they yet remain. _Goog._ was identified with the Cambridge
Kk. v. 35 by Bp. Marsh, who was a little careless in this kind of work.

622. Camb. Univ. Lib. Kk. v. 35 [xv], 9-1/4 x 5-3/4, ff. 403 (14), _chart._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. Lat.), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _subscr._, _vers._ Mr. Bradshaw has pointed out
that Kk. v. 35 is a mere transcript by George Hermonymus from Cod. 70 also
in his handwriting, and hastily copied from it, errors of the pen and all.
It has no _men._, _lect._, as _Goog._ had, but the ordinary {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} and
_Latin_ chapters. Again, _Goog._, as Walton says, "ex Oriente advectus
est," and must have been in England before 1657; whereas Bp. Moore got Kk.
v. 35 from France in 1706, with other books from the collection of J. B.
Hantin, the numismatist.

63. Cod. Ussher 1, Trin. Coll. Dublin, A. i. 8, formerly D. 20 [x], fol.,
with a commentary, 12-3/8 x 9-1/2, ff. 237 (18-24), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
_pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._ (_lect._, later.), _subscr._ Henry
Dodwell made a few extracts for Bishop Fell's N. T. of 1675; Richard
Bulkeley loosely collated it for Mill, Dr. Dobbin in 1855 examined St.
Matthew, and the Rev. John Twycross, of the Charter House, re-collated the
whole manuscript in 1858. The last leaf, containing John xxi. 25, is lost;
but (_see_ Scrivener, Cod. Sin., Introd., p. lix, note, and an admirable
paper by Dr. Gwynn in _Hermathena_, xix, 1893, p. 368) it originally
contained the verse and witnesses to it. Dr. C. R. Gregory has noticed in
Cod. 63 a mutilated double leaf of an Evangelistarium in two columns [ix
or x], containing part of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}.

64. Bute, formerly Ussher 2. This MS. belonged, like the preceding, to the
illustrious Primate of Ireland, but has been missing from Trin. Coll.
Library in Dublin ever since 1742, or, as Dr. C. R. Gregory thinks on the
authority of Dr. T. K. Abbott, 1702. It was collated, like Cod. 63, by
Dodwell for Fell, by Bulkeley for Mill. It once belonged to Dr. Thomas
Goad, and was very neatly, though incorrectly, written in octavo. As the
Emmanuel College copy of the Epistles (Act. 53, Paul. 30) never contained
the Gospels, for which it is perpetually cited in Walton's Polyglott as
_Em._, the strong resemblance subsisting between _Usser._ 2 and _Em._ led
Mill to suspect that they were in fact the same copy. The result of an
examination of Walton's with Mill's collations is that they are in
numberless instances cited together in support of readings, in company
with other manuscripts; often with a very few or even alone (e.g. Matt.
vi. 22; viii. 11; xii. 41; Mark ii. 2; iv. 1; ix. 10; 25; Luke iv. 32;
viii. 27; John i. 21; iv. 24; v. 7; 20; 36; vii. 10; xvi. 19; xxi. 1).
That _Usser._ 2 and _Em._ are sometimes alleged separately is easily
accounted for by the inveterate want of accuracy exhibited by all early
collators. But all doubt is at an end since Dean Burgon in 1880 found this
celebrated copy in the library of the Marquis of Bute, and has traced the
curious history of its rovings. From Dr. Goad (d. 1638) it came into the
keeping of Primate Ussher, by whose hand the modern chapters seem to have
been written in the margin. Then towards the end of the seventeenth
century (as his signature proves) it belonged to one John Jones: a later
hand puts in the date Saturday, May 25, 1728. It has also the book plate
of John Earl of Moira (d. 1793). Then we trace it to James Verschoyle,
afterwards Bishop of Killala from 1793 to 1834, thence to the Earls of
Huntingdon for two generations, when it was purchased at the Donnington
Park sale by Lord Bute. Without doubt this is the long lost Cod. 64, the
_Usser._ 2 and _Em._ of Mill: it was recognized at once by the reading in
John viii. 8. Dean Burgon describes it as [xii or xiii] now in two
volumes, bound in red morocco about 150 years since. It has 440 leaves,
4-3/5 inches by 3-2/5 in size. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,
_Am._ (gilt), _Eus._ (carmine), _lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}. At the end are
fourteen leaves of _syn._ Though beautifully written, it has no _pict._ or
elaborate headings. Previous collators had done their work very poorly, as
we have reason to know. Out of about sixty variations in Mark i-v, Mill
has recorded only twenty-six. Over each proper name of a _person_ stands a
little waved stroke: cf. Evan. 530. (Collated for Burgon.)

65. Lond. Brit. Mus. Harleian 5776 [xiii], 9 x 7, ff. 309 (22), is Mill's
Cov. 1, brought from the East in 1677 with four other manuscripts of the
Greek Testament by Dr. John Covell [1637-1722], once English Chaplain at
Constantinople, then Chaplain to Queen Mary at the Hague, afterwards
Master of Christ's College, Cambridge. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., _subscr._ (Mill). This book was
presented to Covell in 1674 by Daniel, Bishop of Proconnesus. The last
verse is supplied by a late hand, the concluding leaf being lost, as in
Cod. 63.

*66. Camb. Trin. Coll. O. viii. 3, Cod. Galei Londinensis [xii], 8-3/4 x 6,
_chart._, ff. 282 (21), _pict._, _syn._, _men._, _Carp._ ten blank pages,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., no {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _lect._, _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._ (later), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., once belonged to Th. Gale [1636-1702], High Master of St.
Paul's School, Dean of York (1697), with some scholia in the margin by a
recent hand, and other changes in the text by one much earlier. Known to
(Mill), but for a time lost sight of. Collated by Scrivener, 1862.
Inserted in the great printed Catalogue of Manuscripts, Oxford, 1697.

67. Oxf. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 76 [x or xi], 9 x 7, ff. 202 (20), 2 cols., is
Mill's Hunt. 2, brought from the East by Dr. Robert Huntington, Chaplain
at Aleppo, Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and afterwards Bishop of
Raphoe [d. 1701]. _Mut._ John vi. 64-xxi. 25. _Eus. t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _subscr._ On f. 3, the
Athanasian Creed is on _rect._ on gold ground (Mill).

68. Oxf. Lincoln Coll. (Evst. 199) II. Gr. 17 [xii], 8 x 5, ff. 29 (23),
_Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _orn._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. (gold), _Am._, _lect._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., besides _syn._, _men._, and verses at the end of each Gospel by
Theodulos Hieromonachus, is Mill's Wheel. 1, brought from Zante in 1676,
with two other copies, by George Wheeler, Canon of Durham. Between the
Gospels of SS. Luke and John are small fragments of two leaves of a
beautiful Evangelistarium [ix?], with red musical notes (Mill, Scr.).

*69. (Act. 31, Paul. 37, Apoc. 14.) Codex Leicestrensis [xiv Harris; end
of xv], 14-1/2 x 10-5/8, ff. 213 (38), like Codd. 206 and 233, and Brit.
Mus. Harl. 3161; rapidly written on 83 leaves of vellum and 130 of paper,
the vellum being outside the quinion at beginning and end, and three paper
leaves within (_see_ p. 24), apparently with a reed (_see_ p. 27), is now
in the library of the Town Council of Leicester. It contains the whole New
Testament, except Matt. i. 1-xviii. 15; Acts x. 45-xiv. 17; Jude 7-25;
Apoc. xviii. 7-xxii. 21, but with fragments down to xix. 10. The original
order was Paul., Acts, Cath. Epp., Apoc., Gospels last and missing when
the MS. came into Chark's hands. Written in the strange hand which our
facsimile exhibits (No. 40), _epsilon_ being recumbent and almost like
_alpha_, and with accents placed over the succeeding consonant instead of
the vowel(233). The words {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} at the top of the first
page, in the same beautiful hand that wrote many (too many) marginal
notes, prove that this codex once belonged to the William Chark, mentioned
under Cod. 61 (p. 201) who got it from Brynkley, who probably got it like
the Caius MS. (Evan. 59) from the Convent of Grey Friars at Cambridge. In
1641 (Wetstein states 1669) Thomas Hayne, M.A., of Trussington, in that
county, gave this MS. with his other books to the Leicester Library. Mill
was permitted to use it at Oxford, and collated it there in 1671. A
collation also made by John Jackson and William Tiffin was lent to
Wetstein through Caesar de Missy and Th. Gee, a Presbyterian minister of
But Close, Leicester. Tregelles re-collated it in 1852 for his edition of
the Greek Testament, and Scrivener very minutely in 1855; the latter
published his results, with a full description of the book itself, in the
Appendix to his "Codex Augiensis." No manuscript of its age has a text so
remarkable as this, less however in the Acts than in the Gospels. Though
none of the ordinary divisions into sections, and scarcely any liturgical
marks, occur throughout, there is evidently a close connexion between Cod.
69 and the Church Service-books, as well in the interpolations of proper
names, particles of time, or whole passages (e.g. Luke xxii. 43, 44 placed
after Matt. xxvi. 39) which are common to both, as especially in the
titles of the Gospels: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} (_sic_), &c., being
in the very language of the Lectionaries(234). Codd. 178, 443 have the
same peculiarity. Tables of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} stand before the three later Gospels,
with very unusual variations; for which, as well as for the foreign matter
inserted and other peculiarities of Cod. 69, consult Scrivener's Cod.
Augiensis (Introd. pp. xl-xlvii). See also Mr. J. Rendel Harris, Origin of
the Leicester Codex, 1887.

70. Camb. Univ. Lib. Ll. ii. 13 [xv], 11-1/4 x 7-1/4 ff. 186 (23), _orn._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. in margin, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. Lat., _vers._, was written, like Codd. 30, 62, 287,
by G. Hermonymus the Spartan (who settled at Paris, 1472, and became the
Greek teacher of Budaeus and Reuchlin), for William Bodet; there are
marginal corrections by Budaeus, from whose letter to Bp. Tonstall we may
fix the date about A.D. 1491-4. It once belonged to Bunckle of London,
then to Bp. Moore. Like Cod. 62 it has the Latin chapters (Mill).

*71. Lambeth 528 [A.D. 1100], 6-1/2 x 4-3/4, ff. 265 (26), is Mill's _Eph._
and Scrivener's g. This elegant copy, which once belonged to an Archbishop
of Ephesus, was brought to England in 1675 by Philip Traheron, English
Chaplain at Smyrna. Traheron made a careful collation of his manuscript,
of which both the rough copy (B. M., Burney 24) and a fair one (Lambeth
528 b) survive. This last Scrivener in 1845 compared with the original,
and revised, especially in regard to later corrections, of which there are
many. Mill used Traheron's collation very carelessly. _Carp._, _Eus. t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ [xv], {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ This copy presents a
text full of interest, and much superior to that of the mass of
manuscripts of its age. _See_ Cod. 29.

72. Brit. Mus. Harleian. 5647 [xi], large 4to, 10 x 8, ff. 268 (22, 24),
an elegant copy, with a catena on St. Matthew, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _lect._, _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. (Mark), various readings
in the ample margin. Lent by T. Johnson to (Wetstein).

73. Christ Church, Oxford, Wake 26 [xi], 4to, 9-7/8 x 8-1/8, ff. 291, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, _Eus. t._, _vers._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._, _Eus._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _pict._, few _lect._
It is marked "Ex dono Mauri Cordati Principis Hungaro-Walachiae, Ao 1724."
This and Cod. 74 were once Archbishop Wake's, and were collated for
Wetstein by (Jo. Walker, _Wake MS._ 35)(235).

74. Christ Church, Oxford, Wake 20 [xiii], 8 x 6, ff. 204, written by
Theodore (_see_ p. 42, note 3). _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-14; v. 29-vi. 1;
thirty-two verses. It came in 1727 from the Monastery of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}, on
Mount Athos. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _syn._, _men._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _subscr._, _vers._

75. Cod. Genevensis 19 [xi], 9 x 6-1/2, ff. 500 (19), _Carp._, _Eus. t,_
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _Am._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Eus._, _lect._, _pict._, _men._ In text
it much resembles that of Cod. 6. Seen in 1714 by Wetstein, examined by
Scholz (collated Matt. i-vi, John vii, viii), collated (Matt. i-xviii,
Mark i-v) by Cellerier, a Professor at Geneva, whose collation (Matt.
i-xviii) is corrected and supplemented with Matt. xix-end by H. C.
Hoskier, though his visit to the MS. was unfortunately short. The first
diorthota made corrections and additions as regards breathings and stops.
Other corrections made not much later (Hoskier, Collation of 604, App. G).

76. (Act. 43, Paul. 49.) Cod. Caesar-Vindobonensis, Nessel. 300, Lambec.
28 [xi-xiii], 7-1/2 x 5-3/8, ff. 358 (27), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _pict._ This copy (the only one known to
read {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} with the Complutensian and other editions in Luke ii. 22) is
erroneously called an uncial by Mill (Gerhard a Mastricht 1690; Ashe 1691;
F. K. Alter 1786) (Greg.).

77. Caesar-Vindobon. Nessel. 114, Lambec. 29 [xi], 9-1/4 x 8, ff. 300 (21),
very neat; with a commentary (Victor's on St. Mark), _Carp._, _Eus. t._,
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._ (_lect._ and _syn._ by a
later hand). It once belonged to Matthias Corvinus, the great king of
Hungary (1458-90). Collated in "Tentamen descriptionis codicum," &c. 1773
by (Treschow, and also by Alter) (Greg.).

78. Cod. Nicolae Jancovich de Vadass, now in Hungary [xii], 9-1/8 x 5-3/4,

It was once in the library of king Matthias Corvinus: on the sack of Buda
by the Turks in 1527, his noble collection of 50,000 volumes was
scattered, and about 1686 this book fell into the hands of S. B., then of
J. G., Carpzov of Leipsic, at whose sale it was purchased and brought back
to its former country. A previous possessor, in the seventeenth century,
was {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}.

{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (also Lat. cent, xv), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. This MS. belonged to J. G. Graevius, and
was collated by Bynaeus in 1691: then it passed into the hands of J. Van
der Hagen, who showed it to Wetstein in 1739: afterwards it was bought by
Ambrose Didot at a sale, and sold to Mons. Lesoeuf, where Dr. C. R.
Gregory saw it. (_See_ Proleg. to Tisch. ed. viii. p. 485.)

81. Oxf. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 323, Auct. T. Infr. i. 5 [xiii], 7 x 5, ff. 182.
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., some _Am._ Bought in 1883 from Mr. William Ward who brought
it from Ephesus. Contains Matt. xix. 15-xxi. 19; 31-41; xxii. 7-xxviii.
20; Mark i. 9-iii. 18; 35-xv. 15; 32-xvi. 14; Luke i. 18-ii. 19; iii.
7-iv. 40; v. 8-xxii. 5; 36-xxiii. 10; John viii. 4-xxi. 18. This place has
been hitherto occupied by Greek MSS. cited in a Correctorium Bibliorum
Latinorum of the thirteenth century(236). Dr. Hort appropriates this
numeral to Muralt's 2pe. (Evan. 473.)

82. Oxf. Bodl. MS. Bibl. Gr. e. I. Some fragments: (1) John iii. 23; (2)
26, 27; (3) 2 Cor. xi. 3: Chart. (1, 2) [xiii], (3) [vi or vii] uncials
and minuscules intermixed, and some Coptic and Arabic words.

In this place other fragments have been placed till now. Seven unknown
Greek manuscripts of St. John, three of St. Matthew and (apparently) of
the other Gospels, cited in Laurentius Valla's "Annotationes in N. T., ex
diversorum utriusque linguae, Graecae et Latinae, codicum collatione,"
written about 1440, edited by Erasmus, Paris 1505. His copies seem modern,
and have probably been used by later critics. The whole subject, however,
is very carefully examined in the Rev. A. T. Russell's "Memoirs of the
life and works of Bp. Andrewes," pp. 282-310. Hort's Cod. 82 is Burgon's
Venet. xii, to be described hereafter.

83. Cod. Monacensis 518 [xi], 8-1/2 x 6-1/2, ff. 321 (20), beautifully
written, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., _syn._, _men._,
_subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., in the Royal Library at Munich, whither it was brought
from Augsburg (Bengel's August. 1, Scholz, Greg.).

84. Monacensis 568 [xii], 6-5/8 x 5-1/8, ff. 65, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ (not
_Eus._), _lect._ both in the text and margin, contains SS. Matthew and
Mark. _Mut._ Matt. i. 18-xiii. 10; xiii. 27-42; xiv. 3-xviii. 25; xix.
9-21; xxii. 4-Mark vii. 13 (Burgon, Greg.).

85. Monacensis 569 [xiii], 5-1/2 x 3-3/4, ff. 30, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._ in vermilion,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._), contains only Matt. viii. 15-ix. 17; xvi.
12-xvii. 20; xxiv. 26-45; xxvi. 25-54; Mark vi. 13-ix. 45; Luke iii.
12-vi. 44; John ix. 11-xii. 5; xix. 6-24; xx. 23-xxi. 9 (Bengel's August.
3, Scholz).

86. Posoniensis Lycaei Aug. [x], 9-1/2 x 7-1/8, ff. 280, _prol._, _Eus. t._,
_pict._, _syn._ Once at Buda, but it had been bought in 1183 at
Constantinople for the Emperor Alexius II Comnenus (Bengel, Endlicher). It
was brought by Rayger, a doctor of medicine, from Italy, where it had been
carried, to Pressburg, to his brother-in-law Gleichgross, who was a pastor
in that place, amongst whose books it was sold to the library of the
Lycaeum in Pressburg. (_See_ Gregory, Proleg. p. 486.)

87. Trevirensis [xii], fol., contains St. John's Gospel with a catena,
published at length by Cordier at Antwerp. It once belonged to the eminent
philosopher and mathematician, Cardinal Nicolas of Cuza, on the Moselle,
near Treves [1401-64: _see_ Cod. 129 Evan., and Cod. 59 Acts]; previously
at the monastery of Petra or of the Fore-runner of Constantinople(237)
(Scholz). Wetstein's 87 is our 250.

88. Codex of the Gospels, 4to, on vellum, cited as ancient and correct by
Joachim Camerarius (who collated it) in his Annotations to the New
Testament, 1642. It resembles in text Codd. 63, 72, 80.

89. Gottingensis Cod. Theol. 53 [1006], fol., ff. 172, _Carp._, _Eus. t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Eust._, _lect._, with corrections. Collated by A. G.
Gehl in 1729 (?), and by Matthaei (No. 20) in 1786-7.

90. (Act. 47, Paul. 14.) Cod. Jac. Fabri, a Dominican of Deventer, now in
the library of the church of the Remonstrants at Amsterdam, 186 [xvi, but
copied from a manuscript written by Theodore and dated 1293], 4to,
_chart._, 2 vols., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (Lat.), _lect._, _syn._ The Gospels stand John,
Luke, Matthew, Mark (_see_ p. 70); the Pauline Epistles precede the Acts;
and Jude is written twice, from different copies. This codex (which has
belonged to Abr. Hinckelmann of Hamburg, and to Wolff) was collated by
Wetstein. Faber [1472--living in 1515] had also compared it with another
"very ancient" vellum manuscript of the Gospels presented by Sixtus IV
(1471-84) to Jo. Wessel of Groningen, but which was then at Zvolle. As
might be expected, this copy much resembles Cod. 74.  See Delitzsch,
Handschr. Funde, ii. pp. 54-57.

91. Perronianus [x], of which extracts were sent by Montfaucon to Mill,
had been Cardinal Perron's [d. 1618], and before him had belonged to "S.
Taurini monasterium Ebroicense" (Evreux). Hort suggests, and Gregory
favours the suggestion, that this is the same as Evan. 299 (Cod. Par. Reg.
177), which came from Evreux.

92. Faeschii 1 (Act. 49) [xiv or xv]. 94. Faeschii 2 [xvi or xvii]. The
former, 10-1/4 x 8, ff. 141, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _pict._, contains St. Mark
with Victor's commentary on vellum, and scholia on the Catholic Epistles,
with the authors' names, Didymus, Origen, Cyril, &c., and is referred by
Gregory to the tenth century; the latter, 8-1/2 x 5-1/2, ff. 172 (22), SS.
Mark and Luke, with Victor's commentary on St. Mark, that of Titus of
Bostra on St. Luke, on paper [xv or xvi, Greg.]. Both belonged to Andrew
Faesch, of Basle, and were collated by Wetstein. Dean Burgon found them
both at Basle (O. ii. 27 and O. ii. 23).

93. Graevii [1632-1703] of the Gospels, cited by Vossius on the Genealogy,
Luke iii, but not known (Cod. 80? Greg.).

95. Oxf. Lincoln Coll. II. Gr. 16 [xii or earlier], 10-1/2 x 8, ff. 110
(20), is Mill's Wheeler 2(238). It contains SS. Luke and John with
commentary, _mut._ Luke i. 1-xi. 2; John vii. 2-17; xx. 31-xxi. 10. With
full scholia neatly written in the margin, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (later), _syn._,
_men._ (Mill, Professor Nicoll).

96. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 8 (Auct. D. 5. 1) [xv], 5-3/8 x 3-3/4, ff. 62 (18),
_chart._, is Walton's and Mill's Trit., with many rare readings,
containing St. John with a commentary, beautifully written by Jo.
Trithemius, Abbot of Spanheim [d. 1516]. Received from Abraham Scultet by
Geo. Hackwell, 1607 (Walton's Polyglott, Mill, Griesbach).

97. Hirsaugiensis [1500, by Nicolas, a monk of Hirschau in Bavaria], 12mo,
ff. 71, on vellum, containing St. John, seems but a copy of 96. Collated
by Maius, and the collation given in J. D. Michaelis, Orientalische und
exegetische Bibliothek, ii. p. 243, &c. (Greg., Bengel(239), Maius,
Schulz).

98. Oxf. Bodl. E. D. Clarke 5 [xii], 8-1/2 x 6, ff. 222 (25), _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., brought by Clarke
from the East. It was collated in a few places for Scholz, who substituted
it here for Cod. R (_see_ p. 139) of Griesbach.

99. Lipsiensis, Bibliothec. Paul, [xvi], 8-1/4 x 7-1/8, ff. 22 (22, 23),
Matthaei's 18, contains Matt. iv. 8-v. 27; vi. 2-xv. 30; Luke i. 1-13;
_Carp._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _syn._ (Matthaei,
Greg.). Wetstein's 99 is our 155.

100. Paul. L. B. de Eubeswald [x], 4to, 9-1/4 x 7-1/8, ff. 374, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ (_syn._, _men._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. later), vellum, _mut._ John
xxi. 25; _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _Eus. t._, and in a later hand many
corrections with scholia, _chart._ J. C. Wagenseil used it in Hungary for
John viii. 6. Now in the University of Pesth, but in the fifteenth century
belonging to Bp. Jo. Pannonius. Edited at Pesth in 1860 "cum
interpretatione Hungaria" by S. Markfi.

101. Uffenbach. 3 [xvi], 12mo, _chart._, St. John {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}. So near the
Basle (that is, we suppose, Erasmus') edition, that Bengel scarcely ever
cites it. With two others (Paul. M. and Acts 45) it was lent by Z. C.
Uffenbach, Consul of Frankfort-on-the-Main, to Wetstein in 1717, and
afterwards to Bengel. (Gregory would omit it.)

102. Bibliothecae Medicae, an unknown manuscript with many rare readings,
extracted by Wetstein at Amsterdam for Matt. xxiv-Mark viii. 1, from the
margin of a copy of Plantin's N. T. 1591, in the library of J. Le Long.
Canon Westcott is convinced that the manuscript from which these readings
were derived is none other than Cod. B itself, and Dr. Gregory agrees with
him. In St. Matthew's Gospel he finds the two authorities agree seventy
times and differ only five times, always in a manner to be easily
accounted for: in St. Mark they agree in eighty-four out of the
eighty-five citations, the remaining one (ch. ii. 22) being hardly an
exception. Westcott, New Test., Smith's "Dictionary of the Bible." Hort's
Cod. 102 is wscr (Evan. 507), to be described hereafter.

103. Regius 196 [xi], fol., once Cardinal Mazarin's, seems the same
manuscript as that from which Emericus Bigot gave extracts for
Curcellaeus' N. T. 1658 (Scholz). Burgon supposes some mistake here, as he
finds Reg. 196 to be a copy of Theophylact's commentary on SS. Matthew and
Mark, written over an older manuscript [viii or ix].  Perhaps the same as
14 or 278 (Greg.).

104. Hieronymi Vignerii [x], from which also Bigot extracted readings,
which Wetstein obtained through J. Drieberg in 1744, and published.
Perhaps 697 (Greg.).

105. (Act. 48, Paul. 24.) Cod. Ebnerianus, Bodl. Misc. Gr. 136, a
beautiful copy [xii], 8 x 6-1/4, ff. 426 (27), formerly belonging to Jerome
Ebner von Eschenbach of Nuremberg. _Pict._, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._), _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., the Nicene Creed, all
in gold: with _lect._ throughout and _syn._, _men._ prefixed by Joasaph, a
calligraphist, A.D. 1391, who also added John viii. 3-11 at the end of
that Gospel. Facsimile in Horne's Introduction, and in Tregelles' Horne,
p. 220 (Schoenleben 1738, Rev. H. O. Coxe, by whom the collation was lent
before 1845 to the Rev. R. J. F. Thomas, Vicar of Yeovil [d. 1873],
together with one of Canon. Graec. 110 of the Acts and Epistles, both of
which are mislaid).

106. Winchelsea [x], with many important readings, often resembling the
Harkleian Syriac: not now in the Earl of Winchelsea's Library (Jackson
collated it for Wetstein in 1748).

107. Bodl. E. D. Clarke 6 [xiv and later], 8-1/2 x 6-3/4, ff. 351, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
_pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., containing the Gospels in different hands. (Like 98,
111, 112, _partially_ collated for Scholz.) Griesbach's 107 is also 201.

108. Vindobonensis Caesarei, Suppl. Gr. 2, formerly Kollar. 4 [xi], 12-3/8
x 9-1/4, ff. 426, 2 vols. With a commentary (Victor's on St. Mark: Burgon,
Last Twelve Verses, &c., p. 288), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
_pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. It seems to have
been written at Constantinople, and formerly belonged to Parrhasius, then
to the convent of St. John de Carbonaria at Naples (Treschow, Alter,
Birch, Scholz).

109. Brit. Mus. Addit. 5117 [a.d. 1326], 7-1/4 x 5-3/4, ff. 225 (24-30), ll.
rubr., _Carp._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _Eus. t._, _syn._, _men._, _lect._,
_Am._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., Mead. 1, then Askew (5115 is Act. 22, and
5116 is Paul. 75, these two in the same hand; different from that employed
in the Gospels).

110(240).  Brit. Mus. Addit. 19,386 [xiv], 11 x 8, ff. 267 (?), _Carp._,
_Eus. t._ (faded), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _lect._, _syn._, with
a dial of the year. Four Gospels with commentary by Theophylact. Purchased
from Constantine Simonides in 1853. (Greg. 1260.)

111(241). Bodl. Clarke 7 [xii], 8-1/4 x 6, ff. 181 (31), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ (_mut._
Matt.), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _vers._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. _Mut._ John xvi.
27-xvii. 15; xx. 25-end, and

112(242). Bodl. Clarke 10 [xi], 5-1/4 x 4-1/4, ff. 167 (33), _Carp._, _Eus.
t._, _prol._, _pict._, _syn._, _men._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _lect._,
with commencement and large letters in gold, having both _Am._ and _Eus._,
in Matt. i-Mark ii, in the same line (a very rare arrangement; _see_ Codd.
192, 198, 212, and Wake 21 _below_), a very beautiful copy. These two,
very partially collated for Scholz, were substituted by him and
Tischensdorf for collations whose history is not a little curious.

113. Brit. Mus. Harleian. 1810 [xi], 8 x 7-1/4, ff. 270 (26), _prol._,
_syn._ (later), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ (Griesbach, Bloomfield). Apparently this is
Bentley's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~} "membr. 4to 600 annorum," collated by him in the margin of
Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 5 (_see_ Cod. 51). Its readings are of more than
usual interest, as are those of the next.

114. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5540 [x], 5-1/4 x 4-1/4, ff. 280 (20) (facsimile in a
Greek Testament, published in 1837 by Taylor, London), very elegant, with
more recent marginal notes and Matt. xxviii. 19-Mark i. 12 in a later
hand. _Mut._ Matt. xvii. 4-18; xxvi. 59-73 (Griesbach, Bloomfield).
_Carp._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ (Luke, John). _See_
Canon Westcott's article, "New Test.," in Smith's "Dictionary of the
Bible."

115. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5559 [xii], 6-3/4 x 5-3/4, ff. 271 (19), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., some
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, frequently _Eus._(243), once Bernard Mould's (Smyrna, 1724),
with an unusual text. _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-viii. 10; Mark v. 23-36; Luke i.
78-ii. 9; vi. 4-15; John xi. 2-xxi. 25 (Griesbach, Bloomfield). A few more
words of John xi survive.

116. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5567 [xii], 6-1/4 x 5, ff. 300 (23), _Syn._, _Eus.
t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.,
_men._, of some value. It belonged in 1649 to Athanasius a Greek monk,
then to Bernard Mould (Griesbach, Bloomfield).

117. (Apost. 6.) Brit. Mus. Harl. 5731 [xv], 8 x 6, ff. 202 (28),

belonged to the Ducal Library at Urbino, and was brought to Rome by
Clement VII (1523-34). It is very beautifully written (Birch, N. T. 1788,
gives a facsimile), certain chronicles and rich ornaments in vermilion and
gold. On fol. 19 we read underneath two figures respectively {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}

Alexius, A.D. 1118. This MS. is remarkable for its eclectic text, which is
said by Zahn to approach sometimes that of Marcion (Geschichte d. N. T.
Kanons, i. 456, note 2, and 457, note 1). It is often in agreement with
Codd. BDL, 69, 106, and especially with 1.

iii. 6) and marginal scholia (John vii. 29). Various readings are often
thus noted in its margin.

162. Rom. Barb. iv. 31, formerly 11 [dated May 13, 1153 ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}), Indict.

_subscr._, _pict._, written in Syria. Scholz says it contains only the
portions of the Gospels read in Church-lessons, but Birch the four
Gospels, with the numbers of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} to the first three Gospels.

{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}. The subscription states that it was written by Leo, a priest and
calligrapher, and bought in 1168 by Bartholomew, who compared it with
ancient Jerusalem manuscripts on the sacred mount.

the property of Achilles Statius, as also was Cod. 171. This codex and the
next three are in the Library of St. Maria in Vallicella at Rome, and
belong to the Fathers of the Oratory of St. Philippo Neri.

Rom. Vallicell. F. 90 [xii], 4to, ff. 217, now only contains the
Pentateuch, but from Bianchini, I. ii. pp. 529-30, we infer that the
Gospels were once there.

Euthalius' subscriptions. Also inspected by Bianchini.

ends John ii. 1.

177. Rom. Vat. Gr.? formerly Basil. 163 [xi], 8vo, _mut._ John i. 1-29.
Dr. Gregory thinks that it is 2115, his Evan. 870.

Arranged in quaternions, and the titles to the Gospels resemble those in
Cod. 69. Codd. 178-9 belong to the Angelica convent of Augustinian
Eremites at Rome. It has on the first leaf the same subscription as we
gave under Cod. 87, and which Birch and Scholz misunderstand.

179. Rom. Angelic. A. 4. 11 [xii], 7-3/4 x 6-1/2, ff. 248 (22), _Eus. t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ (_syn._, _men._, xv or xvi,
_chart._). The last five leaves (214-18) and two others (23, 30) are
_chart._, and in a later hand.

180. (Act. 82, Paul. 92, Apoc. 44.) Rom. Propagandae L. vi. 19, formerly
251, before Borgiae 2 [Gospels xi, Greg. xiv], 8-1/8 x 5-1/4, ff.? {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ (_syn._, _men._, xv _chart._);
the Gospels were written by one Andreas: the rest of the New Testament and
some apocryphal books by one John, November, 1284(246). This manuscript,
with Cod. T and Evst. 37, belonged to the Velitrant Museum of "Praesul
Steph. Borgia, Collegii Urbani de Propaganda Fide a secretis."

181. Cod. Francisci Xavier, Cardinal. de Zelada [xi], fol., ff. 596, with
scholia in the margin.  This manuscript (from which Birch took extracts)
is now missing. Compare Birch, N. T., Proleg. p. lviii; Burgon, Last
Twelve Verses &c., pp. 284, 288.

Codd. 182-198, all in that noble Library at Florence, founded by Cosmo de'
Medici [d. 1464], increased by his grandson Lorenzo [d. 1492], were very
slightly examined by Birch, and subsequently by Scholz. Dean Burgon has
described his own researches at Florence in the _Guardian_ for August 20
and 27, 1873, from which I have thankfully corrected the statements made
in my first edition respecting all the manuscripts there. They have been
examined since then more leisurely by Dr. Gregory, from whose careful
account some particulars have been added in this edition (_see_ Greg.,
Prolegomena (ii), pp. 505-509).

182. Flor. Laurentianus Plut. vi. 11 [xii], 10 x 7-1/8, ff. 226 (24), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.

This mode
of reckoning is very rare (_see_ p. 42, note 2), and tempted Scholz to
read {~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~} of the Greek era, i.e. A.D. 910.

numbered.

Codd. 199-203 were inspected, rather than collated, by Birch at Florence
before 1788; the first two in the Benedictine library of St. Maria; the
others in that of St. Mark, belonging to the Dominican Friars. Scholz
could not find any of them, but 201 is Wetstein's 107, Scrivener's m; 202
is now in the British Museum, Addit. 14,774. The other two Burgon found in
the Laurentian Library, whither they came at the suppression of
monasteries in 1810. They were examined afterwards by Gregory.

199. Flor. Laur. Conv. Sopp. 160, formerly Badia 99 or S. Mariae 67 [xii],

{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} are numbered and, besides _Am._, _Eus._, there exists in parts a
Harmony at the foot of the pages, such as is described in p. 58, note 2.

200. Flor. Laur. Conv. Sopp. 159, formerly Badia 69 or S. Mariae 66 [x],

Nyssa against the Arians (_syn._ and _men._ xiv). There are many scholia
in vermilion scattered throughout the book. Codd. 199, 200 were presented
to St. Maria's by Antonia Corbinelli [d. 1423]: the latter from St.
Justina's, another Benedictine house.

*201. (Act. 91, Paul. 104, Apoc. 94.) Lond. Brit. Mus. Addit. 11,837,
formerly Praedicator. S. Marci 701 [Oct. 7, 1357, Ind. 11], 13-1/2 x 11, ff.
492 (22), is mscr. in the Gospels, pscr. in Act., Paul., and bscr. in
Apoc. This splendid copy was purchased for the British Museum from the
heirs of Dr. Samuel Butler, Bishop of Lichfield. It contains the whole New
Testament; was first cited by Wetstein (107) from notices by Jo. Lamy, in
his "de Eruditione Apostolorum," Florence, 1738; glanced at by Birch, and
stated by Scholz (N. T. vol. ii. pp. xii, xxviii) to have been cursorily
collated by himself: how that is possible can hardly be understood, as he
elsewhere professes his ignorance whither the manuscript had gone (N. T.
vol. i. p. lxxii). Scrivener collated the whole volume. There are many
changes by a later hand, also _syn._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, some

This splendid copy cost the Museum L84 (Bloomfield).

203. Flor. Bibl. Nat. Convent. i. 10, 7, formerly Praed. S. Marci 707
[xv], 8-5/8 x 5-3/4, _chart._, is really in modern Greek. Birch cites it for
John vii. 53, but it ought to be expunged from the list.

204. (Act. 92, Paul. 105.) [xi or xiii], Bologna, Bibl. Univ. 2775,
formerly Bononiensis Canonicor. Regular. St. Salvador 640. After the
suppression of the house in 1867, it was moved to its present place. 7-3/4 x
5-3/8, ff. 443 (25). _Syn._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} numbered (without _Am._,
_Carp._), _lect._, _pict._ (Birch, Scholz, corrected by Burgon). Also
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _men._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.

Codd. 205-215, 217 in the Ducal palace at Venice, were slightly examined
by Birch in 1783, carefully by Burgon in 1872, and by Gregory in 1886.

205. (Act. 93, Paul. 106, Apoc. 88.) Venice, Mark 5 [xv], large fol., 15-1/2

Lat.), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _subscr._, contains both Testaments, with many peculiar
readings. It was written for Cardinal Bessarion (apparently by John Rhosen

By {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} Holmes understands the class
mark of the volume in Bessarion's Library.  W. F. Rinck considers it in
the _Gospels_ a copy of Cod. 209 ("Lucubratio Critica in Act. Apost. Epp.
C. et P.," Basileae, 1830). Burgon, who fully admits their wonderful
similarity in respect to the text, judges that Cod. 205, which is much
more modern than Cod. 209, was transcribed from the same _uncial_
archetype.

206. (Act. 94, Paul. 107, Apoc. 101.) Ven. Mark 6 [xv or xvi], 15 x
10-5/8, ff. 431, like Codd. 69 and 233, is partly on parchment, partly on
paper. It contains both Testaments, but is not numbered for the
Apocalypse. A mere duplicate of Cod. 205, as Holmes saw clearly: it is his
No. 122.

207. Ven. Mark 8 [xi or xii], 10-7/8 x 8-3/8, ff. 267 (22), 2 cols.,
_Carp._, _prol._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._) in
gold, _syn._, _men._, _mut._ in Matt. i. 1-13; Mark i. 1-11, for the sake
of the gorgeous illuminations. Written in two columns. Once owned by A. F.
R.

208. Ven. Mark 9 [xi or xii], 7-1/8 x 5-3/4, ff. 239 (23), _Carp._, _Eus.
t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, of some value.

209. (Act. 95, Paul. 108, Apoc. 46.) Ven. Mark 10 [xi, xiv Greg.], 7-3/4 x
4-3/4, ff. 411 (27), of the whole New Testament, once Bessarion's, who had
it with him at the Council of Florence, 1439. There are numerous minute
marginal notes in vermilion, obviously _prima manu_. In its delicate style
of writing this copy greatly resembles Cod. 1 (facsimile No. 23). {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._), also the modern chapters in the
margin. _Prol._ to Epistles, _lect._, but not much in the Gospels, before
each of which stands a blank leaf, as if for _pict._ A good collation of
Codd. 205 and 209 is needed; Birch did little, Engelbreth gave him some
readings, and Fleck has published part of a collation by Heimbach. Rinck
collated Apoc. i-iii. In the Gospels they are very like Codd. B, 1. The
Apocalypse is in a later hand, somewhat resembling that of Cod. 205, and
has _prol._ For the unusual order of the books, _see_ above, p. 72.

210. Ven. Mark 27 [xi or xii], a noble fol., 14 x 11-7/8, ff. 372, with a
catena (Victor's commentary on St. Mark). _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-ii. 18, from
the same cause as in Cod. 207. Rich blue and gold illuminations, and
pictures of SS. Mark and Luke. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _pict._

211. Ven. Mark 539 [xii], fol., 11-1/2 x 9-1/2, ff. 280 (29-26), 2 cols.,
_mut._ Luke i. 1-ii. 32; John i. 1-iv. 2, with an Arabic version in the
right-hand column of each page. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. t., Am., Eus. (irregularly inserted),
_lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.

Burgon cites Zanetti, Graeca D. Marc. Bibl. Codd. MSS., Venet. 1740, p.
291, for the enumeration of the five Patriarchates (_see_ above, p. 67),
and other curious matter appended to St. John. The heading of the second
Gospel is {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}.

212. Ven. Mark 540 [xi or xii], 6-7/8 x 5, ff. 273 (23), the first page in
gold, with _pict._ and most elaborate illuminations. Much _mut._, twenty
leaves being supplied in a modern hand. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _vers._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _lect._, _Am._ with _Eus._ in a line with them (_see_ Cod. 112), a
little later, carried only to the end of St. Mark.

213. Ven. Mark 542 [xi], 8vo, 8-1/8 x 6-1/4, ff. 356 (18), _mut._ John
xviii. 40-xxi. 25. _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (_Am._, _Eus._ most irregularly
inserted), few {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., heroic verses as colophons to the
Gospels. Large full stops are found in impossible places.

214. Ven. Mark 543 [xiv], 8vo, 9-3/4 x 6-1/4, ff. 227 (27), _chart._,
_argent._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ with _harm._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._),
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, _vers._

215. Ven. Mark 544 [xi], fol., 12-3/4 x 9-1/2, ff. 271 (24), _Carp._, _Eus.
t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ with _harm._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _syn._,
_pict._ (later). This copy is a duplicate of Codd. 20, 300, as well in its
text as in the subscriptions and commentary, being without any of the
later corrections seen in Cod. 20. The commentary on St. John is
Chrysostom's, those on the other Gospels the same as in Cod. 300 (Burgon).

216. Codex Canonici, brought by him from Corcyra, written in a small
character [no date assigned], never was at St. Mark's, as Scholz alleges:
Griesbach inserted it in his list through a misunderstanding of Birch's
meaning. It is probably one of those now at Oxford, to be described
hereafter (_see_ Codd. 489, 490).

217. Ven. Mark, Gr. i. 3, given in 1478 by Peter de Montagnana to the
monastery of St. John in Viridario, at Padua (viii. A.) [xii or xiii],
8-1/8 x 6-1/8, ff. 306 (21), in fine condition. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._), full _syn._, few _lect._, _prol._,
_vers._ Codd. 218-225 are in the Imperial Library at Vienna. Alter and
Birch collated them about the same time, the latter but cursorily, and
Gregory examined them in 1887.

*218. (Act. 65, Paul. 57, Apoc. 33.) Vindobon. Caesar, Nessel. 23,
formerly 1 [xiii], fol., 12-1/2 x 8-3/4, ff. 623 (49, 50), 2 cols., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _subscr._, _Euthal._ in Acts, Cath., Paul., contains
both Testaments. _Mut._ Apoc. xiii. 5-xiv. 8; xv. 7-xvii. 2; xviii.
10-xix. 15; ending at xx. 7 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}. This important copy, containing
many peculiar readings, was described by Treschow, and comprises the text
of Alter's inconvenient, though fairly accurate N. T. 1786-7, to be
described in Vol. II. Like Cod. 123 it was brought from Constantinople by
De Busbeck.

219. Vind. Caes. Ness. 321, formerly 32 [xiii], 6-1/4 x 4-3/4, ff. 232 (21),
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._

220. Vind. Caes. Ness. 337, formerly 33 [xiv], 12mo, 3-7/8 x 2-5/8, ff.
303 (22), in very small letters, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._, _syn._

221. Vind. Caes. Ness. 117, formerly 38 [x or xi], 11 x 7-5/8, ff. 251
(41-43), with commentaries (Chrysostom on Matt., John; Victor on Mark,
Titus of Bostra on Luke), to which the _fragments_ of text here given are
accommodated.

222. Vind. Caes. Ness. 180, formerly 39 [xiv], 8-1/2 x 6, ff. 346 (32), on
cotton paper, _mut._ Contains _fragments_ of the Gospels, with a
commentary (Victor's on St. Mark). This and the last were brought from
Constantinople by De Busbeck.

223. Vind. Caes. 301, formerly 40 [xiv, Greg. x], 7 x 5-1/2, ff. 115 (32),
contains fragments of SS. Matthew, Luke, and John, with a catena. Codd.
221-3 must be cited cautiously: Alter appears to have made no systematic
use of them.

224. Vind. Caes. Suppl. Gr. 97, formerly Kollar. 8 [xii], 5-1/2 x 4-5/8, ff.
97 (19), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._,
_subscr._, only contains St. Matthew. This copy came from Naples.

225. Vind. Caes. Suppl. Gr. 102, formerly Kollar. 9 [dated {~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK OXIA~} or A.D.
1192], 5-3/8 x 3-7/8, ff. 171 (29), _pict._, _lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., _syn._,
_men._

Codd. 226-233 are in the Escurial, described by D. G. Moldenhawer, who
collated them about 1783, loosely enough, for Birch's edition. In 1870 the
Librarian, Jose Fernandez Montana (in order to correct Haenel's errors)
sent to Mr. Wm. Kelly, who obligingly communicated it to me, a complete
catalogue of the four copies of the Greek Bible, and of nineteen of the
New Testament "neither more or less," then at the Escurial, with their
present class-marks. I do not recognize, either in his list or in that
subjoined, the "Codex Aureus containing the Four Gospels in letters of
gold, a work of the early part of the eleventh century," spoken of in the
_Globe_ newspaper of Oct. 3, 1872, on occasion of the fire at the Escurial
on Oct. 2, which however did not touch the manuscripts. Perhaps that Codex
is in Latin, unless it be Evst. 40. _See_ also Emmanuel Miller, Cat. des
MSS. Gr. de la Bibl. de l'Escurial, Paris, A.D. 1848.

226. (Act. 108, Paul. 228.) Cod. Escurialensis {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. iv. 17 [xi], 8vo, ff. ?,
on the finest vellum, richly ornamented, in a small, round, very neat
hand. _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _lect._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._, _Eus._
Many corrections were made by a later hand, but the original text is
valuable, and the readings sometimes unique. Fairly collated.

227. Escurial. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. iii. 15 [xiii], 4to, ff. 158, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _Am._,
_pict._ A later hand, which dates from 1308, has been very busy in making
corrections.

228. (Act. 109, Paul. 229.) Escurial. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. iv. 12 [xiv, Montana xvi], 8vo,
ff. ?, _chart._ Once belonged to Nicolas Nathanael of Crete, then to
Andreas Damarius of Epidaurus, a calligrapher. _Eus. t._, _syn._(247)

229. Escurial. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. iv. 21 [dated 1140], 8vo, ff. 296, written by Basil
Argyropolus, a notary. _Mut._ Mark xvi. 15-20; John i. 1-11. _Pict._,
_lect._; the latter by a hand of about the fourteenth century, which
retraced much of the discoloured ink, and corrected in the margin (since
mutilated by the binder) very many important readings of the first hand,
which often resemble those of ADK. i. 72. This copy must be mislaid, as it
is not in Montana's list.

230. Escurial. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~} (Montana {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}).(248) iii. 5 [dated Oct. 29, 1013, with the
wrong Indiction, 11 for 12: Montana's date is 1014, and the error is
probably not his: _see_ p. 42, note 2], 4to, ff. 218, written by Luke a
monk and priest, with double _syn._(249), _Carp._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _subscr._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.: _see_ p. 67, note. An interesting copy, deemed by Moldenhawer
worthy of closer examination.

231. Escurial. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~} (Montana {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}). iii. 6 [xii], 4to, ff. 181, _lect._, _Eus.
t._, torn, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, a picture "quae Marcum mentitur," _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.,
_syn._, _men._ There are some marginal glosses by a later hand (which
obelizes John vii. 53 _seq._), and a Latin version above parts of St.
Matthew.

232. Escurial. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~} (Montana {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}). iii. 7 [xiii: dated 1292, Montana], 4to, ff.
288, very elegant but otherwise a poor copy. Double _syn._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in the
margin of SS. Matthew and Luke, but elsewhere kept apart.

233. Escurial. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}. ii. 8 [xi ?, Montana xiii], ff. 279, like Codd. 69 and
206, is partly of parchment, partly paper, in bad condition, and once
belonged to Matthew Dandolo, a Venetian noble. It has a catena, and by
reason of ligatures, &c. (_see_ p. 43), is hard to read. _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, _Eus. t._ (apart), _vers._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.

234. (Act. 57, Paul. 72.) Cod. Havniensis reg. theol. 1322, formerly 1
[dated 1278], 10 x 7-3/8, ff. 315 (35), 2 cols., one of the several copies
written by Theodore (_see_ p. 43, note 1). This copy and Cod. 235 are now
in the Royal Library at Copenhagen, but were bought at Venice by G.
Rostgaard in 1699. The order of the books in Cod. 234 is described p. 73.
_Carp._, _Eus. t._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._, with many corrections. (C. G.
Hensler, 1784.)

235. Havniens. reg. theol. 1323, formerly 2 [dated 1314], 4to, ff. 279,
_chart._, written by the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} Philotheus, though very incorrectly;
the text agrees much with Codd. DK. i. 33 and the Harkleian Syriac. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, _lect._; the words are often ill divided and the stops misplaced
(Hensler).

236(250). London, J. Bevan Braithwaite 3 [xi], 6-1/2 x 4-3/8, ff. 256 (20),
_7 chart._, _syn._, _men._, _Eus. t._, _Am._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., some {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., some
_lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ _Mut._ at beginning and at end after John ix. 28.
Beautifully written. Bought at Athens in 1889. Collated by W. C.
Braithwaite.

Codd. 237-259 are nearly all Moscow manuscripts, and were thoroughly
collated by C. F. Matthaei, for his N. T., to be described in Vol. II.
These Russian codices were for the most part brought from the twenty-two
monasteries of Mount Athos by the monk Arsenius, on the suggestion of the

_prima manu_.

resembling those of Cod. 259.

*254. Dresd. A. 100 (Matthaei 11) (Tregelles) [xi], 11-5/8 x 9-1/8, ff.
247 (24), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _pict._, from the monastery of
St. Athanasius. Contains SS. Luke and John with scholia.

*255. Mosc. Syn. 139 (Mt. 12) [xiii], fol., ff. 299 _chart._ +9, once
"Dionysii monachi rhetoris _et amicorum_." Commentaries of Chrysostom and
others ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}), with fragments of the text interspersed.

*256. Mosc. Typogr. Syn. 3 (Mt. 14) [ix ?], fol., ff. 147, scholia on SS.
Mark and Luke, with portions of the text. The commentary on St. Mark is
_ascribed_ to Victor, but in this copy and the preceding the scholia are
but few in number (Burgon).

*257. Mosc. Syn. 120 (Mt. 15) is Evan. O, described above.

_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _Am._, _Eus._, _syn._, _men._, from the Iberian
monastery, with a commentary (Victor's on St. Mark). This is one of
Matthaei's best manuscripts. His other twenty-two copies contain portions
of Chrysostom, and therefore come under the head of Patristic Quotations.

Codd. 260-469 were added to the list by Scholz: the very few he professes
to have collated thoroughly will be distinguished by an asterisk.

260. Paris National. Gr. 51 [xiii], 12 x 8-3/4, ff. 241 (24), _prol._,

_Am._, _lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. (_subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. later), once at the monastery of
the Forerunner at Constantinople. _Mut._ Luke xxiv. 39-53. Matt. i. 1-xi.
1 supplied [xiv] _chart._

_t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., some {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. (_Am._, _Eus._, _harm._ at bottom of page, except
in Luke, John, where too _Am._ is later), _subscr._, with rare readings,
like those of Evan. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~} and Evann. 300, 376, 428.

263. (Act. 117, Paul. 137.) Par. Nat. Gr. 61 [xiii], 8-1/4 x 6-1/8 ff. 294
(28, 29), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.
Probably from Asia Minor. It once belonged to Jo. Hurault Boistaller, as
did Codd. 301, 306, 314.

264. Par. Nat. Gr. 65 [xiii], 4to, 8 x 5-3/8, ff. 287 (20), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,

have been called Coptic-like letters, but brought from the East in 1718 by
Paul Lucas. The leaves are misplaced in binding, as are those of Cod. 272.
At the foot of every page is a harmony like those in Codd. E, Wd. _See_ p.
58, note 2 (Burgon).

Of these copies, 265-270, Burgon states that the grand 4to Cod. 265 seems
to contain an important text, 270 a peculiar text, though less beautiful
externally than 266, 267, 269. Cod. 268 in double columns has _Eus. t._
very superb, but _pict._ of Evangelists only sketched in ink. Cod. 269,
once belonging to Henry IV (in which the last leaf of St. Luke is
missing), is in its ancient binding, and is full of very uncommon
representations of Gospel incidents.

265. Par. Nat.

Thevenot's. Gregory traces it through the Paris Nat. Library and Th. Rodd
to the Brit. Museum, which purchased it.

ix. 10-27; xviii. 12-29. Dean Burgon had a photograph of this manuscript,
which he regarded as a specimen of the transition period between uncial
and cursive writing. The subscription, resembling that of Cod. L, set in
the margin of Cod. 274, he judges to look as old as that of L: _see_
Chapter IX, Mark xvi. 9-20.

contains Luke i. 1-ii. 39 with a catena, questions and answers from SS.
Matthew and John, with the text. Burgon declares that the date June 20,
A.D. 978, Indiction 6, which we took from Scholz (_see_ above, p. 41, note
2), is that of the manuscript this was copied from, not of Cod. 429
itself. In that case we have another early dated cursive the less.
Gregory, Prolegomena, p. 449, inclines to the placing of this MS. amongst
the uncials.

430. Mon. Reg. 437 [xi], 11-5/8 x 8-5/8, ff. 354 (24), contains John

Leontius, a Cyprian monk, in 1590, and sent it to the Library at Augsburg.

431. (Act. 180, Paul. 238.) Molsheimensis [xii], _Eus. t._, _prol._ with
many unusual readings, was brought to Strasburg from the Jesuits' College

14-xxi. 25 in a rather later hand). It has a somewhat unusual text
(collated, as was also Evan. 122, by J. Dermout, Collectanea Critica in N.
T., 1825).

436. Meerman. 117 [A.D. 1322], ff. 277. Dr. Gregory has traced this MS. to
No. 54 in the library of the Jesuit College at Clermont, then to Meerman,
then to Payne a London bookseller, who bought it in 1824. It is not known
now. For the MS. once in Dean Burgon's possession but in the Bodleian
Library, _see_ Evan. 562.

437. Petropol. Caes. [xi], like Cod. E of the Pauline Epistles, one leaf

Out of this whole mass of 190 manuscripts, Scholz collated five entire
(262, 299, 300, 301, 346), eleven in the greater part (260, 270, 271, 277,
284, 285, 298, 324, 353, 382, 428), many in a few places, and not a few
seem to have been left by him untouched. His list of Oriental manuscripts
(Evann. 450-469), as it is given in the first volume of his Greek
Testament (Proleg. pp. xcvi-xcvii)(255), has been withdrawn from the
catalogue of cursive copies of the Gospels, in deference to the wish of
the Dean of Chichester (Letter iii addressed to myself in the _Guardian_
newspaper, July 5, 1882). It must be confessed indeed that Scholz's
account of what he had seen in the East about 1823 cannot be easily
reconciled with the description of the Rev. H. O. Coxe of the Bodleian
Library thirty-five years later ("Report to Her Majesty's Government of
the Greek Manuscripts yet remaining in the Libraries of the Levant,
1858"); that most of the books which Scholz catalogued at St. Saba on the
Dead Sea were removed before 1875, as Mr. F. W. Pennefather informs us, to
the Great Greek Convent of the Cross at Jerusalem; and that at least four
of them were brought to Parham in Sussex from St. Saba in 1834 by the late
Lord de la Zouche. Instead of Scholz's seven (450-6), Coxe saw fourteen
copies of the Gospels at Jerusalem; twenty of the Gospels (besides a noble
palimpsest of the Orestes and Phoenissae) at St. Saba after the four had
been subtracted, instead of Scholz's ten (457-466); at Patmos five instead
of Scholz's three (467-469). In spite of one's respect for the memory of
that zealous and worthy labourer, M. A. Scholz, with whom I had a personal
conference regarding our common studies in 1845, I cannot help acquiescing
in Dean Burgon's decision, though not, perhaps, without some natural
reluctance.





CHAPTER VIII. CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS. PART II.


We have already intimated that Tischendorf has chosen to make no addition
to the numerical list of cursive manuscripts furnished by Scholz,
preferring to indicate the fresh materials which have since come to light
by another notation, derived from the names of the collators or the places
where they are deposited. As this plan has proved in practice very
inconvenient, it is no wonder that Dean Burgon, after casting away
Scholz's numbers from 450 to 469, on account of their evident inaccuracy,
which has since then received definite proof, should have assigned
numerals to the cursives unknown to Scholz from 450 to 737, still
excluding, as far as was then possible, those whose location or character
was uncertain. Burgon's method, as laid down in his Letters in the
_Guardian_ for July 5, 12, 19, 26, 1882, having the priority of
publication, and being arranged with regard to the places where the
manuscripts are deposited rather than to their actual collators, may as
well be adopted as any other that might be made. The only important point
to be secured is that all scholars should employ the SAME NUMBERS when
speaking of the SAME MANUSCRIPTS.

It is greatly to be regretted that Dr. C. R. Gregory, even upon advice
tendered by other critics, if such was the case, should have neglected the
important principle laid down in the preceding sentence, and in Part II of
his very valuable Prolegomena to Tischendorf's eighth edition, published
seven years after the third edition of this work, should have helped to
make confusion worse confounded in this large and increasing field. But it
is not my object to assail one who has done this study very great service,
but only to point out an inconvenience which I shall endeavour to minimize
as far as I can. It is clear that Dr. Scrivener's order, being the first
out, and having been followed since then in quotations in books, and
notably by the late learned Abbe Martin, cannot be allowed to drop. I have
therefore followed it in the succeeding pages. But it has been my object
to bring together the two lists as soon as possible after the close of Dr.
Scrivener's, and the end of the supplementary lists of Dean Burgon and the
Abbe Martin, and to follow, as far as the case will admit, the lead of Dr.
Gregory, where he has every right to prescribe the series of numbers.
Unfortunately, this course is not always open, because when the time has
arrived it is found that some MSS. have been already forestalled, and
others are in arrear.

It should be added, that the number of the MSS. as standing in Dr.
Gregory's list, where it varies from the present, is given at the end of
the account of each manuscript; and reversely a table is added at the end
of this volume of the varying numbers in this list which answer to the
numbers in Dr. Gregory's list.

We begin with the following twenty Italian manuscripts, added to our
previous list of cursive copies of the Gospels by Burgon in Letters
addressed to Dr. Scrivener and inserted in the _Guardian_ of Jan. 29 and
Feb. 5, 1873.

gold, with a "luxurious prodigality" of miniatures. (Greg. 583.)

453. Parma, Reg. 95 [xi, or older], 7-3/8 x 5-1/8, ff. 318, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,

beautifully written, _pict._ almost obliterated. _Am._ (not _Eus._). The
last leaf more recent. (Greg. 587.)

457. Milan, Ambros. E. 63 sup. [May, 1321, Indiction 4], 8-1/2 x 5-7/8, ff.
221, _Eus. t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._,

Parmae Reg. 15, Rom. Corsin. 41. G. 16, but without explanation. _See_

one-eyed Cyprian, aged 74, June 9, 1612: _chart._, with a catena.

460. Milan, Ambros. D. 298 inf., transcribed by the same, fol., _chart._
These two codices purport to be commentaries of Peter of Laodicea on St.
John and St. Mark respectively: but "such titles are quite misleading,"
_See_ Burgon, Letter to _Guardian_, Feb. 5, 1873.

461. (Act. 197, Paul. 223.) Milan, Ambros. Z. 34 sup. [xiii or xiv],
_chart._, 6-1/2 x 4-3/4, ff. 295 (31), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _syn._,

_syn._, Gospels. (Greg. 592.)

462. Venice, Ven. Marc. i. 58 [xiii], 9-3/4 x 7, ff. 153 (22), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,

Supplementary Catalogue, contains only Mark i. 44-Luke xxiv. 53; John i.
15-xi. 13. (Greg. 593.)

463. Instead of Ven. i. xxxix. 8, 7, or Nan. 27, which appears to be a
commentary--Ven. Marc. ii. 7 [xiv], 12-3/4 x 9-7/8, ff. 430 (31), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._

Burgon collated sixteen chapters in the several Gospels. (Greg. 597.)

465. Ven. Marc. i. 57 [xi or xii], 11-5/8 x 8-1/4, ff. 228 (29), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., ends Mark xii. 18, with Theophylact's commentary. (Greg.
596.)

commentary (Victor's on St. Mark). (Greg. 599.)

We do not include Ven. Marc. i. 61, which is a mere catena on Matt. i-ix,
or an unnumbered catena of St. Luke in the same Library, or Ven. M. 1, an
uncial copy of the Old Testament [ix ?], at the end of which are found
_Carp._, _Eus. t._ of unique fullness, as if the Gospels were to follow.

468. Ven. Marc. 56 [xvi], fol., _chart._, 11-3/8 x 7-7/8 ff. ?, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._
(John), _capp._ _Lat._, _Am._, _lect._, _syn._, wrongly set down by Scholz
as Evst. 143, contains the Gospels, beginning Matt. v. 44. It was once "S.
Michaelis Venet. prope Murianum," and is described in Mittarelli's
Catalogue of that Library, p. 1099. (Greg. 595.)

469. Quaritch i. [xi-xii], 10-1/4 x 7-1/2, ff. ? (19), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,

M., March 18, 1893.)

470. Ven. s. Lazarus 1531 [xiii, Greg. xiv], 10 x 7-3/4, ff. 234 (?), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.
_t._, _prol._ (John), _lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. (later), _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., is a
fragment of the Gospels containing Matt. i. 22-Luke xxiii. 15; 33-48.

the Hon. Frederic North. (E. M., March 18, 1893.)

472. (Act. 235, Paul. 276, Apoc. 103.) Poictiers [xvi], small folio,
_chart._, of the whole New Testament, as described to Burgon by M.
Dartige, the librarian there. Two librarians named Cavou successfully
robbed the library, and probably sold miniatures and pictures. (H. C.
Hoskier.) G. Haenel (Catal. Librorum MSS. Lips. 1830) names this and
another of the whole N. T. at Arras [xv], 8vo, but of the latter the
librarian, M. Wicquot, knows nothing.

Edward de Muralt, in his N. T. "ad fidem codicis principis Vaticani," 1848
(p. 111), inserts a collation of eleven manuscripts (five of the Gospels,
one Psalter with hymns, five Lectionaries), chiefly at St. Petersburg. He
also describes them in his Preface (pp. lv-lvii), and in the Catalogue of
Greek Manuscripts in the Imperial Library there. The copies of the Gospels
are--

(in silver
uncials), _subscr._, a purple MS. with golden letters, very beautiful,
said to have been written by the Empress Theodora. _Mut._ John xi. 26-48;

_t._, _pict._ Brought by Titoff from Turkey.

known of a Greek N. T. MS., is plainly visible in a photographed facsimile
in "Exempla Codicum Graecorum literis minusculis scriptorum" (fol.,
Heidelberg, 1878), Tab. 1, by Wattenbach and von Velsen. This precious
treasure was the property of Porphyry Uspensky, Bp. of Kiow, but is now at

the next in order came in 1727 from {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} on Athos.

_men._, in text said to resemble Cod. 71, once Humphrey Wanley's

Residentiary of Lichfield, was presented by him on his eightieth birthday,

Of a very unusual style. (Greg.
706.)

To this list we must add the five following copies from the collection of
the Abbot M. Aloy. Canonici, purchased at Venice in 1817 for the Bodleian
Library by Dr. Bandinel, who secured 2045 out of the total number of 3550

Metropolitan Church of Heraclea on the Propontis, and presented in 1738 to
Charles, Duke of Marlborough, _amoris et observantiae ergo_ by Thomas
Payne, Archdeacon of Brecon, once our Chaplain at Constantinople: a
bright, clean copy, written in very black ink, with vermilion
ornamentation, and barbarous _pict._ (Greg. 701.)

Mr. Bradshaw indicated in the "Transactions of the Royal Society of
Literature," vol. ii. p. 355, two copies of the Gospels belonging to the
Earl of Leicester at Holkham, to be described with facsimiles in the
Catalogue of the Library there. They were examined by Dean Burgon, who
thus reported of them:--

524. Holkham 3 [xiii], 8-3/4 x 6-1/6, of 183 leaves, four being misplaced.
It is beautifully written in twenty-seven long lines on a page. _Eus. t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ (not Eus.), imperfectly given: no _lect._ ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _subscr._,
_pict._). Besides five pictures of the Evangelists and gorgeous headings
to the Gospels are seventeen representations of Scripture subjects, some
damaged. This "superb MS. of extraordinary interest" in the style of its
writing closely resembles Evan. 38. (Greg. 557.)

525. Holkham 4 [xiii or earlier], 8-1/2 x 6-1/3, ff. 352 (20), finely
written, but quite different in style from Cod. 524. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. in gold,
_lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} in vermilion, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. numbered. ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,

Eight copies of the Gospels, brought together by the late Sir Thomas
Phillipps, Bart., at Middle Hill, Worcestershire, are now the property of
Mr. Fitzroy Fenwick, and, with the rest of this unrivalled private
collection of manuscripts, are now at Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham,
where Burgon examined them in 1880, and Hoskier in 1886, who quotes (Cod.
604, App. E), some of the readings. Scrivener had used some of them at
Middle Hill in 1856.

526. Phillipps 13,975 [xii], 12-1/2 x 9-1/2, ff. 196, once Lord Strangford's
464, a grand copy, the text being surrounded with a commentary (abounding,
as usual, in contractions) in very minute letters. That on St. Mark is
Victor's. _Pict._ of SS. Mark and Luke, beautiful illuminations for
headings of the Gospels. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._ in gold, _pict._
(_syn._, _men._ at end). (Greg. 556.)

527. Phillipps 1284 (Act. 200, Paul. 281) [xii], 7-2/3 x 5-1/4, ff. 344
(28), from the library of Mr. Lammens of Ghent, a rough specimen, contains
the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles, the Pauline preceding the Catholic.
_Mut._ Matt. ix. 36-x. 22; Mark i. 21-45, and the first page of St. John.
The writing varies; that from Acts to 1 Thess. is more delicate, and looks
older. No _Am._, _Eus._ Much _lect._ in vermilion, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}., _subscr._, _syn._, and sparse _men._ (Greg. 676.)

528. Phillipps 2387 [xiii], 6-1/4 x 4-1/2, ff. 222 (25), bought of Thorpe for
thirty guineas: rough, but interesting. One leaf only of _Eus. t._
Wantonly _mut._ in headings of the Gospels, and in Mark i. 1-19; Luke i.
1-18; John i. 1-23. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ (not _Eus._), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} later,
_syn._, _men._ (xvii) at the beginning, and much marginal _lect._ by a
modern hand.

529. Phillipps 3886 [xi or xii], 10-1/2 x 8-1/8, ff. 326 (20), a beautiful
copy, bought (as were Evann. 530, 532, 533) by Payne at Lord Guildford's
sale. _Eus. t._, _Carp._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._

(Greg. 678.)

530. Phillipps 3887 [xii], 8-1/4 x 6, ff. 240 (25, 26), the first four lines
in SS. Matt., Mark, Luke being of gold, with _pict._ of the four
Evangelists and nineteen others, _Eus. t._, _Am._ incomplete and irregular
(no _Eus._). No _lect._, but marginal critical notes. As in Evan. 64, a
line (~) is set over Proper Names of persons in the Genealogies (_see_ at
end of Evan. 64). (Greg. 679.)

531. (Acts 199, Paul. 231, Apoc. 104.) Phillipps 7682 [xi], 6-5/8 x 5, ff.
190 (41 or 50), 2 cols. (two scribes, Hoskier; several, Greg.), the hands
so minute as to require a magnifying glass, contains the whole New
Testament, also from Lord Guildford's (871), being, like Evann. 532 and
583, to be described below, from the Hon. F. North's collection (319). The
ink is a dull brown, the ornaments in blue, vermilion, and carmine.
_Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (Gr. and Lat.), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._,
few _Eus._, _lect._, _subscr._ There are many important corrections in the
margin, and 18-1/2 pages from Epiphanius at the end. This copy has every
appearance of having been made from a very ancient codex: observe the
arrangement of the Beatitudes in Matt. v in single lines, as also the
genealogy in Luke iii. (Greg. 680.)

532. Phillipps 7712, North 184 (_see_ Evan. 529), [xiii], 7-1/2 x 5-1/2, ff.
?, in a large hand and very black ink, the first page being in gold, with
many gold balls for stops. There is much preliminary matter, _Eus. t._
(two sets in different hands), _pict._ (_Carp._, _prol._ later), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _lect._ (later), _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. The text
is corrected throughout by an ancient scribe, in a hand bright, clear, and
small. (Greg. 681.)

533. Phillipps 7757 [xi], 6 x 4-1/2, ff. ?, an exquisite little manuscript,
with accessories in lake, vermilion, and blue. _See_ Evan. 529. _Prol._,
_Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._,
_vers._

Haenel is mistaken in supposing that a Greek Evangelistarium is included
in this grand and unique collection.

The Parham copies of the New Testament are described in a "Catalogue of
materials for writing, early writings on tablets and stones, rolled and
other Manuscripts and Oriental Manuscript books in the library of Robert
Curzon (Lord de la Zouche of Harynworth, 1870-73) at Parham," fol., 1849.
This accomplished person collected them in the course of his visits to
Eastern Monasteries from 1834 to 1837, and permitted me in 1855 to collate
thoroughly three of them, and to inspect the rest. They were all examined
by Dean Burgon, to whom his son, the present Lord de la Zouche, had given
free access to them. The codices of the Gospels are eight in number.

534. (Act. 215, Paul. 233.) Parham lxxi. 6 [xi], 9 x 6-1/2, ff. 348 (41),
contains the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles, the Pauline preceding the
Catholic, and was brought in 1837 from Caracalla on Athos. _Prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.

_vers._, _syn._, _men._ The usual arabesque ornaments are in red. (Greg.
547.)

535. Parh. lxxi. 7 [xi, Greg. x], 6-1/8 x 4-1/2, ff. 167 (26), brought from
St. Saba in 1834. _Pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, illuminated headings, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._

_subscr._, _syn._, _men._ (Greg. 549.)

537. Parh. lxxiv. 9 [xi, Greg. xii], 10-1/4 x 7-3/4, ff. 219 (28), brought
from Caracalla 1837, in its old black binding. _Carp._, _prol._ (later),

_syn._, _men._ With faded red arabesques (no _pict._) and lake headings to
the Gospels, the writing being large and spread. There are marginal notes
here and there. (Greg. 550.)

538. Parh. lxxv. 10 [xii], 4to, ff. 233 (22, 23), from Caracalla, also in
its old black binding. There are rude _pict._ of the four Evangelists, and
barbarous headings to the Gospels. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, few

544. Ashburnham 204 [xiii], 4to, ff. 104, "a piteous fragment," brought
from Greece by the Earl of Aberdeen, and bought at his sale. It contains
only Matt. xxv. 32-5, 40, 41-xxviii. 20; Mark i. 4-xv. 47 (but defective
throughout); Luke i. 1-xxiv. 48; John i. 1-ii. 4: about Luke vi a
different hand was employed. There is no heading to St. Luke's Gospel, but
a blank space is left, so that perhaps the MS. was never finished. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.

*549. B.-C. II. 7 [xii or xiii], 5 x 3, ff. 172 (26-31), a very curious
volume in ancient binding with two metal plates on the covers much
resembling that of B-C. I. 7, contains the Four Gospels and the Acts,
breaking off at ch. xxvi. 24 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}; the writing being unusually full
of abbreviations, and the margin gradually contracting, as if vellum was
becoming scarce. The last five pages are in another, though contemporary
hand. Seven pages containing Gregory Nazianzen's heroic verses on the
Lord's genealogy, and others on His miracles and parables, partly in red,
precede {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ to St. Matthew; other such verses of Gregory precede SS.
Mark and Luke, and follow St. John, and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ stand before SS. Luke
and John. There are {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (no _lect._; and _Am._, _Eus._, only in
the open leaf containing Luke xii): in the Gospels there is a _prol._, and
no chapter divisions in the Acts, but a few capitals in red. Pretty
illuminations precede each book. (Greg. 536.)

*550. B.-C. II. 13 [xii], 7 x 5, ff. 143 (29), with poor arabesque
ornamentation, complete. _lect._, a few {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. by a later hand, as is also
much of _Am._, _Eus._, which are only partially inserted. (Greg. 537.)

*551. B.-C. II. 16 [xiii], 6-7/8 x 4-7/8, ff. ? _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-17; Luke

_Eus._, _pict._ (Greg. 539.)

*552. B.-C. II. 18 [xii], 6 x 4-3/8, ff. ?, very neat. The first leaf
forms part of a Lectionary: on the second the Gospels begin with Matt.

_men._ at the end, _lect._ in abundance, _pict._ of St. Mark washed out:
arabesques at the head of each book. (Greg. 538.)

*553 & *554. B.-C. II. 261 and 262 are two fragments of the Gospels,
whereof 261 comprises 27 leaves of St. Mark (19-21), covered with vile
modern scribbling (ch. iii. 21-iv. 13; 37-vii. 29; viii. 15-27; ix. 9-x.
5; 29-xii. 32) [xiii], 7-1/2 x 5-1/2, neat, with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._,
_lect._; and 262 consists of 48 leaves [xiv], 8-1/2 x 5-1/2, containing Matt.
xviii. 32-xxiv. 10; xxvi. 28-xxviii. 20; Mark i. 16-xiii. 9; xiv. 9-27,
with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ (_Eus._ only partially), _lect._ There are
many abridgements in the writing. Dated, perhaps by the first hand, A.D.
1323. (Greg. 540, 541.)

*555. B.-C. III. 4 [xiii], 7 x 5, ff. 264 (24), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,

53-v. 43; xi. 21-47, one leaf lost in each case, and one (John i. 51-ii.
22) misplaced in binding. This copy has John vii. 53-viii. 11 after Luke
xxi. 38, like Ferrar's four, with which its text much agrees, and the
titles to SS. Matthew and Mark only run {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} M ...

Mark, and John. This copy is remarkably free from _lect._ Neatly written,
but four considerable passages in St. Luke are omitted, the text running
on _uno tenore_. (Greg. 544.)

*558. B.-C. III. 10 [dated A.D. 1430], 8 x 5-1/2, ff. 374 (+ 16 + 34) (16),

{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _pict._, in a bad condition. (Greg. 546.)

The next two were purchased in 1876 of Quaritch for L120 and L50
respectively by Mr. Jonathan Peckover, and now belong to Miss Algerina
Peckover, of Bank House, Wisbech. Burgon examined them, and J. R. Harris
since then.

560. (Act. 222, Paul. 278.) Algerina Peckover (1) [xi], small 4to, ff. 239
(33), contains the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles in their usual Greek order,
"an exquisite specimen, in a somewhat minute character." It begins with a
picture of St. Matthew, the lost preliminary matter being prefixed
_chart._ by a later hand. _Pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._

_syn._, _men._ Bohn became possessed of it, whether from Meerman or not is
not known, and sold it to the Rev. Theodore Williams, Vicar of Hendon, for
L120. The Rev. Joseph Mendham bought it of Payne for L70 in 1827. It was
given by Mr. Mendham's widow to Dean Burgon for his life, afterwards to go
to the Bodleian Library, where the Rev. W. F. Rose brought it upon the
Dean's death. It is dated on the last leaf by a later hand, A.D. 1322. It
is evenly written in pale brown ink with a reed-pen. The last twenty
leaves contain the Gospels for Maundy Thursday, for Good Friday, and for
St. John's Day. The ornamentation is as fresh and bright as if done
yesterday, and its text is of the ordinary type, like lmnscr (Evann. 201,
542, 568). It is a very beautiful MS., and an excellent specimen in all
ways. (Greg. 521.)

Mr. James Woodhouse [d. 1866], Treasurer-General of the Ionian Islands,
while resident fifty years at Corfu, formed a collection of manuscripts
from monasteries in the Levant, which was sold in London in 1869, 1872,
1875. Among them were three copies of the Gospels, two Evangelistaria, one
copy of the Acts and St. Paul.

fair, but has suffered from damp, and has been sadly cropped by the
Western binder. _Mut._ John xx. 17. The headings of the Gospels are in
lake. It abounds in curious and unique liturgical notes, whereof Burgon
gives specimens, and it has textual corrections by the original scribe.
Collated by Rose. Bought by Burgon, then belonged to Rev. W. F. Rose, and
bought for the Museum in 1893. (Greg. 714.)

The ornamentation is
in lake, and at the end are extracts from Eulogius and Hesychius. Upon
collation by Mr. Rose it exhibits here and there suggestive discrepancies
from the common text. Evann. 563, 564 were respectively offered for sale
in 1871 for L50 and L40. Bought by Burgon, belonged to Rose, and purchased
for Museum in 1893. (Greg. 715.)

*565. Brit. Mus. Egerton 2784 [xii, Greg. xiv], 8-3/8 x 5-3/4, ff. 213

Woodhouse collection. It is beautifully written and of an uncommon type.
Its older binding suggests a Levantine origin. The readings are far more
interesting than those of Cod. 564, some of them being quite unique.
Belonged to Burgon, then Rose, then to the Museum in 1893. (Greg. 716.)

*566. hscr. Brit. Mus. Arund. 524 [xi], 6-3/4 x 5-1/4, ff. 218 (27), _Carp._,

was brought to England (with xscr and many others) by the great Earl of
Arundel in 1646. Henry Howard, Evelyn's Duke of Norfolk, presented them to
the Royal Society, from whose rooms at Somerset House they were
transferred to the Museum in 1831. (Greg. 476.)

567. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5538, described in the Harleian Catalogue as an
Evangelistarium, and numbered by Scholz Evst. 149, is a copy of the
Gospels [xiv, Greg. xii], 4-3/4 x 3-1/2, ff. 226 (23), _orn._, _lect._, _Am._
(Greg. 505.)

*568. nscr. (Paul. 259 or jscr.) Brit. Mus., Burney 18 (purchased in 1818,
with many other manuscripts, from the heirs of Dr. Charles Burney),
contains the Gospels and two leaves of St. Paul (Hebr. xii. 17-xiii. 25),
written by one Joasaph A.D. 1366, 12-3/4 x 9, ff. 222 (23) + 9 blank, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.

in gold letters. Codd. lmn (542, 201, 568) agree pretty closely. (Greg.
480.)

*569. oscr. Brit. Mus. Burn. 19 [x], 8-1/2 x 7, ff. 217 (22), _pict._ (Plate
iii, No. 8), in the Escurial as late as 1809, is singularly void of the
usual apparatus. (Greg. 481.)

*570. pscr. Brit. Mus. Burn. 20 [A.D. 1285, Indict. 13, altered into 985,
whose indiction is the same], 7-1/2 x 6, ff. 317 (22, 23), written by a monk
Theophilus: _pict._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._,
_syn._, _men._, the two last in a later hand, which has made many
corrections: this copy is quite equal in value to Cod. cscr (511), and
often agrees closely with wscr (507). (Greg. 482.)

*571. rscr. Brit. Mus. Burn. 21, by the same scribe as Cod. 543 [A.D.
1292], 13 x 10, ff. 258 (24), on cotton paper in a beautiful but formed
hand (see Plate vi, No. 15), _syn._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _prol._, _orn._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,

Codd. 543 and 571 differ only in 183 places. (Greg. 484.)

*572. sscr. Brit. Mus. Burn. 23 [xii], 7-3/4 x 6, ff. 230 (23-25), boldly
but carelessly written, ends John viii. 14: _mut._ Luke v. 22-ix. 32; xi.

_syn._, _men._ It was "John Jackson's book, bought of Conant in Fleet
Street, 1777, for five guineas." _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-vi. 18, and the last
leaf of St. Luke (xxiv. 47-53). This copy has the subscriptions at the end
of each of the Gospels of SS. Matthew and Mark. There is a probable
reference to them at the end of St. John ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}). It is coarsely written
on thick vellum, with much _lect._ in vermilion. The breathings and
accents are remarkably incorrect. (Greg. 686.)

_subscr._, most elegantly and correctly written, purchased in 1838, and
said to come from Caesarea Philippi at the foot of Lebanon. Contains
_scholia_: the text is broken up into paragraphs. (Re-examined by
Bloomfield.) There is a beautiful facsimile page in the new "Catalogue of
Ancient Manuscripts in the British Museum" (1881), Plate 16. (Greg. 478.)

Epistles, beautifully written in a minute hand and adorned with gold
letters, contains Evan., Act., Cath., Paul., Psalms, &c. _Mut._ Mark i.
1-28; Acts i. 1-23; vii. 8-39; Ps. i. 1-3. Akin to Cod. 440 in St. Paul
(Vansittart). (Greg. 491.)

_lect._, _Am._, _Eus._, _syn._, _men._, in a minute hand, bought (as was
Cod. 582) of Captain C. K. Macdonald in 1846. The two came probably from
Sinai, where he once saw Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}. (Greg. 495.)

582. (Act. 227, Paul. 279.) Brit. Mus. Add. 16,184 [xiii or xiv], 7-1/2 x

from Patmos. F. V. J. Arundell, British Chaplain at Smyrna (1834),
describes this copy, given him by Mr. Borrell, and a Lectionary sold to
him at the same time, in his "Discoveries in Asia Minor," vol. ii. p. 268.
He there compares it with the beautiful Cod. Ebnerianus (Evan. 105), which
it very slightly resembles, being larger and far less elegant. _Mut._

viii. 6, and was purchased in 1853 from the well-known Constantine
Simonides (Greg. 502)--as was also

The foregoing Additional MSS. in the British Museum were examined and
collated (apparently only in select passages) by Dr. S. T. Bloomfield for
his "Critical Annotations on the Sacred Text" (1860), designed as a
Supplement to the ninth edition of his Greek Testament, and comprising an
_opus supremum et ultimum_, the last effort of a long and honourable
literary career. He has passed under review no less than seventy
manuscripts of the New Testament, twenty-three at Lambeth, the rest in the
British Museum. The following have been accumulated since his time.

Neophytus a monk of Cyprus, was bought at Milos by H. O. Coxe of a Greek

{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._ (in gold), _pict._ (John), was found in a village near
Corinth, and bought of C. L. Merlin, our Vice-Consul at Athens, in 1865.
Beautifully written in very black ink, the first page of each Gospel being

Gage's sale, 1868, rough and dirty, with many marginal notes to supply
omissions. St. Matthew's Gospel is wholly lost. No _pict._, but
ornamentation in faded lake. (Greg. 698.)

603. (Act. 231, Paul. 266 and 271.) Brit. Mus. Add. 28,815 [x or xi], 11-1/2
x 8-1/2, ff. 302 (30), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _pict._,
sumptuously bound with silver-gilt plates. This noble fragment was bought
(as were Act. 232, Evst. 279, 280) of Sir Ivor B. Guest in 1871, and
contains the Gospels, Acts, Catholic Epistles, Romans, 1, 2 Corinthians,
Galatians, the rest of the original volume being evidently torn out of the
book when already bound. In the same year 1871 the Baroness Burdett-Coutts
also imported from Janina in Epirus sixty-seven leaves containing the rest
of St. Paul's Epistles and the Apocalypse (B.-C. II. 4, Paul. 266, Apoc.
89), which fragments were described in the second edition of the present
book. Mr. Edward A. Guy, of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, U.S.A., on
examining the Museum fragment in 1875 with my book in his hand, concluded
that the two portions originally formed one magnificent copy of the whole
New Testament, and when I brought the two together, I saw that the
illuminated heading and initial capital on the first page of B.-C. II. 4
(Eph. i) was worked off through damp on the _verso_ of the last leaf (302)
of the Museum copy, and the red {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. of Gal. vi on the top of B.-C. II. 4,
leaf one, _recto_. In the larger fragment we find two _pict._ of St. Luke
(one of them before the Acts), one of St. John, with illuminated headings.
_Carp._, _Eus. t._, &c. must have perished, as the first page opens with
Matt. i. 1. It has {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}. in gold letters on purple vellum, a Harmony at
the foot of fol. 17 b-18 b, and many brief marginal scholia. _See_ Paul.
266 (B.-C. II. 4), which is at present five miles off, in the Library of
Sir Roger Cholmeley's School, Highgate. (Greg. 699.)

604. Brit. Mus. Egerton 2610 [xii], 5-3/4 x 4-1/4, ff. 297 (19), about thirty
letters to a line, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ (Matt., Mark, Luke),
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _Am._, _Eus._, _pict._ (beautifully executed). First noticed by
Dean Burgon, bought for the Museum in 1882, and collated by Mr. H. C.
Hoskier, "Full Account, &c.," D. Nutt, 1890. According to Mr. Hoskier's
analysis it contains no less than 270 quite unique readings, siding at
least twenty times alone with D, eleven with B, six with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, six with Evan.
1, twenty-nine with Evan. 473. It has 2724 variations from T. R. There are
besides a vast number of almost unique readings, e.g. Luke xi. 2, for
which Greg. Nyss. is about the only authority (Hoskier). (Greg. 700.)

605. (Act. 233, Paul. 243, Apoc. 106.) Zittaviensis A. 1 [xv], _chart._,
ff. 775 (30), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., _vers._,
given to the Senate of Zittau (Lusatian Saxony) in 1620, contains the
canonical books of the Old Testament down to Esther, with 1 Esdras, 4
Maccabees, Judith, Tobit, and the whole New Testament. Matthaei collated
the Old Testament portion for Dean Holmes's edition of the Septuagint
(Cod. 44), and saw its great critical value. It was examined, as so many
others have been, by Dr. C. R. Gregory. (Greg. 664.)

The next two were bought for the Bodleian in 1882: they came from
Constantinople.

608. Brit. Mus. Add. 11,859-60 (palimpsest) is a Typicum or Rituale [xiv
or xv], 10 x 7-3/4, ff. 39 + 29 (uncertain), from the Butler collection,
having written under it an earlier cursive text [xiii] containing, in
11,859, Matt. xii. 33-xiii. 7; xvi. 21-xvii. 15; xx. 1-15; 15-xxi. 5; Mark
x. 45-xi. 17: 198 verses; and in 11,860, only twenty-seven verses of the

&c.), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _prol._, _subscr._ This must be Scholz's 1673 (N. T.,
vol. i. p. cxix), but it contains the Gospels only, not the Acts, as he
supposes. (Greg. 552.)

610. Oxf. Bodl. Barocc. 59 [xi], 8-1/4  5-1/2, ff. 6 (21), 1 _chart._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.

612. B.-C. I. 11 [xii], 3-1/2 x 2-1/2, ff. 112 (25-28), is a very small and
beautiful {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, containing the Magnificat and Benedictus, besides the

1-14; Deut. xxxii. 14-43), of Hannah (1 Sam. ii), of Habakkuk (ch. iii),
Isaiah (ch. xxvi), Jonah (ch. ii), with that of the Three Holy Children.
Many such books are extant, of which this is inserted in our list as a
specimen. _See_ 5pe, note.

John Belsheim, editor of the Codex Aureus, found at Upsal in 1875, and

The Rev. H. O. Coxe, late Bodley's Librarian, though quite unable to
purchase any of the literary treasures he was commissioned to inspect in
1857, added considerably by his research to our knowledge of manuscripts
in the East. A list of them was given in groups by Dr. Scrivener in the
third edition of this work: but for various reasons they will be found
separately placed amongst the ensuing MSS., to fill up gaps which have
been since discovered in the supplementary list of cursive manuscripts
that was bound up in the beginning of the last edition.

The Evann. 622-735 were reported to Dean Burgon from several Libraries in
reply to his sedulous enquiries. Upon subsequent examination by Dr. C. R.
Gregory on the spot, many of them were seen not to be Evangelia, but
instead of that commentaries of St. Chrysostom, or other commentaries, or
Evangelistaria, or MSS. containing other matter. Thus--including the list
of the Abbe Martin, who extended Dean Burgon's numeration up to 776--the
following must be excised: 643-665, 667, 673, 677-679, 681, 682, 685, 686,
688, 689, 695, 700-702, 706, 711, 712, 715-722, 724-728 (including 726
which Dr. Scrivener noticed as a duplication of 611), 731, 733, 734, 758,
760, 763, 771, 772, 775, 776. Gregory, Prolegomena, pp. 794, 795. The
editor has inserted other MSS. in their places, being especially those
found by the late Rev. H. O. Coxe in his travels, and enumerated in his

CHAPTER IX. CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS. PART III.


We have now come to Dr. Gregory's list, where Dr. Scrivener's and the Abbe
Martin's have ceased, and shall follow it, except in the case of MSS.
which have been already recorded, and which therefore must be replaced by
other MSS. Whenever no independent information is at hand, the MS. will be
simply noted, and the reader is referred to Dr. Gregory's "Prolegomena"
under the same number. Information from other sources than Dr. Gregory's
book will in each case, where the Editor has discovered it, be duly given.
Whenever no reference is made to Dr. Gregory's list, the numbers in both
lists are the same.

The particulars added to MSS. at Athens are taken from the Catalogue by K.
Alcibiades I. Sakkelion, obligingly lent me with others by Mr. J. Rendel
Harris; but the press-marks of the MSS. have apparently been changed since
Dr. Gregory examined them, and I have not succeeded in obtaining
information upon this point. I have therefore identified the MSS. as best
I could, and have inserted queries when there seemed to be doubt. The
number in brackets is the present press-mark. The two measurements often
differ; I have followed that of Sakkelion.

CHAPTER X. CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE ACTS AND CATHOLIC EPISTLES.


*1. (Evan. 1.)

2. (Paul. 2.) Basil. Univ. A. N. iv. 4 (formerly B. ix. 38) [xiii or xiv
Burgon], 5-7/8 x 3-7/8, ff. 216 (27), with short Introductions to the
books, once belonged to the Preaching Friars, then to Amerbach, a printer
of Basle. Erasmus grounded on this copy, in some passages with some
alterations of the MS., the text of his first edition (1516), and he calls
it "exemplar mire castigatum." His binder cut off a considerable part of
the margin (Hoskier). It is Mill's B. 2 (Battier, Wetstein).

3. (Evan. 3.)

4. (Paul. 4.) Basil. A. N. iv. 5 (formerly B. x. 20) [xv], 6-1/8 x 4-3/8,
ff. 287 (18), Mill's B. 3, badly written by several hands, and full of
contractions: the Pauline Epistles preceding the Catholic. Erasmus made
some use of this copy and of its marginal readings (e.g. Acts viii. 37;
xv. 34; xxiv. 6-8) for forming his text (Battier, Wetstein).

5. (Evan. 5.)

6. (Evan. 6.)

7. (Paul. 9.) Paris, Nat. Gr. 102 [x, Greg. xi, Omont xii], 7-1/4 x 5-7/8,
ff. 390 (20), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _pict._, seems to be Stephen's
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}, although {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} is cited in error Luke v. 19; John ii. 17: it nearly
resembles Cod. 5 and the Latin version. In this copy, and in Paul. H, 12,
17, 20, 137, Mr. Vansittart re-collated the beginning of the Epistle to
the Hebrews.

8. (Paul. 10.) Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}, now missing, cited about 400 times by that
editor, in 276 of which it supports the Latin versions (Mill, N. T.,
Proleg.  1171). Stephen cites {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} (apparently in error) four times in the
Gospels, once in the Apocalypse (Matt. x. 8; 10; xii. 32; John ii. 17;
Apoc. xiii. 4).

9. (Paul. 11.) Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Kk. 6. 4 [xi], 6-3/4 x 4-3/4, ff. 247
(22), _lect._ _Mut._ Acts iii. 6-17; 1 Tim. iv. 12-2 Tim. iv. 3; Heb. vii.
20-xi. 10; xi. 23-end. Bp. Marsh has fully proved that this copy, which
once belonged to Stephen's friend Vatablus, Professor of Hebrew at Paris,
is his {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}. This copy also is twice quoted by Stephen in the Gospels
(Matt. xxvii. 64; John ii. 17), through mere oversight. Dr. Hort states
that it is rich in detached readings in Cath. Epp., not in Acts or Paul.

10. (Paul. 12, Apoc. 2.) Par. Nat. Gr. 237, Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} [x], 8-1/8 x
6-3/8, ff. 246 (28), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.,
neatly written, with scholia and other matter. Le Long identified this,
and about five other of Stephen's manuscripts: its value in the Apocalypse
is considerable (Wetstein, Scholz).

11. (Paul. 140.) Par. Nat. Gr. 103 [x, Greg. xi], 8-1/2 x 6-3/4, ff. 333(18),

commentary on the Apocalypse, and OEcumenius' on the other books. Like
Evann. 16, 19, 317, it once belonged to the Medici: in 1518 it was given
by the Greek Janus Lascar to "Petro Masieli" of Constance, and was used by
Donatus of Verona for an edition of OEcumenius (Wetstein, Scholz).

Act. 16-18), compared with Pamphilus' revision, _prol._, and a commentary
digested by Andreas, a priest (Wetstein).

Pauline Epistles precede the Acts and Catholic Epistles. Casley notices

Tit. i. 9-ii. 15; Philem. ii-end of Hebrews. _Prol._ to Pauline Epistles
only, copy is Mill's _Lu_., but he forgot to name it in his Prolegomena.
It was re-discovered and collated by Wetstein, and is probably Bentley's Q
(Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, p. xxix). John Berriman, in the manuscript
notes to his own copy of his "Critical Dissertation on 1 Tim. iii. 16"
(1741), which he presented to the British Museum in 1761, tells us that
this codex [then Cant. 495] was identified "by several collations of many
texts by different hands (Professor Francklin and others), and by other
circumstances" to have been Professor Luke's (MS. note on p. 104).

beginning Acts xi. 13, ending Apoc. xx. 1: the opening chapters are
supplied in a late hand. Tregelles calls this "a very obscure manuscript."
With scholia on the Epistles, and a full and unique commentary on the
Apocalypse, edited by J. A. Cramer, 1840 (Mill, Caspar Wetstein,
Griesbach). This copy is Bentley's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~} in Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 5 (_see_

some leaves of this fine copy are torn or decayed: there are also many
changes by a later hand (Mill's Cant. 2, Scrivener's 1): unpublished
collations were made by Bentley (Trin. Coll. Camb. B. xvii. 10, 11), and
by Jo. Wigley for Jackson (Jesus Coll. Camb. O. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}. 1).

_Mut._ Acts i. 1-11; 1 Cor. xi. 7-xv. 56. This copy and the next bear
Covell's emblem "_Luceo,_" and the date Constantinople, 1675, but he got
Act. 27 from Adrianople. (Mill, Paulus in Acts i-iii Bloomfield.)

27. (Paul. 33.) Brit. Mus. Harl. 5620 [xv], 8-1/4 x 6, ff. 134 (22),

the writing is small and abbreviated (Mill, Griesbach, Bloomfield).

28. (Paul. 34, Apoc. 8.) Brit. Mus. Harl. 5778, is Covell's 5 or Sinai
manuscript(269) [xii], 8-3/4 x 6-1/2, ff. 156 (30), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _lect._,

Bloomfield for Act., Paul., Scrivener's d for Apoc.).

29. (Paul. 35.) Geneva, Libr. 20 [xi or xii], 5-3/8 x 4, ff. 269 (18),

the East by Bp. Huntington, beginning Acts xv. 19, but 3 John, Jude, the
Apocalypse, and St. Paul's Epistles (which stand last) are in a somewhat
earlier hand than the rest. (Mill's Hunt. 1.)

presented in 1483 by Robert Flemmyng, Dean of Lincoln, a beautiful and
interesting codex, with _pict._, _prol._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._, and the
numbers of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} noted in the subscriptions. _Mut._ 2 Pet. i. 1-15;
Rom. i. 1-20 (Walton's Polyglott, Mill, Dobbin "Cod. Montfort.," who
regards it as the manuscript from which this portion of the latter was
mainly copied). The Epistle of Jude stands between James and 1 Peter.
Vansittart notes its affinity in text with Act. 13.

(N. T., Proleg.  1390), and edited by Cramer, Oxford, 1838 (Walton's
Polyglott, Mill).

37. (Paul. 43.) Oxf. New Coll. 37 (59) [xiii], 9-1/4 x 6-5/8, ff. 298 (20),
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., perhaps a little later than Cod. 36,
erroneously described by Walton, and after him by Wetstein, as part of
Evan. 58, a much later manuscript. Heb. xiii. 21-25 is supplied in a
recent hand. It is a beautiful copy, with marginal glosses (Walton's
Polyglott, Mill, Dobbin).

*38. (Paul. 44.) Lugduno-Batav. 77, Voss. Gr. Q. 2 [xiii], 7-1/4 x 5-1/4, ff.

belonging to Petavius, a Councillor of Paris, given by Queen Christina to
Is. Vossius (Mill, Wetstein, Dermout 1825).

39. (Paul. 45, Apoc. 11.) Petavii 2, age and present locality not stated.
_Mut._ Acts i. 1-xviii. 22; James i. 1-v. 17; 3 John 9-Jude 25; 1 Cor.
iii. 16-x. 13 (Extracts in Mill; J. Gachon).

40. (Paul. 46, Apoc. 12.) Vat. Reg. Gr. 179 [xi], 9-7/8 x 7-1/2, ff. 169

with a mixed text and the end of Titus (from ch. iii. 3), Philemon, and
the Apocalypse in a later hand. This copy, given by Christina to Alexander
VIII (1689-91), is of considerable importance, and, as containing all
Euthalius' labours on the Acts and the Epistles, was largely used by Laur.
Zacagni for his edition of the Prologues, &c., of Euthalius (Extracts in
Mill, Zacagni, Birch; Griesbach adds, "Gagnaeus eundem sub Dionysiani
nomine laudasse creditur").

41. (Evan. 175.)

*42. (Paul. 48, Apoc. 13, Evst. 287, Apost. 56.) Frankfort on the Oder
Gymnasium, once Seidel's [xi], 8-1/8 x 5-7/8, ff. 302 (23), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._, carelessly written, with some rare readings. _Mut._ Acts
ii. 3-34 (xxvii. 19-34 is in a later hand); 2 Pet. i. 1, 2; 1 John v.
11-21; Apoc. xviii. 3-13 (N. Westermann, H. Middeldorpf). One leaf of a
Lectionary is added, containing Matt. xvii. 16-23; 1 Cor. ix. 2-12. This
copy often agrees closely with the Complutensian text and Laud. 81 (Evan.
51) jointly.

43. (Evan. 76.)

44. (Like Evan. 82, Paul. 51, Apoc. 5) certain manuscripts cited by
Laurentius Valla. Dr. Hort's Cod. 44 is B.-C. III. 37, which is our Act.
221, Paul. 265.

45. (Paul. 52, Apoc. 16.) Hamburg, City Library, Cod. Gr. 1252 [xv], 7-7/8
x 5-7/8, ff. 268 (22), _chart._, _prol._ With its companion Cod. M of St.
Paul's Epistles, it was lent to Wetstein in 1717 and to Bengel, by Z. C.
Uffenbach. It once belonged to Jo. Ciampini at Rome, is carelessly
written, but from a good text: "plura genuina omittens, quam aliena
admiscens," Bengel.

46. (Paul. 55.) Monacensis Reg. 375 [xi, Greg. x], 12-1/2 x 9-3/8, ff. 381
(40), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. (marked peculiarly in archaic fashion--J. R. Harris--e.g. 1 Cor.
{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}), is Bengel's Augustan. 6, with OEcumenius' commentary and some rare
readings (Bengel, Matthaei, Scholz). All the Augsburg MSS. of the N. T.
(_see_  Evann. 83, 426-8, Paul. 54, 125, 126) were removed to Munich in
1806.

47. (Evan. 90.)

48. (Evan. 105.)

49. (Evan. 92.)

50. (Paul. 8.) Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}' is unknown, though it was once in the Royal
Library at Paris; that is, if Evan. 8, Reg. 49, is Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} in the
Gospels, which Mr. Vansittart seems to have proved. Stephen seldom cites
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}, or (as Mill puts the case) "textus ipsius fere universus absorptus est
in hac editione" (N. T., Proleg.  1167). _See_ Evan. 8.

51. (Paul. 133, Apoc. 52.) Paris, Nat. Gr. 56, once Mazarin's [xii], 10 x
6-3/8, ff. 375 (23), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._, _subscr._ _Mut._ Apoc. xxii.
17-21.

52. (Paul. 50.) Cod. Rhodiensis, some of whose readings Stunica, the chief
of the Complutensian editors, cites in controversy with Erasmus: it may
have been his own property, and cannot now be identified. Whatever Mill
states (on 1 John iii. 16), it is not now at Alcala.

*53. (Paul. 30.) Camb. Emman. Coll. i. 4. 35 [xii], 3-3/4 x 3, ff. 214 (24),
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., the writing being among the minutest and
most elegant extant. It is Mill's Cant. 3, Scrivener's n (a facsimile is
given Plate xii. No. 33), and is in bad condition, in parts almost
illegible. It begins 2 Pet. ii. 4, and there is a hiatus from 1 John iii.
20 to the middle of OEcumenius' Prologue to the Romans: _mut._ also 1 Cor.
xi. 7-xv. 56, and ends Heb. xi. 27. From 1 Tim. vi. 5 another and far less
careful hand begins: but the manuscript exhibits throughout many
abbreviations. Has some marginal notes _prima manu_. Given to the College
"in Testimonium grati animi" by Sam. Wright, a member of the College, in
1598.

54. (Evan. 43.) Paris, Arsenal Libr. The second volume of this book
(containing the Acts and all the Epistles on 189 leaves) is judged by the
present librarian to be a little more modern than the first volume. They
were both "ex dono R. P. de Berzian" (sic) to the Oratory of San
Maglorian.

55. Readings of a _second_ copy of St. Jude contained in Cod. 47.
Tischendorf, in his eighth edition, cites this copy in Acts xvi. 6,
apparently by mistake.

56. (Paul. 227.) Oxf. Bodl. E. D. Clarke 4 [xii], 9 x 6, ff. 220 (27),
_prol._ (names and miracles of Apostles, &c.), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._,
_subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., _syn._ (extracts, &c. by Dean Gaisford).

(This number was assigned by Wetstein and Griesbach to certain readings of
four Medicean manuscripts (only one in the Acts), which, like those of No.
102 of the Gospels, were found by Wetstein in the margin of Rapheleng's
Plantin Greek Testament (1591). Identical with Act. 84, 87-89.--Birch,
Scholz.)

ff. 57 (23), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ in St. James. This has been called the most
important cursive copy of the Acts [but is much overrated--Ed.], was
formerly called 1oti (pscr), discovered by Tischendorf in Egypt in 1853,
and sold to the Trustees of the British Museum in 1854, was written by one
John, a monk, with rubrical marks added in a later hand. _Mut._ ch. iv.
8-vii. 17; xvii. 28-xxiii. 9; 297 verses. Independent collations have been
made by Tischendorf (Anecd. sacra et prof., pp. 7, 8, 130-46), by
Tregelles, and by Scrivener (Cod. Augiensis, Introd., pp. lxviii-lxx). Its
value is shown not so much by the readings in which it stands alone, as
_by its agreement with the oldest uncial copies_, where their testimonies
coincide. ((Paul. 61) comprised extracts made by Griesbach from the margin
of a copy of Mill's N. T. in the Bodleian (_see_ Evan. 236), where certain
readings are cited under the notation _Hal._ These are now known to be
taken from Evan. 440, Act. 111, Paul. 221, or Scrivener's v of the
Gospels, o of the Acts and Epistles--Tischendorf, Tregelles.)

have made corrections, which Griesbach regarded as far more valuable than
the text (cited by him 66**). _Mut._ Apoc. xv. 6-xvii. 3; xviii. 10-xix.
9; xx. 8-xxii. 21. It once belonged to Arsenius Archbishop of Monembasia

68. (Paul. 73.) Upsal. Univ. Gr. 1, 9 x 6-3/4, ff. 220 (38), is in fact two
separate manuscripts bound together, both of high value. The first part
[xii] contains the Acts (commencing ch. viii. 14), Rom., 1 Cor. to ch. xv.
38: the second [xi] begins 1 Cor. xiii. 6, and extends through the Pauline
and Catholic Epistles, which follow them. In the text of St. Paul it much
resembles Paul. 17. A catena is annexed, which is an abridgement of
OEcumenius, and the portion in duplicate (1 Cor. xiii. 6-xv. 38) has
contradictory readings (P. F. Aurivill [Orville?], 1786). It was bought at
Venice by Sparvenfeldt in 1678 (Belsheim).

remarkable text, and has many marginal readings and _prol._ (Knittel,
Matthaei).

All from 70 to 96 were slightly collated by Birch, and except 81, 93-6 by
Scholz also.

Epistles.

This codex has 1
John v. 7, 8 in the margin, by a recent hand. Tregelles suggests that this
is probably the same copy as Cod. 83, the readings ascribed to it being
extracted from the margin of that manuscript.

Greg. xiv and xv], 9-1/2 x 6-1/2, ff. 229 (27), (Hoskier), bought at Meerman's
sale in 1824 by the late Sir T. Phillipps, Bart., of Middle Hill,
Worcestershire. The Pauline Epistles are written smaller than the rest,
but in the same clear hand. _lect._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. (but not in
the Apocalypse), flourished rubric capitals. Scrivener in 1856 fully
collated Apoc. (whose text is valuable), the rest slightly. It is sadly
mutilated; it begins Acts iv. 24; _mut._ Acts v. 2-16; vi. 2-vii. 2;
16-viii. 10; 38-ix. 13; 26-39; x. 9-22; 43-xiii. 1; xxiii. 32-xxiv. 24;

179. (Paul. 128, Apoc. 82.) Munich, Royal Libr. 211 [xi, Delitzsch xiii],
10-5/8 x 8-3/8, ff. 227 (25), _lect._, _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}, Dorotheus'
treatise (_see_ Act. 89), fragments of _Eus. t._, and (in a later hand)
marginal scholia to St. Paul. Belonged to Zomozerab, the Bohemian. The
text is very near that commonly received. The portion of this manuscript
which contains the Apocalypse is described by Delitzsch, Handschriftliche
Funde, Leipzig, 1862, pp. 45-48, with a facsimile of Apoc. viii. 12, 13.

180. (Evan. 431.) Important, but seems to have perished in 1870 at
Strasburg.

181. (Evan. 400(273).)

The following codices also are described by Scrivener, Cod. Augiens.,
Introd. pp. lv-lxiv, and their collations given in the Appendix.

*182. ascr (Paul. 252). Lond. Lambeth 1182 [xii, Greg. xiii], 10-1/2 x
6-7/8, ff. 397 (20), _chart._, brought (as were also 183-6) by Carlyle
from a Greek island. A later hand [xiv] supplied Acts i. 1-xii. 3; xiii.
5-15; 2, 3 John, Jude. In this copy and 183 the Pauline Epistles precede
the Catholic. _lect._, _pict._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _prol._, _syn._, _men._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} for Easter, and other foreign matter. The various
readings are interesting, and strongly resemble those of Cod. 69 of the
Acts, and Cod. 61 hardly less, especially in Acts xiii-xvii. This is
Hort's Cod. 110. (Greg. 214.)

*183. bscr (Paul. 253). Lond. Lamb. 1183 [A.D. 1358], 10 x 7, ff. 236
(27), _chart._, _mut._ 1 Cor. xi. 7-27; 1 Tim. iv. 1-v. 8. _Syn._,
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _mut._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._, in a beautiful hand,
with many later corrections. (Greg. 215.)

*184. cscr (Paul. 254). Lond. Lamb. 1184 [xv], 4to, _chart._, _mut._ Acts
vii. 52-viii. 25. Having been restored in 1817 (Evan. 516), its readings
(which, especially in the Acts and Catholic Epistles, are very important)
are taken from an excellent collation (Lamb. 1255, 10-14) made for Carlyle
about 1804 by the Rev. W. Sanderson of Morpeth. The text much resembles
that of Act. 61, and is almost identical with that of B.-C. III. 37 (Act.
221) and of Act. 137. This is Hort's Cod. 112. (Greg. 216.)

*185. dscr (Paul. 255). Lond. Lamb. 1185 [xiv ?], 8-3/4 x 5-3/4, ff. 209
(23-5), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., _lect._, _subscr._, _men._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}.,

to a tolerable collation of Acts i. 1-xxvii. 12, made by the Rev. John
Fenton for Carlyle (Lamb. 1255, 27-33). In its text it much resembles Cod.

The Baroness Burdett-Coutts has three copies of the Acts, two of the
Catholic Epistles, viz.:

*219. B.-C. II. 7 (Evan. 549). (Greg. 201.)

*220. (Paul. 264.) B.-C. III. 1, Acts and all the Epistles, the Pauline
preceding the Catholic [xi or xii], 11-1/2 x 8, ff. 375 (22), on fine
vellum, with broad margins. This is one of the most superb copies extant
of the latter part of the N. T., on which so much cost was seldom bestowed
as on the Gospels. The illuminations before each book, the golden titles,
subscriptions, and capitals, are very rich and fresh: the rubrical
directions are in bright red at the top and bottom of the pages. The
preliminary matter consists of _syn._ of the Apostolos, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} to the
Acts, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~},
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._ of the Acts, in all twenty pages. There are no other tables of
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, but their {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. are given throughout the manuscript.
To each Epistle is prefixed the ordinary {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or _prol._, _vers._, and
to eight of them Theodoret's also. Three leaves at the beginning of
Epistles (containing portions of _prol._ and 2 Cor. i. 1-3; Eph. i. 1-4;
Heb. i. 1-6) have been shamefully cut out for the sake of the
illuminations. A complete menology of eighteen pages closes the volume. At
the end of Jude we find in golden letters _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}_ _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}_ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH VARIA~}

*221. (Paul. 265.) B.-C. III. 37 [xii], 6 x 4, 270 (20) + 6 _membran._
[xiv or later], and _chart._ [xv] (beginning and end), _men._, _lect._,
_subscr._, contains the Acts, Catholic and Pauline Epistles complete. This
copy is full of instructive variations, being nearest akin to the
Harkleian Syriac _cum asterisco_ and to cscr (184), then to ascr (182),
137, 100, 66**, 69, dscr (185) next to 27, 29, 57**. (Greg. 224.)

written and bound in the original oak boards. After being offered for L60
in London from 1869 to 1875, it was bought by Dean Burgon, and, like Evan.
563, passed to his nephew, the Rev. W. F. Rose, and was obtained for the
Museum in 1893. _Prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}. and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., _subscr._,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., _syn._, _men._, at the beginning, but it has been ill used, and the
text corrected by an unskilful hand. Its faded ornaments were executed in
lake. (Greg. 229.)

603) of Sir Ivor Guest in 1871. A facsimile is exhibited in the
Palaeographical Society's work, Plate 84. It begins with Euthalii {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
of the chapters of the Acts. Euthalius' Prologue also precedes the Pauline
Epistles, and that of Arethas ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}) the Apocalypse, with a

3-vi. 16) is supplied [xv] _chart._ There are ten leaves at the end

7. Basil. A. N. iii. 11, 11-1/4 x 8-1/2, ff. 387 (11), _prol._, with notes and
a finely written marginal commentary, ends Heb. xii. 18. But Rom., 1, 2
Cor. are in a different hand. It is plain that Erasmus must have used this
copy, cf. Rom. v. 21; vi. 19; viii. 35; xv. 31; xvi. 22; 1 Cor. xi. 15; 2
Cor. v. 4; ix. 8; 12; Gal. i. 6; iii. 27; Phil. iii. 9; Col. i. 6; iii.
17; 1 Thess. i. 7; Tit. iii. 8; Philem. 15; Heb. v. 4; vii. 5, in all
which places it countenances peculiar readings of his first edition. It
contained {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~} in Rom. iv. 4, but not {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} in Heb. xi. 13

20. Par. Nat. Coislin. Gr. 27, described (as is Cod. 23) by Montfaucon
[x], 13-3/4 x 10-1/2, ff. 252 (39), in bad condition, with _prol._ and a
catena, from Laura at Athos (Wetstein). _See_ Act. 7.

commentary: Rom. and 1, 2 Cor. are wanting (Wetstein, 1716). Bradshaw
found that this manuscript, which came to Cambridge in 1574, is only the
second part of Paul. 42, the last quire of the latter being numbered {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~},
while the first in Cod. 27 is {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}. Hort's Paul. 27 is kscr or Paul. 260.

47. Oxf. Bodl. Roe 16 [xi], 11-3/8 x 8-1/2, ff. 255 (15), _prol._,
_subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., with a Patristic catena, in a small and beautiful hand,
having a text much resembling that of Cod. A, and Cod. B still more often
when the two stand alone: its history is the same as that of Evan. 49. The
Epistle to the Hebrews precedes 1 Tim. (Mill, Roe 2, Tregelles for his
edition of the N. T.: inspected by Vansittart.)

53 of Wetstein is now Paul. Cod. M, the portion containing the Hebrews, or
Bengel's Uffenbach 2 or 1. Instead-- (Evan. 1149.) (Greg. 336.)

54. Monacensis Reg. Gr. 412 [xii], 11-7/8 x 8-3/8, ff. 358 (24), is
Bengel's August. 5 (_see_ Act. 46), containing Rom. vii. 7-xvi. 24, with a
catena from twenty Greek authors (_see_ Paul. 127), stated by Bengel to
resemble that in the Bodleian described by Mill (N. T., Proleg.  1448).

55. (Act. 46.)

56. This is worthless as being a transcript of Erasmus' first edition,
then just published. Instead-- (Evan. 1262.)

*57. (Evan. 218.)

58. Rom. Vat. Gr. 1650(274) = Act. 156, Paul. 190. Instead-- (Act. 416.)

59. Par. Nat. Coisl. Gr. 204 [xi], 11 x 8-7/8, ff. 312 (32). _Mut._ Rom.,
1 Cor., 2 Cor. is in the 3rd of 3 vols. _See_ Cramer's Catena. (Greg.)
Wetstein and Griesbach comprise readings of two Medicean manuscripts of
the Ephes. and Philipp., derived from the same source as Evan. 102, Act.
56, Apoc. 23.

60. Codices cited in the Correctorium Bibliorum Latinorum.

*61. (Act. 61.)

64 of Griesbach is the portion of Evan. M. Instead-- (Act. 417.)

65. (Act. 62.)

66. Lond. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5552 [xvi], 6-1/2 x 4-1/4, ff. 233 (18). This
number included readings extracted by Griesbach from the margin of this
MS., which itself he considers but a transcript of Erasmus' first edition
(Symb. Crit., p. 166).

67. (Act. 66.) 67** resembles Cod. B, yet is independent of it (Eph. iii.
9, iv. 9, &c.). "These marginal readings must have been derived from a MS.
having a text nearly akin to that of the fragmentary MS. called M, though
not from M itself" (Hort, Introduction, p. 155).

68. (Act. 63.)

69. (Act. 64.)

Titus; Philem.; with
Hebrews before 1 Tim. It includes a commentary and catechetical lectures
of St. Cyril of Jerusalem (Alter, Birch, Greg.).

_subscr._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}., with OEcumenius' commentary. The Epistle to the Hebrews
is wanting.

CHAPTER XII. CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE APOCALYPSE.


1. Mayhingen, Oettingen-Wallerstein [xii], 9-1/8 x 5-7/8, ff. 90 (15 last
_chart._), the only one used in 1516 by Erasmus (who calls it "exemplar
vetustissimum") and long lost, contains the commentary of Andreas of
Caesarea, in which the text is so completely imbedded that great care is
needed to separate the one from the other. _Mut._ ch. xxii. 16-21, ending
with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}_. This manuscript was happily re-discovered in 1861 by
Professor F. Delitzsch at Mayhingen in Bavaria in the library of the
Prince of Oettingen-Wallerstein, and a critical account of it published by
him (illustrated by a facsimile) in the first part of his
"Handschriftliche Funde" (1861). Tregelles also, in the second part of the
same work, published an independent collation of his own (with valuable
'Notes' prefixed), which he had made at Erlangen in 1862. The identity of
Apoc. 1 with the recovered copy is manifest from such _monstra_ as
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} ch. ii. 3, which is found in both; from the reading {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} ch.
xiii. 10, and from the clauses put wrong by Erasmus, as being lost in the
commentary, e.g. ch. ii. 17; iii. 5, 12, 15; vi. 11, 15. Of this copy Dr.
Hort says (Introd. p. 263) that "it is by no means an average cursive of
the common sort. On the one hand it has many individualisms and readings
with small and evidently unimportant attestation: on the other it has a
large and good ancient element,... and ought certainly (with the somewhat
similar 38) to stand high among secondary documents."

2. (Act. 10, Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}.)

3. Codex Stephani {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}, unknown; cited only 77 times throughout the
Apocalypse in Stephen's edition of 1550, and that very irregularly; only
once (ch. xx. 3) after ch. xvii. 8. It was not one of the copies in the
King's Library, and the four citations noticed by Mill (N. T., _prol._ 
1176) from Luke xxii. 30; 67; 2 Cor. xii. 11; 1 Tim. iii. 3, are probably
mere errors of Stephen's press.

4. (Act. 12.)

5. Codices Laurentii Vallae (_see_ Evan. 82); the readings of which
Erasmus used.

Codd. 6, 26, 27, 28 were rather loosely collated for Wetstein by his
kinsman Caspar Wetstein, chaplain to Frederick, Prince of Wales.

18. (Act. 18.)

19. (Act. 17.)

20. (Evan. 175), a few extracts made by Bianchini: so Apoc. 24.

21, 22 of Wetstein were two unknown French codices, cited by Bentley in
his specimen of Apoc. xxii, and made Wetstein's 23 (Act. 56). Scholz,
discarding these three as doubtful, substitutes--

21. Rom. Vallicell. D. 20 [xiv, Greg. xv], 12-7/8 x 8-1/2, ff. 93 (28),
_chart._

22. (Act. 166.)

25. (Evan. 149.)

27. (Evan. 503.)

*28. Oxf. Bodl. Bar. 48 [xv], 8 x 5-1/2, ff. 24 (22), _chart._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.,
contains mixed matter by several hands, and is nscr of the Apocalypse,
_mut._ ch. xvii. 5-xxii. 21 (ch. v. 1-5 is repeated in the volume in a
different hand). This is an important copy, akin to Apocc. 7 and 96.
Bentley also named it {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} in his collation extant in the margin of Trin.
Coll. B. xvii. 5 (_see_ Evan. 51).

*29. (Act. 60, escr.)

30. (Act. 69.)

*31. Lond. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5678 [xv], 11-1/4 x 8-1/2, ff. 244 (24), _chart._,
_prol._, is cscr, but ch. i-viii had been loosely collated for Griesbach
by Paulus. Like Evan. 445 it once belonged to the Jesuits' College at
Agen, and is important for its readings. Has much miscellaneous matter.

32. Dresdensis, Reg. A. 124 [xv, Griesb. x], 7-3/4 x 4-3/4, ff. 16, belonged
to Loescher, then to Bruehl, collated by Dassdorf and Matthaei (Mt. t). The
close resemblance in the text of Apocc. 29-32 is somewhat overstated by
Griesbach.

*33. (Evan. 218.)

34. (Act. 66.)

35. Vindob. Caes. Gr. Theol. 307 [xiv], 7-1/8 x 5-5/8, ff. 32 (20), with
Andreas' commentary: brought from Constantinople by de Busbeck (Alter).
Described by Delitzsch, Handschriftliche Funde (part ii), p. 41 (1862). In
text it closely resembles Cod. 87.

36. Vindob. Caes. Suppl. Gr. 93 [xiv, Greg. xiii], 6-3/8 x 4-3/8, ff. 56
(36), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., ends ch. xix. 20, with Andreas' commentary:
the text is in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} (Alter), having much in common with Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, 7.

37. (Act. 72.)

*38. Rom. Vat. Gr. 579 [xiii, Greg. xv], 8-3/8 x 5-1/4, ff. 24 (30), on
cotton paper, in the midst of foreign matter. The text (together with some
marginal readings) (_prima manu_) closely resembles that of Codd. AC, and
was collated by Birch, inspected by Scholz and Tregelles, and subsequently
recollated by B. H. Alford at the request of Tregelles (_see_ Evan. T).

39. (Paul. 85.)

40. (Evan. 141.)

41. Rom. Vat. Reg. Gr. 68 [xiv, Greg. xv], 9-1/8 x 6, ff. 70 (14),
_chart._, _proll._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}. _t._, with extracts from OEcumenius and Andreas'
commentary (Birch, Scholz: so Apoc. 43).

42. (Act. 80.)

43. Rom. Barberini iv. 56 [xiv], 9-3/4 x 7, ff. 5 (58) at end, 2 cols.,
contains ch. xiv. 17-xviii. 20, with a commentary, together with portions
of the Septuagint.

*49. Moscow, Synod. 67 (Mt. o) [xv], fol., ff. 58, _chart._, with Andreas'
commentary, and Gregory Nazianzen's Homilies.

*50. Mosc. Synod. 206 (Mt. p) [xv], fol. _chart._, ff. 35, like Evann. 69,
206, 233, is partly of parchment, partly paper, from the Iberian monastery
on Athos; it also contains lives of the Saints.

*502. Also from the Iberian monastery [x], is Matthaei's r, Tischendorf's
90.

Apocc. 51-84 were added to the list by Scholz, of which he professes to
have collated Cod. 51 entirely, as Reiche has done after him; 68, 69, 82
nearly entire; twenty-one others cursorily, the rest (apparently) not at
all. Our 87 is Scrivener's m, collated in the Apocalypse only.

65. Moscow, Univ. Libr. 25 [xii], 4to, ff. 7 (once Coislin's 229),
contains ch. xvi. 20-xxii. 21.

66. (Act. 419.)

67. Rom. Vat. Gr. 1743 [dated December 5, 1302], 8-7/8 x 6-1/2, ff. ?, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., with Andreas' commentary.

68. Rom. Vat. Gr. 1904, vol. 2 [xi], 11-1/4 x 8-1/8, ff. 19, contains ch.
vii, 17-viii. 12; xx. 1-xxii. 21, with Arethas' commentary, and much
foreign matter. This fragment (as also Apoc. 72 according to Scholz, who
however never cites it) agrees much with Cod. A.

69. (Act. 161.)

70. (Evan. 386.)

71. Athens, Nat. Libr. 142 [xv], 5-7/8 x 4-3/8, ff. 233, with other

*79. Munich, Reg. Gr. 248 [xvi], 9-1/8 x 6-1/4, ff. 84 (28), _chart._,
_prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.; once Sirlet's, the Apostolic chief notary (_see_
Evan. 373 and Evst. 132), with Andreas' commentary, whose text it follows.
That excellent and modest scholar Fred. Sylburg collated it for his
edition of Andreas, 1596, one of the last labours of his diligent life. An
excellent copy.

80. Monac. Reg. Gr. 544 (Bengel's Augustan. 7) [xii Sylburg, xiv Scholz,
who adds that it once belonged to the Emperor Manuel Palaeologus, A.D.
1400], 8 x 5-3/4, ff. 169 (20), _prol._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., on cotton paper, with
Andreas' commentary.

81. Monac. Reg. Gr. 23 [xvi], 14 x 9-1/4, ff. 83 (30), _chart._, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}.,
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}., with works of Gregory Nyssen, and Andreas' commentary, used by
Theod. Peltanus for his edition of Andreas, Ingoldstadt, 1547. Peltanus'
marginal notes from this copy were seen by Scholz.

*91. (Paul. 263.) Rom. Vat. Gr. 1209 [xv], 10-5/8 x 10-3/8, ff. ?. Mico's
collation of the modern supplement to the great Cod. B, made for Bentley,
and published in Ford's "Appendix" to the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799. The
whole supplement from Heb. ix. 14 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} including the
Apocalypse (but not the Pastoral Epistles) is printed at full length in
Vercellone and Cozza's edition of Cod. Vaticanus (1868).

92. (Evan. 61.) Published by Dr. Barrett, 1801, in his Appendix to Evan.
Z, but suspected to be a later addition. See Apoc. 14, note.

Wm. Kelly, "The Revelation of John edited in Greek with a new English
Version," 1860, thus numbers Scrivener's collations of six copies not
included in the foregoing catalogue--

*93. (Paul. 256 or escr), ascr.

*94. (Evan. 201), bscr.

*95. Parham 82. 17, gscr [xii], 10-1/4 x 7-3/4, brought by the late Lord de la
Zouche in 1837 from Caracalla on Athos: it contains an epitome of the
commentary of Arethas, in a cramped hand much less distinct than the text,
which ends at ch. xx. 11. There are no divisions into chapters. This
"special treasure," as Tregelles calls it, was regarded by him and Alford
as one of the best cursive manuscripts of the Apocalypse: Dr. Hort judges
it inferior to none. It agrees with Cod. A alone or nearly so in ch.
xviii. 8, 10, (19), 23; xix. 14: compare also its readings in ch. xix. 6
(bis), 12.

*96. Parham 67 (?). 2, hscr [xiv], 11-1/8 x 7-5/8, ff. 22 (28), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}., on
glazed paper, very neat, also from Caracalla, complete and in excellent
preservation, with very short scholia here and there. These two
manuscripts were collated by Scrivener in 1855, under the hospitable roof
of their owner.

*97. (Evan. 584.) Brit. Mus. Add. 17,469, jscr [xiv], collated only in
Apoc.

*98. (Evan. 488.) Oxf. Bodl. Can. 34, kscr [dated in the Apocalypse July
18, 1516]. The Pauline Epistles [dated Oct. 11, 1515] precede the Acts.
Collated only in Apoc.

CHAPTER XIII. EVANGELISTARIES, OR MANUSCRIPT SERVICE-BOOKS OF THE GOSPELS.


However grievously the great mass of cursive manuscripts of the New
Testament has been neglected by Biblical critics, the Lectionaries of the
Greek Church, partly for causes previously stated, have received even less
attention at their hands. Yet no sound reason can be alleged for regarding
the testimony of these Service-books as of slighter value than that of
other witnesses of the same date and character. The necessary changes
interpolated in the text at the commencement and sometimes at the end of
lessons are so simple and obvious that the least experienced student can
make allowance for them(282): and if the same passage is often given in a
different form when repeated in the same Lectionary, although the fact
ought to be recorded and borne in mind, this occasional inconsistency must
no more militate against the reception of the general evidence of the copy
that exhibits it, than it excludes from our roll of critical authorities
the works of Origen and other Fathers, in which the selfsame variation is
even more the rule than the exception. Dividing, therefore, the
Lectionaries that have been hitherto catalogued (which form indeed but a
small portion of those known to exist in Eastern monasteries and Western
libraries) into Evangelistaria, or Evangeliaria, containing extracts from
the Gospels, and Praxapostoli or Apostoli comprising extracts from the
Acts and Epistles; we purpose to mark with an asterisk the few that have
been really collated, including them in the same list with the majority
which have been examined superficially, or not at all. Uncial copies (some
as late as the eleventh century) will be distinguished by [+]. The uncial
codices of the Gospels amount to one hundred and six, those of the Acts
and Epistles only to seven or eight, but probably to more in either case,
since all is not known about some of the Codd. recorded here. Lectionaries
are usually (yet see below, Evst. 111, 142, 178, 244, 249, 255, 256, 262,

[+]40. Escurial I [x], 4to, _Unc._, _mus._, kept with the reliques there
as an autograph of St. Chrysostom. It was given by Queen Maria of Hungary
(who obtained it from Jo. Diassorin) to Philip II. Moldenhawer collated
fifteen Lessons. The text is of the common type, but in the oblong shape
of the letters, false breathings and accents, the red musical notes, &c.,

Montana.

_chart._, came from Italy, and, like Apoc. 32, once belonged to Loescher,

Constantine, a priest, is Scrivener's H (Cod. Augiensis, Introd. pp.
xlvii-l), for an alphabet formed from it _see_ our Plate iii. No. 7. It
was brought from Constantinople by Dr. John Covell, in 1677 (Evan. 65),
and by him shown to Mill (N. T., Proleg.  1426); from Covell it seems to
have been purchased (together with his other copies) by Harley, Earl of
Oxford. It is a most splendid specimen of the uncial class of
Evangelistaria, and its text presents many instructive variations. At the
end are several Lessons for special occasions, which are not often met
with. Collated also by (Bloomfield), and facsimiles given by the
Palaeographical Society, Plates 26, 27.

the end is a note, written at Rome in 1699, by L. A. Zacagni, certifying
that the volume was then more than 700 years old. The date assigned above
is more likely (Bloomfield).

_Unc._, _orn._, the uncials leaning to the right, a fine copy, with small
uncial notes, well meriting collation. Called "Codex Prusensis" [Prusa,
near mount Olympus: Scholz's 171] in a MS. note of H. Wanley. It begins
John xx. 20, and is _mut._ in. some other parts. For a facsimile page
_see_ the new "Catalogue of Ancient MSS. in the British Museum" (1881),
Plate 17.

153. Meerman 117 [xi], _see_ Evan. 436 ?, bought at Meerman's sale by

It seems adapted to the Constantinopolitan use.

been a superb specimen of ancient art: about thirty of its pictures are
enumerated.

_orn._, _syn._, is much fuller than most Lectionaries, and contains many
minute variations(286): it exhibits a subscription dated 1261, Indict. 4,
much later than the codex, and a note stating that Francis Tayler,
Preacher at Christ's Church, Canterbury [the Cathedral], gave it to the
College in 1654. There are also four Lessons from the prophets, and four
from St. Paul (Apost. 53). A facsimile is given, Cod. Augiens. Introd., p.
li. This is Hort's 59. (Greg. 185.)

ff. 222 (22), 2 cols., belonged to the late Lord de la Zouche, who brought
it from Caracalla on Athos in 1837, beautifully written at Ciscissa, in
Cappadocia Prima; a note dated 1049 is subjoined by a reviser, who perhaps
made the numerous changes in the text, and added two Lessons in cursive
letters. _See_ Plate xiii, No. 36. Also "Cod. Augiens.," Introd., pp.
l-lv. (Greg. 181.)

235. Parham 84. 19 [xi], 14-1/2 x 11-1/2, ff. 188 (25), "the right royal
codex," partly written in gold, perhaps by the Emperor Alexius Comnenus
(1081-1118). (Greg. 233.)

236. Parham 85. 20 [xii], 13-3/8 x 9-7/8, _mus. rubr._, brought from St.
Saba in 1834, must be on Scholz's list. (Greg. 344.)

237. Ashburnham 205 [xii], 10-3/8 x 7-3/4, ff. 127, _mus._, _mut._, roughly

[+] 238. Ashburnham 208* [xiii], 10-3/4 x 8-1/2, ff. 9, _Unc._, palimpsest,
the fragment of a menology for November and December. These were purchased

Aberdeen," who brought them from Greece. (Greg. 237a.)

239. Burdett-Coutts I. 2. A fragment of 173 leaves [xiii], 10-3/4 x 8-1/8,
one being on paper [xv] and 30 leaves palimpsest; having under the Church
Lessons, in leaning uncials of two columns [viii or ix], fragments of
legends relating to Saints in the menology, including the Apocryphal
{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of Barnabas. _Pict._, capitals in red ink. (Greg. 214.)

240. B.-C. I. 8 [xiii], 9-3/4 x 7-3/8, is also a palimpsest, with uncial
writing in two columns (almost illegible) under the later Church Lessons
on the last leaf and the third, fourth, fifth, and seventh leaves from the
end: _mut._ at the thirteenth Sunday of St. Matthew, and ends in the tenth

(Greg. 215.)

241. B.-C. I. 23 [xiii], 9-1/4 x 7-1/2, a poor copy; with illuminations, the
last leaf only being lost. (Greg. 217.)

242. B.-C. I. 24 [xiv], 12-1/2 x 10-1/8, _chart._, complete, but the first
leaf in a later hand. (Greg. 218.)

243. B.-C. II. 5 [xi or xii], 11 x 8-3/8, a fine copy, with headings, &c.,
in gold, and red musical or tone notes. Begins John i. 17, thence complete
to the Lesson {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. At the end are nine later leaves.
(Greg. 219.)

244. B.-C. II. 16 [xiii], 8-3/8 x 6-1/2, a palimpsest, with only one column
on a page. Ends Luke ii. 59. (Greg. 220.)

245. B.-C. II. 30 [xiv], 11-3/8 x 7-1/2, on glazed paper, complete. Titles

247. B.-C. III. 34 [xiii], 10-1/4 x 7-3/4, neat and complete. A colophon
states the scribe to be Romanus, a priest. (Greg. 224.)

248. B.-C. III. 43 [April 28, 1437, Ind. 15], 11-1/2 x 8-3/8, ff. 206,
_chart._ (Greg. 225.)

[B.-C. III. 44 is Evst. 289, described below, Apost. 78.]

249. B.-C. III. 46 [xiv], 8-7/8 x 7-1/4, ff. 220, _mut._ in the beginning of
the Saints' Day Lessons: fifteen leaves are palimpsest, over writing full
two centuries earlier, containing in double columns Lessons of the
Septuagint from Genesis, Proverbs, and Isaiah. The other 205 leaves have
only one column on a page. (Greg. 226.)

250. B.-C. III. 52 [xiii, Greg. xiv], 9-1/4 x 7-5/8, _chart._, is but a
fragment. (Greg. 227.)

The following are Euchologies (_see_ Evet. 57), and are repeated among the
Lectionaries of the Apostolos:

251. (Apost. 64.) B.-C. I. 10 [xii or xiii], 7-3/8 x 4-3/8, ff. 60 (17),
_orn._, wherein to the ordinary contents of a Euchology, and the Liturgies

a cramped and apparently later hand. (_See_ Scrivener, Critica Sacra.)
(Greg. 216.)

252. (Apost. 66.) B.-C. III. 29 [xiv or xv], 8-1/2 x 6, ff. 172, _men._
Liturgies as in last, and other matter, on coarse paper, Lessons both from
the Gospels and Epistles. (_See_ Scrivener, Critica Sacra.) (Greg. 223.)

253. (Apost. 67.) B.-C. III. 42 [xiv], 6 x 4, ff. 310 (22), on stout
glazed paper, with the Liturgies as in Evst. 251, and much matter in
various hands, has fifteen Lessons from the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles,

ff. 144 (21), 2 cols., _mus. rubr._, _mut._, but well repaired. (Greg.
238.)

255. London, Brit. Mus. Egerton 2786 [xiii], 8-5/8 x 6, ff. 157 (20-27), a
palimpsest, _mut._ at the beginning (thirty-two leaves) and end, rather
rudely written in single columns, on coarse parchment, with vermilion
ornamentation. It abounds in uncouth _itacisms_. After Mr. Woodhouse's
death it belonged to Alderman Bragge from 1869 to 1876, then to Dean
Burgon, then to Rev. W. F. Rose. Bought in 1893. (Greg. 346.)

256. Lond. Brit. Mus. Arundel 536 [xiii], 9 x 6, ff. 217 (25), besides 3
at beginning, _chart._, _mus. rubr._, with Lections from the Epistles.
(Greg. 187.)

*[+] 257. Lond. Brit. Mus. Arundel 547, is xscr [ix], 11-1/2 x 9, ff. 329
(22), 2 cols., _Unc._, _mus. rubr._, _pict._, _mut._ at the end, but
followed by a leaf in a rather later hand, containing John viii. 12-19;
21-23. _See_ our facsimile, Plate vi. No. 16. A collation by Bentley is
preserved at Trinity College (B. xvii. 8). This is Hort's Cod. 38. (Greg.
183.)

258. (Apost. 53.) Lond. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5561 [xiv], 7-1/4 x 5-1/2, ff. 276
(194 vell. + 82 [xv] _chart._), is a Euchology (_see_ Evst. 57),
containing many short Lessons from the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles. (Greg.
340.)

259. Lond. Brit. Mus. Burney 22, is yscr [A.D. 1319], 11-1/2 x 8-1/2, ff. 248
(27), 2 cols. (_see_ facsimile, Plate xiii, No. 37), remarkable for its
wide departures from the received text, and for that reason often cited by
Tischendorf and Alford on the Gospels. See also Westcott, in Smith's
Dictionary of the Bible, "New Testament." Part of the first leaf (John i.
11-13) is on paper and later: Evst. 257, 259 are described in Scrivener's
"Collations of the Holy Gospels," Introd. pp. lix-lxiii. Like Evst. 23 it
was once D'Eon's. This is Hort's Cod. 39. (Greg. 184.)

260. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 5153 [A.D. 1032], 10-1/2 x 7-1/2, 2 vols., ff. 141

261. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 11,840 [xii], 11 x 8-1/2, ff. 236 (22), 2 cols.,
_mus. rubr._, _mut._, from Bp. Butler's collection, a very fine specimen.
(Greg. 189.)

262. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 17,370 [xi], 12-3/8 x 9-1/4, three leaves: one in
double columns (Matt. vi. 14-21), two in single columns [xiii ?] Luke
xxiv. 25-35; John i. 35-51. Sir F. Madden's note on the first fragment is
"Presented by Mr. Harris of Alexandria, June 28, 1848. A leaf of a Greek
Lectionary taken [_by the Arabs_ deleted] out of a volume which afterwards
fell into the hands of Gen. Menou." _See_ Act. 230. (Greg. 190.)

263. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 18,212 [xii], 11 x 8-1/4, ff. 297 (21), 2 cols.,
_mus. rubr._, much _mut._ at the end, and an older leaf from the Old
Testament prefixed (Bloomfield). (Greg. 191.)

264. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 19,460 [xiii], 9-1/4 x 7-1/4, ff. 104 (31), 2
cols., _mut._ at the beginning and end, in coarse and very unusual black
writing (Bloomfield). (Greg. 192.)

265. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 19,737 [xiii], 12-3/4 x 10, ff. 279 (23), 2
cols., _mus. rubr._, bought at Sotheby's, 1854. _Mut._ at the end, with
illuminations, and frequent and beautiful gilt letters. (Greg. 318.)

266. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 19,993 [A.D. 1335], 9-3/4 x 7, ff. 281 (23), in a
bold hand and peculiar style. At the beginning is an Advertisement, signed
G. Alefson, which ends literally thus: "Je l'ai achete seulement pour le
sauver des mains barbares qui allait le destruire intierement au prix de
sch. 15 a Chypre, A.D. 1851." (Bloomfield.) (Greg. 193.)

267. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 21,260 [xiii], 12 x 10, ff. 360 (20), 2 cols.,
_mus. rubr._, _orn._, purchased of Messrs. Boone in 1856. _Mut._ at the
end. The first forty leaves of this splendid copy are injured by damp.
(Greg. 319.)

268. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 21,261 [xiii], 8-1/2 x 5-3/4, ff. 196 (19), written
by various hands. Purchased of Mr. H. Stevens, 1856. (Greg. 320.)

269. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 22,735 [xiii], 12-1/2 x 9-1/2, ff. 304 (_sic_),
(23), 2 cols., _mus. rubr._, a fine, complete and interesting codex,
bought (like Evann. 596, 597) of Sp. P. Lampros of Athens in 1859: as were
also Evst. 270, 271, 272. Seven leaves of Patristic matter are bound up
with it at the end. (Greg. 321.)

270. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 22,742 [xiii], 11-1/2 x 8-3/4, ff. 79 (24), 2
cols., _mus. rubr._ (later), rather old and much mutilated throughout.
(Greg. 322.)

271. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 22,743 [xii ?], 14-1/2 x 9-1/2, ff. 213 (18), 2
cols., _caps._ and _mus. rubr._ in dull brown ink, somewhat roughly
executed, apparently written with a reed pen. _Mut._ The last leaf is a
fragment of Chrysostom, Hom. xlv, on Genesis. (Greg. 323.)

Evst. 265, 269, 271 sometimes agree with each other in departing from the
ordinary week-day Church Lessons, and suggest, as Dean Burgon observes,
some local fashion which is well worth investigating for textual purposes.
The student will have noticed, in our Table of Lessons appended to Chap.
III, how often two other codices, Apost. 64, or B.-C. III. 24 and Evst.
253, or B.-C. III. 42, depart from the common use of Church Lesson books,
but only for the middle days of the week: not, it would seem, for
Saturdays and Sundays.

272. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 22,744 [xiii], 11 x 8-1/4, ff. 189 (23), 2 cols.,
a beautiful copy, _mut._ at the beginning (to Sat. of third week), the
end, and elsewhere, with red musical notes. _See_ Evst. 269. (Greg. 324.)

273. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 24,374 [xiii], 11-1/2 x 9, ff. 90 (18), 2 cols.,
_mus. rubr._, _mut._ (Greg. 325.)

274. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 24,377 [xiv and xii], 12 x 8-3/4, ff. 350 (21), 2
cols., _mus. rubr._, the first and some other leaves being lost; fol. 180,
which is later, has palimpsest cursive writing under it. (Greg. 326.)

275. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 24,378 [xiii], 13 x 8-3/4, ff. 270, 2 cols., part
of a Menaeum, in a small hand, written in a single column: imperfect and
damaged in places. (Greg. 927.)

276. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 24,379 [xiv], 14-1/4 x 11, ff. 178 (28), 2 cols.,
much _mut._ throughout, with liturgical headings and some crosses in red
for stops. (Greg. 327.)

277. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 24,380 [xiv], 11 x 9, ff. 126, 2 cols., _mus.

golden uncials," divided into "verses" like the modern, has breathings and

seen in 1862 by Burgon, in 1864 by the Rev. E. M. Young, and Mr. Jo. Dury
Geden (_Athenaeum_, Nov. 12 and 19, 1864). It is said to be deteriorated
by the promiscuous handling of strangers, although E. A. Sophocles tells
us that local tradition absurdly assigns it to the Emperor Theodosius [d.
395] as the actual scribe; unless, as Mr. Geden suggests, Theodosius III
(A.D. 716) be meant. The volume opens with the Gospels for the first five
days of Easter week, which are followed by about sixty-five more from
other parts of the yearly services. (Greg. 300.)

from the Gospels. They exactly correspond with those in our list, five of
the Saints' Day Lessons being from the Catholic Epistles.

describes none as collated entire or in the greater part. He seems,

12. And especially the learned Prolegomena to Tischendorf, 8th edition,
drawn up and issued by Dr. C. R. Gregory, who has with the greatest
diligence examined a vast number of MSS. on the spot. I have had a
difficult task in steering between my duty to the learned public _in __
the short time_ allowed me for the preparation of this edition, and the
desire of Dr. Gregory that I should not take more of the information
supplied in his work than I could help. What I have chiefly done has been
to insert his measurements, where I could obtain no others, translating
them into inches, and some other particulars upon such MSS. as had been
already described in the third edition. In the case of the
newly-discovered MSS., which have been first recorded by Dr. Gregory, I
have only mentioned them, with a general reference to Dr. Gregory's book,
except where information from other sources has come to hand. I have the
pleasure of paying a tribute in the case of MSS. which I have examined
upon his track to the great skill and accuracy of his examinations.





APPENDIX B. ON FACSIMILES.


Since the application of photography in its more perfect forms to
manuscripts for the purpose of representing their character accurately to
scholars who have no opportunity of examining the manuscripts for
themselves, the older facsimiles have in greater measure lost their value.
It seems, therefore, hardly worth while to refer to the collections of
facsimiles made by Montfaucon, or Bianchini, or Silvestre, or Westwood,
other representations when they are to be had being so much more faithful
and instructive.

The following are some of the most valuable of recent collections:--

1. Palaeographical Society, Facsimiles of MSS. and Inscriptions, ed. E. A.
Bond, E. M. Thompson, and G. F. Warner, first series, 3 vols., London,
1873-1883; second series, 1884, &c., in progress, fol.

This collection contains the following Gr. Test. MSS.:--

APPENDIX C. ON DATING BY INDICTION.


Some account of the old way of dating Greek MSS. by indiction has been
already given (p. 42, n. 2), but it may be convenient to our readers to
have a fuller description to refer to. Such a description may be found in
Mr. Maunde Thompson's admirable Manual on Greek and Latin Palaeography,
pp. 322-3, which, by the kind permission of the author, is reproduced
here.

"Mediaeval Greek MSS. are dated sometimes by the year of the indiction,
sometimes by the year of the world according to the era of Constantinople,
sometimes by both indiction and year of the world.

"The Indiction was a cycle of fifteen years, which are severally styled
Indiction 1, Indiction 2, &c., up to Indiction 15, when the series begins
afresh. The introduction of this system is attributed to Constantine the
Great. From the circumstance of the commencement of the indiction being
reckoned variously from different days, four kinds of indictions have been
recognized, viz.:--

"i. The Indiction of Constantinople, calculated from the 1st of September,
A.D. 312.

"ii. The Imperial or Caesarian Indiction (commonly used in England and
France), beginning on the 24th of September, A.D. 312.

"iii. The Roman or Pontifical Indiction (commonly used in dating papal
bulls from the ninth to the fourteenth century), beginning on the 1st of
January (or the 25th of December, when that day was reckoned as the first
day of the year), A.D. 313.

"iv. The Indiction used in the register of the parliament of Paris,
beginning in October.

"The Greeks made use of the Indiction of Constantinople(290).

"To find the indiction of a year of the Christian era, add 3 to the year
(because A.D. 1= Indiction 4), and divide the sum by 15: if nothing
remains, the indiction will be 15; if there is a remainder, it will be the
number of the indiction. But it must not be forgotten that the Indiction
of Constantinople begins on the first of September, and consequently that
the last four months of a year of the Christian era belong to the next
indiction year.

"The year of the Creation of the World was calculated, according to the
era of Constantinople, to be B.C. 5508. The first day of the year was the
1st of September.

"To reduce the Mundane era of Constantinople to the Christian era, deduct
5508 from the former for the months of January to August; and 5509 for
September to December.

"A chronological table, showing the corresponding years of the Mundane
era, the Christian era, and the Indiction, from A.D. 800 to A.D. 1599,
will be found in Gardthausen's 'Griechische Palaeographie,' pp. 450-459."

Mr. Thompson also refers to an article by Mr. Kenyon in _The Classical
Review_, March, 1893, p. 110, where the Egyptian puzzle is noticed, to one
by Wilcken in "Hermes," xxviii. p. 230, and one by Viereck in
"Philologus," lii. p. 219, and generally to the interesting and valuable
Introduction to the British Museum upon Greek Papyri.





APPENDIX D. ON THE {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}.


The following ingenious and probably sound explanation of what has been
long a _crux_ to Textual Critics, comes from a Lecture by Mr. Rendel
Harris, "On the Origin of the Ferrar Group," delivered at Mansfield
College, Oxford, on Nov. 6, 1893, and since published (C. J. Clay and
Sons), and courteously sent to the editor by the accomplished author. The
explanation is given in Mr. Harris' own words (pp. 7-10): but the whole of
his pamphlet should be consulted by those who are interested in this
study.

"In Scrivener's Introduction to the New Testament (ed. 3, p. 65) we are
told that 'besides the division of the text into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} or lines, we find
in the Gospels alone another division into {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, "sentences,"
differing but little from the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in number. Of these last the precise
numbers vary in different copies, though not considerably, &c.' And on p.
66 we find the following statistical statement:

"Matthew has 2522 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}
Mark, 1675
Luke, 3803
John, 1938

"These figures are derived from MSS. of the Gospels, in which we
frequently find the attestation given both of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} and the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}:
e.g. Cod. Ev. 173 gives for

"Matthew ,{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, ,{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~},

while the corresponding figures for Mark and Luke are

Mark ,{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}' ,{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} and Luke ,{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} ,{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}

"No explanation, as far as I know, has ever been given of these curiously
numbered {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}. The word is, certainly, a peculiar one to use, if short
sentences are intended, such as are commonly known by the terms 'cola and
commata.'

"It has occurred to me that perhaps the explanation might lie in the fact
that {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} was here a literal translation of the Syriac word {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} (or
{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}). Let us then see whether {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} (or {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}) is the proper word to
describe a verse, either a fixed verse, like a hexameter, or a sense-line.
A reference to Payne Smith's Lexicon will show that it may be used in
either of these senses, for example, we are told that it is not only used
generally of the verses of Scripture, but that it may stand for '_comma,
membrum versus, sententia brevior quam versus,_ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, Schol. ad Hex.
Job. ix. 33; {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~} (or {~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~} {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}), Tit. ib. Ps. ix; {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}  {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~} (or
{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}). Ex. xxx. 22 marg.: insunt in Geneseos libro {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} (or {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~})
MMMMDIX, coloph. ad Gen., it. C.S.B. 2 et sic ad fin. cuiusque libri; in
libris poeticis sententia est hemistichio minor, e.g. in Ps. i. insunt
versus sex sed {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~} {~SYRIAC LETTER YUDH HE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~} (or {~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER YUDH HE~} {~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}); in Ps. ii. versus duodecim, sed {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~} {~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER HETH~} (or
{~SYRIAC LETTER HETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}).'

"It seems, therefore, to be used in Syriac much in the same way as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
in Greek.

"Now there is in one of the Syriac MSS. on Mount Sinai (Cod. Sin. Syr.) a
table of the Canonical books of the Old and New Testaments with their
measured verses. We will give some extracts from this table; but first,
notice that the Gospels are numbered as follows:

Matthew has 2522 {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} (or {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~})
Mark has 1675
Luke has 3083
John has 1737

and the whole of the four Evangelists 9218, which differs slightly from
the total formed by addition, which, as the figures stand, is 9017.

"On comparing the table with the numbers given by Scrivener from Greek
MSS., viz.

Matt. = 2522 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}
Mark  = 1675
Luke  = 3803
John  = 1938

we see at a glance that we are dealing with the same system; Luke should
evidently have 3083, the Greek number being evidently an excessive one;
and if we assume that John should be 1938 the total amounts exactly to the
9218 given for the four Gospels.

"This is very curious, and since the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} are now proved to be rightly
equated to {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} (or {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}), and this latter word is a proper word to
describe a verse or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} appear to be a translation of a
Syriac table.

"Perhaps we may get some further idea about the character of the verses in
question by turning to the Sinai list, which is not confined to the
Gospels, but ranges through the whole of the Old and New Testaments.

"The Stichometry in question follows the list of the names of the seventy
disciples, which list is here assigned to Irenaeus, bishop of Lugdunum.
After which we have

{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER WAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER HETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER WAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER NUN~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER WAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER NUN~}{~SYRIAC LETTER YUDH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER NUN~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}
{~SYRIAC LETTER QAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER YUDH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER SHIN~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC SUPRALINEAR COLON~} {~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER KAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER WAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER WAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}
{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER HETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER HETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER NUN~}{~SYRIAC SUPRALINEAR COLON~} {~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}
{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER GAMAL~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER DALATH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER BETH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~} {~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER PE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER YUDH HE~}{~SYRIAC LETTER NUN~} {~SYRIAC LETTER WAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER YUDH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER SHIN~}{~SYRIAC LETTER MIM~}{~SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH~}
{~SYRIAC LETTER WAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER SHIN~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER TAW~}{~SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH~}{~SYRIAC LETTER SEMKATH~}{~SYRIAC SUPRALINEAR COLON~}

i.e.Genesis has 4516 verses followed by:
               Exodus               3378
               Leviticus            2684
               Numbers              3481
               Deuteronomy          2982
               Total for the Law   17041
               Joshua               1953
               Judges               2088
               &c.

"When we come to the New Testament, it seems at first sight as if the
verses which are there reckoned cannot be the Greek equivalent hexameters:
for we are told that Philemon contains 53 verses, and the Epistle to Titus
116, numbers which are in excess of the Euthalian reckoning, 38 and 97
verses respectively, and similarly in other cases. The suggestion arises
that the lines here reckoned are sense lines, and this is therefore the
meaning to be attached to the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of the MSS. But upon this point we
must not speak too hastily.

"The interest of the Sinai stichometry is not limited to this single
point: its list of New Testament books is peculiar in order and contents.
There seem to be no Catholic Epistles, and amongst the Pauline Epistles,
Galatians stands first; note also the curious order Hebrews, Colossians,
Ephesians, Philippians.

"I do not think there can be the slightest doubt that our explanation of
the origin of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} is correct.

FOOTNOTES


    1 Unfortunately, it did not occur to us till after the work was nearly
      all in type to transfer the Lithographed Plates to places opposite
      the pages which they chiefly illustrate, and that in consequence a
      few expressions in the text ought to be altered. The advantage of
      this arrangement appears to be so great as to overbalance the slight
      inaccuracies alluded to, which cannot now be removed. The plates and
      their references will, it is hoped, be found easily from the
      explanations here given.

    2 In later manuscripts Proper Names are often distinguished by a
      horizontal line placed over them, but no such examples occur in
      these Plates.

    3 The reader will observe throughout these specimens that the
      breathings and accents are usually attached to the _first_ vowel of
      a diphthong.

    4 "Remarks upon a late Discourse of Free Thinking by Phileleutherus
      Lipsiensis," Part i, Section 32.

    5 I cite from the late Canon Cureton's over-literal translation in his
      "Remains of a very antient recension of the four Gospels in Syriac,"
      in the Preface to which (pp. xxxv-xxxviii) is an elaborate
      discussion of the evidence for this passage.

    6 But see Dean Burgon's "The Revision Revised," pp. 358-361.

    7 The word {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} is said to have been first used by
      Cassiodorus (A.D. 468-560?). See Migne, Patr. Lat. t. 70, col. 1128.

    8 To this list of examples from the Book of Common Prayer, Dean Burgon
      ("The last twelve verses of St. Mark's Gospel Vindicated" p. 215)
      adds the Gospels for Quinquagesima, 2nd Sunday after Easter, 9th,
      12th, and 22nd after Trinity, Whitsunday, Ascension Day, SS. Philip
      and James, All Saints.

    9 Dean Alford (see his critical notes on Luke ix. 56; xxiii. 17) is
      reasonably unwilling to admit this source of corruption, where the
      language of the several Evangelists bears no close resemblance
      throughout the whole of the parallel passages.

   10 The oldest manuscripts seem to elide the final syllable of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}
      before nouns, but not before verbs: e.g. John vi. 32, 39. The common
      text, therefore, seems wrong in Rom. i. 21; iv. 20; v. 14; viii. 15;
      1 Cor. i. 17; vi. 11; ix. 27; xiv. 34; 1 Pet. ii. 25; Jude 9. Yet to
      this rule there are many exceptions, e.g. Gal. iv. 7 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} is
      found in nearly all good authorities.

   11 Tischendorf indeed (Nov. Test. 1871), from a suggestion of Granville
      Penn in loc., says, "{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~} omnino scribi solet _{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}_," and this no
      doubt is the usual form, even in manuscripts which have _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_,
      as well as _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_, for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}. Yet the Codex Augiensis (Paul.
      F) has _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}_ in 1 Cor. ix. 1.

   12 Especially, yet not always, at the end of a line. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} is
      actually thus written in Cod. Sinaiticus ({~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}), 1 Macc. ix. 7; xv. 33;
      Matt. xxi. 34; Rom. iii. 26; Heb. xi. 11; Apoc. xi. 18. So Cod.
      Sarravianus of the fourth century in Deut. ix. 20, Cod. Rossanensis
      of the sixth (but only twice in the text), the Zurich Psalter of the
      seventh century is Ps. xcvii. 11; cvi. 3; cxvi. 5, and the Bodleian
      Genesis (ch. vi. 13) of about a century later. Similarly, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} is
      written {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} in Cod. B. 2 John 5.

   13 My departed friend, Dr. Tregelles, to whose persevering labours in
      sacred criticism I am anxious, once for all, to express my deepest
      obligations, ranged various readings under three general
      heads:--_substitutions_; _additions_; _omissions_. Mr. C. E. Hammond,
      in his scholarlike little work, "Outlines of Textual Criticism
      applied to the N. T., 1876, 2nd edition," divides their possible
      sources into Unconscious or unintentional errors, (1) of _sight_;
      (2) of _hearing_; (3) of _memory_: and those that are Conscious or
      intentional, viz. (4) incorporation of marginal glosses; (5)
      corrections of harsh or unusual forms of words, or expressions; (6)
      alterations in the text to produce supposed harmony with another
      passage, to complete a quotation, or to clear up a presumed
      difficulty; (7) Liturgical insertions. While he enumerates (8)
      alterations for dogmatic reasons, he adds that "there appears to be
      no strong ground for the suggestion" that any such exist (Hammond,
      p. 17). Professor Roberts ("Words of the New Testament" by Drs.
      Milligan and Roberts, 1873) comprehends several of the foregoing
      divisions under one head: "Again and again has a word or phrase been
      slipped in by the transcriber which had no existence in his copy,
      but which was due to the working of his own mind on the subject
      before him." His examples are {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} inserted in Matt. xxv. 6;
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} in Luke i. 29; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} in Rom. viii. 26 (Part 1. Chap. 1.
      pp. 5, 6).

   14 This source of variations, though not easily discriminated from
      others, must have suggested itself to many minds, and is well
      touched upon by the late Isaac Taylor in his "History of the
      Transmission of Antient Books to modern times," 1827, p. 24. So Dr.
      Hort, when perplexed by some of the textual problems which he fails
      to solve, throws out as an hypothesis not in itself without
      plausibility, the notion of "a first and a second edition of the
      Gospels, both conceivably apostolic" (Gr. Test. Introduction, p.
      177).

   15 "Novum Testamentum Textus Stephanici A.D. 1550 ... curante F. H. A.
      Scrivener." Cantabr. 1877 (Editio Major, 1887).

   16 In this manner we propose to indicate the dates of the birth and
      death of the person whose name immediately precedes.

   18 "Recent investigations have thrown doubts on the accuracy of this
      view; and a careful analysis of many samples has proved that,
      although cotton was occasionally used, no paper that has been
      examined is entirely made of that substance, hemp or flax being the
      more usual material." Maunde Thompson, p. 44.

   19 Tischendorf (Notitia Codicis Sinaitici, p. 54) carried to St.
      Petersburg a fragment of a Lectionary which cannot well be assigned
      to a later date than the ninth century, among whose parchment leaves
      are inserted two of cotton paper, manifestly written on by the
      original scribe.

   24 Miniatures are found even as early as in the Cod. Rossanensis ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}) at
      the beginning of the sixth century.

   27 Besides the Cod. Sinaiticus, the beautiful Psalter purchased by the
      National Library from the Didot sale at Paris has four columns (Mr.
      J. Rendel Harris), and besides the Cod. Vaticanus, the Vatican Dio
      Cassius, the Milan fragment of Genesis, two copies of the Samaritan
      Pentateuch at Nablous described by Tischendorf (Cod. Frid.-Aug.
      Proleg.  11), the last part of Cod. Monacensis 208 (Evan, 429), and
      two Hebrew MSS. Cod. Mon. Heb. 422, and Cod. Reg. Heb. 17, are
      arranged in _three_ columns. Tischendorf has more recently
      discovered a similar arrangement in two palimpsest leaves of Wisdom
      and Ecclesiasticus from which he gives extracts (Not. Cod. Sinait.
      p. 49); in a Latin fragment of the Pentateuch, the same as the
      Ashburnham manuscript below, seen by him at Lyons in 1843; in a
      Greek Evangelistarium of the eighth century, and a Patristic
      manuscript at Patmos of the ninth (ibid. p. 10); so that the
      argument drawn from the _triple_ columns must not be pressed too
      far. He adds also a Turin copy of the Minor Prophets in Greek
      (Pasinus, Catalogue, 1749), and a Nitrian Syriac codex in the
      British Museum "quem circa finem quarti saeculi scriptum esse
      subscriptio testatur" (Monum. sacra inedita, vol. i, Proleg. p.
      xxxi). To this not slender list Mr. E. Maunde Thompson enables us to
      annex B. M. Addit. 24142, a Flemish Latin Bible of the eleventh
      century. The late Lord Ashburnham in 1868 printed his Old Latin
      fragments of Leviticus and Numbers, also in three columns, with a
      facsimile page; and the famous Utrecht Psalter, assigned by some to
      the sixth century, by others to the ninth or tenth, is written with
      three columns on a page.

   28 "Uncialibus, ut vulgo aiunt, literis, onera magis exarata, quam
      codices," Hieronymi Praef. in Job. From this passage the term
      _uncial_ seems to be derived, _uncia_ (an inch) referring to the
      size of the characters. Yet the conjectural reading "_initialibus_"
      will most approve itself to those who are familiar with the small
      Latin writing of the Middle Ages, in which _i_ is undotted, and _c_
      much like _t_.

   29 The Cotton fragment of the book of Genesis of the fifth century,
      whose poor shrivelled remains from the fire of 1731 are still
      preserved in the British Museum, while in common with all other
      _manuscripts_ it exhibits the round shapes of {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}, substitutes a
      lozenge [symbol] for the circle in _phi_, after the older fashion
      ([symbol somewhat like a squared Phi]). _Phi_ often has much the
      same shape in Codex Bezae; e.g. Matt. xiii. 26, Fol. 42 _b_, 1. 13,
      and once in Codex Z (Matt. xxi. 26, Plate xlviii).

   32 We prefer citing Cod. Frid.-August., because our examples have been
      actually taken from its exquisitely lithographed pages; but the
      facsimile of part of a page from Luke xxiv represented in
      Tischendorf's Cod. Sinaiticus, from which we have borrowed six lines
      (No. 11 b), will be seen to resemble exactly the portion published
      in 1846.

   33 Cod. A is found in the simpler form in the Old Testament, but mostly
      with the horizontal line produced in the New.

   35 Codd. B of Apocalypse, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}a {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~} (No. 30) of the Gospels, and Silvestre's
      No. 68, all of about the eighth century, slope more or less to the
      right; Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~} (No. 35) of the ninth century, a very little to the
      left. Tischendorf assigns to the seventh century the fragments
      comprising Leipzig II. (see p. 39), though they lean much to the
      right (Monum. sacra ined. tom. i, pp. xxx-xxxiv, 141-176), and those
      of Isaiah (ibid. pp. xxxvi, xxxvii, 187-199).

   36 The earliest cursive Biblical manuscript formerly alleged, i.e.
      Evan. 14, on examination proves to have no inscription whatever. "On
      folio 392, in a comparatively modern hand, is rather uncouthly
      written {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} A. Z. What the initials A. Z.
      stand for I do not know." (Dean Burgon, Guardian, Jan. 15, 1873.)
      The claim of priority for Cod. 14 being thus disposed of (though it
      must be noted that Dr. C. R. Gregory refers it without doubt to the
      tenth century), we may note that Cod. 429 of the Gospels is dated
      978, Cod. 148 of the Acts 984, Cod. 5pe 994, and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}, written partly
      in cursives, and partly in uncials is of the ninth century. But the
      date May 7, 835 A.D. is plainly visible on Cod. 481, which is
      therefore indisputably the earliest.

It

      monks, and indeed _all the dated manuscripts of the Greek Testament
      we have seen_ except Canonici 34 in the Bodleian (which reckons from
      the Christian era, A.D. 1515-6), calculate from the Greek era of the
      Creation, September 1, B.C. 5508. To obtain the year A.D.,
      therefore, from January 1 to August 31 in any year, subtract 5508
      from the given year; from September 1 to December 31 subtract 5509.
      The indiction which usually accompanies this date is a useful check
      in case of any corruption or want of legibility in the letters
      employed as numerals. Both dates are given in Evan. 558, viz. A.M.
      6938, and A.D. 1430.

      is, as I once supposed, monk of the Convent of Sancta Petra at
      Constantinople, short-hand and fair writer), was the scribe of at
      least _five_ more copies of Scripture now extant: Birch's Havn. 1,
      A.D. 1278 (Evan. 234); Evan. 90, A.D. 1293; Evan. 543, A.D. 1295;
      Scholz's Evan. 412, A.D. 1301; Evan. 74, _undated_. To this list
      Franz Delitzsch (1813-1890) (Zeitschr. f. luth. Theol. 1863, ii,
      Abhandlungen, pp. 217, 218) adds from Matthaei, Synaxarion in Mosc.
      Syn. Typograph. xxvi. A.D. 1295, and recognizes _Hagios Petros_, the
      country of Theodoros, as a town in the Morea, on the borders of
      Arcadia, from whose school students have attended his own lectures
      at Erlangen.

   40 Hence in the later uncials, some of which must therefore have been
      copied from earlier cursives, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA~} and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~} (which might seem to have no
      resemblance) are sometimes confounded: e.g. in Parham 18 (A.D. 980),
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}, Luke vi. 34; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}, John x. 1, especially where {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~} begins
      or ends a line: e.g. Evan. 59, John vii. 35. Evan. 59 has {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}
      very often, yet there is no extra trace that it was copied from an
      uncial.

   43 Thus the type cast for the Royal Printing Office at Paris, and used
      by Robert Stephen, is said to have been modelled on the style of the
      calligrapher Angelus Vergecius, from whose skill arose the
      expression "he writes like an angel." Codd. 296 of the Gospels, 124
      of the Acts, 151 of St. Paul are in his hand.

   44 Yet Tischendorf (N. T. 1859, Proleg. p. cxxxiii) cites {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} from
      Cod. Bezae (Mark i. 34), {~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} (Luke xxiii. 31) from Cod. Cyprius,

      Bentley's nephew speaks of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _ascript_ as in the first hand of Cod.
      B, but he seems to have been mistaken.

   45 In B-C iii. 10 (_dated_ 1430), the whole manuscript being written by
      the same hand, we have {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _ascript_ twenty-five times up to Luke i.
      75, then on the same page {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} _subscript_ in Luke i. 77 and
      eighty-five times afterwards: the two usages are nowhere mixed. In
      Evan. 558, _subscript_ and _ascript_ are mixed in the same page,
      Luc. i. 75, 77.

   46 The invention of breathings, accents, and stops is attributed to
      Aristophanes of Byzantium, 260 B.C.

   47 See below vol. ii. c. ix. 9. note, end. Dr. Scrivener appears not to
      have formed a positive opinion, which indeed in some of these cases
      is hardly possible.

   48 He is speaking (Quaestion. super Genes. clxii) of the difference
      between {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}, Gen. xlvii. 31. "Fallit enim
      eos verbum Graecum, quod eisdem literis scribitur, sive _ejus_, sive
      _suae_: sed accentus [he must mean the breathings] dispares sunt, et
      ab eis, qui ista noverunt, in codicibus non contemnuntur" (Opera,
      Tom. iv. p. 53, ed. 1586, Lugdun.); adding that "suae" _might_ be
      expressed by {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}.

   49 In the Gale Evangelistarium (Trin. Coll. Camb. O. 4. 22) the
      interrogative clause is set between two such marks in red. Hence it
      seems not so much a stop as a vocal note. In the Armenian and
      Spanish languages the note of interrogation is set before the
      interrogative clause, and very conveniently too.

   50 The earliest known example of the use of two dots occurs in the
      Artemisia papyrus at Vienna (Maunde Thompson, p. 69), and other
      early instances are found in a letter of Dionysius to Ptolemy about
      B.C. 160, published by the French Institute, 1865, in "Papyrus grecs
      du Musee du Louvre," &c. tom. xviii. 2e ptie, pl. xxxiv, pap. 49,
      and in fragments of the Phaedo of Plato discovered at Gurob. The
      same double points are also occasionally set in the larger spaces of
      Codd. Sinaiticus, Sarravianus, and Bezae, but in the last-named copy
      for the most part in a later hand.

   51 Abbot, ubi supra.

   52 Hoskier, Cod. 604, p. xiii.

   53 Even Codex Sinaiticus has _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ and _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ in consecutive lines (Apoc.
      xxii. 20, 21), and _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ Rom. vii. 4.

   54 See below p. 64, note 4.

   55 "Fragmenta pauca evangelii Johannis palimpsesta Londinensia [Evan.
      Ib or Nb]. In ceteris haec fere tria: Dionis Cassii fragmenta
      Vaticana--vix enim qui in his videntur speciem majorum litterarum
      habere revera differunt--item fragmenta palimpsesta [Phaethontis]
      Euripidis Claromontana et fragmenta Menandri Porphiriana"
      (Tischendorf, Cod. Vatic. Proleg. p. xviii, 1867).

   56 The English word _paragraph_ is derived from the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}, which
      are often straight lines, placed in the margin to indicate a pause
      in the sense. Professor Abbot, ubi supra, p. 195, alleges not a few
      instances where these dashes are thus employed. A specimen is given
      in Scrivener's Cod. Sinaiticus, facsimile 3: see his Cod. Sin.,
      Introduction, p. xl and note. Thus also they appear in Cod.
      Sarravianus (Tischendorf, Mon. sacra ined. vol. iii. pp. xiv, xx).
      In Cod Bezae [symbol] is set in the margin forty-nine times by a
      later hand, and must be designed for the same purpose, though the
      mark sometimes occurs where we should hardly look for it (Scrivener,
      Cod. Bezae, Introduction, p. xxviii and note). In Cod. Marchalianus
      the dash stands over the capital at the beginning of a line, or over
      the first letter where there is no capital. Lastly, in Codd. Vatic.
      and Sinait. [symbol] is sometimes set in the middle of a line to
      indicate a paragraph break, followed by [symbol] in the margin of
      the next line.

   57 Many other examples of the use of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} and _versus_ in this sense
      will be found in that admirable monument of exact learning, now so
      little read, Prideaux Connections, An. 446. Stichometry can be
      traced back to nearly a century before Callimachus, who (B.C. 260)
      has been credited with the invention (Palaeography, p. 79). The term
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, like the Latin _versus_, originally referring whether to
      rows of trees, or to the oars in the trireme (Virg. Aen. v. 119),
      would naturally come to be applied to lines of poetry, and in this
      sense it is used by Pindar ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} Pyth. iv. 100) and also by
      Theocritus ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} Idyl,
      xxiii. 46), if the common reading be correct.

   58 That we have rightly understood Epiphanius' notion of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} is
      evident from his own language respecting Psalm cxli. 1, wherein he
      prefers the addition made by the Septuagint to the second clause,
      because by so doing its authors {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}: so
      that the passage should run "O Lord, I cry unto Thee, make haste
      unto me || Give ear to the voice of my request," {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} to
      complete the rhythm. This whole subject is admirably worked out in
      Suicer, Thesaur. Eccles. tom. ii. pp. 1025-37.

   59 In the Epistles of St. Paul, Euthalius seems to have followed a
      Syrian writer. Gregory, Prolegomena, p. 113; Zacagnius, Collectanea
      Monumentorum Veterum Ecclesiae, Rome, A.D. 1698, pp. 404, 409.

   60 At the end of 2 Thess., in a hand which Tischendorf states to be
      very ancient, but not that of the original scribe, the Codex
      Sinaiticus has {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~} [180; the usual number is 106]: at the end
      of Rom., 1 Cor., 1 Thess., and the Catholic Epistles, there is no
      such note; but in all the other Pauline Epistles the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} are
      numbered.

   61 So the margin of Gale's Evan. 66 contains readings cited by Mill and
      his followers, which a hand of the sixteenth century took, some of
      them from the Leicester manuscript, others from early editions.

   62 The following subscription to the book of Ezra (and a very similar
      one follows Esther) in the Cod. Frid.-August, (fol. 13. 1), though
      in a hand of the seventh century, will show the care bestowed on the
      most ancient copies of the Septuagint: {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}

      of a critical character, the office of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} or _comparer_

   68 Ambros. in Prooem. Luc. seems to aim at Tatian when he says
      "Plerique etiam ex quatuor Evangelii libris in unum ea quae
      venenatis putaverunt assertionibus convenientia referserunt."
      Eusebius H. E. iv. 29 charges him on report with _improving_ not the
      Gospels, but the Epistles: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}

      might have been anticipated: "The heretical character of the
      Diatessaron was not evident on the surface of it, and consisted
      rather of faults of defect than of erroneous teaching" (History of
      the Canon, p. 354). From the Armenian version of Ephraem the
      Syrian's Exposition of Tatian's Harmony, printed in 1836, translated
      in 1841 by Aucher of the Melchitarist Monastery at Venice, but
      buried until it was published with notes by Moesinger in 1876, a
      flood of light is thrown upon this question, and it is now clear
      "that Tatian habitually abridged the language of the passages which
      he combined" (Hort, Gk. Test. Introduction, p. 283); and that
      apparently in perfect good faith.

Epist. ad

      Burgon's elaborate studies in The Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark,
      pp. 125-132; 295-312.

   70 This is the number given for St. Mark by Suidas and Stephen. It is
      an uncertain point: thirty-four manuscripts give 233, reckoning only
      to xvi. 8; while thirty-six give 341. See Burgon Twelve Last Verses,
      p. 311.

   72 Something of this kind, however, must be the plan adopted in Codex E
      (see Plate xi. No. 27) of the Gospels, as described by Tregelles,
      who himself collated it. "[It has] the Ammonian sections; but
      instead of the Eusebian canons there is a kind of harmony of the
      Gospels noted at the foot of each page, by a reference to the
      parallel sections of the other Evangelists." Horne's Introd. vol.
      iv. p. 200. Yet the canons _also_ stand in the margin of this copy
      under the so-called Ammonian sections: only the _table_ of Eusebian
      canons is wanting. The same kind of harmony at the foot of the page
      appears in Cod. Wd at Trinity College, Cambridge, but in this latter
      the sections in the margin are not accompanied by the canons.
      Tischendorf states that the same arrangement prevails in the small
      fragment Tb at St. Petersburg; Dean Burgon adds to the list Codd. M.
      262, 264 at Paris, and conceives that this method of harmonizing,
      which he regards as far simpler than the tedious and cumbersome
      process of resorting to the Eusebian canons (ubi supra, p. 304), was
      in principle, though not in details, derived to the Greek Church
      from early Syriac copies of the Gospels, some of which still survive
      (p. 306).

   73 To this list of manuscripts of the Gospels which have the Ammonian
      sections without the Eusebian canons add Codd. 38, 54, 60, 68, 117;
      Brit. Mus. Addit. 16184, 18211, 19389; Milan Ambros. M. 48 _sup._;
      E. 63 _sup._; Burdett-Coutts I. 4; II. 18; 262; III. 9. Now that
      attention has been specially directed to the matter, it is
      remarkable how many copies have the Ammonian sections without the
      corresponding Eusebian canons under them, sometimes even when (as in
      Codd. 572, 595, 597) the letter to Carpianus and the Eusebian tables
      stand at the beginning of the volume. To the list here given must
      now be added Codd. O, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON~}, 185, 187, 190, 193, 194, 207, 209, 214,
      217, 367, 406, 409, 410, 414, 418, 419, 456, 457, 494, 497, 501,
      503, 504, 506, 508, 518, 544, 548, 550, 555, 558, 559, 564, 573,
      575, 584, 586, 591, 592, 601, 602, 620: in all seventy-one
      manuscripts.

   74 No doubt they do serve, in the manuscripts which contain them and
      omit the canons, for marks of reference, like in kind to our modern
      chapters and verses; but in consequence of their having been
      constructed for a wholly different purpose, they are so unequal in
      length (as Burgon sees very clearly, pp. 297, 303), that they answer
      that end as ill as any the most arbitrary divisions of the text well
      could do.

   75 Sulci in Sardinia is the only Bishop's see of the name I can find in
      Carol. a Sancto Paulo's Geographia Sacra (1703), or in Bingham's
      Antiquities, Bk. ix. Chapp. II, VII. Horne and even Tregelles speak
      of Sulca in Egypt, but I have searched in vain for any such town or
      see. Euthalius is called Bishop of Sulce both in Wake 12 (infra,
      note 4), and in the title to his works as edited by L. A. Zacagni
      (Collectanea Monument. Veter. Eccles. Graec. ac Latin., Rom. 1698,
      p. 402). But one of Zacagni's manuscripts reads {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} once, and he
      guesses {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} near Syene, which appears in no list of Episcopal
      sees.

   81 Many manuscripts indicate passages of the Old Testament cited in the
      New by placing > (as in Codd. Vatican. Wd, &c., but in Sinait. more
      rarely), or [symbol with two greater-than marks], or some such mark
      in the margin before every line. Our quotation-marks are probably
      derived from this sign, the angle being rounded into a curve.
      Compare the use of [symbol like right double quotation mark] in the
      margin of the Greek Testament of Colinaeus, 1534, and Stephen's
      editions of 1546, -49, -50, &c. Evan. 348 and others have [symbol].
      In Codd. Bezae, as will appear hereafter, the words cited are merely
      thrown a letter or two back in each line.

   82 The whole mystery is thus unfolded (apparently by Cosmas) in Lamb.

   83 N. B. The {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} of the Acts and of all the Epistles except Hebr.
      are taken from the Codex Passionei (G or L), an uncial of the ninth
      century.

   84 The numbers of the Gospel {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in our Table are taken from the
      uncial copies Codd. GS and twenty-seven cursives named by Scholz:
      those of the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} from Codd. 9, 13, 124 and seven others. In the
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} he cites no other variation than that Cod. 339 has 2822 for
      St. Matthew: but Mill states that Cod. 48 (Bodl. 7) has 1676 for
      Mark, 2507 for Luke (Proleg. N. T.  1429). In Cod. 56 (Lincoln
      Coll.) the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of St. Matthew are 127, of St. Mark 74, of
      St. Luke 130 (Mill).

      In the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}, a few straggling manuscripts fluctuate between 3897?
      and 1474 for Matthew; 2006 and 1000 for Mark; 3827 and 2000 for
      Luke; 2300 and 1300 for John. But the great mass of authorities
      stand as we have represented.

   85 Our English version divides 2 Cor. xiii. 12 of the Greek into two,
      and unites John i. 38, 39 of the Greek. The English and Greek verses
      begin differently in Luke i. 73, 74; vii. 18, 19. Acts ix. 28, 29;
      xi. 25, 26; xiii. 32, 33; xix. 40, 41; xxiv. 2, 3. 2 Cor. ii. 12,
      13; v. 14, 15; xi. 8, 9. Eph. i. 10, 11; iii. 17, 18. Phil. iii. 13,
      14. 1 Thess. ii. 11, 12. Heb. vii. 20, 21; x. 22, 23. 1 Jo. ii.
      13,14. 3 Jo. 14, 15. Apoc. xii. 18 or xiii. 1; xviii. 16, 17. In a
      few of these places editions of the Greek vary a little. The whole
      subject of the verses is discussed in Dr. Ezra Abbot's tract "De
      Editionibus Novi Testamenti Graece in versuum quos dicunt
      distinctione inter se discrepantibus" 1882, included in the
      Prolegomena for Tischendorf's N. T., eighth edition, pp. 167, &c.

   86 "I think it would have been better done on one's knees in the
      closet," is Mr. Kelly's quaint and not unfair comment (Lectures on
      the Minor Prophets, p. 324), unless, as is not unlikely, he copied
      what was done before.

   87 Novum Testamentum Graecum. Edente Jo. Alberto Bengelio. Tubingae
      1734. 4to. The practice of the oldest Greek manuscripts in regard to
      paragraphs has been stated above (p. 49, note 2), and will be
      further explained in the next section under our descriptions of
      Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}BD.

   88 Coislin. 199 (Evan. 85); Vatic. 2080 (Evan. 175); Palat. Vat. 171
      (Evan. 149); Lambec. 1 at Vienna (Evan. 218); Vatic. 1160 (Evan.
      141); Venet. 5 (Evan. 205); its alleged duplicate Venet. 10 (Evan.
      209); Matthaei k (Evan. 241); Moscow Synod. 380 (Evan. 242); Paris,
      Reg. 47 (Evan. 18); Reg. 61 (Evan. 263); Vat. Ottob. 66 (Evan. 386);
      Vat. Ottob. 381 (Evan. 390); Taurin. 302 (Evan. 339); S. Saba, 10
      and 20 (Evan. 462 and 466); Laurent. 53 (Evan. 367); Vallicel. F. 17
      (Evan. 394); Phillipps 7682 (Evan. 531); perhaps Scholz ought to
      have added Venet. 6 (Evan. 206) which he states to contain the whole
      New Testament, Proleg. N. T. vol. i. p. lxxii. In Evan. 180 all
      except the Gospels are by a later hand. Add (Evan. 622) also copies
      at Poictiers, Ferrara, and Toledo. Lagarde (Genesis, pp. 7, 8)
      describes another copy at Zittau, collated by Matthaei in 1801-2,
      apparently unpublished.

   89 I presume that the same order is found in Evan. 393, whereof Scholz
      states "sec. xvi. continet epist. cath. paul. ev." Proleg. N. T.
      vol. i. p. xc.

   90 Hartwell Horne in the second volume of his Introduction tells us
      that in some of the few manuscripts which contain the whole of the
      New Testament the books are arranged thus: Gospels, Acts, Catholic
      Epistles, Apocalypse, Pauline Epistles (p. 92, ed. 1834). This
      statement may be true of some of the foreign MSS. named in p. 69
      note, but of the English it can refer to none, although Wake 34 at
      Christ Church commences with the Acts and Catholic Epistles,
      followed by the Apocalypse beginning on the same page as Jude ends,
      and the Pauline Epistles on the same page as the Apocalypse ends.
      The Gospels, which come last, may have been misplaced by an early
      binder.

   91 This is the true _Western_ order (Scrivener, Cod. Bezae, Introd. p.
      xxx and note), and will be found in the copies of the Old Latin
      _a_1, _a_2, _b_, _e_, _f_1, _ff_2, _i_, _n_, _g_, _r_ to be
      described in vol. ii, and in the Gothic version. In Burdett-Coutts
      II. 7, p. 4, also, prefixed to the Gospels, we read the following
      rubric-title to certain verses of Gregory Nazianzen: _{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}_ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~};
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}; {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.

   92 Tischendorf cites the following copies in which the Epistle to the
      Hebrews stands in the same order as in Codd. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}ABC, "H [Coislin.
      202], 17, 23, 47, 57, 71, 73 aliique." Add 77, 80, 166, 189, 196,
      264, 265, 266 (Burdett-Coutts II. 4). So in Zoega's Thebaic version.
      Epiphanius (adv. Haer. i. 42) says: {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. So Paul
      166, 281, and also Bp. Lightfoot's MSS. of the Memphitic except 7
      and 16. In the Thebaic it follows 2 Cor. See below.

   93 They are also termed {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}--evidently a popular, as well as a
      misleading name.

   94 Suicer, s. v.

   95 This was the word for a lection or lesson, and Suicer tells us that
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} were employed as equivalents. But in modern
      textual criticism, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} is used to signify the marks
      indicating lections, which are found in the margin or at the head or
      foot of pages, or the computation of their number which is often
      appended at the end of a book. See pp. 67, note 1, 69.

   96 Chrysost. in Joan. Hom. x {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}.
      Traces of these Church-lessons occur in manuscripts as early as the
      fifth and sixth centuries. Thus Cod. Alexandrinus reads Rom. xvi.
      25-27 not only in its proper place, but also at the end of ch. xiv
      where the Lectionaries place it (see p. 84). Codex Bezae prefixes to
      Luke xvi. 19 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, the proper introduction
      to the Gospel for the 5th Sunday in St. Luke. To John xiv. 1 the
      same manuscript prefixes {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}, as does our
      English Prayer Book in the Gospel for May 1. Even {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~},
      which follows {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} in Mark xiv. 41 in the same manuscript and
      other authorities, probably has the same origin.

   97 See the passages from Augustine Tract. VI. in Joan.; and Chrysost.
      Hom. VII ad Antioch.; Hom. LXIII, XLVII in Act. in Bingham's
      Antiquities, Book XIV, Chap. III. Sect. 3. Chrysostom even calls the
      arrangement {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}. The strong passage cited from Cyril
      of Jerusalem by Dean Burgon (Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark, p. 195)
      shows the confirmed practice as already settled in A.D. 348.

   98 August. Serm. CXLIII de Tempore. The few verses Luke xxiii. 39-43,
      John xix. 31-37 are merely wrought into one narrative with Matt.
      xxvii, each in its proper place. See p. 85.

   99 Besides this special meaning, Synaxarion was also employed in a
      general sense for any catalogue of Church-lessons, both for daily
      use and for Saints' days.

  100 This was naturally even more the case in countries where the Liturgy
      was not in Greek. Thus in the "Calendar of the Coptic Church"
      translated from the Arabic by Dr. S. C. Malan (1873), the only
      Feast-days identical with those given below (pp. 87-89) are Sept.
      14; Oct. 8; Nov. 8, 13, 14, 17, 25, 30; Dec. 20, 24, 25, 29; Jan. 1,
      6 (the Lord's Baptism), 22; Feb. 2, 24; March 25; April 25; May 2;
      June 19, 24, 29; July 22; Aug. 6, 25. Elsewhere the day is altered,
      even if the festival be the same; e.g. St. Thomas' Day is Oct. 6
      with the Greeks, Oct. 23 with the Copts; St. Luke's Day (Oct. 18),
      and the Beheading of the Baptist (Aug. 29), are kept by the Copts a
      day later than by the Greeks, since Aug. 29 is their New Year's Day.

  101 This system was introduced by Wetstein (N. T. 1751-52). Mill used to
      cite copies by abridgements of their names, e.g. Alex. Cant. Mont.
      &c.

  102 The _pericope adulterae_ John vii. 53-viii. 11 is omitted in all the
      copies we know on the feast of Pentecost. Whenever read it was on
      some Saint's Day (_vid. infra_, p. 87, _notes_ 2, 3).

  103 Lessons for the week in B-C. III. 24 are (2) 2 Cor. iii. 4-12. (3)
      iv. 1-6. (4) 11-18. (5) v. 10-15. (6) 15-21.

  104 In B-C. III. 42 all the Gospels for this day run into each other
      without break, e.g. John xiii. 3-17 being read _uno tenore_. Just so
      in the same manuscript stands the mixed lesson for Good Friday
      evening.

  105 The more usual indiction, which dates from Sept. 1, is manifestly
      excluded by the following rubric (Burney, 22, p. 191, and in other
      copies): {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH TONOS~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}

  106 The lesson for the Sunday after Sept. 14 is the same as that for the
      3rd Sunday in Lent.

_  109 Theodosia_ in Codex Cyprius (_see_ p. 73), with the cognate lesson,
      Luke vii. 36-50, which lesson is read in Gale for Sept. 16, Euphemia
      and in Evst. 261 (B.M. Addit. 11,840). In Burdett-Coutts II. 7, John
      viii. 3-11 is used {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}: B-C.

  110 So Cod. Cyprius, but the Christ's Coll. Evst. removes Pelagia to
      Aug. 31, and reads John viii. 1-11.

  111 The Proto-martyr Stephen is commemorated on August 2 in Evst. 3
      (Wheeler 3).

  112 The same Saint is commemorated in the fragment of a Golden
      Evangelistarium seen at Sinai by the Rev. E. M. Young in 1864, and
      in B-C. III. 42 as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}; which (Evst. 286) is
      described in its place below.

  113 These fragments were published by Tischendorf in his Appendix Codd.
      cel. Sin. Vat. Alex. 1867. They consist of Gen. xxiii. 19-xxiv. 4;
      5-8; 10-14; 17, 18; 25-27; 30-33; 36-41; 43-46; Num. v. 26-30; vi.
      5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18; 22-27; vii. 4, 5, 12, 13; 15-26. Another leaf
      of the same manuscript, containing Lev. xxii. 3-xxiii. 22, was also
      found at Sinai by Dr. H. Bruegsch Bey, of Goettingen, and published by
      him in his Neue Bruchstuecke des Codex Sinaiticus aufgefunden in der
      Bibliothek des Sinai Klosters, 1875, but is not, after all, part of
      Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}. Another morsel, containing Gen. xxiv. 9, 10, and 41-43, now
      at St. Petersburg, really belongs to it.

  114 J. Rendel Harris, New Testament Autographs, Baltimore (without
      date), an original and ingenious contribution to textual criticism;

      same author, Fellow of Clare College, and Reader in Palaeography at

  116 It has been suggested that this strange mode of division originated
      in the reluctance of scribes to begin a new line with any
      combination of letters which could not commence a Greek word, and to
      end a line with any letter which is not a vowel, or a liquid, or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~},
      or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~} before another consonant, except in the case of Proper Names
      (Journal of Sacred Literature, April 1863, p. 8). Certainly the
      general practice in Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} bears out the rule thus laid down, though
      a few instances to the contrary occur here and there (Scrivener,
      Collation of Cod. Sinaiticus, Introd. p. xiv, note). Hort refers it
      to a grammatical rule not to end a line with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} or {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}, or a
      consonant preceding an elided vowel, as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}. New Testament in
      Greek, p. 315.

  117 But {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA~}, for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} occur even in the Septuagint Cod.
      Sarravianus, also of the fourth century, in which copy numerals are
      quite constantly expressed by letters.

  118 Tischendorf, however, describes {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}a as "et formis et atramento primam
      manum tantum non adaequans," and its writer has been regarded by
      some as little inferior in value to the first scribe. Thus Dr. Hort
      (Introd. p. 271), calling him the "corrector" proper, states that he
      "made use of an excellent exemplar, and the readings which he
      occasionally uses take high rank as authority." Hort considers {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}b as
      mixed, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}c as still more so.

  119 I am indebted for the following Memoranda on Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} to the kindness
      of the Dean of Derry and Raphoe.

      i. It is demonstrable that the Eusebian Sections and Canons on the
      margin are contemporaneous with the text. For they are wanting from
      leaves 10 and 15. Now these leaves are conjugate; and they have been
      (on other grounds) noted by Tischendorf as written not by the scribe
      of the body of the N. T., but by one of his colleagues ("D") who
      wrote part of the O. T. and acted as Diorthota of the N. T. It thus
      appears that, after the marginal numbers had been inserted, the
      sheet containing leaves 10 and 15 was cancelled, and rewritten by a
      contemporary hand. The numbers must therefore have been written
      before the MS. was completed and issued.

      ii. The exemplar whence these numbers were derived, differed
      considerably from that which the text follows. For, in some cases,
      the sectional numbers indicate the presence of passages which are
      absent from the text. E.g. St. Matt. xvi. 2, 3, which is sect. 162,
      is wanting; and 162 is assigned to ver. 4, while the wrong canon (5
      for 6) betrays the presence in the canonizer's exemplar of the
      passage omitted by the scribe. The same is true of St. Mark xv. 28
      (in which case the scribe is "D").

      iii. The scribe who wrote the text was unacquainted with the
      Eusebian sections. For the beginning of a section is not marked, as
      in A and most subsequent MSS., by a division of the text and a
      larger letter. On the contrary the text is divided into paragraphs
      quite independent of the Eusebian divisions, which often begin in
      the middle of a line, and are marked merely by two dots (:) in
      vermilion, inserted no doubt by the rubricator as he entered the
      numbers in the margin. The fact that the numbers of the sections as
      well as of the canons (not as in other MSS. of the Canons only) are
      in vermilion, points the same way.

      iv. From the above it follows, (1) That while Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} proves the
      absence from its exemplar of certain passages, its margin proves the
      presence of some of them in a contemporaneous exemplar; (2) that
      while on the one hand the Eusebian numbers, coeval with the text,
      show that the MS. cannot be dated before the time of Eusebius, on
      the other hand the form of the text, inasmuch as it is not arranged
      so as to suit them, and as it differs from the text implied in them,
      marks for it a date little, if at all, after his time--certainly many
      years earlier than A.

      v. As regards the omission of the verses of St. Mark xvi. 9-20, it
      is not correct to assert that Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} betrays no sign of
      consciousness of their existence. For the last line of ver. 8,
      containing only the letters {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}, has the rest of the space (more
      than half the width of the column) filled up with a minute and
      elaborate "arabesque" executed with the pen in ink and vermilion,
      nothing like which occurs anywhere else in the whole MS. (O. T. or
      N. T.), such spaces being elsewhere invariably left blank. By this
      careful filling up of the blank, the scribe (who here is the
      diorthota "D"), distinctly shows that the omission is not a case of
      "non-interpolation," but of deliberate excision. John Gwynn, May 21,
      1883.

  120 He would have written about 20,000 separate uncial letters every
      day. Compare the performance of that veritable Briareus, Nicodemus {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH DASIA~}
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, who transcribed the Octateuch (in cursive characters
      certainly) now at Ferrara (Holmes, Cod. 107), beginning his task on
      the 8th of June, and finishing it the 15th of July, A.D. 1334,
      "working very hard"--as he must have done indeed (Burgon, _Guardian_,
      Jan. 29, 1873).

  121 This opinion, first put forth by Tischendorf in his N. T. Vaticanum
      1867, Proleg. pp. xxi-xxiii, was minutely discussed in the course of
      a review of that book in the _Christian Remembrancer_, October 1867,
      by the writer of these pages. Although Dr. Hort labours to show that
      no critical inferences ought to be drawn from this identity of the
      scribe of Cod. B with the writer of six conjugate leaves of Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}
      (being three pairs in three distinct quires, one of them containing
      the conclusion of St. Mark's Gospel), he is constrained to admit
      that "the fact appears to be sufficiently established by concurrent
      peculiarities in the form of one letter, punctuation, avoidance of
      contractions, and some points of orthography" (Introduction, p.
      213). The internal evidence indeed, though relating to minute
      matters, is cumulative and irresistible, and does not seem to have
      been noticed by Tischendorf, who drew his conclusions from the
      handwriting only.

  122 Prothero (Memoir of H. Bradshaw, pp. 92-118) reprints a letter of
      Bradshaw from _Guardian_, Jan. 28, 1863, worth studying:--"Simonides
      died hard, and to the very end was supported by a few dupes of his
      ingenious mendacity." (p. 99.)

  123 A more favourable estimate of the ecclesiastical policy of Cyril
      (who was murdered by order of the Sultan in 1638, aet. 80) is
      maintained by Dr. Th. Smith, "Collectanea de Cyrillo Lucario,
      Patriarcha Constantinopolitano," London 1707.

  124 I.e. "Memorant hunc Librum scriptu fuisse ma-nu Theclae Martyris."
      On the page over against Cyril's note the same hand writes
      "videantur literae ejusde Cyrill: Lucar: ad Georgium Episco Cant"
      [Abbot]; _Harl_: 823, 2. quae extant in Clementis Epistolis ad
      Corinthios editionis Colomesii Lond. 1687 8o page 354 &c.

  125 Not to mention a few casual _lacunae_ here and there, especially in
      the early leaves of the manuscript, the lower part of one leaf has
      been cut out, so that Gen. xiv. 14-17; xv. 1-5; 16-20; xvi. 6-9 are
      wanting. The leaf containing 1 Sam. xii. 20-xiv. 9, and the nine
      leaves containing Ps. 1. 20-lxxx. 10 (Engl.) are lost.

  126 Yet we may be sure that these two leaves did not contain the
      Pericope Adulterae, John vii. 58-viii. 11. Taking the Elzevir N. T.
      of 1624, which is printed without breaks for the verses, we count
      286 lines of the Elzevir for the two leaves of Cod. A preceding its
      defect, 288 lines for the two which follow it; but 317 lines for the
      two missing leaves. Deduct the thirty lines containing John vii.
      53-viii. 11, and the result for the lost leaves is 287.

  127 An excellent facsimile of A is given in the Facsimiles of the
      Palaeographical Society, Plate 106; others in Woide's New Testament
      from this MS. (1786), and in Baber's Old Test. (1816). Two specimens
      from the first Epistle of Clement are exhibited in Jacobson's Patres
      Apostolici, vol. i. p. 110, 1838 (1863); and one in Cassell's Bible
      Dict. vol. i. p. 49.

  128 Notice especially what Tregelles says of the Codex Augiensis
      (Tregelles' Horne's Introd. vol. iv. p. 198), where the difference
      of hand in the leaves removed from their proper place is much more
      striking than any change in Cod. Alexandrinus. Yet even in that case
      it is likely that one scribe only was engaged. It should be stated,
      however, that Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, who, edits the autotype
      edition, believes that the hand changed at the beginning of St.
      Luke, and altered again at 1 Cor. x. 8. His reasons appear to us
      precarious and insufficient, and he seems to cut away the ground
      from under him when he admits (Praef. p. 9) that "sufficient
      uniformity is maintained to make it difficult to decide the exact
      place where a new hand begins."

  129 Tischendorf, Septuagint, Proleg. p. lxv, cites with some approval
      Grabe's references (Proleg. Cap. i. pp. 9-12) to Gregory Nazianzen
      [d. 389], three of whose Epistles are written to a holy virgin of
      that name (of course not the martyr), to whose {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} at Seleucia
      he betook himself, the better to carry out his very sincere _nolo
      episcopari_ on the death of his father Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus:
      {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} | {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} | {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}.{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}.

  130 The last Arabic numeral in the Old Testament is 641, the first in
      the New Testament 667.

  131 Very interesting is Whitelock's notice of a design which was never
      carried out, under the date of March 13, 1645. "The Assembly of
      Divines desired by some of their brethren, sent to the House [of
      Commons] that Mr. Patrick Young might be encouraged in the printing
      of the Greek Testament much expected and desired by the learned,
      especially beyond seas; and an ordinance was read for printing and
      publishing the Old Testament of the Septuagint translation, wherein
      Mr. Young had formerly taken pains and had in his hand, as library
      keeper at St. James's, an original _Teeta_ [sic] Bible of that
      translation" (Memorials, p. 197, ed. 1732).

  134 The "Epistle" of Cardinal Carafa to Sixtus V, and the Preface to the
      Reader by the actual editor Peter Morinus, both of which Tischendorf
      reprints in full (Septuagint, Proleg. pp. xxi-xxvii), display an
      amount of critical skill and discernment quite beyond their age, and
      in strange contrast with the signal mismanagement in regard to the
      revision of the Latin Vulgate version under the auspices of the same
      Pope.

  135 In Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and 1 Kings i. 1-xix. 11, there
      are forty-four lines in a column; and in 2 Paralip. x. 16-xxvi. 13,
      there are forty lines in a column.

  136 The writer of the Preface to the sixth volume of the Roman edition
      of 1881 (apparently Fabiani), is jubilant over his discovery of the
      name of this retracer ("eruditissimi et patientissimi viri," as he
      is pleased to call him, p. xviii) in the person of Clement the Monk,
      who has written his name twice in the book in a scrawl of the
      fifteenth century. But mere resemblance in the ink is but a lame
      proof of identity, and Fabiani recognizes some other correctors,
      whom he designates as B4, posterior to the mischievous
      "instaurator."

  137 Hug says _none_, but Tischendorf (Cod. Frid.-Aug. Proleg. p. 9)
      himself detected two in a part that the second scribe had left
      untouched; and not a very few elsewhere (N. T. Vatican. Proleg. pp.
      xx, xxi, 1867); though a break often occurs with no stop by either
      hand. In the much contested passage Rom. ix. 5, Dr. Vance Smith
      ("Revised Texts and Margins," p. 84, note), while confidently
      claiming the stop after {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} in Cod. A as _prima manu_, and
      noticing the space after the word in Cod. Ephraemi (C), admits that
      "in the Vatican the originality of the stops may be doubtful." In
      the judgement of Fabiani, "vix aliqua primo exscriptori tribuenda"
      (Praef. N. T. Vat. 1881, p. xviii).

  138 The publication of the Roman edition (1868-81) enables us to add
      (Abbot, _ubi supra_, p. 193) that the blessings of the twelve
      patriarchs in Gen. xlix are in separate paragraphs numbered from A
      to IB, that the twenty-two names of the unclean birds Deut. xiv.
      12-18, twenty-five kings in Josh. xii. 10-22, eleven dukes in 1 Chr.
      i. 51-54, each stand in a separate line. In Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, especially in
      the New Testament, this arrangement {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} is much more frequent
      than in Cod. B, although the practice is in some measure common to
      both.

  139 The Roman edition (1868-81) also makes known to us that in the Old
      Testament two columns are left blank between Nehemiah and the
      Psalms, which could not have been otherwise, inasmuch as the Psalms
      are written {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} with but two columns on a page. Between Tobit
      and Hosea (which book stands first of the Prophetical writings) a
      column is very naturally left blank, and two columns at the end of
      Daniel, with whose prophecy the Old Testament concludes. But these
      peculiarities obviously bear no analogy to the case of the end of
      St. Mark's Gospel.

  140 See above, pp. 49-51.

  141 The writer of the Preface to the Roman edition (vol. vi. Praef. p.
      9, 1881) vainly struggles to maintain the opposite view, because the
      Cardinal, in his Preface to the Complutensian N. T., speaks about
      "adhibitis Vaticanis libris," as if there was but one there.

  142 Rulotta's labours are now printed in Bentleii Critica Sacra by Mr.
      A. A. Ellis, 1862, pp. 121-154.

  143 Thus the correspondence of Codex B with what St. Basil (c. Eunom.
      ii. 19) states he found in the middle of the fourth century, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, in Eph. i. 1, viz. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI AND PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} without {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}
      {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~}, though now read only in this and the Sinaitic manuscript
      _prima manu_, and in one cursive copy (Cod. 67) _secunda manu_,
      seems in itself of but little weight. Another point that has been
      raised is the position of the Epistle to the Hebrews. But this
      argument can apply only to the elder document from which the Vatican
      MS. was taken, and wherein this book unquestionably followed that to
      the Galatians. In Cod. B it _always_ stood in its present place,
      after 2 Thess., as in the Codices cited p. 74, note.

  144 Besides the twenty-five readings Tischendorf observed himself,
      Cardinal Mai supplied him with thirty-four more for his N. T. of
      1849. His seventh edition of 1859 was enriched by 230 other readings
      furnished by Albert Dressel in 1855.

  145 "They would not let me open it," he adds, "without searching my
      pocket, and depriving me of pen, ink, and paper.... If I looked at a
      passage too long the two _prelati_ would snatch the book out from my
      hand." Tregelles, Lecture on the Historic Evidence of the N. T., p.
      84.

  146 The great gap in the Pauline Epistles is filled up from Vatic. 1761
      (Act. 158, Paul. 192) of the eleventh century.

  147 Other editions of the Vatican N. T. appeared at Ratisbon; at Leyden
      (1860) by A. Kuenen and C. G. Cobet, with a masterly Preface by the
      latter; and at Berlin (1862) by Philip Buttmann, furnished with an
      Appendix containing the varying results of no less than nine
      collations, eight of which we have described in the text, the ninth
      being derived from Lachmann's Greek Testament (1742, 1850), whose
      readings were all obtained second-hand. Tischendorf does not much
      commend the accuracy of Buttmann's work.

  148 "Angelus Mai, quamquam, ut in proverbio est, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, non is erat cui tanta res recte mandari posset:"
      Kuenen and Cobet, N. T. Vat. Praef. p. 1. Tischendorf too, in his
      over querulous Responsa ad Calumnias Romanas &c., 1870, p. 11, is
      not more than just in alleging "Angelum Maium in editionibus suis
      Codicis Vaticani alienissimum se praebuisse ab omni subtiliore rei
      palaeographicae scientia, ac tantum non ignarum earum legum ad quas
      is codex in usum criticum edendus esset." The defence set up for Mai
      in the Preface to the Roman volume of 1881, was that he intended to
      produce only a new edition of the "authentic" Septuagint of 1586-7,
      chiefly for the use of Greek-speaking Catholics.

  149 The Dean himself on Feb. 20, 1861, and for four subsequent days,
      "went twice over the doubtful passages and facsimilized most of the
      important various readings," in spite of much opposition from the
      Librarian, who "insisted that our order from Antonelli, although it
      ran 'per verificare,' to verify passages, only extended to seeing
      the Codex, not to using it." (Life by his Widow, pp. 310, 315.)

  150 "Novum Testamentum Vaticanum post Angeli Maii aliorumque imperfectos
      labores ex ipso codice edidit Ae. F. C. Tischendorf." Lipsiae, 4to,
      1867.

  151 To his hand Tischendorf assigns seven readings, Matt. xiii. 52; xiv.
      5; xvi. 4; xxii. 10; xxvii. 4. Luke iii. 1 (_bis_), 7. "For some six
      centuries after it was written B appears to have undergone no
      changes in its text except from the hand of the 'corrector,' the
      'second hand' " (Hort, Introd. p. 270). What then of B2?

  152 It must surely be to these, the earliest scribes, that Cobet refers
      when he uses language that would not be at all applicable to the
      case of B2 or B3: "In Vaticano duorum librorum veterum testimonia
      continentur, et nihilo plus in prima manu quam in secunda inest
      auctoritatis ac fidei. Utriusque unaquaeque lectio ex se ipsa
      spectanda ponderandaque est, et si hoc ages, modo hanc modo illam
      animadvertes esse potiorem. Hoc autem in primis firmiter tenendum
      est, non esse secundae manus lectiones correctoris alicujus
      suspiciones aut conjecturas, sive illae sunt acutiores sive
      leviores, sed quidquid a secunda manu correctum, mutatum, deletum
      esse Maius referat, id omne haud secus atque id quod prior manus
      dederit, perantiqui cujusdam Codicis fide nixum esse." (N. T. Vat.
      Praef. p. xxvi.)

  153 It may be mere oversight that in Matt. xxvii. 4 he does not say in
      1867 of what hand the marginal {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} is: in his eighth edition
      (1865) he adjudges it to B2. In Matt. xxiv. 23 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} and ver. 32
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} he gives to B3 in 1867 what he had assigned to B2 in 1865. The
      Roman Commentary gives no light in the other places, but assigns
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} to B2, B3.

  154 "Bibliorum Sacrorum Graecus Codex Vaticanus, Auspice Pio IX
      Pontifice Maximo, collatis studiis Caroli Vercellone Sodalis
      Barnabitae, et Josephi Cozza Monachi Basiliani editus. Romae typis
      et impensis S. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide," square folio,
      1868.

  155 The feeble rejoinder of the Roman editors was followed up in 1870 by
      Tischendorf's Responsa ad Calumnias Romanas, &c., the tone of which
      pamphlet we cannot highly praise.

  156 This practice is plainly confessed to in the Preface to the volume
      of 1881 (p. xvi) without any consciousness of the fatal mistake
      which it involves: "Facies libri Vaticani repraesentata est [ut] ea
      primum omnia apparerent, quae a priore codicis notario profecta
      adhuc manifesto perspiciuntur, tum ea tantum a posterioribus sive
      emendatoribus, sive instauratoribus commutata adderentur, quae sine
      scripturae confusione legi possent."

  157 In 1 Cor. vii. 29 Vercellone joins {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~} closely, but
      Tischendorf leaves a space between them, with a middle point, which
      he expressly states to be _prima manu_. Again, in ver. 34 Vercellone
      joins {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} with the following {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}. Tischendorf in 1867 (but
      not in his last edition of the N. T.) interposes a point and space.
      In these _minutiae_ Vercellone, who was not working against time,
      may be presumed to be the more accurate of the two. The editors of
      the sixth volume have no note at either place. Tischendorf detects
      an error of Vercellone, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~} Heb. ix. 1, but this has been
      corrected by the hand in some copies of the Roman volume, as also in
      the Commentary.

  158 His reasons for regarding the Sinaitic manuscript as the younger
      (_see_ p. 89, note 2) are valid enough so far as they go (Praef. p.
      vi): its initial letters stand out more from the line of the
      writing; abridgements of words are fewer and less simple; it
      contains the Ammonian sections and Eusebian canons instead of the
      antiquated divisions of its rival, and the text is broken up into
      smaller paragraphs. Tregelles, who had seen both copies, used to
      plead the fresher appearance of the Sinaitic, contrasted with the
      worn look of the Vatican MS.; but then its extensive hiatus proves
      that the latter had been less carefully preserved.

      notes, "Codices enim membranacei fere per quaterniones digerebantur,
      hoc est quatuor folia simul compacta, ut terniones tria sunt folia
      simul compacta. Et quaterniones quidem sedecim habebant paginas,
      terniones vero duodenas." But now that we have come to know that
      Cod. B is arranged in quires of five sheets (_see_ p. 105), that
      manuscript will hardly answer to the description {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}
      (see p. 27, note 1) as Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} does. Indeed Canon Cook (Revised
      Version, &c., p. 162) objects to Valesius' explanation altogether,
      on the ground that his sense would rather require {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}

      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~} ("four by four") exactly describe the arrangement of three
      columns on a page in Cod. B, and four on a page in Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}. The Canon
      has since observed that the same view is maintained by O. von
      Gebhardt ("Bibel-text" in Herzog's Real-Encyklopaedie, Leipsic 1878,
      second edition). On the other hand Archdeacon Palmer, in an obliging
      communication made to me, comparing the words {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}

      Eusebius' compliance (c. 37) by means of Constantine's directions
      (c. 36), is inclined to refer {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~} to {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, as if
      it were "we sent abroad the collections [of writings] in richly
      adorned cases, three or four in a case." It will probably be thought
      that the expression is on the whole too obscure to be depended on
      for any controversial purposes. It is safer to argue that if the
      sections and canons extant in Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} be by a contemporary hand
      (_see_ p. 93, and Dean Gwynn's _Memoranda_ in our _Addenda_ for that
      page), that circumstance, the great antiquity of the manuscript
      considered, will confirm the probability of Eusebius' connexion with
      it. Eusebius agrees also with {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} in omitting {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}, Matt. vii. 13,
      and knew of copies, not however the best or with his approval, which
      inserted {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} before {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} in Matt. xiii. 35: {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} being the
      only uncial which exhibits that reading. So again Eusebius after
      Origen maintains the impossible number {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} of {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} and a
      few others in Luke xxiv. 13. Dr. C. R. Gregory, Prolegomena, pp.
      347, 348, inclines to the belief that B and {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} were among the fifty
      MSS. sent by Eusebius to Constantino about A.D. 331-2. Canon Cook's
      entire argument (Revised Version of the First Three Gospels (1882),
      pp. 160-165) should be consulted.

  159 Dublin University Magazine, Nov. 1859, p. 620. Even Bishop
      Lightfoot, a strong and consistent admirer of the manuscript, speaks
      of its "impatience of apparently superfluous words" (Epistle to the
      Colossians, p. 316). Dr. Hort (Introduction, p. 235) pleads that
      such facts "have no bearing on either the merits or the demerits of
      the scribe of B, except as regards the absolutely singular readings
      of B," whereas multitudes of these omissions are found in other good
      documents.

  160 Dean Burgon cites four specimens of such repetitions: Matt. xxi. 4,
      five words written twice over; ib. xxvi. 56-7, six words; Luke i.
      37, three words or one line; John xvii. 18, six words. These,
      however, are but a few out of many. Nor is Tischendorf's judgement
      at variance with our own. Speaking of some supposed or possible
      gross _errata_ of the recent Roman edition, he puts in the
      significant proviso "tamen haec quoque satis cum universa scripturae
      Vaticanae vitiositate conveniunt" (Appendix N. T. Vaticani, 1869, p.
      xvii).

  161 The latest Roman editors incline to an Egyptian origin, rather than
      one suggested in Magna Graecia, but the only fresh reason they
      allege can have very slight weight, namely, that two of the damaged
      leaves have been repaired by pieces of papyrus. The learned Ceriani
      of Milan believes that Cod. B was written in Italy, Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} in
      Palestine or Syria (Quarterly Review, April, 1882, p. 355). The
      supposed Eusebian origin of both has been already stated.

  162 As this manuscript is of first-rate importance it is necessary to
      subjoin a full list of the passages it contains, that it may not be
      cited _e silentio_ for what it does not exhibit: Matt. i. 2-v. 15;
      vii. 5-xvii. 26; xviii. 28-xxii. 20; xxiii. 17-xxiv. 10; xxiv.
      45-xxv. 30; xxvi. 22-xxvii. 11; xxvii. 47-xxviii. 14: Mark i. 17-vi.
      31; viii. 5-xii. 29; xiii. 19-xvi. 20: Luke i. 2-ii. 5; ii. 42-iii.
      21; iv. 25-vi. 4; vi. 37-vii. 16 or 17; viii. 28-xii. 3; xix. 42-xx.
      27; xxi. 21-xxii. 19; xxiii. 25-xxiv. 7; xxiv. 46-53: John i. 1-41;
      iii. 33-v. 16; vi. 38-vii. 3; viii. 34-ix. 11; xi. 8-46; xiii.
      8-xiv. 7; xvi. 21-xviii. 36; xx. 26-xxi. 25: Acts i. 2-iv. 3; v.
      35-x. 42; xiii. 1-xvi. 36; xx. 10-xxi. 30; xxii. 21-xxiii. 18; xxiv.
      15-xxvi. 19; xxvii. 16-xxviii. 4: James i. 1-iv. 2: 1 Pet. i. 2-iv.
      6: 2 Pet. i. 1-1 John iv. 2: 3 John 3-15: Jude 3-25: Rom. i. 1-ii.
      5; iii. 21-ix. 6; x. 15-xi. 31; xiii. 10-1 Cor. vii. 18; ix. 6-xiii.
      8; xv. 40-2 Cor. x. 8: Gal. i. 20-vi. 18: Eph. ii. 18-iv. 17: Phil.
      i. 22-iii. 5: Col. i. 1-1 Thess. ii. 9: Heb. ii. 4-vii. 26; ix.
      15-x. 24; xii. 15-xiii. 25: 1 Tim. iii. 9-v. 20; vi. 21-Philem. 25:
      Apoc. i. 2-iii. 19; v. 14-vii. 14; vii. 17-viii. 4; ix. 17-x. 10;
      xi. 3-xvi. 13; xviii. 2-xix. 5. Of all the books only 2 John and 2
      Thess. are entirely lost; about thirty-seven chapters of the
      Gospels, ten of the Acts, forty-two of the Epistles, eight of the
      Apocalypse have perished. The order of the books is indicated, p.
      74.

  163 The following Medicean manuscripts seem to have come into the Royal
      Library by the same means; Evan. 16, 19, 42, 317. Act. 12, 126.
      Paul. 164. It appears therefore that Cod. C was not one of the
      manuscripts bought of Marshal Strozzi (Pattison, Life of Is.
      Casaubon, p. 202), which were only 800 out of the 4,500 which
      belonged to the Queen (ibid. p. 204).

  164 Bp. Chr. Wordsworth (N. T. Part iv. p. 159) reminds us of Wetstein's
      statement (Bentley's Correspondence, p. 501) that it had cost him
      two hours to read one page; so that his L50 were not so easily
      earned, after all. This collation is preserved in Trinity College
      Library, B. xvii. 7, 9.

  165 Dr. Hort, with his ever ready acuteness, draws certain inferences to
      be discussed hereafter from the fact that a displacement in the
      leaves of the exemplar wherefrom the Apocalypse in Cod. C was
      copied, which the scribe of C did not notice, proves it to have been
      a book of nearly 120 small leaves, and accordingly that it "formed a
      volume either to itself or without considerable additions"
      (Introduction, p. 268).

  166 Very remarkable is the language of the University in returning
      thanks for the gift: "Nam hoc scito, post unicae scripturae
      sacratissimam cognitionem, nullos unquam ex omni memoria temporum
      scriptores extitisse, quos memorabili viro Johanni Calvino tibique
      praeferamus." Scrivener's Codex Bezae, Introd. p. vi.

  167 Matt. i. 1-20; vi. 20-ix. 2; xxvii. 2-12: John i. 16-iii. 26: Acts
      viii. 29-x. 14; xxi. 2-10; 15-18 (though Ussher, Mill, Wetstein and
      Dickinson cite several readings from these verses, which must have
      been extant in their time); xxii. 10-20; 29-xxviii. 31 in the
      _Greek_: Matt. i. 1-11; vi. 8-viii. 27; xxvi. 65-xxvii. 1: John i.
      1-iii. 16: Acts viii. 20-x. 4; xx. 31-xxi. 2; 7-10; xxii. 2-10;
      xxii. 20-xxviii. 31 in the _Latin_. The original writing has
      perished in the following, which are supplied by a scribe of not
      earlier than the ninth century: Matt. iii. 7-16: Mark xvi. 15-20:
      John xviii. 14-xx. 13 in the _Greek_: Matt. ii. 21-iii. 7: Mark xvi.
      6-20: John xviii. 2-xx. 1 in the _Latin_. A fragment, containing a
      few words of Matt. xxvi. 65-67 (Latin) and xxvii. 2 (Greek), (Fol.
      96, Scrivener), was overlooked by Kipling.

  168 It is surprising that any one should have questioned the identity of
      Cod. D with Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}. No other manuscript has been discovered
      which agrees with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} in the many singular readings and arbitrary
      additions in support of which it is cited by Stephen. That he
      omitted so many more than he inserted is no argument against their
      identity, since we know that he did the same in the case of his {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}
      (the Complutensian Polyglott) and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} (Codex L, Paris 62). The great
      inaccuracy of Stephen's _margin_ (the text is much better revised)
      is so visible from these and other well-ascertained instances that
      no one ought to wonder if {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} is alleged occasionally (not often) for
      readings which D does not contain. On a careful analysis of all the
      variations imputed to {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} by Stephen, they will be found to amount to
      389 in the parts written in the original hand, whereof 309 are
      alleged quite correctly, forty-seven a little loosely, while in
      eight instances corrected readings are regarded in error as from the
      original scribe. Of the twenty-five places which remain, all but
      three had been previously discovered in other copies used by
      Stephen, so that {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} in their case has been substituted by mistake
      for some other numeral. One of the three remaining has recently been
      accounted for by Mr. A. A. Vansittart, who has found {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~}
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} added to {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} (Luke viii. 18 from Matt.
      xiii. 12) in Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} or Coislin 200 at Paris (No. 38, of the
      Gospels). I do not find {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} cited by Stephen after Acts xx. 24,
      except indeed in Rom. iii. 10 (with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}), in manifest error, just as
      in the Apocalypse xix. 14 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK OXIA~} (No. 6 of the Gospels), which does not
      contain this book, is cited instead of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK OXIA~}; or as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} is quoted in
      xiii. 4, _but not elsewhere in the Apocalypse_, undoubtedly in the
      place of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}; or as {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER STIGMA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}, which had broken off at xvii. 8, reappears
      instead of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK OXIA~} in xx. 3. In the various places named in the last
      note, wherein the Greek of Cod. D is lost, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} is cited only at Matt.
      xxvii. 3, beyond question instead of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}; and for _part_ of the
      reading in Acts ix. 31, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} (to which the whole rightly belongs)
      being alleged for the other part. In John xix. 6, indeed, where the
      original Greek is missing, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} is cited, but it is for a reading
      actually extant in the modern hand which has there supplied Codex
      D's defects.

  169 "Ils s'emparerent des portes et de tous les lieux forts ... non pas
      sans leur impietes et barbaries accoutumees envers les choses
      saintes" (Mezeray, Hist. de France, tom. iii. p. 87, 1685).
      Accordingly, travellers are shown to this day the bones of unclean
      animals which the Huguenots, in wanton mockery, then mingled with
      the presumed remains of St. Irenaeus and the martyrs of Lyons.

  170 One cannot understand why Wetstein (N. T. Proleg. vol. i, 30) should
      have supposed that Beza _prevaricated_ as to the means whereby he
      procured his manuscript. He was not the man to be at all ashamed of
      spoiling the Philistines, and the bare mention of Lyons in connexion
      with the year 1562 would have been abundantly intelligible scarce
      twenty years afterwards. It is however remarkable that in the last
      edition of his Annotations (1598) he nowhere calls it Codex
      Lugdunensis, but _Claromontanus_ (notes on Luke xix. 26; Acts xx.
      3); for, though it might be natural that Beza, at eighty years of
      age and after the lapse of so long a time, should confound the Lyons
      copy with his own Codex Claromontanus of St. Paul's Epistles (D);
      yet the only way in which we can account for the Codex Bezae being
      collated in _Italy_ for Stephen, is by adopting Wetstein's
      suggestion that it was the actual copy ("antiquissimum codicem
      Graecum") taken to the Council of Trent in 1546 by William a Prato,
      Bishop of Clermont in Auvergne, to confirm the Latin reading in John
      xxi. 22 "sic eum volo," which D alone may seem to do. Some learned
      man ({~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} does not well suit his son Henry) might
      have sent to Robert Stephen from Tren the readings of a manuscript
      to which attention had been thus specially directed.

  171 Not more than eighty-three typographical errors have been detected
      in Kipling throughout his difficult task, whereof sixteen are in his
      Annotations, &c.

  172 In St. Luke 136 (143 Lat.): in what remains of St. Matthew 583 (590
      Lat.), of St. Mark 148, of St. John 165 (168 Lat.), of the Acts 235.
      The later {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}, indicated by [symbol] (_see_ p. 51, note 3),
      though forty-five out of the forty-nine are firmly and neatly made,
      and often resemble in colour the ink of the original scribe, can be
      shown to be full four centuries later (Scrivener, Cod. Bezae,
      Introd. p. xxviii).

  173 Bradshaw (Prothero's Memoirs, p. 97) in a letter to the _Guardian_,
      Jan. 28, 1863, writes thus:--"I saw Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} at Leipsig _per_
      Tischendorf. I had been curious to know whether it was written in
      even quaternions throughout, like the Cod. Bezae, or in a series of
      fasciculi, each ending with a quire of varying size, like the Cod.
      Alexandrinus, and I found the latter to be the case. This,
      by-the-bye, is sufficient to prove"--why, is not quite clear--"that it
      cannot be the volume which Dr. Simonides speaks of having written at
      Mount Athos."

  174 Yet {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI~} (Beratinus) and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} (Rossanensis) contain St. Matthew and St.
      Mark, and are probably a little older than D.

  175 H. C. Hoskier, Collation of Cod. 604, &c. Appendix F. Mr. Hoskier
      saw the MS. on May 18, 1886.

  176 In our facsimile (No. 21), over against the beginning of Mark xvi.
      8, is set the number of the section ({~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA~} or 233), above the
      corresponding Eusebian canon (B or 2).

  177 Dr. Hort more exactly reckons that these leaves apparently contain
      Mark vi. 53-vii. 4; vii. 21-viii. 32; ix. 1-x. 43; xi. 7-xii. 19;
      xiv. 25-xv. 22 (_Addenda and Corrigenda_ to Tregelles's N. T., p.
      1019), adding that Tischendorf had access also to a few verses
      preserved in the collections of the Russian Bishop Porphyry. They
      are published in Duchesne's "Archives des Missions scientifiques et
      litteraires" (Paris, 1877), 3e ser. tom. iii. pp. 386-419.

  178 These songs, with thirteen others from the Old Testament and
      Apocrypha, though _partially_ written in uncial letters, are
      included in a volume of Psalms and Hymns, whose prevailing character
      is early cursive.

  179 From Tischendorf's copy of Od Dr. Caspar Rene Gregory has gathered
      readings in Heb. v. 8-vi. 10, and sent them to Dr. Hort.

  180 I.e., twenty lines on a page, according to the form used in this
      edition.

  185 Codex R contains Luke i. 1-13; i. 69-ii. 4; 16-27; iv. 38-v. 5; v.

  186 For the Coptic style of the letters Tischendorf compares a double
      palimpsest leaf in the British Museum, containing 1 Kings viii.
      58-ix. 1, which he assigns to the fifth century, although the
      capital letters stand out a little, and are slightly larger than the
      rest (Monum. sacr. ined. vol. ii. Proleg. p. xliv). But both Dr.
      Wright and Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, from their great experience in
      this style of writing, have come to suspect that it is usually
      somewhat less ancient than from other indications might be supposed.

  187 Tischendorf found breathings also in the palimpsest Numbers (Monum.
      sac. ined. _ubi supra_, p. xxv).

  188 I say _almost_, for Bengel's description makes it plain that this is
      the Moscow manuscript from which F. C. Gross sent him the extracts
      that Wetstein copied and numbered Evan. 87. Bengel, however, states
      that the cursive portion from John vii onwards bears the date of
      6508 or A.D. 1000. Scholz was the first to notice this identity
      (_see_ Evan. 250).

  189 Notwithstanding, the Eusebian canons have been washed out of Wb, a
      strong confirmation of what was conjectured above, p. 61.

  190 Codex X contains Matt. vi. 6, 10, 11; vii. 1-ix. 20; ix. 34-xi. 24;

      The hiatus in John ii. 22-vii. 1 is supplied on paper in a hand of
      the twelfth century; Mark xiv. 61-64; xiv. 72-xv. 4; xv. 33-xvi. 6
      are illegible in parts, and xvi. 6-8 have perished. Matt. v. 45
      survives only in the commentary.

  191 Codex Z contains Matt. i. 17-ii. 6; ii. 13-20; iv. 4-13; v. 45-vi.

  192 Not in moveable type, as a critic in the _Saturday Review_ (Aug. 20,
      1881) seems to suppose.

  193 Mr. E. H. Hansell prints in red these additional readings thus fresh
      brought to light in the Appendix to his "Texts of the oldest
      existing manuscripts of the New Testament," Oxford, 1864.

  194 "Barrett's edition shows that of the sixty-four pages of the MS.
      fifty had originally twenty-one lines to the page, and fourteen had
      twenty-three." Dr. Ezra Abbot.

  195 These are Matt. vi. 16-29; vii. 26-viii. 27; xii. 18-xiv. 15; xx.
      25-xxi. 19; xxii. 25-xxiii. 13; John vi. 14-viii. 3; xv. 24-xix. 6.

  196 In the St. Petersburg portion are all the rest of St. John, and
      Matt. i. 1-v. 31; ix. 6-xii. 18; xiv. 15-xx. 25; xxiii. 13-xxviii.
      20; or all St. Matthew except 115 verses.

  197 Dr. Gregory, Tisch. Prolegomena, p. 401, quotes Gardthausen,
      Griechische Palaeogr., Lipsiae, 1879, pp. 159, 344, as assigning
      A.D. 979 as the date.

  198 The edition was posthumous, and has prefixed to it a touching "Life"
      of two pages in length, by his brother and pupil, dwelling
      especially on Rettig's happy change in his later days from
      rationalism to a higher and spiritual life.

  199 Viz. Rom. iii. 5; 1 Cor. ii. 8; 1 Tim. ii. 4; iv. 10; vi. 4; 2 Tim.
      ii. 15. Equally strong are the notices of Aganon, who is cited eight
      times in {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}, about sixteen in G. This personage was Bishop of
      Chartres, and a severe disciplinarian, who died A.D. 941; a fact
      which does not hinder our assigning Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} to the ninth century, as
      Rettig states that all notices of him are by a later hand. There is
      the less need of multiplying proofs of this kind, as Tregelles has
      observed, a circumstance which demonstrates to a certainty the
      identity of Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~} and G. When he was at Dresden he found in Cod. G
      twelve leaves of later writing in precisely the same hand as several
      that are lithographed by Rettig, because they were attached to Cod.
      {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}. "Thus," he says, "these MSS. once formed one book; and when
      separated, some of the superfluous leaves with additional writing
      attached to the former part, and some to the latter" (Tregelles'
      Horne's Introd. vol. iv. p. 197).

  200 The portion of this manuscript contained in Paul. G was divided into
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} on the same principle by Hug (Introduction, vol. i. p. 283,
      Wait's translation).

  201 {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~} (1) is really an Evangelistary. See Evst. 493.

  205 Dean. Gywnn of Raphoe is so good as to remind me that among the
      other proper names enumerated by Wetstein and Semler as written on
      the reverse of the last leaf of this manuscript, {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA~} stands by
      itself in a hand which may be as old as the seventh century. Common
      as the name is, the fact is interesting and suggestive. For the
      orthography compare {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} Acts xvi. 12 in Cod. E.

  206 It is probable that Mill got this from "Nouvelles Observations sur
      le Texte et les Versions du Nouveau Testament," par R. Simon, Paris,
      1695.

  207 I see no force in Tischendorf's objection, that if Theodore had
      brought Cod. E to England, Bede would have used it before he came to
      write his "Expositio Retractata."

  208 The names and order of the books of the New Testament in this most
      curious and venerable list stand thus: Matthew, John, Mark, Luke,

      _Filimon_, 1, 2 Pet., James, 1, 2, 3 John, Jude, Barnabas' Ep.,

  209 Facsimiles of this manuscript are given by Semler in his edition of
      Wetstein's Prolegomena (1764, Nos. 8, 9). Bianchini's estimate of
      its age (Evangeliarium Quadruples, tom. ii. fol. 591, 2), as of the
      seventh century, is certainly too high.

  214 Boerner's son tells the tale thirty years afterwards with amusing
      querulousness in his Catalogus Bibl. Boern. Lips. 1754, p. 6, cited
      by Matthaei Cod. Boern. p. xviii. But there must have been some
      misunderstanding on both sides, for it appears from a manuscript
      note in his copy of the Oxford N. T. of 1675 (Trin. Coll. B. xvii.
      8), that Bentley considered Cod. G his own property; since after
      describing Cod. F before the Epistle to the Romans as his own, and
      as commencing at Rom. iii. 19, he adds "Variae lectiones ex altero
      _nostro_ MSto, ejusdem veteris exemplaris apographo."

  216 By John O'Donovan, Editor of Irish Annals. I have been favoured with
      corrections by the late Dr. Todd, of Trinity College, Dublin, and
      recently by the Rev. Robert King of Ballymena, whose version I have
      ventured to adopt.

      Teicht do roim [teicht do roim]: To come to Rome, to come to Rome,
      Mor saido becic torbai: Much of trouble, little of profit,
      Inri chondaigi hifoss: The thing thou seekest here,
      Manimbera latt ni fog bai: If thou bring not with thee, thou findest
      not.

      Mor bais mor baile: Great folly, great madness,
      Mor coll ceille mor mire: Great ruin of sense, great insanity,
      Olais airchenn teicht doecaib: Since thou hast set out for death,
      Beith fo etoil maic Maire.: That thou shouldest be in disobedience
      to the Son of Mary.

      The second stanza intimates that as the pilgrimage to Rome is at the
      risk of life, it is folly not to be at peace with Christ before we
      set out. The opening words "To come to Rome" imply that the verses
      were written there by some disappointed pilgrim. Since the
      handwriting resembles that of the interlinear Latin, Mr. King
      suggests that both may have been the work of the Scottish Bishop
      Marcus, or of his nephew Moengal (Rettig, Cod. {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA~}, Prolegomena, p.
      xx), who called at St. Gall on their return from Rome, whence Marcus
      went homewards, leaving his books and Moengal behind him.

  217 Here {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} standing to represent _au_ shows that the Greek is derived
      from the Latin, not _vice versa_.

  218 That Cod. G cannot have been taken from Cod. G appears both from
      matters connected with their respective Latin versions, and because
      F contains no trace of the vacant lines left in G at the end of Rom.
      xiv to receive ch. xvi. 25-27. But Dr. Hort (Journal of Philology,
      vol. iii. No. 5, pp. 67, 68 note) has come to think that F is a mere
      transcript of G, the scribe of the former being by far the more
      ignorant of the two. He meets our argument to the contrary stated
      above in the text, by alleging that in respect to the division of
      words F is free from no outrageous portent found in G, while it has
      to answer for many of its own. But (to take our examples from one
      open leaf) if the writer of F were so helplessly ignorant as Dr.
      Hort represents, how could he have set right G's error in 1 Tim. iv.
      7, reading {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} . {~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} for G's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}? Again, if F had
      before him an undivided manuscript, one can easily account for such
      monsters as in 1 Tim. iv. 2 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} . {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. F (_photographed
      page_), but no one could possibly have so written with G's
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} before him. That the two copies were compared
      together in after times seems evident from the fact stated in p.
      179, that Latin renderings from G stand in eighty-six places above
      the Greek of F. It was at the same time perhaps that some
      ill-divided words in F were corrected by means of a loop from the
      Greek of G: e.g. 2 Cor. i. 3 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} G, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} [symbol] {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} F; ii.

'Mr. Hort's view, that F was
      copied directly from G' (writes Bishop Lightfoot very gently,
      Journal of Philology, vol. iii. No. 6, p. 210, note), "deserves
      consideration, and may prove true, though his arguments do not seem
      quite conclusive." Lightfoot elsewhere pronounces that "the
      divergent phenomena of the two Latin texts" seem unfavourable to Dr.
      Hort's hypothesis (Ep. to Coloss. p. 355, note 2). But the latter
      still adheres to it with characteristic firmness: "we believe F to
      be as certainly in its Greek text a transcript of G [as E is of D];
      if not, it is an inferior copy of the same immediate exemplar"
      (Introd. p. 150). Yet why "inferior"?

  221 Scholz describes Codd. 196, 362, 366 of the Gospels as also written
      in red ink. See too Evan. 254.

  222 Dr. C. R. Gregory has read a few words more of this MS. Griesbach
      and Scholz number the London part as 64, the Hamburg part as 53.

  223 Griesbach (Symbol. Critic. vol. ii. p. 166) says that in the
      Harleian fragment "Iota bis tantum aut ter subscribitur, semel
      postscribitur, plerumque omittitur," overlooking the second ascript.
      Scrivener repeats this statement about {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~} subscript (Cod. Augiens.
      Introd. p. lxxii), believing he had verified it: but Tischendorf
      cannot see the subscripts, nor can Scrivener on again consulting
      Harl. 5613 for the purpose. Tregelles too says, "I have not seen a
      _sub_scribed iota in any uncial document" (Printed Text, p. 158,
      note).

  224 Tregelles, wishing to reserve the letter B for the great Codex
      Vaticanus 1209, called this copy first L (N. T. Part iv. p. iii),
      and afterwards Q (N. T. Part vi. p. i). Surely Mr. Vansittart was
      right (Journal of Philology, vol. ii. No. 3, p. 41) in protesting
      against a change so needless and inconvenient; nor has Tischendorf
      adopted it in his eighth edition of the N. T.

  225 Very many corrections have been made in the following Catalogue as
      well from investigations of my own as from information kindly
      furnished to me by Mr. H. Bradshaw, University Librarian at
      Cambridge, by Professor Hort, by Mr. A. A. Vansittart, late Fellow
      of Trinity College there [d. 1882], by Mr. W. Kelly, and especially
      by Dean Burgon, to whom the present edition is more deeply indebted
      than it would be possible to acknowledge in detail. His series of
      Letters addressed to me in the _Guardian_ newspaper (1873) contains
      but a part of the help he has afforded towards the preparation of
      this and the second edition. Ed. iii.

  227 Stephen's margin cites {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} eighty-four times in the Gospels, usually
      in company with several others, but alone in Mark vi. 20; xiv. 15;
      Luke i. 37. Since Evan. 18 or Reg. 47 contains the whole N. T., and
      Stephen cites {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} in the Acts once (ch. xvii. 5), in the Catholic
      Epistles seven times, in the Pauline twenty-seven, in the Apocalypse
      never; Reg. 47 has been suggested to have been Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}, rather
      than Cod. 8 or Reg. 49. On testing the two with Steph. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~} in eight
      places, Mr. Vansittart found that they both agreed with it in five
      (Matt. xx. 12; Mark vi. 20; x. 52; Luke vi. 37; John vi. 58), but
      that in the remaining three (Mark xii. 31; Luke i. 37; John x. 32)
      Reg. 49 agreed with {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK OXIA~}, while Reg. 47 did not.

  228 Stephen includes his {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} among the copies that {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}

      Louis would have brought or sent it to France. Mr. Vansittart tested
      Cod. 38 in Matt. xxvi. 45; Luke viii. 18; xix. 26; James v. 5; 2
      Pet. ii. 18, and found it agree in all with Stephen's {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}. What of
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, 1 John i. 5? In Luke viii. 18 that most careless editor
      misprints {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} when he means {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK KORONIS~}. See above, p. 124, note 3.

  229 "Textus ipse distinctus est in clausulas majores, seu Paragraphos;
      ad initium notatos singulos litera majuscula miniata," Mill (N. T.
      Proleg.  1445). Yet since Burgon testifies that its text "is not
      broken up into Paragraphs after all," Mill can only intend to
      designate in a roundabout way the presence of the larger chapters
      (p. 55) with their appropriate capitals.

  230 On the death of Dr. John Moore, Bishop of Ely (whose honesty as a
      book-collector is impeached, on no fair grounds, by Tew in Bridge's
      "Northamptonshire," vol. ii. p. 45, Oxon. 1791), in 1714, George I
      was induced to buy his books and manuscripts for the Library at
      Cambridge, amounting to 30,000 volumes, in acknowledgement of the
      attachment of the University to the House of Hanover. Every one
      remembers the epigram which this royal gift provoked. _See_ "Cap and
      Gown," p. 15.

  231 "We often hear," said a witty and most reverend Irish Prelate, "that
      the text of the Three Heavenly Witnesses is a _gloss_; and any one
      that will go into the College Library may see as much for himself."
      It was a little bold in Mr. Charles Forster ("A New Plea," &c., pp.
      119, 120, 139), whose zeal in defence of what he held to be the
      truth I heartily revere, to urge the authority of Dr. Adam Clarke
      for assigning this manuscript to the thirteenth century, the rather
      since almost in the same breath, he stigmatizes the Wesleyan
      minister for a "self-taught philomath" (p. 122). Dr. Clarke tells us
      fairly the grounds on which he arrived at his strange conclusion
      (Observations on the Text of the Three Divine Witnesses, Manchester,
      1805, pp. 8-10), and marvellously unsound they are. But what avails
      authority, _quum res ipsa per se clamat_? The facsimile made for Dr.
      Clarke nearly seventy years ago has been copied in Horne's
      Introduction and twenty other books, and leaves no sort of doubt
      about the date of Codex Montfortianus.

  232 This Froy or Roy is believed by Mr. Rendel Harris (Origin of Cod.
      Leic., p. 48) to be the forger of Cod. 61.

  233 Another facsimile (Luke xxi. 36-John viii. 6) is given by Abbott in
      his "Collation of Four Important Manuscripts" (_see_ Cod. 13). In
      all four the _pericope adulterae_ follows Luke xxi. 38.

  234 See the style of the Evangelistaria, as cited above, pp. 80-83;
      Matthaei's uncials BH and Birch's 178 of the Gospels, described
      below. So B.-C. ii. 13, to be described hereafter, reads in St.
      Matthew only {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK KORONIS~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}.

  235 Of the 183 manuscript volumes bequeathed by William Wake, Archbishop
      of Canterbury [1657-1737] to Christ Church (of which he had been a
      Canon), no less than twenty-eight contain portions of the Greek
      Testament. They are all described in this list from a comparison of
      Dean Gaisford's MS. Catalogue (1837) with the books themselves, to
      which Bp. Jacobson's kindness gave me access in 1861. Corrected by
      E. M., to whom similar kindness has been shown. See also "Account of
      some MSS. at Christ Church, Oxford," by the Rev. Charles H. Hoole,
      Student.

  236 These formal revisions of the Latin Bible were mainly two, one made
      by the University of Paris with the sanction of the Archbishop of
      Sens about 1230, and a rival one undertaken by the Mendicant Orders,
      through Cardinal Hugo de St. Caro (_see_ above, p. 69), and adopted
      by their general Chapter held at Paris in 1256. A previous revision
      had been made by Cardinal Nicolaus and the Cistercian Abbot
      Stephanus in 1150. A manuscript of that of 1256 was used by Lucas
      Brugensis and Simon (Wetstein, N. T. Prol. vol. i. p. 85). Canon

  239 Cod. 101 better suits Bengel's description of Uffen. 3 than 97: they
      are written on different materials, and the description of their
      respective texts will not let us suspect them to be the same.
      Wetstein never cites Cod. 101, but the addition of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} at the
      end of John viii. 27, the reading of the margin of Uffen. 3, has
      been erroneously ascribed in the critical editions to 97, not to
      101.

  240 Cod. Ravianus, Bibl. Reg. Berolinensis [xvi], 4to, 2 vols., on
      parchment, once belonging to Jo. Rave of Upsal, has been examined by
      Wetstein, Griesbach, and by G. G. Pappelbaum in 1796. It contains
      the whole New Testament, and has attracted attention because it has
      the disputed words in 1 John v. 7, 8. It is now, however, admitted
      by all to be a mere transcript of the N. T. in the Complutensian
      Polyglott with variations from Erasmus or Stephen, and as such has
      no independent authority.

  241 (Wetstein.) THE VELESIAN READINGS. The Jesuit de la Cerda in his
      "Adversaria Sacra," cap. xci (Lyons, 1626), a collection of various
      readings, written in vermilion in the margin of a _Greek_ Testament
      (which from its misprint in 1 Pet. iii. 11 we know to be R.
      Stephen's of 1550) by Petro Faxardo, Marquis of Velez, a Spaniard,
      who had taken them from sixteen manuscripts, eight of which were in
      the king's library, in the Escurial. It is never stated what codices
      or how many support each variation. De la Cerda had received the
      readings from Mariana, the great Jesuit historian of Spain, then
      lately dead, and appears to have inadvertently added to Mariana's
      account of their origin, that the sixteen manuscripts were in Greek.
      These Velesian readings, though suspected from the first even by
      Mariana by reason of their strange resemblance to the Latin Vulgate
      and the manuscripts of the Old Latin, were repeated as critical
      authorities in Walton's Polyglott, 1657, and (contrary to his own
      better judgement) were retained by Mill in 1707. Wetstein, however
      (N. T. Proleg. vol. i. pp. 59-61), and after him Michaelis and Bp.
      Marsh, have abundantly proved that the various readings must have
      been collected by Velez from _Latin_ manuscripts, and by him
      translated into Greek, very foolishly perhaps, but not of necessity
      with a fraudulent design. Certainly, any little weight the Velesian
      readings may have, must be referred to the Latin, not to the Greek
      text. Among the various proofs of their Latin origin urged by
      Wetstein and others, the following establish the fact beyond the
      possibility of doubt:

      (For each of these, there is the reference, the Greek Text, the
      Vulgate Text, the Vulgate various reading, and the Velesian
      reading.)

  242 (Wetstein.) THE BARBERINI READINGS must also be banished from our
      list of critical authorities, though for a different reason. The
      collection of various readings from twenty-two manuscripts (ten of
      the Gospels, eight of the Acts and Epistles, and four of the
      Apocalypse), seen by Isaac Vossius in 1642 in the Barberini Library
      at Rome, was made about 1625, and first published in 1673 by Peter
      Possinus (Poussines), a Jesuit, at the end of a catena of St. Mark.
      He alleged that the collations were made by John M. Caryophilus [d.
      1635], a Cretan, while preparing an edition of the Greek Testament,
      under the patronage of Paul V [d. 1621] and Urban VIII [d. 1644]. As
      the Barberini readings often favour the Latin version, they fell
      into the same suspicion as the Velesian: Wetstein especially (N. T.
      Proleg. vol. i. pp. 61, 62), after pressing against them some
      objections more ingenious than solid, declares "lis haec non aliter
      quam ipsis libris Romae inventis et productis, _quod nunquam credo
      fiet_, solvi potest." The very papers Wetstein thus called for were
      discovered by Birch (Barberini Lib. 209) more than thirty years
      later, and besides them Caryophilus' petition for the loan of six
      manuscripts from the Vatican (Codd. BS, 127, 129, 141, 144), which
      he doubtless obtained and used. The good faith of the collator being
      thus happily vindicated, we have only to identify his eleven [Cod.
      141 of the Gospels being also Act. 75, Paul. 86, Apoc. 40. Another
      of his manuscripts was Act. 73, Paul. 80.] remaining codices, most
      of them probably being in that very Library, and may then dismiss
      the Barberini readings as having done their work, and been fairly
      superseded.

  243 In Codd. 115 and 202 _Eus._ is usually, in Codd. 116, 117, 417, 422,
      and B. M. Addit. 15,581 but rarely, written under _Am._: these
      copies therefore were probably never quite finished. See p. 62, and
      note 1.

  244 Meerman's other manuscript of the N. T., sold at his sale in 1824,
      is No. 562.

  245 A collection presented to Urban VIII (1623-44) by Maximilian,
      Elector of Bavaria, from the spoils of the unhappy Elector Palatine,
      titular king of Bohemia.

  246 Or rather A.D. 1274. According to Engelbreth the letters stand
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}, which can only mean A.M. 6782 (_see_ p. 42, note 2).

  247 Thus, at least, I understand Moldenhawer's description, "Evangeliis
      et Actis {~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER XI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} subjiciuntur dudum in vulgus notae."

  248 Others F.

  249 By double _syn._ Moldenhawer may be supposed to mean here and in
      Cod. 232 both _syn._ and _men._

  250 Readings extracted by Griesbach (Symb. Crit. i. pp. 247-304) from
      the margin of a copy of Mill's Greek Testament in the Bodleian, in
      his own or Thomas Hearne's handwriting, were placed here, but are
      omitted. Scrivener (Cod. Augiensis, Introd. p. xxxvi) has shown that
      they were derived from Evan. 440.

  251 Holmes, Praefatio ad Pentateuchum, describes his Cod. 32 as "e
      Codicibus Eugenii, olim Archiepiscopi Slabinii et Chersonis."
      Nicephorus also is named by Holmes as the editor of a Catena on the
      Octateuch and the four books of Kings from the Constantinopolitan
      manuscripts (Leipzig, 1772-3), and is described as "primo
      Hieromonachus, et postea Archiepiscopus Slabiniensis et
      Chersonensis, sedem Astracani habens" (_ubi supra_, cap. iv).

  252 Written in three several and minute hands (Hort):--A for the Gospels,
      the Epistle of Pilate and its Answer, and a treatise on the
      genealogy of the Virgin; B for the Apocalypse and a Synaxarion; C
      the Acts, Cath. Paul. (Hebrews last), and Lives of the Apostles,
      followed on the same page by the Psalter by B, so that Apoc. and
      _syn._ probably stood last.

  253 This manuscript appears to be the only Greek witness for the Old
      Latin and Curetonian Syriac variation Matt. i. 16 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH VARIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH DASIA AND PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~}

But
      then it was written in Italy, as Ceriani judges.

  254 The asper or asprum was a mediaeval Greek silver coin (derived from
      {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, _albus_); we may infer its value from a passage cited by
      Ducange from Vincentius Bellovac. xxx. 75 "quindecim drachmas seu
      asperos."

  256 The Psalter 5pe (Petrop. ix. 1) [994], containing the hymns, Luke i.
      46-55; 68-79; ii. 29-32, is like our Evan. 612, which see.

  257 In addition to Evann. 73, 74, Gaisford in 1837 catalogued, and
      Scrivener in 1861 inspected, these fourteen copies of the Gospels in
      the collection of Archbishop Wake, now at Christ Church, Oxford.
      They were brought from Constantinople about 1731, and have now been
      described in the Rev. G. W. Kitchin's Catalogue of the Manuscripts
      in Christ Church Library (4to, 1867).

  258 The letter {~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~} is quite illegible, but the Indiction 9 belongs only to
      A.D. 831, 1131, 1431, while the style of the manuscript leaves no
      doubt which to choose.

  259 Of these manuscripts Thomas Mangey (Evan. 483) states on the
      fly-leaves that he collated Nos. 12, 25, 28, 34 in 1749. Caspar
      Wetstein collated the Apocalypse in Nos. 12 and 34 for his
      relative's great edition; while in the margin of No. 35, a 4to Greek
      Testament printed at Geneva (1620), is inserted a most laborious
      collation (preceded by a full description) of eight of the Wake
      manuscripts with Wetstein's N. T. of 1711, having this title
      prefixed to them, "Hae Variae lectiones ex MSS. notatae sunt manu et
      opera Johannis Walkeri, A. 1732." John Walker, most of whose labours
      seem never yet to have been used, although they were known to
      Berriman in 1741 (Critical Dissertation on 1 Tim. iii. 16, pp.
      102-4), was Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where so many of
      his critical materials accumulated for the illustrious Bentley are
      deposited. Walker d. 1741, Archdeacon of Hereford, after Bentley's
      will, six months before him. The codd. in Trinity College were
      bought from Bentley's heirs (not from Richard Bentley) when
      Wordsworth was Master (1820-41), and so were not in Bentley's hands
      when Walker died. Old Latin Biblical Texts, xxiv-vi. Of his eight
      codices, we find on investigation that Walker's C is Wake 26;
      Walker's 1 is Wake 20 (collations of these two, sent by Walker to
      Wetstein, comprise Codd. 73, 74, described above); Walker's B is
      Wake 21; Walker's D is Wake 24, both of Gospels; Walker's E is Wake
      18, his H is Wake 19, both Evangelistaria; Walker's q is Wake 12, of
      which Caspar Wetstein afterwards examined the Apocalypse (Cod. 26);
      Walker's W is Wake 38 of the Acts and Epistles, or Scholz's Act.
      191, Paul. 245.

  260 Bentley specifies "argumenta inedita Cosmae Indicopleustae in 4
      Evangelia, et versus iambici fortasse Jacobi Calligraphi: argumenta
      incerti ad Actus: prologus ineditus et argumenta Oecumenii ad

  262 In Mr. Coxe's "Report to Her Majesty's Government," we find an
      account (which illness compelled him to give at second hand) of
      several copies of the Gospels and one palimpsest Evangelistarium,
      all dated [xii], still remaining in this Prelate's Library.

  264 Belsheim (Cod. Aureus, Proleg. p. xvii and note 3) gives a short
      life of that noble Swede, John Gabriel Sparvenfeldt [1655-1727], who
      was sent over Europe by his master, Charles XI, to procure
      manuscripts for the Royal Library, and bought the Latin Codex Aureus
      at Madrid in 1690.

  265 Gregory considers this to be (not a duplicate but) the same as Cod.

  268 Mr. Ellis (Bentleii Critica Sacra, pp. xxviii, xxix) represents,
      among facts which I am better able to verify, that Act. and Epp. 25,
      26, and Epp. 15, were collated by Wetstein, and his labours
      preserved at Trin. Coll. Cambridge (B. xvii. 10, 11). The
      manuscripts he indicates so ambiguously must be Paul. 25, 26, and
      Act. 15, since Wetstein is not known to have worked at Act. 25, 26,
      or Paul. 15.

  269 Covell once marked this codex 5, but afterwards gave it the name of
      the Sinai MS. (little anticipating worthier claimants for that
      appellation), reserving 5 for Harl. 5777 or Evan. 446.

_  270 See_ under 98.

  271 Cod. 162 has attracted much attention from the circumstance that it
      is the only unsuspected witness among the Greek manuscripts for the
      celebrated text 1 John v. 7, 8, whose authenticity will be discussed
      in Vol. II. Ch. XII. A facsimile of the passage in question was
      traced in 1829 by Cardinal Wiseman for Bishop Burgess, and published
      by Horne in several editions of his "Introduction," as also by
      Tregelles (Horne, vol. iv. p. 217). If the facsimile is at all
      faithful, this is as rudely and indistinctly written as any
      manuscript in existence; but the illegible scrawl between the Latin
      column in the post of honour on the left, and the Greek column on
      the right, has been ascertained by Mr. B. H. Alford (who examined
      the codex at Tregelles' request) to be merely a consequence of the
      accidental shifting of the tracing paper, too servilely copied by
      the engraver.

  272 Scholz says 1344, and Tischendorf corrects but few of his gross
      errors in these Catalogues: but A.M. 6902, which he cites from the
      manuscript, is A.D. 1394.

  273 Here again we banish to the notes Scholz's list from Cod. 182 to
      Cod. 189, for the reasons stated after Evan. 449.

      182. (Paul. 243.) Library of St. John's monastery at Patmos [xii],
      8vo, also another [xiii] 8vo.

      183. (Paul. 231.) Library of the Great Greek monastery at Jerusalem
      8 [xiv], 8vo. This must be Coxe's No. 7 [x], 4to, beginning Acts
      xii. 6.

      184. (Paul. 232, Apoc. 85.) Jerusalem 9 [xiii], 4to, with a
      commentary. This is evidently Coxe's No. 15, though he dates it at
      the end of [x].

      185. (Paul. 233.) St. Saba, Greek monastery, 1 [xi], 12mo.

      186. (Evan. 457.)

      187. (Evan. 462.)

      188. (Paul. 236.) St. Saba 15 [xii], 4to.

      189. (Evan. 466.)

  274 From the monastery of Grotta Ferrata, near Tusculum, "Ubi degunt ab
      antiquo tempore monachi, ordinis S. Basilii Magni, ritum
      Italo-Graecum observantes," Holmes. Praef. ad Pentateuch. on his
      Cod. 128, which came to the Vatican from the same place. It is the
      traditional Villa Luculli.

  275 Birch shows the connexion of Caryophilus with this important copy
      (which much resembles the Leicester manuscript, Evan. Cod. 69) from
      James v. 5, and especially from 3 John 5 {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} for {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, a
      _lectio singularis_. In this codex, as in the others cited, Heb.
      stands before 1 Tim.

  276 The gold ducat coined for the Military Order of St. John at Rhodes
      (_see_ Ducange) was worth 9_s_. 6_d_. English money.

  277 Here again we set Scholz's codices in a note, substituting others in
      their room. Scholz's run, 231. (Act. 183.) 232. (Act. 184.) 233.
      (Act. 185.) 234. (Evan. 457.) 235. (Evan. 462.) 236. (Act. 188.)
      237. (Evan. 466.) 243. (Act. 182), two separate codices.

  278 Mr. B. W. Newton superintended the publication of Tregelles' last
      part of his Greek New Testament under circumstances which disarm
      criticism, but Tregelles could hardly have meant that in the
      Apocalypse "much of Cod. 14 (Leicestrensis) has been supplied by a
      later hand from the Codex Montfortianus, Apoc. 92" (Introductory
      Notice, p. 1). The original hand remains unchanged in the Leicester
      copy, even on the last torn leaf containing portions of Apoc. xix,
      but the converse supposition is very maintainable, though not quite
      certain, that the Apocalypse in Cod. 92 was transcribed from Cod.
      14.

  279 Gregory has substituted this for Scholz's 23, which he finds does
      not contain Apoc. Whatever readings he cites under these three
      numbers, are simply copied from Wetstein (Kelly's "Revelation,"
      Introd. p. xi, note). Dr. Gregory has seen all the four.

  280 After this again we withdraw Scholz's copies, as virtually included
      in Coxe's, putting others in their room. They are 85. (Act. 184.)
      86. (Evan. 462), thrice cited ineunte libro (Tischendorf). 862 of
      Scholz, being 89 of Tischendorf (Evan. 466).

  281 We cannot identify 109, Bentley's R (Regis Galliae, 1872): cf.
      Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, Intr. p. xxix.

  282 In the sixth lesson for the Holy Passions the prefatory clause to
      Mark xv. 16 is founded on an obvious misconception: {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI AND YPOGEGRAMMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH YPOGEGRAMMENI~}

We remember no similar instance of error.

  283 Laud. Gr. 36, which in the Bodleian Catalogue is described as an
      Evangelistarium, is a collection of Church Lessons from the
      Septuagint read in Lent and the Holy Week, such as we described
      above. It has red musical notes, and seems _once_ to have borne the
      date A.D. 1028. It is Dean Holmes' No. 61 (Praef. ad Pentateuch).

  284 As with the MSS. of the Gospels, and for the reasons assigned above,
      we remove to the foot of the page, and do not reckon in our
      numbering, the twenty-one copies seen by Scholz in Eastern
      Libraries.

      reckoning, e.g. Parham No. 20 (Evst. 236).

  286 Thus 222, with only two other Evangelistaria (6, 13) and Evan. 59 by
      the first hand, supports Cod. {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~} and Eusebius in the significant
      omission of {~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}, Matt. xxiii. 35.

  287 [+]Evan. Td and Te and {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA~} (1) should also properly be classed as
      Lectionaries. Apost. 15, and perhaps Apost. 24, also contains
      Lessons from the Gospels. The two copies of the Gospels, Lowes
      formerly Askew, membr. 4to, mentioned by Scholz (N. T., vol. i. p.
      cxix), and stated by Marsh on Michaelis, vol. ii. p. 662, to have
      been bought at Askew's sale by Mr. Lowes, the bookseller, are shown
      by the sale catalogue to have Evangelistaria. They have not yet been
      traced. (Ed. 3.)

  288 In 1721. _See_ Monk's "Life of Bentley," vol. ii. p. 149. This is
      Bentley's O, John Walker's collation of which is preserved at Trin.
      Coll. (B. xvii. 34). Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, Introd. pp.
      xxix, xxx.

  289 As in our preceding lists, we remove to this foot-note Scholz's six
      copies seen at St. Saba, and occupy their numbers by other
      manuscripts. They are Apost. 49. St. Saba 16 [xiv], 4to, _chart._
      50. St. Saba 18 [xv], 8vo. 51. St. Saba 26 [xiv], fol. 52. (Evst.
      171.) 53. (Evst. 160.) 54. St. Saba (unnumbered) [xiii], 4to.

  290 An independent mode of reckoning the commencement of the indiction
      was followed in Egypt under the later Roman Empire. The indiction
      there began normally in the latter half of the month Pauni, which
      corresponds to about the middle of June; but the actual day of
      commencement appears to have been variable and to have depended upon
      the exact period of the rising of the Nile.--"Catalogue of Greek
      Papyri in the British Museum," pp. 197, 198.

  291 So Scholz's index, and we may suppose correctly, but in his
      Catalogue of Evangelistaria he numbers it 1256.

To protect the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project Gutenberg"),
you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.


General Terms of Use & Redistributing Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works


1.A.


By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work,
you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the
terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright)
agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this
agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee
for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work
and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may
obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set
forth in paragraph 1.E.8.


1.B.


"Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be used on or
associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be
bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that you can
do with most Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works even without complying
with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are
a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works if you
follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.


1.C.


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" or
PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual
work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in
the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying,
distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on
the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of
course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} mission of
promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for
keeping the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} name associated with the work. You can
easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License when you
share it without charge with others.


1.D.


The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you
can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant
state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of
your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before
downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating
derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work.
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of
any work in any country outside the United States.


1.E.


Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:


1.E.1.


The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access
to, the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License must appear prominently whenever
any copy of a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work (any work on which the phrase
"Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project Gutenberg"
is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or
distributed:


    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
    almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away
    or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License
    included with this eBook or online at http://www.gutenberg.org


1.E.2.


If an individual Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work is derived from the
public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with
permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and
distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or
charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you
must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7
or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.


1.E.3.


If an individual Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work is posted with the
permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply
with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed
by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked to the Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License for all works posted with the permission of the
copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.


1.E.4.

access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License.


1.E.6.


You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed,
marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word
processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version posted
on the official Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} web site (http://www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other form.
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License as
specified in paragraph 1.E.1.


1.E.7.

1.E.8.


You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or
distributing Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works provided that

    - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works calculated using the method you
      already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to
      the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark, but he has agreed to
      donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60
      days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally
      required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments
      should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
      "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation."

    - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License.
      You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the
      works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and
      all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.

    - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
      any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
      receipt of the work.

    - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.


1.E.9.


If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic
work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this
agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in
Section 3 below.


1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.


1.F.2.


LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES -- Except for the "Right of
Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE
NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE
FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGE.


1.F.3.


LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND -- If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.


1.F.4.


Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in
paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.


1.F.5.


Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.


1.F.6.


INDEMNITY -- You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark
owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and
any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution
of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs
and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from
any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of
this or any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, and (c) any Defect
you cause.


Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}'s goals and ensuring

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

      General Information About Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
