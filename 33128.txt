Hymn 1.                                                            L. M.

                 "_All people that on earth do dwell._"


    All people that on earth do dwell,
      Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
    Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell,
      Come ye before him and rejoice.

  2 The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
      Without our aid he did us make;
    We are his flock, he doth us feed;
      And for his sheep he doth us take.

  3 O enter then his gates with praise,
      Approach with joy his courts unto:
    Praise, laud and bless his name always;
      For it is seemly so to do.

  4 For why? The Lord our God is good;
      His mercy is for ever sure;
    His truth at all times firmly stood;
      And shall from age to age endure.

  5 Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
      Praise him, all creatures here below;
    Praise him above, ye heavenly host;
      Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

                 "_All hail the power of Jesus' name._"


    All hail the power of Jesus' name;
      Let angels prostrate fall!
    Bring forth the royal diadem,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  2 Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
      A remnant weak and small.
    Hail him, who saves you by his grace,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  3 Ye Gentile sinners, ne'er forget
      The wormwood and the gall;
    Go, spread your trophies at his feet,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  4 Let ev'ry kindred, ev'ry tribe,
      On this terrestrial ball,
    To him all majesty ascribe,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  5 O that with yonder sacred throng,
      We at his feet may fall;
    We'll join the everlasting song,
      And crown him Lord of all!

Hymn 3.

                   "_Pass me not, O gentle Saviour._"


    Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
      Hear my humble cry;
    While on others thou art calling,
      Do not pass me by.

  Chorus:--
    Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry;
      While on others thou art calling,
    Do not pass me by.

  2 Let me at a throne of mercy
      Find a sweet relief;
    Kneeling there in deep contrition,
      Help my unbelief.

  3 Trusting only in thy merit,
      Would I seek thy face;
    Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
      Save me by thy grace.

  4 Thou the spring of all my comfort,
      More than life to me:
    Whom have I on earth beside thee?
      Whom in heaven but thee?

  5 Pass me not, O gentle Saviour
      Thou canst make me see;
    Thy salvation, Jesus, Saviour!
      Speak some word to me.

                "_Lord, I hear of showers of blessing._"


    Lord, I hear of showers of blessing
      Thou art scattering full and free--
    Showers the thirsty land refreshing;
      Let some droppings fall on me--

  Chorus.--E-ven me, e-ven me,
            Let thy blessing fall on me.

  2 Pass me not, O gracious Father!
      Sinful though my heart may be;
    Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
      Let Thy mercy fall on me.

  3 Pass me not, O tender Saviour!
      Let me love and cling to Thee;
    I am longing for Thy favor;
      Whilst Thou'rt calling, oh, call me.

  4 Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
      Thou can'st make the blind to see;
    Witnesser of Jesus' merit.
      Speak the word of power to me.

  5 Love of God, so pure and changeless;
      Blood of Christ, so rich and free;
    Grace of God, so strong and boundless,
      Magnify them all in me.

                       "_Forever with the Lord._"


    For ever with the Lord:
      Amen, so let it be,
    Life from the dead is in that word,
      'Tis immortality.

  2 Here in the body pent,
      Absent from him I roam,
    Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
      A day's march nearer home.

  3 My Father's house on high,
      Home of my soul, how near
    At times to faith's foreseeing eye
      Thy golden gates appear!

  4 Ah, then my spirit faints
      To reach the land I love,
    The bright inheritance of saints,
      Jerusalem above.

  5 I hear at morn and even,
      At noon and midnight hour,
    The choral harmonies of heaven
      Earth's Babel-tongues o'erpower.

  6 That resurrection word,
      That shout of victory,
    Once more, For ever with the Lord:
      Amen, so let it be.




Nuhguhmoowin 5.                                                    S. M.

                 "_Awake, my soul, and with the sun._"


    Awake, my soul, and with the sun
    Thy daily stage of duty run:
    Shake off dull sloth, and early rise,
    To pay thy morning sacrifice.

  2 Redeem thy misspent moments past,
    And live this day as if thy last;
    Thy talents to improve take care;
    For the great day thyself prepare.

  3 Let all thy converse be sincere,
    Thy conscience as the noonday clear;
    For God's all-seeing eye surveys
    Thy secret thoughts, thy words and ways.

  4 Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart,
    And with the angels take thy part;
    Who all night long unwearied sing
    High glory to the eternal King.

  5 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
    Praise him, all creatures here below;
    Praise him above, ye heavenly host;
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

                 "_Glory to thee, my God, this night._"


    Glory to thee, my God, this night,
    For all the blessings of the light.
    Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
    Beneath thine own almighty wings!

  2 Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear son,
    The ill that I this day have done;
    That with the world, myself and thee,
    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

  3 Teach me to live, that I may dread
    The grave as little as my bed;
    Teach me to die, that so I may
    Rise glorious at the awful day.

  4 O let my soul on thee repose!
    And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close;
    Sleep that shall me more vigorous make
    To serve my God when I awake.

  5 If in the night I sleepless lie,
    My soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
    Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
    No powers of darkness me molest.

  6 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
    Praise Him, all creatures here below;
    Praise him above, ye heavenly host;
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

           "_While shepherds watch'd their flocks by night._"


    While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
      All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
      And glory shone around.

  2 "Fear not," said he, (for mighty dread
      Had seized their troubled mind,)
    "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
      To you and all mankind.

  3 "To you in David's town this day
      Is born, of David's line,
    The Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
      And this shall be the sign:

  4 "The heavenly babe you there shall find
      To human view display'd,
    All meanly wrapp'd in swathing bands,
      And in a manger laid."

  5 Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
      Appear'd a shining throng
    Of angels praising God, on high,
      And thus addressed their song:

  6 "All glory be to God on high,
      And to the earth be peace;
    Good will henceforth, from heaven to men,
      Begin and never cease."

                  "_There is a land of pure delight._"


    There is a land of pure delight,
      Where saints immortal reign:
    Infinite day excludes the night,
      And pleasures banish pain.

  2 There everlasting spring abides,
      And never-withr'ing flowers:
    Death like a narrow sea divides
      That heavenly land from ours.

  3 Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
      Stand dressed in living green:
    So to the Jews fair Canaan stood,
      While Jordan roll'd between.

  4 But tim'rous mortals start and shrink
      To cross that narrow sea;
    And linger shiv'ring on the brink,
      And fear to launch away.

  5 O could we make our doubts remove,
      Those gloomy doubts that rise,
    And see the Canaan that we love,
      With unbeclouded eyes!

  6 Could we but climb where Moses stood,
      And view the landscape o'er,
    Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,
      Should fright us from the shore.

    O for a thousand tongues to sing
      My great Redeemer's praise!
    The glories of my God and King,
      The triumphs of his grace.

  2 My gracious Master, and my God,
      Assist me to proclaim,
    To spread through all the earth abroad
      The honours of Thy name.

  3 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
      That bids our sorrows cease;
    'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
      'Tis life, and health, and peace.

  4 He breaks the power of cancell'd sin;
      He sets the pris'ner free;
    His blood can make the foulest clean;
      His blood avail'd for me.

  5 Look unto Him, ye nations; own
      Your God, ye fallen race;
    Look and be saved through faith alone;
      Be justified by grace.

  6 See all your sins on Jesus laid;
      The Lamb of God was slain;
    His soul was once an off'ring made
      For every soul of man.

    How came they to the blissful seats
      Of everlasting day?

  2 Lo! these are they, from sufferings great,
      Who came to realms of light;
    And in the blood of Christ have wash'd
      Those robes, which shine so bright.

  3 Now, with triumphant palms, they stand
      Before the throne on high
    And serve the God they love, amidst
      The glories of the sky,

  4 His presence fills each heart with joy,
      Tunes every mouth to sing;
    By day, by night, the sacred courts
      With glad Hosannas ring.

  5 The Lamb, which dwells amidst the throne,
      Shall o'er them still preside,
    Feed them with nourishment divine,
      And all their footsteps guide.

  6 In pastures green He'll lead his flock
      Where living streams appear;
    And God the Lord from every eye
      Shall wipe off every tear.

    Let the water and the blood,
    From thy riven side which flow'd,
    Be of sin the double cure,
    Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

  2 Not the labours of my hands,
    Can fulfil thy law's demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears for ever flow;
    All for sin could not atone,
    Thou must save, and thou alone.

  3 Nothing in my hand I bring,
    Simply to thy cross I cling;
    Naked, come to thee for dress;
    Helpless, look to thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the fountain fly;
    Wash me, Saviour, or I die!

  4 While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When my eyelids close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    See thee on thy judgment throne,

    'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
      And to the weary, rest.

      And cold my warmest thought;
    But, when I see thee as thou art,
      I'll praise thee as I ought.

    Turned thy darkness into light.

  3 Can a woman's tender care
    Cease towards the child she bare?
    Yes, she may forgetful be,
    Yet will I remember thee.

  4 Mine is an unchanging love,
    Higher than the heights above,
    Deeper than the depths beneath,
    Free and faithful, strong as death.

  5 Thou shalt see my glory soon,
    When the work of grace is done:
    Partner of my throne shalt be,
    "Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?"

  6 Lord, it is my chief complaint
    That my love is cold and faint:
    Yet I love thee, and adore;
    O for grace to love thee more.

  2 Must I be carried to the skies

      Must I not stem the flood?
    Is this vile world a friend to grace,
      To help me on to God?

  4 Sure, I must fight, if I would reign;
      Increase my courage, Lord;
    I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
      Supported by thy word.

  5 Thy saints in all this glorious war
      Shall conquer, though they die;
    They see the triumph from afar,
      By faith they bring it nigh.

  6 When that illustrious day shall rise,
      And all thine armies shine
    In robes of victory through the skies,
      The glory shall be thine.

    Come let us join our cheerful songs
      With angels round the throne;
    Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
      But all their joys are one.

  2 "Worthy the Lamb that died," they cry,
      "To be exalted thus;"
    "Worthy the Lamb," our lips reply,
      For he was slain for us.

  3 Jesus is worthy to receive
      Honor and power divine;
    And blessings more than we can give,
      Be, Lord, for ever thine.

  4 Let all that dwell above the sky,
      And air, and earth, and seas,
    Conspire to lift thy glories high,
      And speak thine endless praise!

      To bless the sacred name
    Of him who sits upon the throne,
      And to adore the Lamb.

      Hither by thy help I'm come;
    And I hope, by thy good pleasure,
      Safely to arrive at home.

  4 Jesus sought me when a stranger,
      Wand'ring from the fold of God;
    He, to rescue me from danger,
      Interposed his precious blood.

      Daily I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
      Bind my wand'ring heart to thee:

  6 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
      Prone to leave the God I love--
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
      Seal it for thy courts above!

    For without thee I cannot live;
    Abide with me when night is nigh,
    For without thee I dare not die.

  4 If some poor wandering child of thine
    Has spurned, to-day, the voice divine,
    Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
    Let him no more lie down in sin.

    With blessings from thy boundless store;
    Be every mourner's sleep to-night
    Like infant slumbers, pure and light.

    Ere through the world our way we take,
    Till in the ocean of thy love
    We lose ourselves in heav'n above.

    Children of the heavenly King,
    As ye journey, sweetly sing;
    Sing your Saviour's worthy praise,
    Glorious in his works and ways.

  2 We are travelling home to God,
    In the way the fathers trod:
    They are happy now; and we
    Soon their happiness shall see.

  3 Shout, ye little flock and blest;
    You on Jesus' throne shall rest:
    There your seat is now prepared,
    There your kingdom and reward.

  4 Lift your eyes, ye sons of light;
    Zion's city is in sight;
    There our endless home shall be,
    There our Lord we soon shall see.

  5 Fear not, brethren; joyful stand
    On the borders of your land;
    Christ, the everlasting Son,
    Bids you undismay'd go on.

  6 Lord, obediently we go,
    Gladly leaving all below:
    Only thou our leader be,
    And we still will follow thee.

    Abide with me, fast falls the eventide;
    The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
    When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

  2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away,
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O thou, who changest not, abide with me.

  3 I need thy presence every passing hour;
    What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
    Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
    Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

  4 I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;
    Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness,
    Where is death's sting? where grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still, if thou abide with me.

  5 Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;
    Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

    Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
      Thy head upon my breast."

  2 I came to Jesus as I was--
      Weary, and worn, and sad;
    I found in him a resting place,
      And he has made me glad.

  3 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
      "Behold I freely give
    The living water--thirsty one
      Stoop down, and drink, and live."

  4 I came to Jesus, and I drank
      Of that life-giving stream;
    My thirst was quench'd, my soul reviv'd
      And now I live in him.

  5 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
      "I am this dark world's light;
    Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,
      And all thy day be bright."

  6 I looked to Jesus, and I found
      In him my Star, my Sun;
    And in that Light of Life I'll walk
      Till earthly days are done.

      And pearly gates behold,
    Thy bulwarks with salvation strong,

      Nor sin nor sorrow know:
    Blest seats! 'mid rude and stormy scenes,
      I onward press to you.

  4 Why should I shrink from pain and woe,
      Or feel at death dismay?
    I've Canaan's goodly land in view,
      And realms of endless day.

  5 Apostles, martyrs, prophets, there,
      Around my Saviour stand,
    And soon my friends in Christ below
      Will join the glorious band.

          The beautiful, the beautiful river--
          Gather with the saints at the river,
          That flows by the throne of God.

  2 On the margin of the river,
      Washing up its golden spray,
    We will walk and worship ever
      All the happy, golden day.

  3 Ere we reach the shining river,
      Lay we every burden down;
    Grace our spirits will deliver
      And provide a robe and crown.

  4 At the smiling of the river,
      Mirror of the Saviour's face,
    Saints whom death will never sever,
      Lift their songs of saving grace.

  5 Soon we'll reach the shining river,
      Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
    Soon our happy hearts will quiver

    And griefs around me spread,

    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray
        From thee aside.

  4 When ends life's transient dream,
    When death's cold sullen stream

    Fear and distrust remove;
    O bear me safe above,

    Mine, to show a Saviour's love;
    Mine art thou to guide my feet;
    Mine, to judge, condemn, acquit.

  3 Mine, to comfort in distress,
    If the Holy Spirit bless;
    Mine, to show by living faith
    Man can triumph over death.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
