SIR ROBERT PEEL, AND HIS CLAIMS TO BE REMEMBERED BY THE LITERARY MEN OF
ENGLAND.

One of the most interesting of the recently published parts of Murray's
_Reading for the Rail_ is unquestionably _Theodore Hook, a Sketch_,
which has been reprinted from the _Quarterly Review_, with some
additional notes. Of these there is one (at p. 62.) which presents us
with the following honorable and characteristic anecdote of the late Sir
Robert Peel:--

  "The writer of this sketch, now that Sir R. Peel is no more among
  us, takes this, perhaps his only opportunity of mentioning the
  generosity of that statesman's conduct towards Maginn. The Doctor
  having always retained the strong feelings of an Irish Orangeman,
  was one of those who condemned with severity Sir Robert's
  pro-Catholic policy of 1829; nor, perhaps was there any one writer
  of the time by whom the personal motives of the minister were more
  unmercifully dealt with. The Doctor assailed them with unwearied
  pertinacity, in various newspapers and magazines; but especially
  in rhymes only less galling than the fiercest of Swift's. He had
  never been personally acquainted with Peel, who could have known
  nothing about him so distinctly as this hostility. Yet when, a few
  years before Maginn's death, some of his friends were privately
  making a subscription to relieve him from some pressing
  difficulties, Sir Robert, casually hearing of it, immediately sent
  through the writer of this sketch, with a stipulation for secrecy,
  the sum of 100_l._ as a contribution to the fund. The writer
  believes that Sir Robert on various subsequent occasions
  interfered on the Doctor's behalf in a manner not less liberal,
  and with the same delicate precautions. At all events, when the
  doctor was near his end, Sir Robert forwarded for his use a
  similar benefaction of 100_l._ The writer has no reason to suppose
  that Maginn was ever aware of any of these kind deeds. It remains
  to be added that, some years after Dr. Maginn's death, his only
  son, on attaining the requisite age, received a cadetship in the
  East Indies from Sir Robert Peel's last government."--(1852.)

The perusal of this interesting passage has reminded us of a desire
which we felt most strongly at the time when the country lost the
distinguished man to whom it relates; and which we should then have
given expression to, but for the fear that in the multitude of projects
for doing honour to his memory then floating before the public eye,
what we had to propose might not be received in the way which his merits
deserved.

Sir Robert Peel was pre-eminently a patron of English Literature and
literary men; and we hoped, and do still hope, to see a recognition of
his great claims in that special character on the part of the men of
letters in this country. The most appropriate that occurs to us would be
the erection of his bust or statue in the vestibule of that national
establishment, in the welfare and management of which he always took so
great an interest--we mean the British Museum.

The minister who, in terms alike honorable to himself and to the man of
letters to whom the dignity was offered, tendered a baronetcy to
Southey, and conferred upon him a pension of 300_l._ a year--who gave
the same amount to Wordsworth--who gave to James Montgomery 150_l._ a
year, and to Tytler, to Tennyson, and to M'Culloch, each 200_l._ a
year--who bestowed a pension upon Frances Brown, and gave a 100_l._ a
year to the widow of Thomas Hood--who gave the first appointment of his
first administration to a son of Allan Cunningham, and placed the sons
of Mrs. Hemans in the service of the Crown,--Sir Robert Peel, the man
and the minister who could thus recognise the claims of Literature[1],
and not, like ministers of old, stipulate for a return in the political
support of those whom he so distinguished, was surely a person whose
memory the men of letters in this country should not be slow to honour.

  [Footnote 1: We have confined our remarks to Sir Robert Peel's
  patronage of Literature; but that patronage was as liberally
  bestowed upon Science and Art. To him Mrs. Somerville and Sir M.
  Faraday were indebted for their pensions; and while his friendship
  with Lawrence, Wilkie, and Chantrey, and his patronage of Collins,
  Roberts, Stansfield, &c., cannot be forgotten, his prompt and most
  kind response to poor Haydon's application for assistance, though
  addressed to him at a moment when plunged in the fiercest
  political struggle in which he was ever engaged, can never be
  forgotten.]

Let us hope that the moment has arrived when they will do justice to him
who was so ready to recognise their claims. Let Lord Mahon or Mr.
Hallam, who enjoyed the friendship of Sir Robert Peel, step forward and
begin the good work. An appeal from either of them would arouse a host.
They would be supported by all who love Literature, from the highest to
the humblest. Who can doubt that the author of _Coningsby_ and the
author of _Don Carlos_ would rejoice at the opportunity, which would
thus be afforded them, of uniting to do honour to the memory of a
political opponent, in that character in which he deservedly won the
applause of all men--as the judicious and munificent PATRON OF THE
LITERATURE OF OUR NATIVE COUNTRY.




Notes.


SITTING IN BEDE'S CHAIR.

One of the most interesting antiquities of Jarrow Church,
Northumberland, is the chair of the Venerable Bede. It is preserved in
the vestry of the church, whither all brides repair as soon as the
marriage service is over, to seat themselves upon it. This, according to
the popular belief, will make them the joyful mothers of children; and
the expectant mothers (as I have been informed) would not consider the
marriage ceremony complete, until they had been enthroned in the
Venerable Bede's chair. The chair is very rude and substantial; made of
oak; in height, four feet ten inches; having an upright back, and sides
that slope off for the arms. According to the barbarous English fashion,
it is carved over with the nomenclature of all the vulgar obscurities of
the neighbourhood, whose sacrilegious penknives, together with the
wanton depredations of relic-hunters, have so "shorn" the chair of its
"fair proportions," that soon nothing but its attenuated form, "small by
degrees, and beautifully less," will be left for the future Childe
Harold to address with--

                          "Can it be,
      That this is all remains of thee?"

Every foreigner who has visited our churches and cathedrals cannot fail
to remark how the English love of popularity glares forth in its most
sickly form in this barbarous custom of writing and carving names upon
monuments, or other works of art. Every observant person, too, when he
sees John Smith's name and full address, scratched with painful and
elaborate accuracy upon the stern but noseless face of some alabaster
knight, while he wonders at the gratuitous trouble which John Smith has
taken, must deplore the want of education thus so lamentably evinced.
Happily, this vulgar taste (so far as our churches are concerned) is now
under some control; but, nevertheless, it is still sad to see--at
Lichfield, for example--that control obliged to take the visible shape
of railings, to prevent Messrs. Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson from
handing their names down to posterity on the life-like marble of
Chantrey's "Sleeping Children." I have heard that this mode of defacing
monuments took its rise in the time of the Protectorate; and I would
wish to put this in the form of a _Query_: Whether it was so, or no?
With the impression that it _was_ the case, I have for many years past
examined the dates that accompanied names scratched upon monuments, and
never found a date earlier than the Protectorate. The subject seems
worth the inquiry.

To return to Bede's chair. It has often been engraved: but the best
representation of it that I know, is that by Mr. W. B. Scott, in his
_Antiquarian Gleanings of the North of England_. Besides his careful
etching of the present state of the chair, he also gives a suggestive
woodcut of its restoration. The ornamental portion he confines to the
front of the seat, and the head of the chair.

_Dedication Stone at Jarrow Church._--While on the subject of Bede's
chair at Jarrow, it may not prove altogether useless to transcribe you a
faithful copy of the dedication stone of Jarrow Church, which is now
placed against the tower-arch of the nave:

INEDITED POETRY.

The _first_ piece in the volume of MS. poetry referred to in my
communication in Vol. v., p. 387., may perhaps be deemed of sufficient
interest to occupy a place in your columns. It is entitled "A Ballad,"
and appears to me worthy of notice from its quaintness both in style and
rhythm.

      "A BALLAD.

      "Sure glorious Modesty again will rise,
      Since she can conquer in bright Marcia's eyes.
      Each look of hers creates a lambent fire,
      And youth and age concur her virtue to admire.
      Hence flow these lines from an unpolish'd hand,
      Which thinks her Marcia should the world command.
      Go, lovely maid, and let each virgin see
      How graceful modesty appears in thee.
      That they may all thy imitators be,
      And give example to posterity.

      1.

      "View Marcia's native charms,
        She's graceful in behaviour,
      By wise advice she steers,
        And with all the world's in favour.
      No foolish talk slides from her tongue,
        Her eyes ne'er wanton seem,
      Regards her friends, respects the great,
        And is humble to the mean.

      2.

      "How gentle is her voice,
        Not loud with foul detraction,
      Good sense guides all her words,
        And prudence every action.
      Not stiff in dress, or careless she,
        But in the graceful mean,
      What e'er she wears she still appears
        Like some majestic queen.

      3.

      "Her mind and thoughts still tends [sic]
        How to perform her duty;
      To her parents' laws she bends,
        Which adds more to her beauty.
      In conduct she a matron is
        With cheerful air and mein, [sic]
      The steddiness of sixty years, [sic]
        In look she's scarce fifteen.

      4.

      "In friendship most sincere,
        As well as in devotion,
      To herself alone severe,
        And guards her every motion.
      Her conquering eyes give her no pride,
        Her charms she will not know,
      Nor meaner beautys does deride [sic],
        Tho' they their envy show.

      5.

      "How lovely is that face
        Where modesty's adorning,
      And Marcia with that grace
        Is improving every morning.
      She like the glorious sun in spring
        Is encreasing every day,
      For her Apollo's harp he'll string,
        And the Muses sing their lay.

      6.

      "How happy is this nymph,
        Whose noble inclination,
      All subtle arts contemns
        And sligh made assignation: [sic]
      Whose hours are spent in useful works,
        Or reading tracts divine,
      The young, the grave, the wise, the brave,
        Pay homage at her shrine.
              And so does
                    Her humble slave,

                    "JUBA ISSHAM."

I hope that some of your readers will be able to explain this signature,
which is to me inexplicable.

    W. SPARROW SIMPSON.


ON A PASSAGE IN "MEASURE FOR MEASURE," ACT I. SC. 1.

Dr. Johnson long since observed that "there is perhaps not one of
Shakspeare's plays more darkened than this by the peculiarities of its
author, and the unskilfulness of its editors, by distortions of phrase,
or negligence of transcription."

Under these circumstances we cannot be surprised that we are favoured
with three pages of notes on the following passage, which occurs in the
opening scene:

      "_Duke._ Escalus.

      "_Escal._          My lord.

      "_Duke._ Of government the properties to unfold,
      Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse:
      Since I am put to know, that your own science
      Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
      My strength can give you: Then no more remains
      But that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
      And let them work."

I must refer those who are desirous of seeing the various attempts to
extract a meaning from this passage to the Variorum Edition, and content
myself with those of the two latest editors, Mr. Collier and Mr. Knight.

Mr. Collier says:

  "This passage is evidently corrupt, as is shown both by the metre
  and the sense. The latter will be cleared by the omission of the
  preposition 'to:' 'then no more remains [to be said], but that
  your sufficiency, as your worth is able, and let them work.' This
  change, however, will only partially cure the defective measure;
  and even were we to omit 'that,' as well as 'to,' the line would
  not be perfect without reducing 'sufficiency' to a trisyllable. It
  has been thought best, therefore, to leave the text as it stands
  in the first folio. 'Sufficiency' is adequate authority."

Mr. Knight says:

  "We encounter at the onset one of the obscure passages for which
  this play is remarkable. The text is usually printed thus:

                      "'Then no more remains
      But that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
      And let them work.'

  "It is certainly difficult to extract a clear meaning from this;
  and so Theobald and Hanmer assume that a line has dropped out,
  which they kindly restore to us, each in his own way. The
  emendation which Steevens proposes is much less forced: 'Then'
  (says the Duke), 'no more remains to say,

      "'But your sufficiency as your worth is able,
      And let them work.'

  "It is not our purpose to remove obscurities by additions or
  omissions, and therefore we leave the passage as in the original,
  excepting a slight alteration in the punctuation. We believe it
  may be read thus, without much difficulty. '_Then no more remains_
  (to say on government) _But that_, (your science) _to your
  sufficiency_, (joined to your authority) _as your worth_ (as well
  as your virtue) _is able_ (equal to the duty), _and let them work_
  (call them into action).'"

I cannot say that this exposition (paraphrastic as it is) is clear to
me; and I feel confident that our great poet never wrote the words "But
that," following as they do "Exceeds in that." What does "But that"
refer to? It cannot refer to "science," as Mr. Knight imagines. The
remedy lies in a very trifling correction of the press. In the MS. from
which the play was printed, the words "But thrto" were thus written, and
the compositor mistook "thr" for "tht;" there is no comma after _that_
in the old copies. Replace "thereto" and the passage is perfectly clear
as to sense.

                    "Then no more remains
      But _thereto_ your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
      And let them work."

It may be necessary to show that the word I propose would be used by the
poet just in the sense required here. The following passage from the
_Winter's Tale_, Act I. Sc. 2., will, I think, place it beyond doubt:

                                "Camillo,
      As you are certainly a gentleman, _thereto_
      Clerk-like experienc'd, which no less adorns
      Our gentry, than our parents' noble names,
      In whose success we are gentle," &c.

I take the sense of the whole passage thus: "Since I must acknowledge
that you are better skilled in the nature of _government_ than I am, it
would be idle in me to lecture you on the subject. Then nothing more is
wanting but _thereto_ your sufficient authority (_i.e._ to govern), as
you have the ability, and let them (your skill and authority) come into
operation."

_Sufficiency_, as Warburton long ago observed, is _authority_, but may
possibly be here used in the Latin sense of _substitution_. Escalus is
to be Vice-gerent. The very slight change necessary, and the great
probability of the occurrence of the error, strongly recommend this
simple emendation.

Daily experience is manifesting how large a portion of the difficult
passages are errors of the printer of the first folio, the two happy
corrections lately given in _The Athenaeum_, for instance: who can doubt
that in _Coriolanus_, Act III. Sc. 1., "Bosome-multi_p_lied" should be
"Bissom-multitude:" or that, in _All's Well that Ends Well_, Act V. Sc.
3., "infuite comming" should be "infinite cunning?" A glance at the
passages as they stand in the old print of the first folio would
convince the most sceptical. A list of mere printer's errors in that
book would be not a little astounding.

FOLK LORE.

_Sites of Buildings mysteriously changed._--It may be amusing to the
readers of "N. & Q.," and attended with some useful result, to record a
few popular traditions respecting the mysterious opposition to the
building of certain edifices on the spots originally designed for them
by their founders. I will introduce the subject with the local
traditions about the building of three churches well known to myself.

1. The church of Breedon, in Leicestershire, stands alone on a high
hill, the village being at its foot. The hill is so steep on the side
towards the village, that a carriage can only ascend by taking a very
circuitous course; and even the footpath winds considerably, and in some
parts ascends by steps formed in the turf. The inconvenience of such a
situation for the church is obvious, and the stranger, of course,
wonders at the folly of those who selected a site for a church which
would necessarily preclude the aged and infirm from attending public
worship. But the initiated parishioner soon steps forward to enlighten
him on the subject, and assures him the pious founder consulted the
convenience of the village, and assigned a central spot for the site of
the church. There the foundation was dug, and there the builders began
to rear the fabric; but all they built in the course of the day was
carried away by _doves_ in the night, and skilfully built in the same
manner on the hill where the church now stands. Both founder and
workmen, awed by this extraordinary interference, agreed to finish the
edifice thus begun by doves.

2. The parish church of Wendover, in Buckinghamshire, stands nearly half
a mile from the town. The church was to have been placed on a field
adjoining the town, and there the building of it was begun; but the
materials were all carried away in the night by witches, or, as some
relate the tradition, by fairies, and deposited where the church now
stands. The field in which the church was to have been built is still
called "Witches' Meadow."

3. The parish church of Winwick, Lancashire, stands near that
miracle-working spot where St. Oswald, king of the Northumbrians, was
killed. The founder had destined a different site for it, but his
intention was overruled by a singular personage, whose will he never
dreamed of consulting. It must here be noticed that Winwick had then not
even received its name; the church, as not uncommon in those days, being
one of the earliest erections in the parish. The foundation of the
church, then, was laid where the founder had directed, and the close of
the first day's labour showed the workmen had not been idle, by the
progress made in the building. But the approach of night brought to pass
an event which utterly destroyed the repose of the few inhabitants
around the spot. A pig was seen running hastily to the site of the new
church; and as he ran he was heard to cry or scream aloud "We-ee-wick,
We-ee-wick, We-ee-wick!" Then, taking up a stone in his mouth, he
carried it to the spot sanctified by the death of St. Oswald, and thus
employing himself through the whole night, succeeded in removing all the
stones which had been laid by the builders. The founder, feeling himself
justly reproved for not having chosen that sacred spot for the site of
his church, unhesitatingly yielded to the wise counsel of the pig. Thus
the pig not only decided the site of the church, but gave a name to the
parish.

In support of this tradition, there is the figure of a pig sculptured on
the tower of the church, just above the western entrance; and also the
following Latin doggerel:

      "Hic locus, Oswalde, quondam placuit tibi valde;
      Northanhumbrorum fueras Rex, nuncque Polorum
      Regna tenes, loco passus Marcelde vocato."

May not the phrase "Please the pigs" have originated in the above
tradition, since the founder of Winwick Church was obliged to succumb to
the pleasure of his porkish majesty?

Instances of equally marvellous changes in the sites of buildings are
recorded in Bede, and other monkish writers. Perhaps it would not be
difficult to unravel the mystery of such changes.

_Burning the Bush._--While in Herefordshire last spring, I noticed a
singular custom in the agricultural districts. When the wheat is just
springing out of the ground, the farmer's servants rise before daybreak,
and cut a branch of thorn of a particular kind. They then make a large
fire in the field, in which they burn a portion of it; the remaining
part is afterwards hung up in the house. They do this to prevent the
smut, or mildew, affecting the wheat.

_Essex Superstition._--An uncle of mine, who has a large farm near
Ilford, tells me, that observing a horse-shoe nailed to the door of one
of his cow-houses, he asked the cow-keeper why he had fixed it there.
The lad gravely replied, "Why, to keep the wild-horse away, to be sure."
This is, to me, a new reason for the practice.

I have learned that the superstition about the bees deserting their
hives on the death of one of their owner's family, is common in the same
county. A lady tells me, that calling upon some poor people who lived at
Hyde Green, near Ingatestone, she inquired after the bees. The old woman
of the house replied, "They have all gone away since the death of poor
Dick; for we forgot to knock at the hives, and tell them he was gone
dead."

OLD SONG, "NOT LONG AGO I DRANK A FULL POT."

I send another old song; and, as in the case of the "Cuckold's Cap," I
would ask is it known?

      Not long ago I drank a full pot,
        Full of sack up to the brim,
      I drank to my friend, and he drank his pot,
        Thus we put about the whim.
      Six bottles at a draught he pour'd down his throat;
        But what are such puny sips as these?
      I laid me all along, with my mouth unto the bung,
        And I drank up a hogshead to the lees.

      I have heard of one who drank whole tankards,
        And styl'd himself the Prince of Sots;
      But what are such poor puny drunkards?
        Melt their tankards, break their pots.
      My friend and I did join for a cellar full of wine,
        We drank the vintner out of door,
      We drank it ev'ry drop, one morning at the tap,
        And we greedily star'd about for more.

      My friend then to me made this motion,
        Don't let's part thus with dry lips;
      With that we sail'd upon the ocean,
        Where we met with a fleet of ships;
      All laden with wine which was superfine,
        The merchants they had ten thousand tun,
      We drank it all at sea, before they reach'd the quay,
        And the merchants swore they were all undone.

      My friend not having quench'd his thirst,
        Said, to the vineyard let us haste;
      There we seized the canary first,
        That yielded to us but a taste:
      From thence unto the Rhine, where we drank up all their wine;
        Till Bacchus cried "Hold, hold! 'ere I die!"
      He swore he never found, in the universe around,
        Two such thirsty souls as my friend and I.

      "Pooh!" says one, "what a beast he makes himself,
        He can neither stand nor go!"
      "Sir," said I, "that's a grand mistake of yours,
        For when did you ever know a beast drink so?
      'Tis when we drink the least, we drink the most like beasts;
        'Tis when we carouse with six in hand;
      'Tis then and only then, we drink about like men,
        When we drink 'till we neither can go nor stand."

Minor Notes.

_Boston and Bunker's Hill._--In the plan of Boston, among the maps of
the Useful Knowledge Society, is to be found, near Charleston, and on
Breed's Hill (the real site of the battle usually misnamed as of
Bunker's Hill), the following notice, "Defeat of the British, 1775." My
first idea was, that, _Liberal_ though the Society might be, it was
being rather too liberal to give away in this manner a victory which,
however bloody and fruitless, was indubitably ours: but, on second
thoughts, it seemed that the whole fault arose from copying too
implicitly an American map. Now I am well aware that a very large part
of the Americans, from continually vaunting (and with good reason) the
valour they displayed, and the honour they acquired, on that occasion,
have gradually worked themselves into the belief that they were the
victors, even though their own historians tell a different tale; and
they have even placed inscriptions on the monuments standing on the site
of the intrenchments from which they were forced by the British; which
inscriptions also assert a similar claim. This would be of no great
consequence had it been confined to themselves; but its being
transferred to an English publication not only tends to mislead many
persons on this side, but enables the Americans to refer with confidence
to it, as an admission of _their_ victory on the part of the British;
and no one who remembers the use they made, on the Oregon Question, of a
similarly occasioned error in one of the Society's globes, can doubt
that our Transatlantic friends would make the most of this trifling
affair in confirmation of their claims to the victory.

_Snooks._--This name, so generally associated with vulgarity, is only a
corruption, or rather a contraction, of the more dignified name of
_Sevenoaks_. This town is generally called _Se'noaks_ in Kent; and the
further contraction, coupled with the phonetic spelling of former days,
easily passed into _S'nooks_. This is no imaginary conclusion, for I am
told by a trustworthy friend that Messrs. Sharp and Harrison,
solicitors, Southampton, have recently had in their possession a series
of deeds in which all the modes of spelling occur from _Sevenokes_ down
to _S'nokes_, in connexion with a family now known as _Snooks_.

_Last Slave sold in England._--Can any of your correspondents tell me
the date of the last public slave sale in England? Till the
establishment of Granville Sharpe's great principle, in 1772,
announcements of these are by no means uncommon. The following, from the
_Public Ledger_ of Dec. 31, 1761, grates harshly upon the feelings of
the present generation:--

  "FOR SALE:

  "A healthy negro girl, aged about fifteen years; speaks good
  English, works at her needle, washes well, does household work,
  and has had the small-pox."

    SAXONICUS.

_Hoax on Sir Walter Scott._--The following passage occurs in one of Sir
W. Scott's letters to Southey, written in September, 1810:

  "A witty rogue, the other day, who sent me a letter subscribed
  'Detector,' proved me guilty of stealing a passage from one of
  Vida's Latin poems, which I had never seen or heard of; yet there
  was so strong a general resemblance as fairly to authorise
  'Detector's' suspicion."

Lockhart remarks thereupon:

  "The lines of Vida which 'Detector' had enclosed to Scott, as the
  obvious original of the address to 'Woman' in _Marmion_, closing
  with--

      "'When pain and anguish wring the brow,
      A ministering angel thou!'

   "end as follows: and it must be owned that if Vida had really
   written them, a more extraordinary example of casual coincidence
   could never have been pointed out.

      "'Cum dolor atque supercilio gravis imminet angor,
            Fungeris angelico sola ministerio.'

   "'Detector's' reference is Vida _ad Eranen_, El. ii. v. 21.; but
   it is almost needless to add there are no such lines, and no
   piece bearing such a title in Vida's works. 'Detector' was, no
   doubt, some young college wag; for his letter has a Cambridge
   post-mark."

It may interest to know that the author of this clever hoax was Henry I.
T. Drury, then, I think, of King's College, Cambridge, and afterwards
one of the Masters at Harrow. The lines will be found in the _Arundines
Cami_.

IRISH QUERIES.

1. O'Donovan, in his edition of the _Post-Invasion Annals of the IV.
Masters_, vol. iii. p. 2091. note, says that he "intends to publish a
review of Spenser's _View of the State of Ireland_, in which he will
give him full credit for his discernment of abuses, and expose all his
intentional figments." Query, Has this review since appeared in any
Irish periodical, or other publication?

2. What is the relationship (or may it possibly be the _identity_?)
between Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who married a daughter of
William, Earl Marshal, the famous Protector, during Henry III.'s
minority, and Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who married a
daughter of King Edward I.?

3. The inquirer will consider himself extremely indebted to any one who
will inform him of the existence of a set of Middle-Age Maps of the
countries of Europe, of 8vo. or small 4to. size, published in England,
_France_, or _Germany_, in print, or easily to be had second-hand, _more
or less accurate_.

Koch's _Revolutions de l'Europe_, tome iii., Paris, 1814, gives seven
maps of the whole continent and its adjacent islands, at the following
periods of Middle-Age history:

      (1.) Avant l'Invasion des Barbares;
      (2.) Vers la Fin du Ve Siecle;
      (3.) Sous l'Empire de Charlemagne;
      (4.) Vers la Fin du IXe Siecle;
      (5.) Vers 1074;
      (6.) Vers 1300:
      (7.) A l'An 1453;

which contain, of course, but few names of places. Were Europe divided
into five unequal parts, say, 1. The Northern Countries; 2. The British
Isles; 3. The Germanic Countries, Hungary, &c.; 4. France and Spain; 5.
Italy, Turkey, &c.; and maps of these five parts given, the Northern
Countries at three periods, the British Isles at four ditto, and the
others at seven periods, as above, we should require twenty-eight maps
(not too great a number, as the King's College _Modern Atlas_, of a
convenient size, has twenty-five), which if they contained names of
places as closely packed as the King's College _Atlas_, and laid down
from Spruner, or some other trustworthy authority, would soon, it may be
said without much foresight, be in the hands of so many readers of
history, as to answer thoroughly to any bookseller undertaking to bring
them out.

4. A copy of O'Brien's _Irish-English Dictionary_, _first_ edition,

the edition of 1832 (inferior in value but more portable), and a clean

Minor Queries.

_The Azores._--In a note in _Our Village_ (vol. v.), Miss Mitford says
that this name was given to these islands collectively, on account of
the number of hawks and falcons found on them. Is the name Spanish; and
does the Natural History of the islands at the present time confirm the
assertion?

_Johnny Crapaud._--In one of Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe books is the
following entry of a trinket, devised at the period of the Duke of
Alencon's courting her Majesty:

  "Item, one little Flower of gold, with a _Frog_ thereon; and
  therein mounseer his physnomie, and a little Pearl pendant."

  "'Query,' says Miss Strickland (_Queens_, vol. vi. p. 471., 1st
  edit.), 'was this whimsical conceit a love-token, from the Duke of
  Alencon to his royal _belle amie_, and the frog designed, not as a
  ridiculous, but a sentimental allusion to his country?'"

To which Query I would add another: When was the term of _Johnny
Crapaud_ first applied to the French people, and on what occasion? I am
aware of the notion of its being on account of their said partiality for
eating frogs; which, by the bye, having tasted, I can pronounce to be
very good: _mais chacun a son gout_. Is the frog introduced in the arms
of Anjou or Alencon?

_Poems in the "Spectator."_--The fine moral poems which first appeared
in the _Spectator_, e.g. that commencing "When all thy mercies, O my
God;" the version of the Twenty-third Psalm, "The Lord my pasture shall
prepare;" "The spacious firmament on high," &c., are, as most of our
readers are aware, commonly ascribed to Addison. In a recent collection
of poetical pieces, however, I have seen them attributed to Andrew
Marvell. Can any of your readers certify either of these contradictory
assertions?

_Old John Harries, "Bishop of Wales."_--I have "An Elegy to the Memory
of the late worthy and pious Mr. John Harries of Amleston, in
Pembrokeshire, Preacher of the Gospel;" from which it appears that,
after devoting himself to preaching for forty-six years, through both
North and South Wales, and more particularly in "Roose, Castlemartin,
Pembroke, Haverfordwest, Narberth, Woodstockslop, and Amleston," he died
at Newport on the 7th of March, 1788. Will you allow me to ask your
numerous correspondents whether any of them can assist me in tracing his
pedigree? One of his sons, a minor canon of Bristol, bore the arms of
Owen Gwynedd, viz. "vert, three eagles displayed on a fesse, or," on his
book-plate. He was often called the "Bishop of Wales," from the large
district through which he _overlooked_ the progress of the Gospel.

_Black Rood in Scotland--Cross Neytz._--Observing that in Vol. ii. of
"N. & Q." pp. 308. 409., and in Vol. iii., p. 104., there is a
discussion about the "Black Rood of Scotland," which does not seem to be
very satisfactorily concluded, I am tempted to send you a passage from
Madox's _Baronia Anglica_, p. 268., &c., which seems to bear upon the
point in question, but I am not competent to say how far it may serve to
throw any light upon the obscurities of the case.

It there appears that 13th Oct. 1306, James Steward of Scotland swore
fealty to King Edw. I.:

  "By his corporal oath, taken upon the consecrated body of Christ;
  and upon _the two holy crosses_, to wit, the _cross Neytz_, and
  the _Blakerode Descoce_, and other holy reliques."

  "In the priory of Lanrecost, in the diocese of Carlisle, before W.
  Bp. of Lichfield and Coventry, the King's Chancellor; and in the
  presence of Adomar de Valence."

I perceive in one of your communications, there is mention of the
_English Cross, the Cross Nigth_, which in Madox is called "the Cross
Neytz." Perhaps some of your antiquarian correspondents will favour us
with some explanation of this cross.

I should wish moreover to elicit some further particulars of _Thomas
Madox, the Historiographer Royal_, who has so well deserved of all
lovers of ancient English history by the four books in folio which he
has left us: especially his _Formulare Anglicanum_, and that work of
prodigious industry and research, his _History of the Exchequer_. There
is some account in Nichols' _Lit. Anecdotes_, but I should wish to see
some more particulars of his life and studies, and a more exact critique
upon his several works.

_Crown Jewels once kept at Holt Castle._--I remember reading many years

the _crown jewels_ were once deposited in Holt Castle, about five miles

      De cane, de canis, cane Decane, cane."

mind the work in which it occurred.

_Frebord._--I want information on this matter, and consider "N. & Q."
peculiarly the place wherein to seek it, because it is a matter mainly
dependent on local custom. All the notice of Frebord that I have been
able to discover in books is derived from Dugdale. For instance, in
Jacob's _Law Dictionary_, ed. 1807, I read--

  "Frebord, _Franchordus_, ground claimed in some places more or
  less, beyond, or without the fence. It is said to contain two foot
  and a half."

  _Mon. Ang._, tom. ii. p. 141.

I heard, the other day, of a Warwickshire gentleman who claimed ten or
twelve feet; but the immediate reason for my Query is a claim at present
under the notice of a friend of mine is for sixty-six feet freebord! Is
not such a claim preposterous?

in 1711 and 1712, with notes, &c., by the Rev. W. Derham (a _second
edition_, with additions, published in 1714), the authors, in treating
of the stature and size of man's body, says there is great reason to
think the size of man was always the same from the Creation; and in a
note at page 330., after quoting Dr. Hakewill's _Apolog._ and other
authorities, concludes with these words:--

  "Nay, besides all this probable, we have some more certain
  evidence. Augustus was five foot nine inches high, which was the
  just measure of our famous Queen Elizabeth, who exceeded his
  height two inches, if proper allowance be made for the difference
  between the Roman and our foot."--Vide Hakewill, _Apolog._, p.
  215.

_Inscription by Luther._--In looking at some of the old books in the
library of the British Museum, I observed, on the fly-leaf of an old
Bible, an inscription by Martin Luther, the meaning of which was the
following:--

  "Elijah the prophet said, the world had existed 2000 years before
  the law (from Adam to Moses); would exist 2000 years under the
  Mosaic dispensation (from Moses to Christ), and 2000 years under
  the Christian dispensation; and then the world would be burnt."

The manuscript was in German and very much effaced, so that I am not
able to remember the words, though I very well remember the meaning.

Could any reader inform me in what part of the Bible this prophecy of
Elijah's is to be found? for I have searched for it in vain.

_All-fours._--In Macaulay's essay on Southey's edition of _The Pilgrim's
Progress_ (Longman & Co., p. 184.) occurs a curious use of this
expression:

  "The types are often inconsistent with each other; and sometimes
  the allegorical disguise is altogether thrown off.... It is not
  easy to make a simile go on all-fours. But we believe that no
  human ingenuity could produce such a centipede as a long allegory
  in which the correspondence between the outward sign and the thing
  signified should be exactly preserved. Certainly no writer ancient
  or modern has achieved the adventure."

This meaning I cannot find in Bailey's _Dictionary_, and it has escaped
the curious vigilance of Blakie's compilers. The saying, however, is a
very old one. Sir Edward Coke employs it (_Coke upon Littleton_, lib. i.
c. 1. sect. 1. p. 3. _a._):

  "But no simile holds in everything; according to the ancient
  saying, _Nullum simile quatuor pedibus currit_."

There is a marginal reference here to 1 Hen. VII. 16.

Perhaps some of your philological correspondents can throw some light on
the origin of the phrase, or at least give me some other examples of its
use. Is the expression "To be on all-fours with" good English?

    C. MANSFIELD INGLEBY.

_Richard, second Son of the Conqueror_, is said by Hume, and by some
minor writers after him, to have been killed by a stag in the New
Forest; but William of Malmesbury and Roger of Wendover both say that he
died of fever, consequent on malaria, which struck him while hunting
there. This is well known to be of frequent occurrence in the
neighbourhood of desolated human dwellings; and thus seems to involve
even a more striking instance of retributive justice than the fate which
Hume assigns to him. The fatality attending most of this name in our
history is singular. Of nine princes (three of them kings) who have
borne the name of Richard, seven, or, if Hume is right, eight, have died
violent deaths, including four successive generations of the House of
York.

_Francis Walkinghame._--Your correspondent's mention of my _Arithmetical

which has never obtained the slightest answer--Who was Francis
Walkinghame, and when was his work on arithmetic first published? The
earliest edition I know of is the twenty-third, in 1787; but I am told,
on good authority, that Mr. Douce had the sixteenth edition of 1779.

_Optical Phenomenon._--I shall be much obliged to anybody who will
explain a phenomenon which I have observed.

Suppose 1. A street from twenty to thirty feet broad.

2. At the open window of a house on one side stands a man looking at the
corresponding window of the house on the opposite side; that is, he
looks at what was a window, but is now filled up with a large board that
is covered with an inscription of short lines, black on white; in short,
just such a board as one sees at a turnpike gate.

3. From shortness, or defect, of sight (I cannot say which), the man is
unable to read the inscription as he stands at his window.

4. He sits down on a low seat, so as to bring his eye almost close to,
and just on a level with, the sill of his own window. He then slowly
raises and depresses his head. As he does this, it of course appears to
him as if his own window-sill travelled up and down the board opposite.

5. In doing so it comes successively under each line of the inscription.

6. As it does so, that one line becomes perfectly legible.

  ["To sham Abraham" is a cant expression, having reference to the
  practices of a class of vagabonds and cheats once common in this
  country. In Decker's _English Villanies_ there are many curious
  particulars of the habits of this class of impostors. "She's all
  Abram," that is, quite naked. "What an Abram!" an exclamation for
  a ragged fellow. "An Abraham-man" was an impostor who personated a
  poor lunatic called Tom of Bedlam: one of this class is described
  by Shakspeare in his _Lear_, Act II. Sc. 3.:

      "The basest and most poorest shape,
      That every penury, in contempt of man,
      Brought near to beast."

SCOTTISH REGALIA.

(Vol. iv., p. 208.)

The story referred to by Jeremy Taylor reminds me of a somewhat similar
instance of dishonest astuteness I lately heard of in Scotland, from an
old Highlander; the which, though courtesy forbade me to dispute, I at
the time received "cum grano," and have since been unable to verify. It
was as follows:

The custodians (whether rightful or not, I know not, as no date was
assigned to the action of the narrative) of the Scottish regalia being
bound by an oath to deliver it to the Governor of Carlisle, as the
nearest representative of the English sovereign, by a certain day,
determined upon a plan for performing (!), and at the same time evading,
their promise. Having selected the most able steed in Scotland, a
suitable deputation escorted the regalia _and the horse_ to the
appointed place of tradition. The embassy carrying with them the more
valuable and portable of their treasures--the jewels, not the horse, of
which hereafter,--were duly admitted to an audience with the governor,
who received them in the presence of the principal inhabitants of
Carlisle: and having produced and surrendered the regalia (and doubtless
taken an acquittance!), surreptitiously, and with gipsey adroitness,
regained possession of it, and conveying it from the audience chamber,
immediately delivered it to an expectant messenger; who, mounted on the
before-mentioned horse, awaited its return outside the hall; and who,
_ventre a terre_, pursued his eager flight across the border, nor once
drew rein until his precious burden was again deposited in the custody
of Scottish tenure. Whether the deputation was dismissed, and escaped
before the discovery of its chicanery, or whether the conspirators
received the well-merited punishment of their audacious dissimulation,
my informant knew not. And although the story tells more in favour of
the astuteness than the honesty of his countrymen (if true), he
narrated it with considerable unction, and declared that it was
generally believed and admired in Scotland; the patriotism displayed,
the dangerous nature of the enterprise, and the success which attended
it, palliating any stigma which might attach to the want of faith,
double dealing, and casuistry which marked the transaction.

The method by which the horse's title to be considered the ablest in
Scotland was ascertained, was ingenious. The horses the most renowned
for fleetness and endurance were secretly collected, and having been
deprived of water for a considerable time, were presently, one by one,
permitted to bury their heads in the grateful bucket, and the duration
of each draught was scrupulously watched and recorded; the animal that
retained its nostrils for the longest time immersed being selected for
the honour of rescuing the royal treasure, as having given proofs of its
superior wind and bottom.

Is any credit to be attached to the story: and if historical, can any
reader inform me where it is recorded?

GOSPEL OAKS.

(Vol. v., pp. 157. 209.)

The replies of FABER, EXON., and P. T. to the inquiry of STEPHEN,
concerning the origin of Gospel Oaks, are not very explanatory.

The oak was consecrated to the god of thunder--Ang.-Sax., _Thunor_;
Gallic, _Taranis_; Irish, _Toran_; Anc. N. _Thorr_--as being more
generally struck by lightning than any other tree; and the acorn was
called by the Romans _Jovis glans_, the fruit of the supreme god.

  "Quercus Jovi placuit."--_Phaedrus_, III. 17.

  "Magna Jovis antiquo robore quercus."--Virg. _Georg._ III. 332.

At Dodona stood the [Greek: drys hypsikomos Dios].--_Od._ XIV. 327.

Woods, groves, and trees were the temples and sacred emblems of the
Deity among the greater part of the Pagans, but especially among the
Teutonic and Celtic tribes. Maximus Tyrius, an author of the second
century, informs us, concerning the worship of the Celts:

  [Greek: Keltoi sebousi men Dia, agalma de Dios Keltikon hypsele
  drys.]

And Tacitus gives us the oldest testimonies concerning the Germans,
_Germ._ 9.:

  "Ceterum, nec cohibere parietibus Deos, neque in ullam humani oris
  speciem assimulare, ex magnitudine coelestium arbitrantur. _Lucos
  ac nemora consecrant_, Deorumque nominibus appellant secretum
  illud, quod sola reverentia vident."

  Vid. _Germ._ 39. cap. 40. cap. 43., &c.

Also, a passage of the later Claudian is to the same purpose:

      Ut procul Hercyniae per vasta silentia silvae
      Venari tuto liceat, lucosque vetusta
      Religione truces, et _robora Numinis instar
      Barbarici_, nostrae feriant impune bipennes.

      _Cons. Stilich._ I. 288.

From these passages it will be seen that the gods dwelt in these groves,
and that sacred vessels and altars were placed there, but no images;
neither were temples erected.[2] The practice of worshipping the gods in
woods and trees continued for many centuries, till the introduction of
Christianity (Vid. Willibald, A.D. 786, _in Vita Bonifacii_), and the
converters did not disdain to adopt every means to raise Christian
cultus to higher authority than that of Paganism, by acting upon the
senses of the heathen, _e.g._ using white robes for those baptized,
lighting of candles, burning of incense, &c.; and they erected the
Christian churches, for the most part, upon the site of Pagan _tree_ or
temple; Sulp. _Severus_ (ed. Amst. 1665), p. 485.:

  "Nam ubi fana destruxerat (Martinus), _statim ibi aut ecclesias
  aut monasteria construebat_."

Dietm. _V. Merseb._, 7. 52., p. 859.:

  "Fana idolorum destruens incendit, et mare daemonibus cultum
  inmissis quatuor lapidibus, sacro Chrismate perunctis et aqua
  purgans benedicta, novam Domino ... plantationem eduxit."

  [Footnote 2: Brissonius _De Regno Pers._ II. 28.: "Persae diis suis
  nulla templa vel altaria constituunt, nulla simulacra."]

The heathen gods were represented as impotent, in opposition to the true
God, though not as powerless in themselves, and were converted into
inimical evil powers, which must submit, but could nevertheless exercise
a certain hurtful influence.

Some heathen traditions and superstitions remained, their names only
being altered into those of Christ, Maria, and the saints. In this
manner they spared the assuefactions of the people, and made them
believe that the sacredness of the place was not lost, but henceforth
depended on the presence of the true God.

The above facts will perhaps sufficiently explain the origin of the
Gospel Oak.

MITIGATION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO A FORGER.

(Vol. iv., p. 434.)

The case related by MR. GATTY is interesting, but requires sifting.
Perhaps he will be good enough to do it, or to put me on the trail. As
the energetic sister may be a reader of "N. & Q.," I do not wish to
annoy her by printing the forger's name, but I shall be glad to have the
place and date of the conviction.

About twenty years ago, the rule of hanging for forgery was broken in
the case of Fry, a school-master, who was sentenced to death without any
hope of mercy, and not reprieved till he had heard the "condemned
sermon"--I think, not till the day before that which was fixed for his
execution. He showed great fear; rolled upon the chapel floor, and
delivered to the sheriffs a well-written protest against the right to
inflict capital punishment. His being spared caused much surprise; and
between that event and the abolition of the punishment of death for
forgery, few, if any, were executed for that crime.

The sister, falling, at the feet of Baron G----, who "was notorious for
his unflinching obduracy," is a melo-dramatic event which, I think,
would have found its way to the newspapers. But the most extraordinary
thing is the conclusion:

  "The forger was placed in the hulks prior to transportation; and
  before this took place he had forged a pass or order from the Home
  Secretary's office for his own liberation, which procured his
  release, and he was never afterwards heard of."

Letters to convicts in the hulks are opened by the officers before being
delivered to the prisoners. It is not usual for the Home Secretary to
write to a convict enclosing "a pass or order." On the contrary, a
pardon is attended with a good number of formalities, and without one I
do not think that any convict would have been allowed to quit the
vessel. In that class of prisoners, leave of absence on parole, or a
"day rule," would have been something peculiar enough to make the
turnkey ask, "Where did you get this?" In short, a convict who made his
escape as described must be as extraordinary a person as the strong
American, who could sit in a basket and lift himself upon a table by the
handles.

  "She returned to the city at which the assizes had been held just
  as they were concluded. The two judges were in the act of
  descending the cathedral nave, after partaking of the Holy
  Sacrament, when," &c.

It is usual for the judges to attend divine service on the
commission-day if they arrive soon enough, or the day after if they do
not. If a Sunday occur during the sitting of the commission, they also
attend; but I never knew, and on inquiring I cannot hear, that they ever
so attended at the close of the assizes, when they are always glad to
get on to the next town, if the circuit is not concluded, and away
altogether if it is.

LORDS MARCHERS OF WALES.

(Vol. v., pp. 30. 135. 189.)

Allow me to call upon your correspondent I. J. H. H., who dates from St.
Asaph, to explain what he means by a Lordship Marcher; and what proof he
possesses that his friend Mr. Lloyd is the "only Lord Marcher now extant
in the kingdom?" The most authentic single record which we possess of
the number, names, and situation of these lordships is the statute 27
Hen. VIII. ch. 26. The writs issued to the Lords Marchers, at various
times before that statute, would perhaps furnish materials for a more
exact enumeration of them; but the above Act was unquestionably intended
to include all of them; and the only reason why the information conveyed
by it is not complete is, that some of the names specified in it may
perhaps be those of townships, or other districts within, or parcel of,
some Lordship Marcher, and that other lordships seem to be comprehended
under a general description, such as "all lordships lying between
Chepstow Bridge and Gloucestershire." Hence, the number of real
Lordships Marchers may, _perhaps_, be fewer or more than are there
mentioned. Herbert, in his _History of Henry VIII._, says that there
were 141 Lordships Marchers. (Kennett's _Compl. Hist._, vol. ii. p.
189.)

The lordship of Kemes is not, I think, specified in the Act; but I
presume that it is comprehended within some of the descriptions of
lordships in it. Probably it is included in sect. 16. In old writs of
summons to attend the King in his wars, Kemes is associated with Dyvett
or with Llandovery.

The statute referred to did, in fact, extinguish the most characteristic
privileges of a Lordship Marcher, and reduced it nearly to the level of
an ordinary lordship, with such royalties only as have often been
granted, and are still enjoyed, by Lords of Manors, or honours in other
parts of England and Wales. The franchises left to them are enumerated
in sections 25. and 30., explained by the later statute 1 & 2 Phil. &
Mary, ch. 15. The palatine jurisdiction which they once possessed, and
the exemption from ordinary process, exist no longer; and the various
local customs prevailing in each lordship, which were repugnant to the
common law of England, must have been almost wholly abolished by the
operation of that Act. The lordships themselves remain in name, and in
little more than in name.

Hence I am afraid that I. J. H. H.'s friend must be prepared to
surrender the distinction of being the sole surviving Lord Marcher. In
the strict and original sense of the term, there is now no such lordship
in existence. In the sense in which alone the title can now be assumed,
he shares the honour with many others; among others, with the Duke of
Beaufort, who holds the very extensive and important Marcher Seignory of
Gower and Kilvey.

Probably the number of private lordships of this kind is not now great;
for, at the passing of the above statute, the majority were in the
Crown; and if any have since been re-granted, it is most likely that
their franchises and tenure would be so modified as to leave no vestige
of the Marcher privileges in them.

The statement of your correspondent suggests to me another doubt. How
could any Lordship Marcher be "erected by Martin of Tours?" Every such
lordship must be of the creation of the Crown, either shown or presumed.
The date of the establishment of these marcherships is so ancient that,
perhaps, no one may have actually seen any document to prove them but
charters of confirmation and inquisitions post-mortem; still the _law_
refers their origin to specific Crown grants, and not to the act or
authority of a mere subject. If, therefore, Martin, who was a tenant in
capite of the Crown, founded the lordship of Kemes, he must have
done--as the military invaders of Ireland in a subsequent reign
did--conquered the territory with his own arms, and obtained palatine
jurisdiction over it, with the assent and by the authority of the King.

Let me add, that the MS. treatise in the Harleian Collection (referred
to _ante_, p. 135.) is printed in Pennant's _Wales_, and, more
correctly, in vol. ii. of the _Transactions of the Cymmrodorion
Society_. It is much to be lamented that the treatise on the Lordships
Marchers, bequeathed by Sir Matthew Hale to the Society of Lincoln's
Inn, is not to be found in that library. If the work was composed by
that eminent judge himself, it must be one of the highest value and
authority. Does any one possess it, or a copy of it?

DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION.

(Vol. iii., p. 374.)

"Can any of your readers inform me of any traces of the doctrine of the
resurrection before the Christian era?" I shall endeavour as briefly as
possible to do justice to this important subject by giving extracts
from, and references to, various authors, especially Hody in his work
_The Resurrection of the (Same) Body Asserted from the Traditions of the
Heathens, &c._ The arguments derived from this source are as follow:--

1. "The gross notions of the heathens concerning the soul in its state
of separation, that it has all the same parts as the body has."

Confer Farmer on the _Worship of Human Spirits in the Ancient Heathen
Nations_, p. 419. _et seq._; _AEschyli Persae_, v. 616.; and Blomfield's
note; _Nicolaus de Sepulchris Hebraeorum, &c._, cap. ix. and xiv.

2. "Their opinion concerning the transmigration of souls." Confer Vossii
_Idololat._, lib. i. c. x.

3. "Their opinion concerning the duration of the soul as long as the
body lasted, and its adherence to the body after death," v. Cicero,
_Tuscul. Quaest._, lib. i.; _Lucret._, lib. iii. Concerning the opinion
of the Egyptians, v. _Greenham on Embalming_.

4. "The belief that some men have ascended up into heaven in their
bodies, there to remain for ever," v. Hody.

5. "That others have done so even after death upon a re-union of their
souls and bodies." (H.) "There were not only certain persons under the
law and among the Jews who were raised to life; but there were also
histories among the Gentiles of several who rose the third day; and
Plato mentioneth another who revived the twelfth day after death, _Plato
de Rep._, lib. x.; _Plin._ lib. vii. 52., "De his qui elati revixerunt;"
_Philostrat._ lib. iii. c. xiii."--_Pearson on the Creed._ There are
histories of this description in _Bonifacii Hist. Ludiceae_, p. 561. _et
seq._

6. "The opinion of the Pythagoreans and Platonists, &c., concerning the
restitution of our bodies, and of all other things in the world to their
former state, after the revolution of many ages, by a new birth or
production." On the Platonic year confer Gale's _Court of the Gentiles_,
book iii. c. 7.; on the Phoenix cycle of the Egyptians, Rev. Edw.
Greswell's _Fasti Catholici and Origines Calendariae_. By some this
restitution is considered as merely astronomical, _v._ Costard's _Hist.
of Astronomy_, p. 131. "The opinion of some of the Genethliacal writers,
that the soul returns and is united to the same body in the space of 440
years."--_Varro ap Aug. de Civit._ xxii. 28.; Jackson's _Works_, vol.
iii. p. 424. "The opinion of the Stoics concerning the reproduction of
all the same men, &c., after the general conflagration," v. _Eusebii
Praep. Evang._, lib. xv.; _M. Antonin. Imp._, lib. xi. The resurrection
was asserted by the Persian Magi, the Indian Brachmans, and other
philosophers both oriental and western. "Thus we have demonstrated what
evident notices the heathens had of the last conflagration, with the
ensuing judgment, and man's immortal state; and all from sacred oracles
and traditions."--Gale, _ut supra_.

CAN A CLERGYMAN MARRY HIMSELF?

(Vol. v., p. 370.)

A Query has been put respecting a clergyman marrying himself. Such a
thing did once occur in the case of the Rev. J. D. T. M. F----g, curate
of the parish of S----n M----t, Somersetshire. The parish register
informs us that--

  "On three several Sundays, namely, on the 22nd and 29th days of
  July, and the 5th August in the year 1787, banns of marriage were
  published in the parish church between J. D. T. M. F----g and H.
  V. B----t; and after the third publication, no impediment being
  alleged, the said J. D. T. M. F----g and H. V. B----t were
  _immediately_ married in the face of the congregation, on the 5th
  of August, 1787, by J----n F----g curate."

The parties' names are appended to the form "This marriage was
solemnised between us;" and then follows, "in the presence of" two
witnesses who signed their names, one of them being the "clark," as he
spelt the word. The event occurred "on a Sacrament Sunday." An aged
parishioner, who was about seventy-four or seventy-five years of age
when my informant wrote, perfectly remembered the ceremony; and added,
that previously to Mr. F.'s return from the Lord's Table to the reading
desk, in order to continue the service, from the Second Lesson, he
exchanged a kiss with his blushing bride! It appears that, owing to
several persons having disputed the _validity_ of this marriage, the
said parties were re-married by the Rev. W. N----s, officiating
minister, on the 9th October in the same year.

I have heard that Mr. F. was always regarded as an eccentric man, it not
deranged. I think I have heard that the bride was a milk girl, with whom
the reverend gentleman fell in love because "she reminded him of his
first love!" The marriage was decidedly opposed by his relatives and
friends, which led to the above-mentioned singular occurrence. I
believe, before performing the ceremony himself, Mr. F. publicly
inquired "whether there was any one provided to marry him?" As there was
not, he proceeded to the performance of the ceremony himself.

I have heard also of some such case of a clergyman marrying himself in
Ireland. But the marriage was, I believe, pronounced null and void, and
the clergyman deposed from the ministry.

Connected with this subject, I would relate another circumstance related
to me as a fact by a clergyman, now a surrogate, who for very many years
was curate of the parish adjoining that in which it occurred. He related
it to justify and to explain his own somewhat unusual practice of using
the _surnames_ as well as Christian names of the parties throughout the
Marriage Service, saying that in the parish of B----y, Gloucestershire,
the not doing so led to the _wrong couple being married_, owing to the
stupidity of the parties and their friends! The rector, Rev. Mr. M----d,
on discovering the mistake, formally pronounced the whole proceeding
null and void, and then married the right couple!

A correspondent lately inquired whether a person could be buried in a
garden! In N----h, Gloucestershire, such a thing occurred about sixteen
years ago. An eccentric old gentleman built a kind of summer-house in
his garden, and prepared his own tomb in it, and was there buried
according to his directions. I rather think the funeral service was
read, under the express sanction of the bishop, by the rector of an
adjoining parish, who was a friend of the deceased.

_Algernon Sydney_ (Vol. v., pp. 318. 426.).--I can hardly suppose that
MR. H. DIXON can have made any progress in his inquiries as to Algernon
Sydney, without having met with the "authorities" mentioned by your
correspondent C. E. D.; and yet it is certainly strange that, if MR.
DIXON had seen these authorities, he could have called Sydney "an
_illustrious patriot_." It may be therefore as well to state that the
specific evidence which destroys Sydney's claim to the title not merely
of an "_illustrious patriot_," but even of _an honest man_, and shows
him to have been a corrupt traitor of the worst class, is to be found in
the Appendix to Sir John Dalrymple's _Memoirs_, vol. i. pp. 339. 386.
(8vo edit. 1790), where are transcribed the secret despatches of the
French ambassador, Barillon, to Louis XIV., detailing the _bribes_ by
which he engaged Algernon Sydney to that factious and traitorous
opposition which had, for a hundred years prior to Dalrymple's
publication, passed off for _patriotism_. I shall be very curious indeed
to see what light MR. H. DIXON may be able to throw on this curious and
infamous case; of which the best that even Mr. Macaulay can say is, that
Barillon's _louis d'ors_ were "a temptation which conquered the virtue
and the pride of Algernon Sydney."--_History of England_, vol. i. p.

_Cock-and-Bull Stories_ (Vol. v., p. 414.).--It may be doubted whether
Mr. Faber will thank J. R. R. for republishing his absurd blunder. It
must not, however, be allowed to gain a settlement in "N. & Q.," or to
pass for a real explanation, while it is in reality one of the most
unfortunate "cock-and-bull" stories that ever was invented. The truth
is, that Reinerius, a writer of the Middle Ages, lays it to the charge
of the Waldenses that they did not hold the traditions of the Church
and, by way of instance, he specifies that they did _not_ believe (as,
he took for granted, all his orthodox readers _did_) that the cock on
the church steeple was symbolical of a doctor or teacher. Reinerius did
not think of adding a word of explanation about its overlooking the
parish from its elevated position, or of its prescriptive right from the
days of St. Peter to do a pastor's office by reminding men of the duty
of repentance, or of any of the things which writers on symbolism had
said, or might say. He nakedly states, "Item, mysticum sensum in divinis
scripturis refutant: praecipue in dictis et actis ab Ecclesia traditis:
ut quod gallus super campanile significat Doctorem." Mr. Faber, who was
somewhat out of his way in dealing with the thoughts and language of
mediaeval writers, catching a sight of this passage, blundered between a
_bell_ and a _belfry_, put _campanum_ for _campanile_, and thus got an
idea of a "cock-on-a-bell," and that this symbol meant a doctor.
Whereupon it occurred to him to set the world right with the wonderful
discovery which J. R. R. has revived for the amusement of your readers.

_Thomas Crawford_ (Vol. v., p. 344.).--In the seventeenth century there
were four professors of philosophy in every university in Scotland.
Thomas Crawford was one of the professors in the University of Edinburgh
from 1640 to 1662.

Thomas Crawford, educated at St. Leonard's College, St. Andrew's,
graduated A.M. 1621. Succeeded Mr. Samuel Rutherford as Professor of
Humanity in the University of Edinburgh, 1625. Appointed Rector of the
High School of Edinburgh in 1630. Elected Professor of Philosophy (or
Regent) in the University of Edinburgh, 1640, and continued in that
office till his death, in 1662.

He was the author of _A Short History of the University of Edinburgh,
from 1582 to 1646_, first printed in 1808; and of _Notes and
Observations on G. Buchanan's History of Scotland_: Edinb. 1708, 8vo.

_Theological Tract--The Huntyng of the Romish Fox_ (Vol. iii., p.

This tract has just been reprinted, with some curtailments and

_Moke_ (Vol. v., p. 374).--With the Editor of "N. & Q." I think the
interpretation of "muck" for the old word used by Wyckliffe is "not
satisfactory:" I therefore suggest another, perhaps equally
questionable. Every rustic in grazing districts knows, that in the hot
season of the year sheep are liable to be fearfully flyblown in their
living flesh; and that the maggots thence resulting are called _mokes_,
or mawks. Is not the preacher's allusion in the text to certain
shepherds, or rather sheep of Christ's flock, who, rather than give one
of their _mokes_ to help one of their "needy brethren," will allow
themselves to "perish" and "be taken of" these maggots? The term in
question is, or was formerly, in provincial use as a metonym for
lendiculosity in a figurative sense--a tetchy, whimsical individual,
being said to be "maggoty," _vulgo_, _mokey_. Lendix has not, however,
in all cases been treated with abhorrence; for one of the elder Wesleys
not only printed a book of rhymes with the title of _Maggots_, but
prefixed to it his portrait, with one of these _animi impetu concitari_
represented as creeping on the forehead!

_Nobleman alluded to by Bishop Berkeley_ (Vol. v., p. 345.).--I beg to
suggest to your correspondent J. M., that this nobleman was Richard
Boyle, third Earl of Burlington, and fourth Earl of Cork, who had a
passion for architecture, and was the architect of numerous buildings in
the metropolis and other parts of the kingdom. He repaired Inigo Jones's
church of St. Paul, Covent Garden. He built the front of Burlington
House in Piccadilly; the dormitory at Westminster School; the Assembly
Rooms at York; and several villas and mansions in various parts of the
country, besides publishing some architectural works. Bishop Berkeley
was introduced to him by Pope about the year 1722, and I believe derived
some benefit from his patronage. His architectural pursuits are alluded
to by Pope in the epistle on the use of riches, which was addressed to
him.

_House at Welling_ (Vol. v., p. 368.).--Inquiry is made about one of our

I am the owner of the house referred to, and have lived here since 1811.
I have never heard the report, but I think that it may have arisen from
the fact, that about eighty years ago a Major _Denham_ possessed the
house. It is possible that he may have been mistaken for his namesake,
_Denham_ the poet.

_The Iron Plate in Lewes Castle_ (Vol. v., p. 342.).--In answer to A. W.
I beg to say that the iron plate was taken from the ruins of a cottage
which was burnt down on the estate of Sir Henry Shiffner some time
since; it formed the fire-back of the kitchen: the inscription was
turned to the wall, and therefore not visible.

This inscription is a fac-simile of the iron plate placed to the memory
of Ann Forster in the church of Crowhurst in Surrey, and it would appear
that the founder cast several plates similar to that in Lewes Castle,
which are known to exist and be used as fire-backs. See Brayley and
Britton's _History of Surrey_, vol. iv. p. 131., and note at foot of the
same page.

    WILLIAM FIGG.

  Lewes.

The monumental (cast iron?) plate in Lewes castle, referred to by A. W.,
probably came from the church of Crowhurst in Surrey, where there are
several monuments to members of the family of Gaynsford, and there were
(in Sept. 1847, when I visited the building) more than one iron plate in
the pavement with inscriptions of the exact character of that at Lewes,
and with the letters similarly inverted and reversed. My impression is
that I saw the memorial in question in the church; but I cannot now
discover the notes I made on the subject at the time, nor a rubbing
which I took of another iron plate of a more ornate though not less rude
character. I remember, in passing within sight of the church on the
Dover Railway, since 1847, to have noticed scaffolding about the tower;
possibly the plate now at Lewes may have been removed at that time.

    R. C. H.

The plate was presented to the Antiquarian Museum in Lewes Castle by Sir
H. Shiffner, Bart., about two years ago, when he rescued it from a
farm-house burnt down on his property near Lewes. It has been traced to
a cottage where it previously served the same purpose as at the
farm-house, as back to the fire-place; but no further record of its
former history can be discovered. It is not unusual, however, to find
monumental plates thus desecrated.

_Chelwoldesbury_ (Vol. v., p. 346.).--Allow me to suggest to your

originally have been Ceolwoldsburh or Ceolweardesburh, i.e. _the burgh_
or _castle of Ceolwold_ or _Ceolweard_, analogously with Brihthelmstun,
now contracted into _Brighton_. The A.-S. _ce_ has constantly been
corrupted into _che_.

"_The King's Booke_" (Vol. v., p. 389.).--The printer's account supplied

_Key Experiments_ (Vol v., pp. 152. 293.).--In an edition of _Hudibras_
of 1704 appears the following "annotation" to the line "As Friar Bacon's
noddle was:"--

  "The tradition of Friar Bacon and the Brazen-head is very commonly
  known, and considering the times he lived in, is not much more
  strange than what another great philosopher of his name has since
  deliver'd of a ring that, being ty'd in a string, and held like a
  pendulum in the middle of a silver bowl, will vibrate of itself,
  and tell exactly against the sides of the divining-cup the same
  thing with, Time is, Time was, &c."

I have tried this experiment with the ring, and find the oscillation
takes place as described by AGMOND with the shilling. If, however, the
thread is tightly pressed between the finger and thumb, the vibration
ceases. This latter circumstance appears to support AGMOND'S idea, that
the motive power is due to the pulse, the circulation of the blood
ceasing by pressure.

this reference is much more likely; as our ancestors were most
particular in their superstitious attentions to the requirements of this
most mischievous fraternity.

_The Word Shunt_ (Vol. v., p. 352.) is quite common in the North of
England; in Lancashire it is perhaps especially so. It signifies to
shift, to move, to give way: as, speaking of a thing, a wall or
foundation, which has moved from its position, we should say, "it has
shunted;" or of a thing which requires moving, "Shunt it a little that
way," "Shunt it at the other end." _Shunt_, to move, to slip, to give
way; _shuntu_, they move; _shuntut_, they moved.--See Bamford's
_Lancashire Dialect_: Smith, Soho Square.

The word _grin_, in the same county, signifies a noose to catch hares or
other game, as well as the act of grinning with the teeth. The word
_gin_ is seldom used, except to express a horse gin-wheel, or the
_blue-ruin_ of the Pandemoniums.

_Abigail_ (Vol. iv., p. 424.; Vol. v., pp. 38. 94.).--As your

mention that the use of this name in the sense alluded to has probably
originated from a "waiting gentlewoman" who figures in Beaumont and
Fletcher's comedy of _The Scornful Lady_. As this play appears from
Pepys's _Diary_ to have been a great favourite after the Restoration, it
was then most probably that the term came into use.

_Nuremberg Token, or Counter_ (Vol. v., pp. 201. 260.).--G. H. K.
appears to consider the object of H. C. K.'s Query a tradesman's token.
This is by no means the case. It is a jetton, or counter, such as was
formerly much in use for casting accounts, on a principle very similar
to that of the abacus. They are found in vast numbers in England, but
were principally manufactured at Nuremberg, where a large trade in them
must have been carried on. The greatest manufacturers of the
"Rechenpfennige" were the members of the families of Schultz, Laufer,
and Krauwinckel. Of the three Krauwinckels, the productions of Hans are
most numerous. Many of them have legends of a moral or religious
character, as "Gottes Segen macht reich," God's blessing maketh rich;
"Gott allein die Ehre sey," To God alone be the glory; "Heut rodt,
Morgen todt," To-day _red_, to-morrow dead, &c. The date 1601 occurs on
several of those of Hans K., with mythological devices.--See Snelling's
_Treatise on Jettons, or Counters_.

    J. E.

The legend on the counter described signifies

      "John Kravwinckel in Nuremberg."
      Rx "God's kingdom remains always."

I know not the signification of the solitary E. Snelling (_Treatise on
Abbey Pieces, &c._) has engraved and described many of these counters,
and to him I must refer H. C. K. Hans means John, and has no reference
to the Hanseatic League.

_Meaning of Lode_ (Vol. v., p. 345.).--_Lode_ and _load_, in Cornwall,

having similar reference to the watercourses by which the fens are

Lode means to carry. (_Promptorium Parvulorum_, ed. Way, p. 310.) The
term _lode_ is now used to signify a navigable ditch. In Cambridgeshire
we have Soham Lode, Burwell Lode, Reach Lode, Swaffham Lode, and
Bottisham Lode.

It appears that Mr. Bindley had an unique engraving of her, and that a
well-known alehouse at Holloway (of which a token is extant, with the
date 1667) was sacred to her memory as Mother Redcap, as well as that in
the Hampstead Road.

_Monuments of De la Beche Family_ (Vol. v., p. 341.).--The monuments
referred to by AEGROTUS are in the church of Aldworth: the effigies are
certainly remarkable, especially one for its size and attitude. Another
noticeable circumstance is that most of the figures are of older date
than the tombs on which they lie, or than the church which contains
them. The building consists of a nave and south aisle; and, at the time
of its original construction, three canopied recessed tombs were
introduced in each of the side walls to receive the effigies which must
have existed in the older church. The style of the architecture belongs
to the age of Edward III. There are nine figures altogether, some of
them greatly mutilated. They are not entirely unknown to archaeologists.

I may take this opportunity of calling attention to another very fine
monumental effigy, of which I believe no moderately good representation
has been published, at Tilton in Leicestershire. There are two figures
in the church of as early dates as those at Aldworth, one an armed male,
and the other a female. The former is in "edgering" mail, and is of good
character; but the latter is of superior design, and very well executed,
though unfortunately in a coarse material. The right arm is bent, and
the hand brought up to the breast; the left hangs naturally by the side,
and has the fore-arm and (bare) hand exposed from among the folds of the
drapery. Slight traces of colour are discoverable.

    R. C. H.

The village of Aldworth, in Berkshire, where the effigies of the De la
Beche family are to be seen, is about five miles from the Goring
Station, on the Great Western Railway, _via_ Streatley. Hewett's
_Hundred of Compton_ furnishes a very interesting account of the ten
monumental effigies which represent various members of the ancient
family of De la Beche in that church, and will be read with no small
pleasure.

_Monumental Portraits_ (Vol. v., p. 349.).--Fully agreeing with my
friend H. H. in his opinion of the brass of the Abbess of Elstow,
considered as a portrait, I should yet be glad if your correspondents
would send to "N. & Q." the names of any effigies which may appear to
them exceptions to the rule of conventional portraiture, especially if
of earlier date than the latter half of the sixteenth century. H. H. has
mentioned one, Nicholas Canteys, 1431, at Margate: and I am inclined to
add another in the well-executed little brass of Robert de Brentingham
at East Horsley, Surrey; this is about the date of 1380. The artists of
that time, in brasses as well as in painted glass, wood-carving, &c.,
may have sometimes desired to produce a portrait, but certainly they
seldom succeeded: a religious severity of expression atoned for the
deficiency. In English coins it is well known that there is no
appearance of a portrait before the reign of Henry VII.

The particular _costume_, however, of the deceased was more attended to
in monumental effigies; and it is this fact which renders the study of
them so serviceable towards a knowledge of the manners and habits of our
ancestors. Care was even taken not to omit any peculiarity which may
have distinguished the deceased; of which the long beard of Sir Wm.
Tendring, at Stoke, by Layland, is perhaps an instance, and many others
might be quoted. If any decided portraits are known in _stone effigies_,
it would I think be desirable to communicate such to the pages of "N. &
Q."

_Motto on Chimney-piece_ (Vol. v., p. 345.)--It does not appear to me
that the mottoes sent by your inquirer C. T. are very difficult to
solve. The first is Latin:

      "VITATRANOVULAESTOLIM."

He says he is not certain as to one or two letters. I suspect the first
O should be Q, and the V should be I. It will then read:

      "Vita tranquila est olim."

      "Life is henceforth tranquil."

A very proper motto for a fire-side.

The second is Italian:

      "VE DAL AM DARO."

I suspect the R should be T. It will then read:

      "Ve da'l amico dato."

      "Given to you by the friend."

If the word is _daro_, it will be--

      "I will give it to you from the friend."

Clare (who had married the heiress of Cavendish), was created by King
William III. in 1694 Marquis of Clare and Duke of Newcastle.

Might not the chimney-piece have adorned a mansion of the Cavendish
family, who probably resided in Newcastle during the period above
alluded to?

The motto underneath (which is _not_ the family motto of Cavendish)
certainly at first sight looks puzzling enough; will the following
solution suffice, which I merely throw out as a first thought that may
lead to a better elucidation?

      "Vita: tran: ovula: est: olim."

Presuming "ovula" to be the diminutive of _ovum_ (I am not sure if I am
correct), and "tran" (if correctly transcribed) to be a component part
of one of the numerous compounds of _trans_ (say _transitorius_), may
not the passage be _freely_ translated: "(Our) transitory life (was)
once (as mysterious, or hidden, or minute as) is (the germ of vitality)
in an egg?"

If C. T. could give a description of the second coat, some connecting
link may possibly be supplied toward unravelling the motto.

"_Ve dal am daro_" (Vol. v., p. 325.).--One of the mottoes which puzzle
your correspondent C. T. is Welsh, and means that _retribution will
follow violence_: "he will pay (_i.e._ suffer) for striking."

_White-livered_ (Vol. v., pp. 127. 403.).--Bishop Ridley, in his
conference with Bishop Latimer, whilst they were confined in the Tower,
makes use of the expression: "For surely, except the Lord assist me with
His gracious aid in the time of His service, I know I shall play but the
part of a _white-livered knight_."

_Enigmatical Epitaphs_ (Vol. v., p. 179.).--The brasses of John
Killyngworth, 1412, formerly in Eddlesborough Church, now in Pitson
Church, Bucks; and of a priest at St. Peter's, near St. Alban's, have
this inscription upon them:

  "Ecce quod expendi habui, quod donavi habeo, quod negavi punior,
  quod servavi perdidi."

That at St. Alban's has an English translation:

      "Lo, all that ever I spent, that sometime had I;
      All that I gave in good intent, that now have I;
      That I never gave, nor lent, that now aby[3] I;
      That I kept till I went, that lost I."

  [Footnote 3: So in my authority.]

The same inscription is on a brass as late as 1584, at St. Olave's, Hart
Street, London. (See _Oxford Architectural Society's Manual of
Monumental Brasses_.)

_Pelican in her Piety_ (Vol. v., p. 59.).--In Warner's _Glastonbury_,
plate 18, fig. E., is a very _early_ representation of the pelican
feeding her young with her own blood: an emblem of Christ's love for His
church. The stone was dug out of the ruins of the Abbey.

In Parker's _Glossary_ the symbol is explained by a quotation from
_Ortus Vocabulorum_:

  "Fertur, si verum est, eam occidere natos suos, eosque per triduum
  lugere, deinde seipsum vulnerare, et aspercione sui sanguinis
  vivos facere filios suos."

Arbroath is a corruption of Aberbrothok, Gretna of Gretenhow, and
Meiklam of M'Ilquham: but probably one of the most remarkable

village, a few miles to the south of Edinburgh, where _Burdiehouse_ has
usurped the place of Bordeaux.

_The Term "Milesian"_ (Vol. iv., p. 175.).--I beg to direct your
attention to the accompanying extract, which furnishes a reply to MR.
FRASER'S Query:--

  "Whoever is acquainted with Irish history, or whoever has had
  opportunities of mixing with the natives of that country, cannot
  be ignorant that they claim a descent from a long race of Milesian
  kings, who reigned over them for thirteen centuries before the
  Christian aera. The stock from which this long line of monarchs
  emanated is traced to a pretended Milesian colony, supposed to
  have emigrated from Spain into Ireland under the conduct of
  Heremon and Heber. The most rational inquirers, however, into the
  subject consider it as nothing more than a tissue of imaginary
  events, originating in the fertile fancies of their bards. A very
  brief and general abstract of this contested part of Irish history
  shall be given in the words of Mr. Plowden:

  "'About 140 years after the Deluge, Ireland was discovered by one
  Adhua, who had been sent from Asia to explore new countries by a
  grandson of Belus: he plucked some of the luxuriant grass as a
  specimen of the fertility of the soil, and returned to his master.
  After that the island remained unoccupied for 140 years; and about
  300 years after the Flood, one Partholan, originally a Scythian,
  and a descendant from Japhet in the sixth generation, sailed from
  Greece with his family and 1000 soldiers, and took possession of
  the island. They all died off, and left the island desolate of
  human beings for the space of thirty years. Afterwards different
  sets of emigrant adventurers occupied and peopled the island at
  different periods. About 1080 years after the Deluge, and 1300
  B.C., Niul (the son of Phenius, a wise Scythian prince), who had
  married a daughter of Pharaoh, inhabited with his people a
  district given to him by his father-in-law on the Red Sea, when
  Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt. The descendants of that
  Phenius (called more generally Feniusa Farsa) were afterwards
  expelled by Pharaoh's successors on account of their ancestors
  having favoured the escape of the Israelites through the Red Sea.
  They then emigrated and settled in Spain, whence, under the
  command of Milesius, a colony of them sailed from Brigantia in
  Galicia to Ireland, gained the ascendancy over the inhabitants,
  and gave laws and a race of monarchs to the island. The Milesian
  dynasty continued to govern Ireland without interruption till
  about the year 1168, when it ceased in the person of Roger
  O'Connor, and the sovereignty was assumed by our Henry II. Of this
  race of kings the first 110 were Pagan, the rest Christian.'"

_Title of D.D._ (Vol. ii., p. 13.).--The remark of your correspondent
EYE-SNUFF, "that any lay scholar of adequate attainments in theology is
competent to receive this distinction, and any university to bestow it
upon him," is incorrect in two ways, as far as the university of which I
am a member is concerned. A reference to the Oxford University Calendar,
or to the Statutes of the University, will show him that no one can take
the degree of B.D., or D.D., without first exhibiting his letters of
priest's orders: and the theological attainments represented by the
degree D.D. are next to nothing; the exercise required for B.D. used to
be a mere form, and I believe is little more now; a certain number of
terms kept in the university, and payment of certain fees, being all
that is necessary for proceeding D.D. The case is the same, I imagine,
at Cambridge.

    W. FRASER.

_Lass of Richmond Hill_ (Vol. ii., p. 103.).--I have heard it said, of
course with little regard to probability, that this once popular song
was written by George IV. when Prince of Wales.

    W. FRASER.

_A Bull_ (Vol. ii., p. 441.).--I have heard it argued that the word
_bull_, meaning an incoherent blunder, was derived from the Pope's
Bulls, the tyrannical contents and imperious tone of which often made so
odd a contrast with the humility of the subscription, "Servus servorum
Dei," that the name _bull_ was applied to anything that seemed absurdly
inconsistent or self-contradictory.

    W. FRASER.

_Remains of Horses and Sheep in Churches_ (Vol. v., p. 274.).--We have
good evidence that the Saxons used the places of sepulture which they
found in England; and it is well known that Anglo-Saxon remains have
often been discovered in the vicinity of churches, a fact which leads to
the supposition that churches occupied the sites of Pagan temples. The
bones of animals have often been found on and near the sites of our
London churches.

    J. Y. A.

_Fern Seed_ (Vol. v., pp. 172. 356.).--I am led to think there is an
error in the notice of your correspondent R. S. F. on the above subject.
The seed of St. John's Fearn cannot be gathered on Midsummer Eve,
inasmuch as at that time it is in a merely embryotic state. The seed
attains perfection late in autumn, and it remains attached to the dry
brown stem until shaken off by the autumnal and winter blasts. The
taking of it, therefore, is not, according to those versed in such
mysteries, the easy task of a Midsummer twilight, but must be performed
amid the darkness of a winter's night. On the midnight of Saint John the
Evangelist, to whom the seed and plant are dedicated, must it be shaken,
not pulled, from its stem. Very probably mystic virtues were imputed to
the seed before the introduction of Christianity. And it were not
perhaps hazarding too much to suppose that the old superstitious monks
assigned it to Saint John from an idea that the potency of the seed
might have influenced the wondrous revelations with which he, more than
any other of the disciples, or all the disciples, was favoured.

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

The Camden Society, of which the fourteenth Annual Meeting on Monday
last passed off most successfully, has just issued to its Members _The
Chronicle of The Grey Friars of London_, edited from a MS. in the
Cottonian Library in the British Museum. This very interesting document,
which altogether escaped the research of the industrious and voluminous
Strype, though it had passed through the hands of Stowe, who had either
the possession or the loan of the original MS., was written by one of
the Grey Friars, who appears to have watched narrowly, and recorded
carefully, the religious changes of the times, more particularly, those
which occurred within the sphere of his personal observation in the city
of London, and the metropolitan church of St. Paul. As he retained
possession of his register, and continued his labours after the
dissolution of his house, and the dismissal of the rest of his
fraternity, he has preserved to us many particulars of great historical
value; and his work has this additional claim to attention, that,
whereas the majority of the existing documents are records of the
Reforming party, this comes from one of the Reformed, and presents us
accordingly with the other side of the case. The work is edited by Mr.
J. G. Nichols, whose name is a sufficient guarantee for the fidelity
with which the document is printed, and the learning and care bestowed
upon its illustration.

_The Publications of the Antiquarian Etching Club._--Part III., 1851,
presents us with no less than thirty-three etchings by Members of the
Club (of course of various degrees of merit), of objects of antiquarian
interest, comprising Ecclesiastical, Military, and Domestic Edifices,
Fonts, Sepulchral Monuments, Portraits, Fac-similes, copies of rare
prints, and numerous other vestiges of antiquity calculated at once to
instruct the archaeologist, and preserve in a pictorial form a record of
much which, but for the _burins_ of the members of this useful little
Society, might have been lost for ever.

It is but a few weeks since we noticed the admirable second volume of
the _Catalogue of the London Library_, by Mr. J. G. Cochrane. We have
now to record the death of that gentleman on Tuesday last. He was a most
worthy man, and a good scholar; and possessed a vast fund of
bibliographical knowledge. His death therefore will be felt, not only by
his own immediate friends, but also by the institution which he had
served so ably and so zealously ever since its formation.

It would be treason to the Brothers Grimm, and to our own love of the
literature of the people, if we did not notice and (as it deserves it)
say a good word of a new and complete translation of the world-renowned
_Kinder und Haus Maehrchen_, which Messrs. Addey have commenced
publishing under the title of Grimm's _Household Stories_. They are very
faithfully translated from the last edition; and we specify this because
the little _Almaine 4to._ first edition of 1819 has long been one of our
household books, and finding that the translation did not agree with the
versions there given, we have compared it with the edition of 1843, and
so discovered, first, that the translator has used the later edition;
and secondly, what we were not till now aware of, namely, that these
great scholars, Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, amid their more learned
labours, have not disdained to revise and enlarge their collection of
nursery stories, which have been the delight of the children of all
Europe. What a justification is this for the attention which is bestowed
in "N. & Q." on our own English Folk Lore!

THREATENED DEMOLITION OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE.

In consequence of many thousands of persons in the United Kingdom having
been unable to obtain a Copy of the GREAT EXHIBITION CHART, printed in
Colours, and presented by the Proprietors of the WEEKLY DISPATCH, to
their Subscribers and the Public, in the months of January and February
last, A RE-ISSUE has been determined upon, to take place on SUNDAY the
16th of MAY. The Chart, which has undergone a careful revision, shows by
simple diagrams the number of persons that visited the Exhibition daily,
the amount of money taken at the various entrances, the quantity of
refreshments consumed; the names of the Royal Commissioners; an account
of the origin of the Palace, and its dimensions in feet. In order that
every individual in the country may possess this statistical reflex of
curious and interesting results, to mark the demolition of the building,
and to serve as a memento of its existence, the Chart will be delivered
GRATIS to every Subscriber and Purchaser of the DISPATCH on the day
stated.

  [Star symbol] The DISPATCH is published at 4 o'clock every
  Saturday morning, in time for the First Railway Trains leaving
  London, and for the Morning Mails. Early orders should be given to
  any Newsvendor, in Town and Country; or to MR. R. J. WOOD, No.

  N.B. The News Agents will have a Copy of the Chart with every
  DISPATCH of May 16th.

  A COPIOUS and CRITICAL LATIN-ENGLISH LEXICON, founded on the
  larger German-Latin Lexicon of Dr. WILLIAM FREUND; with Additions
  and Corrections from the Lexicons of Gesner, Facciolati, Scheller,
  Georges, &c. By E. A. ANDREWS, LL.D., &c.

  In reviewing this Lexicon, the _Athenaeum_ says:--"The knowledge
  which it conveys of the early and later Latin is not to be
  gathered from ordinary Latin Dictionaries."

  The _Literary Gazette_ says:--"We have examined this book with
  considerable attention, and have no hesitation in saying it is the
  best Dictionary of the Latin language that has appeared."

  The _Spectator_ says:--"It is the best Latin Dictionary."

  The _Examiner_ says:--"We never saw such a book published at such
  a price."

      HOUSEHOLD STORIES.
      ILLUSTRATED WITH FOUR LARGE AND TWENTY-FIVE SMALL DRAWINGS
      ON WOOD.
      By EDWARD H. WEHNERT.

  Most of the Stories in the "KINDER- UND HAUSMAEHRCHEN" of the
  Brothers Grimm have appeared in England at various times; but,
  though the contents of the book are as well known here as in
  Germany, no complete edition has yet been published. The present
  is a new translation, carefully following the original text,
  except in a few necessary instances, and always preserving the
  integrity of the stories. The Illustrations will run plentifully
  throughout; every tale will have its picture, and besides these,
  four large Engravings will be added in each Part.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
