MR. AND MRS. BOWSER.

The Former Decides to Give a Progressive Euchre Party.

Mr. Bowser suddenly looked up from his paper the other evening and
asked:

"Why is it that we haven't given a progressive euchre party this
season?"

"They have been voted too much trouble," I replied.

"They have, eh? Did any one vote besides you? I saw half a dozen
mentioned in the papers last Sunday."

"It's almost impossible to get thirty or forty people together on a
certain evening, even if all desire to come. Mrs. Johnson calculated on
eight tables and only had enough for five. Mrs. Dart calculated on----"

"Oh, bosh! What does a woman's calculation amount to?"

"But if people can't come and don't come, what are you going to do?"

"They can come, and they will come. It's all in the management."

"Well, I wish you'd try it."

"Do you? Very well, Mrs. Bowser; I shall give a progressive euchre party
next week, Wednesday evening. If you'll see to the refreshments I'll see
to the people."

"I'll be glad to, of course, but----"

"But what?"

"You must prepare yourself for disappointments."

"Oh, I must! How kind of you to give me warning! Mrs. Bowser, I don't
want to seem vain or egotistical, but I'll invite thirty-six people here
on that night, and for every one who fails to come I'll give you a $20
bill."

"You are very kind--very kind. I hope the party, will be a great
success. You can begin at once."

During the next hour he had the use of the telephone to call up
acquaintances, and when he finally hung up the trumpet he turned to me
with:

"Anything very dismal about that, Mrs. Bowser? I've got ten couple
without moving out of my tracks. I'll have the other eight before
to-morrow night."

"That is, they will promise to come."

"Promise! Promise! Do you imagine that all other people are like you?
Most folks know their own minds for a day or two ahead, Mrs. Bowser."

When he came home next night he had a list of eighteen couples who had
been invited and solemnly promised to come. Mr. Bowser had made it a
point to inform each one that the playing would begin at eight sharp,
and all had agreed to be on hand fifteen minutes before that hour.

"Voted too much trouble--can't get people enough!" sneered Mr. Bowser as
he looked over the list. "It's in the management, Mrs. Bowser--all in
the management."

For three days he walked around on tiptoe and took every occasion to
brag over me. Then came the first setback. We were at dinner when the
telephone rang and Mr. Bowser was asked for.

"Hello, Bowser."

"Yes."

"This is Filbert."

"Yes."

"I wanted to tell you that we can't come down to the party."

"You can't?"

"No. My wife has just remembered that she agreed to go over to Johnson's
on that night. Sorry, old fellow, but I hope----"

Mr. Bowser shut him off with a loud bang and returned to me and said:

"Mrs. Bowser, don't you ever darken Filbert's doors again--never! They
are liars and dangerous people. I can fill their places in five
minutes."

Before he got out of the house there was another ring.

"Hello, Bowser!"

"Yes."

"This is Watkins."

"Yes."

"When I told you the other day we'd be down Wednesday evening, I forgot
that our Eva was to have a child's party on the same evening. That
knocks us out."

"And you can't come?"

"Of course not. Sorry to disappoint you, old fellow, but of course----"

"Watkins is a liar, Mrs. Bowser--a first class, bold-faced liar!"
exclaimed Mr. Bowser, "and you want to cut the whole family as dead as a
door nail!"

He went off saying he could get 2,000,000 couples to take their places,
and he returned at evening just as the following note came by the hands
of a messenger boy:

"Mr. and Mrs. Jackson present their compliments, and regret that the
death of an uncle in China will prevent them from being present on
Wednesday evening."

Mr. Bowser had begun to turn white when the telephone rang.

"Hello, Bowser!"

"Yes."

"Say, old man, this is a world of change, you know. When I told you we'd
come down to that party I never thought about my sister. She's to be
married that same evening. Tra-la, old boy; hope you'll have a good
time."

"I told you it would be hard work to get so many people out," I
remarked.

"Did you, Mrs. Bowser? How kind of you! But I'll show you and these
liars and deceivers a thing or two before I get through."

There were no more declinations until Wednesday morning. Then Mr. Bowser
was called up by telephone.

"That you, Bowser?"

"Yes."

"Is it to-night you have that party?"

"Yes."

"Pshaw! I thought it was a week from to-night! Well, that knocks us out.
We've got to go to the Y. M. C. A. Sorry, you know, but this is a
previous engagement."

Mr. Bowser was jumping up and down when there came another ring.

"Hello, Bowser!"

"Yes."

"Nice weather."

"Yes."

"All well down there?"

"Yes."

"Say, Bowser, my wife made a previous engagement for to-night. We've got
to go to----"

Mr. Bowser shut him off with a bang and started for the office. During
the forenoon I took in two more declinations, and while he was at dinner
there was a ring and the old familiar hail:

"Hello, Bowser!"

"Yes."

"Say, Bowser!"

"Yes."

"We expect to be down early to-night."

"Glad of it."

"But it may be that my mother-in-law will come in on the 6.30 train. If
she does we can't come."

Mr. Bowser seemed dazed as he hung up the trumpet and left the house.
The last blow came at 7 in the evening. The telephone rang and he
crawled over to answer.

"Is this Bowser's?"

"Yes."

"Where's the old man?"

"I am Mr. Bowser."

"Oh! so you are. Your voice seems mighty weak to-night. Say, old man,
the three couples of us in this terrace were coming down to-night, but
we must disappoint you at this late moment. We have had free tickets
sent up for the opera, and of course----"

Mr. Bowser walked to the front door, locked it, muffled the bell and
turned out the gas. Then he sat down and was very quiet for a couple of
hours. At last he looked up and said:

"Mrs. Bowser, some husbands would murder a wife for this!"

"But what have I done?"

"What have you done? Coaxed, bribed and bulldozed me into giving a
progressive euchre party, and where's the party? I told you how it would
come out, and here we are! Mrs. Bowser, I--I----"

But he was too full for further utterance, and went to bed.

in use.

into the room for inspection the poor man was so bewildered at the
multitudinous character of his happiness that he asked: "Am I to

a time.

NOW SHE IS THIN AND HE IS FAT.

The Wonderful Case of the Mullenhausers, Who Bathed at Coney Island.


The familiar figures of Mr. Germain Mullenhauser and his wife are no
longer seen daily braving the surf at Coney Island. They have returned
to their Brooklyn residence, where their ablutions are made in the bath
tub, and it is very doubtful whether any of the seaside resorts will
ever see them again. An estrangement has grown up between them, and they
are not happy.

Their story is a strange eventful history. Two months ago Mrs.
Mullenhauser could readily turn the scales at 210 pounds, while her
husband weighed about the ninety pounds necessary to aggregate 300. They
were proud of their proportions, viewed collectively, and neither was
jealous of the other. But in an evil hour a friend told Mr. Mullenhauser
that he was beginning to look like a scarecrow, and slightingly
nicknamed him "Praise-God Bare-Bones," in pointed and scornful
recognition of the office of deacon in a Brooklyn church. Mr.
Mullenhauser consulted a doctor with the view of gaining flesh.

About the same time an attenuated female acquaintance told Mrs.
Mullenhauser that if she grew any fatter she would stand a chance of
bursting, and would certainly become dropsical. The stout lady was
alarmed, and she too, sought the advice of a medical practitioner
relative to the best method of shedding some of her superfluous tissue.
Neither husband or wife cared to take counsel with the family physician.
They stated their cases to different doctors, and only told each other
what they had done when their courses had been mapped out for them.

"Dr. Jones seems to be a very intelligent person," said the lady. "He
says that by surf bathing I can reduce my weight at the rate of fourteen
pounds a week."

"Why, he must be an imbecile," exclaimed her husband, hotly. "If you go
wallowing, like a whale, in the ocean it will add just two pounds a day
to your bulk. That is what Dr. Brown promises that sea bathing will do
for me, and I am going to begin to try it to-morrow."

"Germain, you have been imposed upon by an ignorant quack," replied Mrs.
Mullenhauser, severely. "If you risk your light body in those great
rollers at Coney Island you will be swept away. Be contented with your
small proportions and try to show that you make up in mind what you lack
in matter."

"I won't," cried the small man, angrily. "I'll take Dr. Brown's advice,
and I'll soon be as fat as you are now. Though Lord knows what size
you'll be then, if you follow the directions of that ass, Jones," he
added sarcastically.

Thus was made between them the fissure that has since been widening
daily. They went down to Coney Island together and engaged board and
lodging. They kept up a show of friendliness before the public to save
appearances, but they ate their meals in silence and bathed at different
parts of the beach.

The other frequenters looked at them with amazement, for a great change
was soon perceptible in each. Drs. Brown and Jones were both right. At
the end of sixty days their joint weight was still 300 pounds, but Mr.
Mullenhauser now tipped the scales at 210 pounds and was threatened with
dropsy, while his wife could only turn them at 90 pounds, looked like a
scarecrow, and feared to breast the waves, as she had formerly done,
lest they should sweep her away.

They fled by different trains from the seaside and tried to consult the
slighted family physician, but he refused to be consulted, and advised
them, cynically, to see Drs. Jones and Brown. Mrs. Mullenhauser is half
a foot taller than her spouse, and much better adapted, anatomically, to
carry the heavier burden of flesh. She looks like a greyhound, and he
like a puncheon standing on its end. It is likely that before the
bathing season returns, Brown, the ignorant quack, will prescribe for
the lady, and Jones, the ass, for her husband.

    They lingered in the gloaming
      Beneath the star-lit sky,
    Yet oft unto his hearing
      There came from her a sigh;
    He marvelled at her sadness
      And longed to ask her why.

    Then as he pressed her closer
      He lisped: "Why dost thou sigh?"
    "Ah, Gus," said she, "I cannot
      Tell unto thee a lie;
    The trouble is I've eaten
      Too much spring chicken pie."

She Knew One When She Saw It.

The following is related as an actual occurrence during the presentation
of "Virginius" by the amateurs of Macon. Those who have seen the play
will doubtless remember the scene where the ashes of Virginia, who has
been killed by her father, after which the body was cremated, are
brought on the stage in an urn. A young lady in the audience turned to
her escort with the remark: "That's a crematory."

"No," said he, "you are mistaken; that is not a crematory."

"Well, I say it is," she remarked; "I guess I know a crematory when I
see one."

Mrs. Gusby Carrots (whose husband has hit Standard Oil and acquired

morning, and I declare! when I called at my husband's office he told me
he had bought a Rembrandt by the same artist yesterday afternoon.

THE LIMEKILN CLUB.

How Major Drawbar Jones Escaped Expulsion on Serious Charges.

On the opening of the meeting the secretary announced a communication
from Eufaula, Ala., making charges against Major Drawbar Jones, an
honorary member of the club. He was charged with:

1. Going on a rabbit hunt while his wife lay at the point of death.

2. Putting burrs under the saddle of his old mule to get up an
artificial enthusiasm.

Brother Gardner said that it was a question for debate, and Giveadam
Jones arose and observed that he could never vote to convict a brother
on the first charge. While there might be no question that Major Jones
went out to hunt rabbits while his wife was dying, what was his object?
Was it for amusement, or was it to provide her with rabbit soup? The
accused should be given the benefit of the doubt. As to charge No. 2,
that was a different matter. A man who would put burrs under his saddle,
whether that saddle was on a horse or a mule, deserved the severest
condemnation.

Waydown Bebee couldn't excuse the Major for going on that rabbit hunt. A
dying wife does not care for soup of any sort. As to the burrs under the
saddle, they might have got there by accident. Even if they were put
there by design, there was no evidence that the mule objected. He owned
a mule, whose demeanor could not be changed one iota by all the burrs in
the State of Michigan.

Shindig Watkins, Elder Toots, Samuel Shin, and others argued pro and
con, and the question of whether the Major should be bounced was put to
a vote. The vote stood 43 for, and 44 against, and he thus escaped by
the skin of his teeth.

A MODEST TALE.

It Is Cheerfully Told by a Georgia Munchausen.

"I hardly feel like telling a modest tale," said another, "after the
wonderful things we have heard; but I will give you a true story which
was told me by a North Georgia cracker."

"Tell it, tell it!" they said.

"Well, then, once upon a time a man who lived by a creek in North
Georgia discovered that the corn was disappearing from his crib. He
watched and at length found the secret of the theft.

"A squirrel came down to the edge of the creek on the opposite side,
dragged a shingle to the water's edge, launched it, and jumping on
himself hoisted his tail for a sail. He soon sailed across and anchored
his shingle at the bank. Stealing up to the crib, he got out an ear of
corn and carried it to the creek, put it on the shingle and ferried it
across."

"How strange!" said some one.

"That's only the beginning," said the narrator.

"When the man saw his ear of corn disappear in a hollow tree he
determined to recover his lost property, and started, ax in hand, to
wade the creek. It was a little over waist deep, and he had on a heavy
overcoat fastened by one big button at the top. As he came up out of the
water the coat seemed exceedingly heavy, and looking down he saw that
both the big side pockets were full of shad."

Here a chorus of laughter interrupted, but with a solemn face the story
teller went on:

"That was a small matter to those that follow. When the man came up out
of the water the weight of the wet overcoat, further weighed with the
fish, broke off the button, and it flew off to one side where a rabbit
crouched in the bush. The button hit him in a tender spot behind the
ear, and he keeled over, and with a few pitiful kicks expired."

Here the laughter was so boisterous as to interrupt the narrator for
nearly a minute, and then he proceeded:

"Picking up the rabbit, the man concluded it was not the kind of game he
wanted, and he flung it aside. It was late in the evening, and just at
this moment it so happened that a covey of partridges had huddled
together for the night, with their heads bunched together in the center,
according to their habit."

Here a suppressed titter ran round the company.

"Oh," said the narrator, with some indignation, "it is well known that
partridges huddle together in just that way."

"Go on," they said.

"When the rabbit fell its head struck the bunch of heads and killed all
the partridges." (Laughter.)

"When the man had picked up the partridges he went to the hollow tree
and cut it down. He got back fifty bushels of corn, and it proved to be
a bee tree, so that he got ten barrels of honey. Not only this, but the
top of the tree fell in the stream, and the creek ran sweet for twenty
years."

This took the cake, which will be served next Sunday.

P. S.--There is no space here to tell about the Georgia hen that turned
gray after the snakes got her chickens, or the young partridges that
afterward hatched under her sitting and became the solace of her

Hugging the Shore.

    I went one day to sail in a yacht
      With the very best girl I had,
    And indeed I was thankful at my lot,
      Which you'll see was not at all bad.

    The sea ran high far away outside;
      And as, in the sea's dread lore,
    I was not well versed, I concluded to glide
      Near by, so I hugged the shore.

    Anon, as the twilight round us fell,
      I spooned with the lively maid,
    And what I did but the stars could tell,
      And they will not, I'm afraid.

    And anon again I asked her to show
      How a maid could a man adore;
    And she showed me how till I could but know,
      And again I hugged the show-er.

His Cure for Sleeplessness.

"Do you ever want to sleep, Major, when you can't?" I asked of a very

"Of course, of course, sah."

"Well, what do you do?"

"What do I do? You blamed idiot, what would any man with a brain do?
Why, when I want to sleep and feel so wide awake that I could go out and
read in the dark I go take a good, long drink of my customary beverage,
sah. You know what that is. Then, sah, if that fails, I go take anothah.
If that does not kiss down my eyelids I go and take two. If Morpheus
refuses to lock me in his arms I go and take three more, and by that
time I don't care a continental darn whether I ever go to sleep or not."

AFTER A CLEW.

Methods of the Modern Detective Illustrated by a Small Incident.

"I'll follow him to the ends of the earth! He shall not escape me!"

The tall, powerfully built man, attired in a suit of dark blue, who
hissed these words through his set teeth, stood in a shadow of a
one-story coal house in a dark, noisome, Philadelphia-like alley, and
watched with widely staring eyes a figure moving slowly along down the
Hong Kong district of Clark street.

The watcher was wide awake, and the saloons had not yet closed for the
night.

It was evident he was not a policeman.

Emerging from the alley he followed stealthily the object of his pursuit
like a sleuth hound on the track of its prey. Moving along in the shadow
of the buildings and halting now and then, but never relaxing for one
instant his eager watchfulness, he kept his man in sight for nearly an
hour.

Down Clark to Harrison, west on Harrison to the river, across the bridge
to Canal, up Canal to Monroe, and westward on that street for many and
many a weary block moved this singular--or rather plural--procession.

"He little thinks he is followed," muttered the relentless pursuer.
"I'll shadow him to his lair now if it takes till the next centennial!"

At last the man whom he was following halted at a modest dwelling,
opened the gate that afforded the entrance to the little yard in front,
and as he turned to close it his face, plainly visible in the glare of a
street lamp close by, was for one brief moment exposed to the hawk-like
gaze of the mysterious pursuer in the dark blue suit, who had crouched
in the shadow of a friendly Indian cigar sign across the way. The next
instant he had disappeared within the house.

With a smothered cry of exultation the eager watcher took out a note
book and pencil and jotted down a memorandum. His fingers trembled with
excitement.

"I saw his face!" he said in a hysterical whisper. "I was not mistaken.
And now I have his street and number. At last I am on the trail. If he
finds out anything about that mysterious disappearance I'll know just
where he goes to get it. Ha! At last! At last!"

Two of a Kind.

A bright little girl was taken by her father out into the country to
visit an uncle whom she called Walsh. As the two drove along the country
road, the little one spied a scarecrow in a field, and exclaimed: "Oh,
papa, there's Uncle Walsh." Papa laughed hugely at the joke, but told
her that she was mistaken; that what she saw was only a scarecrow. A
little further along and Uncle Walsh's farm was reached, and way out in
the field was Uncle Walsh at work. The little girl's eyes were the first
to catch sight of him, but she wasn't to be fooled so easily this time.
"Oh, papa," she cried, "look at that scarecrow!" Papa did look, and has
not got through laughing yet.

reached Ann the conductor called that name and another woman got off. At
Elizabeth Street he called out "Elizabeth!" and two women got off. When
he called "Ada!" still another woman got up and left.

The countryman went out on the platform and said to the conductor:

"Do you know where I want to get off?"

"I do not."

"Do you know my name?"

"No, sir; I don't."

A Simple Fish Story.

A bass weighing one pound in 1880 was returned to the Potomac with a
small sleigh bell attached to its tail with a wire. A few days ago it
was caught with the bell still attached, the fish weighing six pounds.
This may seem like a fish story, but some of our readers will remember
that a one-pound bass caught in the Eastern branch five years ago was
returned to the water with a penny tin whistle attached to its tail.
Three years later the bass was caught near the same spot. It still
weighed a pound, but the whistle had grown into a fog horn.

Burdette on Womankind.

Because I am.

Because a woman has more good, hard, common sense than a man.

them better than a man.

Because she won't give $1.50 for an article that she knows very well she
can get for 75 cents.

Because she does not stalk loftily away from the counter without her
change if the robber behind it is a little reluctant about counting it
out.

Because she is too independent to pay the landlord $2.25 for her dinner,
and then pay the head-waiter $1 to send her a waiter who will bring it
to her for 50 cents.

who made her husband pay the same bill three times last year. Not any

trip; too many women aboard. Don't never get nothin' out of a woman
'ceptin' just her regular fare." I had just paid him 25 cents for
blacking one of my boots and losing the other; and when he said that,
when I saw for myself the heroic firmness of those women, traveling
alone, paying their fare and refusing to pay the salaries of the
employes of a wealthy corporation, I said: "These women have a right to
vote. To vote? By all that is brave and self-reliant and sensible, they
have a right to run the government!"

It Was a Bad Mixing Up.

In an English country church the curate had to give out two notices, the
first of which was about baptisms and the latter had to do with a new
hymn book. Owing to an accident he inverted the order and gave out as
follows: "I am requested to announce that the new hymn book will be used
for the first time in this church Sunday next, and I am requested to
call attention to the delay which often takes place in bringing children
to be baptized; they should be brought on the earliest day possible.
This is particularly pressed on mothers who have young babies."

"And for the information of those who have none," added the rector, in
gentle, kindly tones and who, being deaf, had not heard what had been
previously said--"and for the information of those who have none, I may
state, if wished, they can be obtained on application in the vestry
immediately after service to-day. Limp ones, one shilling each: with
stiff backs, two shillings."

A Thrilling Social Episode.

    There was a young lady named Moll
    Who purchased a new parasol,

        That she had to be strong
    Or she couldn't have lugged it at all.

    Was staggering with might and main
        To steady his gait
        'Neath the terrible weight
    Of his dreadfully cumbersome cane.

    So intent was the beautiful Moll
    In lugging her long parasol,
        That she passed the young swain
        With the cumbersome cane
    And never once saw him at all.

    What a narrow escape for that swain!
    Had she recognized him he would fain

His Awful Confession.

"Were you ever engaged in a train robbery?" asked the prosecuting
attorney, looking at him keenly.

"I was never indicted for train robbing," answered the witness,
evasively.

"That is not the question," said the lawyer. "I will ask you again. Were
you ever a train robber?"

"Judge," said the witness, turning imploringly to the dignitary of the
Bench, "must I answer that question?"

"You must," answered the judge. "And remember you are under oath."

The witness turned pale and his knees knocked together.

"I suppose it's got to come out. I sold books and bananas on the cars
for a whole year when I was a young fellow," faltered the miserable man.

An Accommodating Boss.

A gang of men were at work on a city street, when a slight, beardless
youth laid down his pick, and approaching the foreman, said to him:

"Can I take a fit, sir?"

"Take what?" asked the foreman.

"A fit--I feel one coming on," replied the young man, without emotion.

"Why, certainly," said the foreman.

So the young man walked over to a bit of grass under a leafy tree--it
was a new street in the suburbs--and had a fit.

Then he went and washed his face, came back to his place in the line,
took up his pick and struck into work. After the day's work was over the
young man said to the foreman: "You don't mind my having fits?"

"No--I guess not if you do a fair day's work."

"Well, you see I used to work for a butcher an' he wouldn't let me take
fits--said it interfered with business--an' I thought you might feel the
same way about it."

And the young man works hard with pick and shovel and takes a fit once
in a while as you or I might take a drink of water.

who lives in the western part of our city was very much disturbed by the
frightful noises which accompanied the celebration this year. She was
old and quite ill, and she had spent a night in tossing, waiting in vain
for a silence that came not and which drove sleep out of the question.
It was near sunbreak, when the noise was at its wildest, when with a
groan she turned over and in despair ejaculated: "Goodness, gracious me.
I wish the other side had licked!"

it I have taken one pound of sand. If the rascal will send me six pounds
of sugar I will not expose him."

The next day five six-pound packages of sugar were left at the
gentleman's residence, there being just five grocers in the village.

    And I've planned out a beautiful future,
      I'm engaged to be married to Jack.

    From the first of July to September,
      Is not a long courtship I know;
    But, then, if we wait until Christmas,
      'Twill be half a twelvemonth, and so
    After telling Jack "Yes," on an impulse,
      I couldn't somehow take it back;
    And he says we can court all our lifetime,
      So I'm to be married to Jack.

    He hasn't a very large fortune,
      But he's handsome and brimful of life,
    And he says that his prospects will brighten
      With me for his own little wife.
    How little I dreamed when I came here,
      How settled and staid I'd go back;
    Not caring for flirting or dancing,
      For I'm to be married to Jack.

    I thought, at the first of the season,
      Of titles and money and style;
    But the charm which they hold is but trifling,
      When I think of his bright, tender smile.
    Ah, me! when a girl loves her lover,
      Of happiness there is no lack,
    My heart is as light as a feather,
      I'm engaged to be married to Jack.

She Considered it a Deliberate Insult.

When General O. O. Howard was marching down through Tennessee, General
Whittlesey, late president of the Freedmen's Bank, was assistant
adjutant general on his staff. Whittlesey had been a clergyman down in
Maine, and was fully as strait-laced as Howard. One day Howard drove
into a farm-yard from which Whittlesey was just departing. A woman and
her grown daughter were standing outside the door.

"My good woman," said Howard, "will you kindly give me a drink of
water?"

"No. Get out of my yard. A lot of more impident Yankees I never seed."

"But I have done nothing and said nothing out of the way, and will
severely punish any of my soldiers who should say or do anything wrong."

"That sojer insulted me," said she, pointing to the retreating form of
General Whittlesey. "He axed me for a drink of water and when I done
give it to him he sassed me."

"But--but that is General Whittlesey, of my staff. I am sure he wouldn't
be rude to any woman."

"Maw," said the girl, pulling her mother's dress, "I reckon he moughtn't
have meant anything misbeholden."

"Hush; don't I know low-down blackguard talk when I hears it? He asked

MR. BOWSER ON DECK ONCE MORE.

He Delivers a Lecture Upon the Carelessness of Women.

In returning from a trip down town the other week I left my shopping bag
in the car, and when I mentioned the fact to Mr. Bowser and asked him to
call at the street railway office and get it, he replied:

"No, ma'am, I won't! Anybody careless enough to leave an article of
value in a street car deserves to lose it. Besides, you did not take the
number of the car, and they would only laugh at me at the office."

"Do you take the number of every street car you ride in?" I asked.

"Certainly. Every sensible person does. Day before yesterday I came up
in No. 70. I went back in No. 44. I came up to supper in No. 66.
Yesterday I made my trips in Nos. 55, 61 and 38. To-day in Nos. 83, 77
and 15. The street railways contract to carry passengers--not to act as
guardians for children and imbeciles."

"Mr. Bowser, other people have lost things on the street car."

"Yes--other women. You never heard of a man losing anything."

I let the matter drop there, knowing that time would sooner or later
bring my revenge. It came sooner than I expected. Mr. Bowser took his
dress coat down to a tailor to get a couple of new buttons sewed on, and
as he returned without it, I observed:

"You are always finding fault with the procrastination of my dressmaker.
Your tailor doesn't seem to be in any particular hurry."

"How?"

"Why, you were to bring that coat back with you."

"That coat! Thunder!"

Mr. Bowser turned pale and sprang out of his chair.

"Didn't lose it going down, did you?"

"I--I believe I--I----!"

"You left it on the street car when you come up?"

"Yes."

"Mr. Bowser, anybody careless enough to leave an article of value in a
street car deserves to lose it. However, you took the number of the car,
I presume?"

"N--no!"

"You didn't! That shows what sort of a person you are. Yesterday when I
went down after baby's shoes I took car No. 111. When I returned I took
car 86. When I went over to mother's I took car 56. The conductor had
red hair. One horse was brown and the other black. The driver had a cast
in his left eye. There were four women and five men in the car. We
passed two loads of ashes, one of dirt and an ice cream wagon. The
conductor wore No. 8 shoes, and was nearsighted. The street railways
contract to carry passengers, Mr. Bowser, not to act as guardians for
sap heads and children."

"But I'll get it at the office to-morrow," he slowly replied.

"Perhaps, but it is doubtful. As you can't remember the number of the
car they will laugh at the idea, and perhaps take you for an impostor."

He glared at me like a caged animal, and made no reply, and I confess
that I almost hoped he would never recover the coat. He did, however,
after a couple of days, and as he brought it home he looked at me with
great importance and said:

"There is the difference, Mrs. Bowser. Had you lost anything on the car
it would have been lost forever. The street car people were even sending
out messengers to find me and restore my property."

One day a laboring man called at the side door and asked for the loan of
a spade for a few minutes, saying that he was at work near by; and he
was so respectful that I hastened to accommodate him. Two days later Mr.
Bowser, who was working in the back yard, wanted the spade, and I had to
tell him that I lent it. As it was not to be found the natural inference
was that the borrower had not returned it.

"This is a pretty state of affairs!" exclaimed Mr. Bowser when he had
given up the search. "The longer some folks live the less they seem to
know."

"But he looked honest."

"What of it? You had no business to lend that spade."

"I was sure he'd return it."

"Well, he didn't, and anybody of sense would have known he wouldn't. If
somebody should come here and ask for the piano, I suppose you'd let it
go. Mrs. Bowser, you'll never get over your countrified ways if you live
to be as old as the hills. It isn't the loss of the spade so much, but
it is the fact that the man thinks you are so green."

In the course of an hour I found the spade at the side steps, where the
man had left it after using, but when I informed Mr. Bowser of the fact
he only growled:

"He brought it back because he probably heard me making a fuss about it
and was afraid of arrest."

Two days later, as Mr. Bowser sat on the front steps, a colored man came
up and asked to borrow the lawn mower for a few minutes for use on the
next corner.

"Certainly, my boy," replied Mr. Bowser; "you'll find it in the back
yard."

When he had gone I observed that the man had a suspicious look about him
and that I should not dare trust him, and Mr. Bowser turned on me with:

"What do you know about reading character? There never was a more honest
man in the world. I'd trust him with every dollar I have."

In about half an hour Mr. Bowser began to get uneasy, and after waiting
a few minutes longer he walked down to the corner. No black man. No lawn
mower. By inquiry he learned that the borrower had loaded the mower into
a handcart and hurried off. It was a clear case of confidence.

"Well?" I queried, as Mr. Bowser came back with his eyes bulging out and
his hair on end.

"It's--it's gone!" he gasped.

"I expected it. The longer some folks live the less they seem to know.
If somebody should come and want to borrow the furnace or the bay
windows you'd let 'em go, I suppose."

"But he--he----"

"But what of it? You had no business to lend that lawn mower, Mr.
Bowser. You'll never get over your countrified ways if you live----"

He would listen no further. He rushed out and sailed around the
neighborhood for two hours, and next morning got the police at work, and
it was three days before he would give up that he had been
"hornswagled," as one of the detectives put it. Then, to add to his
misery, the officer said:

"We'll keep our eyes open, but there isn't one chance in 500. After this
you'd better let your wife have charge of things. That negro couldn't
have bamboozed her that way."

He had been twisting around his chair trying to find words to express
his undying devotion, and had already begun to hem and haw, when a voice
came from the floor below:

"Miss Candlewick," it said, "I love you passionately--madly; bid me but
hope, and all the dark colors of my life will change!"

This was a bonanza for the young man above.

"Miss Clara, darling," he said tremulously, "them's my sentiments."

Then another voice came from below:

"No, Mr. Goatee, I cannot bid you hope; I love another."

"And them's mine, Mr. Morris," remarked Miss Clara.

He Got There All the Same.

There is in Lewiston at least one man whose friends never worry about
his ability to take care of himself no matter where he may be.

He went to the inauguration at Washington, last month, and after hanging
around in the rain for an hour and becoming thoroughly wet, he thought
it would be a good plan to go up and stand under the capitol
portico,--that being next best to admittance to the capitol itself,
which seemed to be out of the question, as he had no ticket.

But when he tried to avail himself of this shelter, a policeman stopped
him.

"Can't I stand in here out of the rain?" the Lewistonian asked,
innocently.

"No," said the policeman, "not unless you have a ticket."

Our Lewiston friend stood by and exercised his wits for a few moments.
Presently two men in the capitol came out and asked the policeman for
checks, in order that they might get in again.

"No checks," said the officer.

"But how are we going to get in when we come back?"

"Go ahead, and I'll remember you."

The Lewiston man heard this and needed no other hint. He retreated for a
short time, then threw his coat back, tripped his hat rakishly on the
back of his head and started on a run for the entrance, as though
intending to brush right by the policeman.

"Hi!" said the officer, putting up his billy--"Where are you going?"

"Going in."

"Where's your ticket?"

"Ticket! Good gracious, you wouldn't give me any! You said you'd
remember."

"Oh, yes! yes, yes! Pass right in."

And in he went.

The same gentleman once made a sixty days' tour of Europe for a sum less
than a hundred dollars, passage included.

A Substitute.

A lady who is opposed to corporeal punishment visited a school at the
North End where the rod was being applied. Before going away she said a
few words to the offender, and asked him to come and see her on a
certain evening, promising that her daughter should sing and play to
him. He said he would come, and at the appointed time a boy dressed in
his best was ushered into her parlor, and for an hour or more his kind
entertainers devoted themselves to his enjoyment. Afterwards the older
lady took him one side and began to speak of the importance of good
behavior and obedience to rules, when she was interrupted with: "Oh, I
ain't that fellar! He gin me ten cents to cum, instid er him!"

A city child, wandering over a farm-yard with its father, was greatly
frightened at the sight of a good-sized gobbler.

"Why, my boy, you don't mean to say that you're afraid of a turkey, when
you ate one only yesterday."

"Yes, pa, but this one isn't cooked."

No Evidence to Convict Thomas of Stealing the Hog.

When I reached Lester's Crossroads it was to find the score or so of
people comprising the hamlet very much excited, and their numbers had
been re-enforced by a dozen or more farmers, who had come in on mules
and in ox carts. I got accommodations at Jeffers', and in a few minutes
Mrs. Jeffers had posted me as to the cause of the excitement.

"Thar's gwine to be the powerfulest lawsuit nobody ever hearn tell of,"
she explained. "Thar's gwine ter be as many as ten witnesses, and the
lawyers will gab, and the squar' will boss everybody, and it will be the
excitingest time we ever had. I'm so glad you got yere in time!"

The squar' who lived a mile out of the hamlet took dinner with us, also
the lawyers, both of whom had made a ride of fifteen miles in the
interest of their respective clients. The squar' was on his dignity, and
the lawyers were looked up to with all the reverence and respect due the
president of the United States. School was dismissed that the trial
might take place in the school-house, and when we all found seats the
place was packed. When the case was stated Thomas Andrews, a "squat
farmer," was charged with having stolen, killed and converted to his own
use one hog belonging to and the lawful property of William Ainsworth,
another "squat farmer." The squar' opened his own court as follows:

"Here ye and look yere! This court ar' now open fur bizness, and it's
agin the law to fuss or trifle. Them negroes and all others is warned to
be powerful quiet, and if ary purson be in contempt he will get the full
extent of the law. Hank Stovin, kick that ar big dog of your'n outer
doors."

The prosecutor then charged the prisoner with having, between the 5th
and the 20th of the month, stolen, killed and eaten, in whole or in part
one hog belonging to the plaintiff, and described as black and white, 2
years old, weight 115 to 120 pounds, and in good health and fair
condition.

He was followed by the other lawyer who denied the charge in toto, and
intimated that he would prove a conspiracy to down the defendant, to the
injury of his name and fame as an honest citizen of the commonwealth.
The plaintiff was put on the stand, and when told to go ahead he said:

"I know that he 'un stole my hog, and I wanter see him sent to prison."

"Why do you suspect him of stealing the hog?"

"Hain't he shiftless and onery?"

"Is that why you suspected him?"

"It ar'. And I know the hog went over his way the last I seed of him."

The plaintiff hadn't made out much, but he had a witness who swore that
he ate fresh pork at Andrews' cabin on the 12th. He also saw hog
bristles and hoofs on the ground near the cabin.

"You declare that on your oath, do you?"

"Sartin, I've got to tell it as it was, though Tom and I hev always
jiggered (got along) without a word."

A second witness swore that he called at Andrews' cabin on the 15th and
the wife had fresh pork in a kettle. He asked if Tom had been killing
and she seemed confused and did not reply. That was the case for the
prosecution. It looked slim in one sense, and yet everybody knew that
Andrews was a shiftless, suspicious character not above hog stealing.
When the opposing counsel got hold of the plaintiff he asked:

"Was this hog ranging the country?"

"Yes, he was loosely about and around."

"Went where he pleased, didn't he?"

"Reckon he did."

"Well, how do you know he is dead? How far have you hunted for him?"

"Three miles."

"But he may be alive and well and four miles away."

"Couldn't be. Tom Andrews killed him."

"That's only your suspicion. Can you swear that that hog isn't home this
very minute?"

"Mebbe he ar', but I shan't dun giv in."

The witness who had sworn to eating pork at Andrews' table was asked:

"Can you tell pork from a two-year-old hog from pig meat?"

"No, sah."

"Dare you swear that the meat you ate that day wasn't coon or bear
meat?"

"Reckon 'twas pork."

"Yes, you reckon, but do you know it was?"

"Dasn't dun sw'ar any harder, sah."

The second witness was also tangled up on cross-examination, and then
Andrews was put on the stand.

"Tom, did you ever see this hog in question?" asked his lawyer.

"Lawd, no!"

"How long since you had any fresh pork at your house?"

"Almost before the wah, sah."

"What meat did Miner eat there that day?"

"Coon, sah."

"What about those bristles and hoofs he says he saw?"

Tom produced a small package and opened it and displayed the four feet
of a coon and a handful of hair. He admitted on cross-examination that
he was onery, but he claimed to be honest.

"Mrs. Andrews," asked the lawyer when she was called, "do you remember
when Jackson called about the quilt frames?"

"'Deed, I do."

"Were you cooking meat?"

"Sartain, I was."

"Fresh pork?"

"No, sah--'possum."

"Were you confused?"

"Lawd save ye, but I was never dun confused in all my life."

The case wasn't very strong in a legal sense against Andrews, but after
it had been submitted his Honor called up all his dignity and commanded:

"You thar! Tom Andrews, stand up!"

Tom arose.

"Prisoner," continued the judge, "you stole that air hog suah's
shooting! It's jist like you. You killed it and converted it to your own
use. I'm jist as satisfied of that as I ar' that you took coons outen my
trap last winter. However, they hain't proved it down fine and I've got
to turn ye loose. Ar' yer ears wide open, Tom?"

"'Deed they is allus so."

"Then you skitter (listen) to what I'm going to say. Justice is arter
you. She hit your trail way back ten years ago, and she's followin'
right along. She moves slow but suah. She's gittin very clus to your
vest buckle, and when she reaches out fur ye it will be good-by, Tom
Andrews. You kin go loose, but it's only fur a leedle while. Justice is
givin' ye mo' rope so that the bringin' up will be harder. Git out of
yere and lumber yer carcass off hum, and if I was the plaintiff I'd cut
across lots and meet ye down by the creek and lick the value of that hog
outer yer wrinkled hide. Court stands a-journed."

Outwitted.

As Rich, the harlequin, was one evening returning home from the
playhouse in a hackney coach, he ordered the coachman to drive him to
the Sun, then a famous tavern in Clare Market. Just as the coach passed
one of the windows of the tavern, Rich, who perceived it to be open,
dexterously threw himself out of the coach window into the room. The
coachman, who saw nothing of this transaction, drew up, descended from
his box, opened the coach door, and let down the step: then taking off
his hat, he waited for some time, expecting his fare to alight; but at
length, looking into the coach, and seeing it empty, he bestowed a few
hearty curses on the rascal who had cheated him, remounted his box,
turned about, and was driving back to the stand, when Rich, who had
watched his chance, threw himself into the coach, looked out, asked the
fellow where in all the world he was driving, and desired him to turn
again. The coachman, almost petrified with fear, instantly obeyed, and
once more drew up to the door of the tavern. Rich now got out; and,
after reproaching the fellow with stupidity, tendered him his money.

"No, God bless your honor," said the coachman; "my master has ordered me
to take no money to-night."

"Pshaw!" said Rich; "your master's a fool; here's a shilling for
yourself."

"No, no," said the coachman, who by that time had remounted his box,
"that won't do; I know you too well, for all your shoes--and so, Mr.
Devil, for once you're outwitted."

Trotters' Rival.

"I'll do it," he repeated, grinding his teeth and showing the whites of
his eyes.

"Nonsense!" said Matilda. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for
threatening such wickedness--and besides, you don't mean it. Go along!"

"Ha, ha!" exclaimed William Trotters, in a hollow voice. "Ha, ha!"

"You give me the creeps when you laugh like that," said Matilda; "and
all the way to Gravesend you grumbled--when you weren't seasick. That is
pretty lover, to go and be bilious on a pleasure trip!"

"It was the iron that had entered into my soul, Matilda," remarked
Trotters, solemnly.

"It disagreed with you, whatever it was," said Matilda, tossing her
pretty head and turning up her nose. "And when another gentleman--a
stranger--was attentive, and took care of me, instead of being grateful,
you went on like a mad bull, and talked about having his gore."

"Either his or my own," groaned Trotters. "Oh, woman! why art thou
thus?"

"You wouldn't want to marry us if we weren't, would you, gaby?" snapped
Matilda. "Give me that nasty thing, there, do!" She pointed to Trotters'
breast pocket, which, as far as could be seen by the light of the
street-lamp near them, looked bulky.

"Never!" said Trotters, recoiling.

"It'll go off one of these days, I know it will," sobbed Matilda, "and
then you'll be sorry."

A smile illumined Trotters' visage. Nobody knew better than himself that
the deadly weapon wasn't loaded. He had bought it of a marine store
dealer, cleaned and polished it--it was a five-chambered revolver--and
clicked the trigger three or four times to make sure; but even that made
him nervous.

"She's really frightened!" he said, as he walked away.

An irresistible impulse came over him to frighten her a little more. He
went back. He peeped over the garden gate. The house stood dark and
silent. Everybody had gone to bed. He would steal round into the back
garden and throw a little gravel up at Matilda's window. That would
bring her down.

The onion and cabbage beds rose right up to the house wall. In the soft
mould his footsteps fell silent. Ha! what was that? Jealousy! Wrath!
Revenge!

A male figure stood in the center of the onion-bed. Its hat was cocked
on one side, its gaze uplifted to Matilda's window. One arm was
stretched out in an attitude of supplication. A bush rustled as Trotters
stole warily behind him. Matilda's window opened. Matilda's voice
queried, "Is that you, dear?" It was too much. Trotters drew the fatal
pistol and clapped it to his rival's ear.

"Stir a step and you're a dead man!" he hissed, trying to steady his
shaking hand. Too late! There was a flash--a terrible explosion! The
stranger fell prone, and lay motionless on the ground.

Trotters was unaware that his cousin Jack, who was in the Carabineers,
had expressed much curiosity regarding the weapon Trotters carried with
such jealous solicitude, and, being of a larksome disposition, had
surreptitiously gained possession of the revolver, placed a blank
cartridge in each of the barrels, and returned it to the pocket of the
unsuspecting Trotters, or he might have behaved differently. But no, he
felt that in his passionate jealousy he had committed a deadly crime,
and sent to his last account an innocent man. 'Twas too much. Trotters
shrieked aloud in terror, and then fainted.

Matilda flew down to him with her hair in curl-papers. They found him
lying cold and motionless beside the garden scarecrow!

prospects worth mentioning. I am in moderate circumstances and have no
resources except a knowledge of my business, good health and steady
habits."

"And on this, my young friend, you would expect to support yourself and

MR. BOWSER AS A WHITEWASHER.

He Is Not a Howling Success at Inside Decorating.

There were several little things I wanted done about the house this
fall, and so the other week I engaged a colored man to come and work for
a couple of days. It so happened that he came one morning before Mr.
Bowser had left the house, and was greeted with:

"Well, what's up now?"

"I'ze dun bin hired to work, sah."

"Who hired you?"

"De lady, sah."

"What to do?"

"Jobbin', sah."

"Well, the lady has changed her mind and doesn't want you."

After the man had gone, Mr. Bowser came into the house and asked:

"Did you hire a colored man?"

"Why, yes."

"What for?"

"I was going to have him whitewash the vegetable cellar, take down and
clean the laundry stovepipe and do some other jobs."

"H'm! Mrs. Bowser, I don't believe in encouraging such people. He'd have
done about one hour's work and charged you for a whole day. I don't
believe he knows any more about whitewashing than I do about playing the
harp."

"But he said he did."

"Certainly. Did you ever see a negro who wouldn't say anything to fit
the occasion?"

"Well, but---"

"There is no 'but' about it. If there are any little jobs about the
house I've got plenty of time to do them. In fact, I need just such
exercise. Such work is a diversion to me, and the doctor recommends it."

"Do you mean to say you will do the whitewashing?"

"I do. I don't do it to save a dollar, but for my own benefit. I always
like the smell of lime."

"I wish you wouldn't do it. You will get lime in your eyes, and you will
blame me for it, and---"

"There you go! Blame you! What would I blame you about? If I get lime in
my eyes it's my own fault. Mrs. Bowser, you are getting to be a good
deal of a crank lately."

"Well, if you are determined on it, don't say that I asked you or
encouraged you."

"That's a funny way to talk to me, Mrs. Bowser! Are you getting ready
for the insane asylum? I think I run my own house yet. If I'm willing to
peel off and do these odd jobs, I ought to be encouraged instead of
insulted."

I was quite sure how it would end, but I said nothing more, and in the
course of half an hour he got into his old clothes and went down cellar.
I followed him down to give him a few last words of advice, but he
didn't need them.

"You go right upstairs and sit down and enjoy yourself," he said.
"Here's the brush and here's a pail of lime, and if I don't white-wash
more cellar in ten minutes than Moses could in all day, I'll never try
it again. Besides, Mrs. Bowser, whitewashing is not the slouch work you
imagine it to be. It has got to be done by a person of taste and
intelligence or it won't stand. I want a little blueing to give it a
tinge."

"You understand," I said, as I got what he wanted, "that I did not ask
you to do this work."

"Ask me! What on earth ails you, Mrs. Bowser? You are making fuss enough
over ten minutes' work to warrant a year's job."

"It must be well done."

"Certainly."

"Two coats all around."

"Just so."

"Even if it takes you all day?"

"Even if it takes me over half an hour, which it won't. I'll show you a
job here that will make a black man turn green with envy. Just run
upstairs and make yourself comfortable."

I retreated up the stairs to the kitchen door and waited for results,
which I knew were sure to come. Mr. Bowser dipped and dished and sozzled
and stirred until he had the liquid to his liking, and as he began on
the stone wall I heard him chuckling:

"I said fifteen minutes, but I'll go slow and take twenty. The idea of a
colored man sloshing around here all day to do this work. Let's see. I
believe I'll take the overhead first."

I held my breath in suspense for a long minute. Then a yell arose from
that cellar which jumped the cook out of her old slippers and made her
cry out:

"For heaven's sake, Mrs. Bowser, have we been struck by another
cyclone?"

There was a second and a third yell, and as I hurried downstairs Mr.
Bowser stood in the middle of the cellar, hands out-stretched and
jumping up and down as if he had fire under his feet.

"For heaven's sake, what is it, Mr. Bowser?" I asked.

"Whitewash--lime--fire!"

"Where?"

"In my eyes! I'm blind! I've burned them out!"

I got hold of him and led him out to the laundry tubs and set the water
to running. He had indeed got a dose in his eyes, but it was more
painful than dangerous. He could hardly see daylight after we had washed
out all the lime, and as I led him upstairs he said:

"I shall never see again!"

I washed his eyes with milk and got him to lie down on the lounge, and
in a couple of hours he was pretty near all right. His eyes were sore,
but no great damage had been done. He was very gentle until he
discovered this. Then he suddenly turned on me with:

"Mrs. Bowser, what possible excuse can you urge in extenuation of your
conduct?"

"What do you mean?"

"What do I mean? That's a cool question to ask me! In view of what has
transpired what have you to say?"

"I say that you were foolish to undertake the job. I warned you how it
would turn out."

"Mrs. Bowser!" he shouted, squirting tears of lime water out of his
eyes, "do you pretend to deny that you didn't encourage me to undertake
a task which you knew would put my whole future happiness, if not my
life, in peril?"

"I do, sir. I did all I possibly could to dissuade you."

"And you are not to blame?"

"Not in the least."

"Mrs. Bowser, this is too much--too much! I could forgive one who had
wronged me, if penitent, but when they attempt to brazen it out it is
time for action. We will settle on the amount of alimony right here and
now."

But we didn't. After blinking around for half a day he went down town,
and when he came home to supper he was as good-natured as pie. I got a
colored man to come and do the work, and two or three days later, when
Mr. Bowser happened down cellar, I heard him saying to himself:

"Yes, it's a mighty slick job I did on this, and I'll tackle that
stovepipe to-morrow morning."

The Latest About Kissing.

Men have often remarked on the fertility of woman's mind. Physiologists
declare she never reasons, but as an instinctive creature she often
reaches a correct conclusion much quicker than a man. If they lack the
intricate process of ratiocination they have the happy faculty of
walking straight through mental difficulties like a somnambulist in
sleep.

The fellows who discuss "Is Marriage a Failure?" or "Why I am a
Bachelor," have wondered lately how women reach their cute noses with a
handkerchief since the advent of the new fangled veil. It covers the
greater part of the face, and is as ornamental possibly as protective.

Two women veiled alike met yesterday. It was evident that they hadn't
seen each other for some time, and they rushed together in a long
embrace. The inevitable kiss came next. Both essayed the attempt, but
the veils rendered this impossible. Quick as a flash one of the ladies
turned the side of her face to her companion and the latter smacked a
spot on her cheek somewhere below the ear. This was satisfactory and
then followed the usual storm of quick womanly ejaculations.

"Is kissing on the lips no longer fashionable?" queried a reporter of a
lady he met after this event.

"No, not since the introduction of the new veil," she answered sweetly.
"You see the lips are completely covered, and it has become the fashion
to press the lips against the cheek. This thing of kissing is a nuisance
anyhow, and I wish the ladies would all stop it."

The Sly Way in Which Prohibition Works.

A week or two ago a well-known dealer in live stock of this city went
over to Washington County to make a deal with a big stock raiser, who is
also prominent as a strict Prohibitionist. The cattle having been
inspected and the price agreed upon, the Washington County man retired
to the house to make out a receipt and so on, leaving the Pittsburgher
in his son's hands. As soon as the old man had disappeared indoors his
son, a bright lad, nearing his majority, said to the Pittsburgher:

"This is rather dry work talking all day, ain't it?"

The Pittsburgher vehemently assented.

"Well," continued the young man, "I've a bottle out in the haymow, and
we might as well get a taste of the stuff while dad's not by."

The Pittsburgher said "yes" again, and the two repaired to the haymow
and looked upon the contents of the black bottle. Then the young
Washingtonian hid the bottle in the haymow, saying as he did so: "Don't
tell the old man anything about this--he's awful down on drinking."

Of course the Pittsburgher vowed silence as he smacked his lips and left
the barn. Two minutes later he was in the house paying over the money to
the old stock raiser. After the business in hand had been dispatched and
the bargain had been closed the Pittsburgher was about to take his
leave, when the old man said, rather awkwardly: "Say, are you feelin'
dry? I've a jug down in the cellar, and the liquor's fine."

It is hardly necessary to say they were soon in the cellar. As the old
Prohibitionist drained his glass he said to his guest: "Don't say
nothing 'bout this to them boys o' mine--they don't know about the jug!"

How She Told the Latest Joke.

Mrs. Jason came home the other evening with her face "wreathed in
smiles," as the novelists have it.

"Well, what are you grinning at?" was the cordial greeting of her lord
and master.

"I heard something funny down town," she answered.

"Well, what was it?"

"Oh, nothing much. I happened to meet little Johnny Figg, who used to
keep the apple stand across the way, you know, and he's got a better one
down town now. I asked him how he was getting along and he says to me,
'Oh, I'm still keeping a stand, you see.' I thought it was the cutest
thing I had heard for a good while."

"Oh, you did, did you, Maria? If I ever see where the laugh comes in
I'll try and smile, even if I have to get up in the middle of the night
to do so," was his crushing reply, to which she deigned no answer.

About two o'clock in the morning Mr. Jason was awakened from a dream of
being stabbed by a masked assassin, to find his wife energetically
nudging him below the fifth rib.

"Oh, Jehiel, I had that wrong," she twittered, in a tone of one who has
made a great discovery. "Johnny said his business was at a stand still.
You see the point now, don't you?"

"Yes, I reckon so," said the old man in no gracious tones, "and if I
feel the point of your infernal elbow jabbing me in the ribs any more
to-night I'll go to sleep in the barn. Do you hear?"

"And he didn't laugh either as he promised to," was her reflection as
she settled down to sleep again with the sweet consciousness of duty
performed.

His First Shave.

This is a momentous event in a boy's life, as it is to him the line of
demarcation between boyhood and manhood.

The microscopic indications under his chin are becoming annoying to him,
and he considers it a duty to society to have them removed without
delay.

He has already made several surreptitious attempts with his father's
razor, to the great detriment of both the razor and his face, and
although he succeeded, in a measure, in removing the obnoxious down, yet
it was with the unpleasant accompaniment of some of his chin. Therefore
he determines to do the thing in a manly way, and resolves to submit to
the barber's delicate manipulations without delay.

It takes him some time to muster up the requisite courage to enter the
barber's shop, as he has certain misgivings that the barber might
indulge in facetious and satirical remarks concerning his beard.

He passes the shop many times and looks in; but his heart sinks within
him. There is always some drawback--either too many people inside or too
few; in either case of which he thinks he will be noticed. Once he does
enter; and one of the barbers venturing the inquiry, "Hair cut, sir?"
involves him in delightful confusion, and to avoid further
embarrassment, he submits to having his hair cut, and still remains
unshaved.

At last, in sheer desperation, he makes a very firm resolve either to
get shaved that day or never. With this heroic resolve, and twopence in
his hand, he sallies forth to the barber's, and at a favorable moment
walks in and tremblingly awaits his turn.

The sharp, short "Next!" sends the blood thrilling up his backbone, and
he feebly climbs into the chair, and hurriedly says, "Shave me, please,"
and shuts his eyes.

The barber, with an eye to the twopence, says nothing, and proceeds to
shave him, figuratively speaking. There is only one drawback to the
boy's cup of happiness, and that is the entire absence of that
peculiarly pleasant rasping sound which comes only from a long
experience.

MR. BOWSER IN THE COUNTRY.

He Enjoys Fresh Air and Mosquitoes to His Heart's Content--His Original
Method of Milking Not Indorsed by the Cow.

"Well, what do you think!" exclaimed Mr. Bowser as he came hurrying home
from the office the other afternoon.

"Have you gone and got some more hens or bought another horse?"

"Mrs. Bowser, the event of our life is about to happen."

"What is it?"

"You know Gregg? Well, Gregg owns a little farm out here about twelve
miles. There's a good house on it, and he says we can occupy it for the
summer. We will have a cow and a horse, pigs, poultry and other stock,
and we'll go out there and tan up and get fat and have the best time in
the world."

"I don't think much of the idea, Mr. Bowser."

"You don't. You don't want cool breezes--fresh eggs--fresh berries--rich
milk--songs of birds--lowing of the kine and rest from care!"

"You will be disappointed if you expect any such thing."

"I will, eh? Perhaps I don't know what the country is. You are always
ready to throw cold water on any of my plans. I shall go, anyhow."

That was the beginning, and at the end of three days I yielded,
womanlike.

One Monday morning we took the train and started, having engaged a
farmer's daughter to take charge of the kitchen, and at the nearest
railroad station we were met by a farmer and his lumber wagon. The sun
poured down its hottest, the dust had covered grass and bushes, and as
we jogged and jolted along the farmer queried of Mr. Bowser:

"Come out for your health, I suppose?"

"We did. Ah! this country air has already refreshed me."

"Has, eh? Well, there's heaps of it, and I'm thinking you'll get all you
want in about a week. I think a city chap is a blamed fool to come out
here."

"Do you? Why, the doctors recommended it. That boy ought to gain a
pound a day, and I am sure my wife will brace right up with these
pastoral scenes before her eyes."

"The doctors and pastoral scenes be darned!" growled the farmer, as he
turned to his horses, and those were the last words he uttered until he
landed us at the gate.

It was a comfortable frame house, and I did not observe the surroundings
until after dinner. The barn had partly fallen in, giving it a weird and
lonely look; most of the fencing was down, a gust of wind had laid the
smoke-house on its back, and nearly every tree and bush about the house
was dead or dying.

"Is this one of the pastoral scenes you referred to?" I asked Mr.
Bowser.

"There you go!" he snapped. "You can't expect things to look as nice out
here as in Central Park. We come for the balmy breezes and the rest."

"You spoke of hunting hens' eggs in the meadow grass."

"So we will--come on."

He made a dash for a big patch of burdocks near the back door, got
tangled up in the ruins of a barrel, and when he got up he had a cut on
his chin and his nose was bleeding. He tried to make light of the
affair, but it was hard work.

When I asked after the horse and vehicle in which we were to take our
morning jaunts he walked down to the barnyard and pointed out a
raw-boned old yellow horse, so weak that he could not brush the flies
away, and a one-horse wagon, quaint enough to have taken its place in a
museum.

"You'll have our photographs taken after we all get seated in that rig,
won't you?" I asked.

"That's it; just as I expected. Mrs. Bowser, what did you come out here
for?"

"Because you obliged me to."

"I did, eh! Not by a long shot! You came to restore your health and to
give our child a chance for his life. It will be the making of him. No
more doctor's bills for us."

In the afternoon Mr. Bowser swung his hammock in the orchard. This was
something he had doted on for a week. He had scarcely dropped into it
when three or four caterpillars dropped on to him, and he put in the
rest of the afternoon on the hard boards of the veranda. The cow came
sauntering up about 5 o'clock, covered with flies and mosquitoes, and
the girl hinted to Mr. Bowser that he was expected to milk.

"Oh, certainly," he replied. "I wouldn't give a cent for farm life
unless I could milk a cow or two. I used to sing a ballad while I was
milking."

The girl and I watched him as he took the pail and stool and approached
the cow. The cow also watched him. Folks generally sit down on the
right-hand side of the cow to milk. Mr. Bowser took the other side.

"What are you trying to do?" I called to him from the gate.

"Mrs. Bowser, when I want to learn anything about a cow I'll ask you for
the information. I think I know my business."

So did the cow. She had been fooled with long enough, and she suddenly
planted a hoof against Mr. Bowser with such vigor that he tumbled over
in a confused heap. Between us we got him into the house, and the girl
finished the milking. Mr. Bowser recovered from the shock after a while,
and I felt it my duty to inquire:

"Mr. Bowser, don't you think a week of these pastoral scenes will be
enough for us?"

"No, nor six weeks!" he growled. "Nothing would do but you must go into
the country, and now I'll give you enough of it."

"Why, Mr. Bowser?"

"You needn't why Mr. Bowser me! You gave me no peace until I agreed to
come, and now I'll remain here five straight years."

When the summer sun went down and the stars came out we were not as
happy as we might have been. Mr. Bowser still held his hand on his
stomach, the baby cried because the milk tasted of wild onions, and the
girl lost the old oaken bucket in the thirty-foot well while getting a
pail of fresh water. I asked Mr. Bowser when the kine would begin to low
and the whippoorwills to sing, and he was so mad he wouldn't speak.
However, if the kine didn't low, the pinchbugs and mosquitoes did. There
wasn't a screen at door or window, and soon after sundown we were
besieged.

That night seemed never ending. No one of us three slept a wink. The
room was invaded with every insect known to country life, from a bat to
a gnat.

When we got up in the morning the girl didn't know us. We were blotched
and bitten until one would have suspected us of suffering with smallpox.
Mr. Bowser knew himself, however, and before noon we were back in the
city. He scarcely spoke to me all the way home, but once in the house he
burst out with:

"Now, old lady, prepare for a settlement! You've nosed me round all you

The Hard Luck of Some People.

"Tell yo' w'at, Mars' Parson," remarked Uncle Cocklesole, as he sat on
the sill of a second-story window and looked down on the mounted
missionary and the receding waters, "tell yo' wat it ar', ef hard luck

A Disastrous Clerical Error.

Government Clerk (to friend)--I'm in a frightful hole. I went to see two
doctors yesterday and got a medical certificate from each. One was a
certificate of health for a life insurance company, and the other was a
certificate of illness to send to the chief with my petition for a
week's leave of absence.

Friend--I've done that myself. What's the matter?

G. C.--Matter? Great Scott! I mixed the certificates in mailing them.
The insurance company has my certificate of ill-health, and the chief
has my certificate of good health.

His Complexion Was Against Him.

Hadji Hassein Ghooly Khan, envoy extraordinary and minister
plenipotentiary from Persia, was one of the favorites in Washington
society while there. He was very fond of going out and calling on the
ladies, and was always most hospitably received wherever he went. That
is, almost always, for an experience he had one Sunday afternoon proved
that he was not as cordially received at one house as had been his wont.
Ghooly Khan started out with the purpose of making a round of calls. It
is his custom to pay his respects to the ladies of the fashionable world
on Sunday the same as on the week days. The day being an extremely
pleasant one, his landau was not brought into use. He walked from his
residence on M street, to Massachusetts avenue, in the neighborhood of
Fourteenth street, where the subjects of his first call resided. Walking
up the stone steps in an indolent fashion, he reached the door and
rather timidly touched the electric bell. After lingering some moments
the servant appeared, and before Ghooly Khan could utter a word she
shouted out: "The ladies are all busy and cannot be bothered with you
now."

"Well," said the minister, completely nonplussed, "there must be a
mistake; take in my card."

"Oh! don't worry them now," answered the servant, not allowing him to
finish his sentence. "They are all about going to dinner and don't care
for any one to see them at this time--you'd better come again in the
morning; and the side door is always the handiest place for such as yez
to call."

The minister waited for no more. The rebuff he had received at the hands
of the unruly servant completely paralyzed him. He concluded that he had
a sufficient dose of American society.

The ladies of the house soon learned of the "horrible" manner in which
their distinguished caller had been received, and they at once made
heroic and happily successful efforts to have the affair settled on a
basis satisfactory not only to themselves but to the distinguished envoy
from Teheran.

The Difference.

The following anecdote, which we have received as authentic from the
lips of a clergyman, sets forth in a very pleasant way the folly of
reproaching preachers as hirelings, merely because they receive temporal
support from their congregations.

At the meeting of a presbytery in an eastern state, it fell to the lot
of one of the ministers to be quartered with a man belonging to a
denomination which does not allow of salaried preachers. He was accosted
by his host as follows:

"What is thy name, friend? I mean the name thy parents gave thee."

"John."

"Has thee any objections that I should call thee by that name?"

"Certainly not; my mother always calls me John."

"Well, John, I understand thee belongs to the class of hireling
preachers."

"You are greatly mistaken, sir; I do not belong to that class."

"I mean thee is one of those preachers who receive pay for preaching."

"No, sir; I receive nothing for preaching to my people."

"How then," said the interrogator, evidently surprised and disconcerted,
"does thee manage to live?"

"Why, I work for my people six days, and then I preach for them on
Sundays for nothing."

Sir Wilfred Lawson's Story.

Sir Wilfred Lawson told the following story the other evening: A student
at college was sent for by the Don, who said--"Sir, I am told you have a
barrel of beer in your room, which is contrary to all orders." And the
young man said: "Well, sir, that is true; but the fact is the doctors
told me that if I drank this beer I should get stronger." The Don said:
"Are you stronger?" "Yes, sir, indeed I am," was the reply, "for when
the barrel came in I could scarcely move it, and now I can roll it round
the room."

"That is very nice of him; but surely you are not crying about that?
Most woman would give anything to have such a poetic and devoted
husband."

"Oh, yes, Arthur is very poetical; but you don't know. Just to try him,
I put mother's photo into his traveling bag instead of my own, and the
wretch has never found it out. Boo-hoo-hoo!"

minute. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, fighting this way in the
street?"

The boy reluctantly arose from his vanquished antagonist and faced his

"Well, I don't care. He said you wasn't good looking. I don't think you
are either; but it ain't none o' his funeral. So I licked him."

One of Chauncey's Latest.

Chauncey M. Depew tells the following story of another of the many
interesting characters he encountered last Fall while addressing his
fellow citizens on the vital issues of the campaign. It doesn't sound so
much like a true story as some that are extant, but it is getting pretty
late in the day to doubt his word:

One night, after the meeting was over and while the hall was clearing, a
weather-beaten man buttonholed me and said:

"I'm postmaster out here at Shingle Corners. Blaze away and elect your
man if you want to."

"You don't care for the office, then?" I said.

"No, that ain't it," he replied. "It don't pay but $14 a year, or mebbe
good years, when I boom 'er a little, $15, but it's powerful handy to
have in the house. No, my idee is that we can keep it in the fam'ly
anyhow."

"How's that?"

"The old woman, you see, she's a rip-snortin' Republican, powerful so,
reg'lar uncompromisin'. If Cleveland gets it I stay; if Harrison slides
in the old woman comes to the front for her reward. Nobody else wants
it, so there we be."

"Well, you're all right then."

"You bet we are. If we get tired of it or too old for it, or anything
ever, there's my boy, a red-hot Republican, and my oldest gal, Democrat
from 'way back. Oh, we're hustlers in our fam'ly when it comes to
politics."

"But suppose the Mugwumps should develop power some day and carry
things?" I asked.

"Well," he replied, "we will soon be fixed for that, too. The baby is a
Mugwump--I know it 'cause he howls all the time. If you see anybody
lookin' for p'ints on keepin' a good thing in the family jess send him
out to Shingle Corners."

A Bitter Reflection.

    Oh why so sad, my lady fair?
      What pales thy cheek and dims thy eye?
    Thy drooping face is mark'd with care,
      Thy heaving breast betrays a sigh.
    What lacks thy lot to make it sweet?
      What joy is there that is not thine?
    What makes that heart in sorrow beat
      And gives of happiness no sign?

    "Ah, woe is me! I loved a youth,
      Handsome in face, and brave and strong.
    The paths of honor and of truth
      Were his, for he could do no wrong.
    Two years ago he sailed away
      To seek his fortune o'er the seas,
    And I've been yearning every day
      That he'd return his love to please.

    "But ah! I've waited long in vain
      For my old sweetheart to return;
    No message came across the main
      From him for whom my soul did yearn.
    Until to-day, when I am told
      His ship is due to come in port;
    He comes back worth a pile of gold,
      At least, so says the last report."

    Then why repine, sweet maid? You should
      Be overjoyed to hear the news;
    You soon will wed a husband good,
      How can you, then, this grief excuse?
    The lady answer'd. "Would you know
      Why tear drops from my eyes now fall?
    To tell the true cause of my woe,
      I--married--some--one--else--last--Fall."

the rear platform, as the conductor reached up to the bell-rope.

"Yes, but he has probably forgotten something."

"Well, let him get it when the car comes down. I have no patience with
forgetful men."

"I guess I'll stop, anyhow."

A Point Usually Overlooked.

The youthful heir to a Walnut Hills ancestral establishment is of an
inquiring turn of mind and directs his attention especially to the
elucidation of religious problems. Last week he heard a Sunday school
address on "The Prodigal Son." Just what the small boy thought of the
address his father was curious to learn, and so he said to him that
night at supper: "My son, tell me which of the characters in the parable
of the prodigal son you sympathized with?" "Well, papa," replied the
cherub with perfect nonchalance, "I think I'd feel disposed to
sympathize most with the calf."

"I have a very lovely family," said he. "I hold, as the sinful world
would say, a bobtail flush."

"What's that?" asked Hon. Charles B. Farwell, the well-known collector
of Bibles and psalm books.

"We were talking about children," exclaimed Mr. Gunsaulus, "and I was
saying that in our family we had a bobtail flush--four girls and a boy."

"No," said Mr. Farwell, smiling sadly; "it is evident that you have had
no experience in the ways of the world, otherwise you would not make so
erroneous an application of terms. You do not hold a bobtail flush; you
hold four of a kind--four queens and a jack--a powerful good hand, sir,
and I should advise you to stand pat."

Judge--Prisoner is discharged. Mr. Clerk, swear out a warrant against
plaintiff and have him arrested for criminal assault.

A Family Peculiarity.

One of the officers of the Nypano, who is a great talker, received a
rebuke from his little three-year-old girl on Memorial Day that was
worse than he ever received from his older friends. He stayed at home
that day to amuse his little girl who inherited the "gift of gab." She
nearly wore him out asking questions until finally he said, "Amy, Amy,
Amy. Do keep still; it's nothing but talk, talk, talk all the time." The
little one didn't seem to care a bit, for she looked up innocently and
said, "Talk, talk, talk. Jess 'ike papa."

About to Strike Dead Luck.

A small manufacturer, who had engaged in many local speculations, which
had always turned out well, had become a person of some wealth thereby.
He was rather past the middle age when he bethought himself of insuring
his life, and he had only just taken out his policy when he fell ill of
an acute disease, which was certain to end fatally in a very few days.
The doctor, half hesitatingly, revealed to him his hopeless state. "By
jingo!" he exclaimed, rousing up at once into the old energy, "I shall
do the insurance company! I was always a lucky fellow!"

Confiding.

A Chicago gambler, whose first name was George, used to visit a
Chinaman's establishment and smoke opium almost daily. One day he rushed
into the place and said, excitedly: "Hip, loan me $10. Thanks. I'll come
in and pay you to-morrow noon, if I'm alive," and out he went with the
money. About three o'clock the next afternoon a friend of the gambler
dropped in on the Chinaman and said: "Hip, where is George to-day?" and
the confiding Celestial wiped his eyes with the corner of his blouse and
replied: "George, him dead."

A Nun-Like Girl and Her Mischievous Friend.

It was on the St. Jose train and two young ladies--one as serious and
good as a little nun, the other with a black eye with the devil's own
glint in it--sat behind the youngest minister in town. The quiet one
held in her hand a purple pansy so large that it attracted the attention
of the young minister. While he was still looking at it the train rushed
into a tunnel. The black-eyed young woman grabbed the pansy in the
darkness from her companion, and leaning over, dropped it into the lap
of the godly man. When the train reached daylight again the young
minister had turned, and with the pansy in his hand was glaring
reprovingly at the nun-like girl between whose fingers he had seen the
flower. Her face was blazing and her downcast eyes seemed to confess her
guilt. The whole car snickered and the malicious black-eyed girl read
her book unconsciously.

This is why the young minister preached on the iniquity of flirting,
yesterday.

An Effective Mule Invigorator.

While traveling in Virginia some time ago with a doctor we came upon an
old colored man who was standing by a mule hitched to an old two-wheel
vehicle. "Dis mule am balked, boss," said the old man; "an' I'll jis gib
a dollah to de man what can start 'im."

"I will do it for less than that, uncle," said the doctor. He took his
case from the carriage and selected a small syringe, which he filled
with morphin. He went to the side of the mule and quickly inserting the
syringe in his side pushed the contents into the animal. The mule reared
upon his hind legs and giving an astonishing bray started down the road
at a break neck speed. The aged colored man gave a look of astonishment
at the doctor, and with a loud "Whoa!" started down the road after the
mule. In the course of ten minutes we came up to the old man standing in
the road waiting for us. The mule was nowhere in sight.

"Say, boss," said the darky, "how much you charge for dat stuff you put
in dat mule?"

"Oh, ten cents will do," laughingly replied the doctor.

"Well, boss, heah is twenty cents. Squirt some of dat stuff in me. I
must ketch dat ar mule."

MRS. FLYNN AND THE GOAT.

The Lady's Stirring Narrative, with Spring Lamb Trimmings.

Mrs. Flynn relates with much pathos an incident in her life, that
graphically illustrates woman's trustfulness and man's perfidy.

"Oi waz in the market wan mornin' lookin' fer some mate, an' a Dootch
butcher axed me how an illegant bit av Spring lamb wad soot. Oi sed it
wad do af it waz good, an he sed it waz the best in the market or he
wudn't be offerin' it to a lady loike meself. Oi'm fond av Spring lamb,
an so Oi took a hunk av it home an' cooked it fer me ould mon an'
meself.

"May the divil take me av it tasted roight. It had a sort av a rank an
romantic flavor thet Oi niver kem across afore, an' heaven help me, may
Oi niver come across it again.

"Oi kept me jaw to meself, and said nathin'. After dinner the ould mon
said the Spring lamb tasted kin o' quare an' he wondered had Oi cooked
the baste enough. Oi said Oi had cooked the baste joost roight, an' Oi
saw nathin wrong wid the taste av it.

"Whin the ould mon had gone out to wurruk, Oi tuk a luck at the chunk av
mate that was left, an' phat do you tink Oi saw? A bit av the skin av
the varmint, an' it had hair on it instead of wool, begorra. The thavin'
Dootchman hed sold me goat instead av lamb! Bad luk to him!

"Oi coodn't affoord to lose the mate, d'ye see, an' so Oi kept me jaw to
meself an' said nothin agin. Oi stewed it up wid spices and tings to
disguoise the taste, an' we had it agin fer supper. Oi told the ould mon
Oi didn't care fer enny Spring lamb fer supper, but it wuz very
beautiful cooked up wid spices, an he needed plenty av mate now that he
wuz wurkin' wid the Park Commishioners. He ate awhoile, an' thin he said
the Spring lamb tasted kind o' quare, an' he thought it wuz too
high-toned fer us.

"'Now, me darlint,' Oi said, 'the Spring lamb is a little high-toned,
but it is none too good fer the loikes av us, an' ye moost ate hearty so
ye can do good wurruk fer the Park Commishioners.'

"He said the Park Commishioners be blowed, an' he cood do good enough
wurruk fer them on roast bafe, an' wad Oi git roast bafe the nixt
toime?

"Oi said, 'My darlint, av coorse Oi'll git roast bafe the nixt toime,
but we moost ate all the Spring lamb foorst.'

"Well, ye see it took me hoosband several days to git away wid the
Spring lamb, but he foinly got trough wid the job, an' thin Oi took the
bit av skin wid the hair on, phat Oi had saved as a guarantay av good
faith, an' Oi wint down to the market. Oi hoonted up the beautiful
Dootchman, an' sez Oi:

"'Have you enny noice mate this mornin', Dootchy?'

"'Phat koind wad you loike this mornin', Mrs. Flynn?' sez he.

"'Oi ate nothin' but the best,' sez Oi.

"'How wad a noice bit av Spring lamb soot?' sez he.

"'Tanks,' sez Oi. 'Spring lamb is a bit high-toned fer me. Oi'll take a
foine large steak av ye plaze.'

"'About how large?' sez he.

"'About tin pounds,' sez Oi, 'an' a foine juicy wan, av ye plaze.'

"So Oi tuk the steak an' takin' a good grip av it, Oi slammed it around
his big Dootch ears till he yelled bloody murther in fourteen languages.
'The nixt toime ye sell me goat fer Spring lamb, ye thavin'
Dootchman'--an' Oi kept bastin' him around the ugly lugs--'the nixt
toime ye sell me goat, Oi say, Oi'll make ye ate his whuskers.'"

Twenty-five Cents Ahead.

A story is told about a Kingston minister's marriage fee that causes
amusement among the clergy. He was paid $1 for marrying a couple. After
they departed he was about to hand the money to his wife, when the door
bell was rung. The newly-married wife said she wanted a certificate. No
marriage was good without one. It cost twenty-five cents for a blank
that would suit her. The reverend gentleman filled the blank out in the
usual form and she went away seemingly satisfied. A few days later she
again appeared at the door. "Mister," said the woman in an aggrieved
tone, "I looked through the papers and can't find a notice of our
wedding. You ought not to treat us different from other folks." So the
dominie went to a newspaper office and paid fifty cents to have a notice
inserted. When he reached home he handed the remaining twenty-five cents
to his wife with the remark: "Here, my dear, hurry and take this before
that woman makes another call."

Two Kinds of Bands.

"Pap, did you ever hear music from a rubber band?" said Johnnie.

"No, my son, never. What in the world do you mean. Is it a lot of rubber
figures that you blow up and then do they play music?"

"Naw, pap. Come out in the next room and I'll let you hear some music
from a rubber band."

The old gentleman becoming interested, laid down his paper, wiped his
glasses, and followed his son into the next room, where Johnnie had a
rubber band stretched from one side of the wood box to the other, which
he began to pick with his finger. "Now, pap, you can say that you have
heard music from a rubber band."

"Yes," said the old man, "and I will be able to add that I have caused
music by a leather band," and suiting the action to the word, he reached
around for a strap, and before John knew it he felt as if eight million
rubber bands were snapping him where his pants fit the tightest.

party," one night recently, each maid appearing painted and powdered.
There doesn't seem to have been any thing save the name to distinguish
it from any other party attended by young ladies.

Young Man of Killarney.

    There was a young man of Killarney,
    Who was chock full of what is called blarney.
        He would sit on a stile,
        And tell lies by the mile,
    Would this dreadful young man of Killarney.

Three new recruits for the golden shore.


Times Have Changed.

Long ago there was a time when Sir Walter Raleigh laid his cloak over a
puddle, so that the royal Elizabeth might go on her way dry-shod.

In similar circumstances, Queen Victoria would be lucky if she could
elicit from the gilded youth of the present day the languid cry of "Skip
the gutter, old lady!"

                                                 --_Harvard Lampoon._


From the Oklahoma "Snorter."

The Oklahoma _Snorter_, in its last issue, contained the following
breezy locals:

Jim Highbee has secured the beautiful lot at the corner of Bullwhacker
avenue and Kill'emquick street, and has begun the erection of a tent
thereon. This lot formerly belonged to Dick Skinner, but he gave it up
at the same time he give up his life. Col. Jim is a good shot.

We are glad to learn that our friend Dan Bunker has at last come into
possession of a choice lot. Dan killed the former claimant with his
first shot. Dan is a rustler, and never does things by halves.

The report that the ten men found dead last night on Goosebristle Creek
had been shot, proves a fabrication. They were the victims of congestive
chills.

Wanted--Ten first-class grave diggers. Also, four or five more coffin
makers. Must be willing to work twelve hours a day, but pay is large.
Cophin & Son.

Subscribers must pay for this paper in advance. Life is too uncertain to
take any chances.

Major Burdock, one of our gentlemanly undertakers, came up yesterday to
see us. The Major is smiling, and says he never had more flattering
business prospects. He is running a large corps of men day and night in
order to keep up with his orders. He says he is prepared to make liberal
terms with those who contemplate taking claims, if they wish to arrange
in advance for burial.

There was quite a lot of freight received at the depot yesterday,
consisting chiefly of coffins and guns.

Notice--We are prepared to bury boomers quicker and cheaper than any
other house in the city. Send in your friends. We will take pleasure in
burying them. Plantum & Co.

Real estate has changed hands rapidly the last few days. The new owners
usually show their liberality by burying the former claimants.

Several Texans came in yesterday to locate claims. Our undertakers are
watching the corners for a good harvest.

Food and ammunition are becoming scarce. We learn, however, that a
carload of shot and powder is expected to-day.

First-class meals at all hours at Tremont hotel. Bean soup, fifty cents
a dish; eggs, ten cents each (when we have them); water, five cents a
glass. Call in second tent above the _Snorter_ office.

We learn that our genial friend Dick Tucker has given up his claim and
returned home. We are sorry to lose Dick, as he was one of the most
cheerful and whole-hearted men among us. If he had known the claim was
so worthless it is doubtful if he would have shot the man who held it
down before him.

Bill Swanson was in to-day and reported that he had secured a fine claim
just east of town. Of course he had to remove the man who was on it, but
Bill did it neatly, and then paid the funeral expenses. There is nothing
small about Bill.

Herr Yager on the Marriage Question.

"Good evening, Neighbor Yager. What's your opinion about marriage being
a failure?"

"Vell, I dinks it vas vone dem dings und it don'd vas vone dem dings.
Vhen a man got him marriedt he got him marriedt; dat vas somedings sure;
der don'd vhas some vailures about dot. Aber ouf him got a frau vhat
vhas some dem Arisdodle's preed, vhat neffer done got dalkin', den dem

fishes derein, vhen youm a frau fishin' gone meppy youm vone dimes in a
hunnert gatch vone dem goot fishes, aber not more as dot."

"Did you catch one of the good fishes, Herr Yager?"

Then Herr Yager looked back at the front windows of his residence and
remarked in a kind of graveyard tone:

"I seen you lader."

Not Saving His Bacon.

It is related that Sir Nicholas Bacon was about to pass judgment upon a
man who had been guilty of robbery, at that time punishable by death;
but the culprit pleaded for mercy on the ground that he was related to
the judge.

"How is that?" he was asked.

"My Lord," was the reply, "your name is Bacon, mine is Hogg, and hog and
bacon have always been considered akin."

"That is true," answered Sir Nicholas; "but as hog is not bacon until it
has hung, until you are hanged you are no relation of mine."

Her Attraction.

    There's something attractive about her:
          It isn't her beauty of face,
          It isn't her ribbons of lace,
    But there's something attractive about her,
    And I swear that I can't live without her,
          And that is the state of the case.

    There's something attractive about her,
          It isn't her glance or her smile,
          It isn't her elegant style;
    But I'm poor and I can't live without her,
    For that something attractive about her,
          You know, is the size of her pile.

JOURNAL OF SOLOMON SIDESPLITTER.

"Martha, does thee love me?" asked a Quaker youth of one at whose shrine
his heart's fondest feelings had been offered up. "Why, Seth," answered
she, "we are commanded to love one another, are we not?" "Ah, Martha!
but doest not thee regard me with that feeling that the world calls
_love_?" "I hardly know what to tell thee, Seth; I have greatly feared
that my heart was an erring one; I have tried to bestow my love on all;
but I may have sometimes thought, perhaps, that thee was getting rather
more than thy share."


"Martha, my dear," said a loving husband to his spouse, who was several
years his junior, "what do you say to moving to the far West?" "Oh, I'm
delighted with the idea! You recollect when Mr. Morgan moved out there
he was as poor as we are; and he _died in three years, leaving his widow
worth a hundred thousand dollars_."


"Ma," said a juvenile grammarian, when she returned from school; "ma,
mayn't I take some of the currant-jelly on the sideboard?" "No," said
the mother, sternly. "Well, then, ma, mayn't I take some of the
ice-cream?" "No," again replied "ma." It was not long, however, before
the young miss was found "diggin'" into both. "Did I not tell you," said
the maternal parent, in a somewhat angry tone, "not to touch them?" "You
said _no_ twice, ma," said the precocious girl, "and the schoolmistress
says that two negatives are equal to an affirmative; so I thought you
meant that I should eat them."


"Mat, I want another _porter_." "What _ales_ the one you have, Dick?"
"He's dead." "Gone to his _bier_, eh?" "Hang you, Dick, your wit's
always a broad-_cider_."


"Jack, Jack!" cried a sailor, on board a ship at sea, lately, to one of
his companions.--"Hello!" replied Jack; "what is it?"--"Your brother's
overboard."--"Overboard?"--"Yes."--"Blow the lubber! he has got my
sea-boots and monkey-jacket on!"


Judge Rooke, in going the western circuit, had a great stone thrown at
his head; but, from the circumstance of his stooping very much, it
passed over him. "You see," said he to his friends, "that had I been an
upright judge, I might have been killed."


"Kitty, where's the frying-pan?"--"Johnny's got it, carting mud and
oyster shells up the alley, with the cat for a horse."--"The dear little
fellow! what a genius he'll yet make; but go and get it. We're going to
have company, and must fry some fish for dinner."


Lighting an editor's fire with rejected contributions--_Burns' Justice._


Lady F---- had arrived to so extreme a degree of sensibility, that,
seeing a man go by with a mutilated wheelbarrow, she cried out to her
companion, "Do turn aside, it distresses me above measure to see that
poor unfortunate wheelbarrow with one leg."


"La, me!" sighed Mrs. Muggins, "here have I been sufferin' the begamies
of death for three mortal weeks. Fust, I was seized with a painful
phrenology in the left hampshire of the brain, which was exceeded by a
stoppage of the left ventilator of the heart. This gave me an
inflammation in the borax, and now I'm sick with the chloroform morbus.
There is no blessin' like that of health, particularly when you're
sick."


"Jack," said a commercial traveller to a country joskin, "which is the
way to Harlingford?" "How did you know my name was Jack?" inquired the
countryman. "Why, I guessed it," replied the bagman. "Then guess your
way to Harlingford," says Jack, "for I shan't tell you."


"John, what is the past of see?" "_Seen_, sir." "No, it is
_saw_--recollect that." "Yes, sir. Then if a _sea_-fish swims by me, it
becomes a _saw_-fish when it is _past_, and can't be _seen_." "You may
go home, John."


Judge Peters, a Philadelphian and a punster, having observed to another
judge on the bench that one of the witnesses had a _vegetable_ head,
"How so?" was the inquiry. "He has _carroty_ hair, _reddish_ cheeks, a
_turnup_ nose, and a _sage_ look."


"John," screamed a country girl, seated by the side of her dull lover,
"leave me alone!" John, astonished, cried, "Why, I ain't a-touching
yer!" "No," replied she, "but you might have done--if you liked."


"Jim, why is it that a musician's strains are always heard so much less
distinctly when he plays alone, than when in a band?"--"Why, I didn't
know it was so--suppose it must be because he plays _so-lo_."


"Jack," said a gentleman to an old negro, who was rather lazily engaged
in clearing the snow from his premises, "Jack, my old boy, you don't get
along with this job very fast."--"Why, master," replied Jack, scratching
his wool, "pretty considerable for an old man, I guess; and I conceit
myself, that I can clear more snow away in dese here short days, than
the spryest nigga in the city could do in the longest summer day as ever
was."


Mr. Russell once asked a nigger to call him early in the morning,
because he wanted to go by the first boat. "At wat time, massa?" "At
half-past three o'clock." "Half-pass tree o'clock?" "Yes, sir." The
nigger, after grinning, departed; but immediately reappeared, saying:
"Please, massa, don't forget to ring for me at tree o'clock in the
morning, and I can be sure to wake you."


"Mr. Smith, you said you once officiated in a pulpit--do you mean by
that that you preached?" "No, sir; I held the light for a man what did."
"Ah; the court understood you differently. They supposed that the
discourse came from you." "No, sir; I only throwed a light on it." "No
levity, Mr. Smith. Crier, wipe your nose, and call on the next witness."


Mrs. Hopkins told me, that she heard Green's wife say, that John Glucks
told her, that Fanny Hopkins heard the Widow Busham say, that Captain
Weed's wife thought Colonel Hodgkins' sisters believed, that old Miss
Quint reckoned that Mrs. Samuel Dunham had told Spoldin's wife that she
heard John Fink's daughter say, that her mother told her, that old Miss
Jenks heard Grandmother Cook declare, that it was an undoubted fact.


"Misther! Misther! what have you done?" said a little fellow with
protruding eyes, to a greenhorn, who had just tied his horse to a spruce
pole, as he thought, on the street. "Done!" said the fellow, "what do
you mean? I haint been doin' nothin' as I knows on!" "Why, yeth you
have, thir; you've hitched your hoth to the magnetic telegraph, and
you'll be in Bothton in leth than two minutes, if you don't look out!"
The man untied his horse with nervous anxiety, and, jumping into his
wagon, drove hastily down the street.


"I'm not afraid of a barrel of cider!" said a toper to a temperance man.
"I presume not, from your appearance; I should think a barrel of cider
would _run_ at your approach," was the reply.


"I tell you, Susan, that I will commit suicide, if you won't have
me."--"Well, John, as soon as you have given me that proof of your
affection, I will believe that you love me."


If the speculator misses his aim, everybody cries out, "He's a fool,"
and sometimes "He's a rogue." If he succeeds, they besiege his door and
demand his daughter in marriage.


"I'm sitting on the style, Mary," as the lover said when he seated
himself on a bonnet of the latest Paris fashion.


"If you say another crooked word I'll knock your brains out," said a
blacksmith to his termagant wife. "Ram's horns, you dog!" exclaimed his
hopeful helpmate, "ram's horns, if I die for it!"


It is said there is a man in Connecticut who walks so fast, that it puts
his shadow out of breath to keep up with him.


In the course of the Irish state trial, Mr. Whiteside quoted an
extraordinary figure once used by an advocate: "I smell a rat--I see it
brewing in the storm--and I will crush it in the bud!"


"I say, Pat, what are you writing there in such a large hand?" "Array,
honey, an' isn't it to my poor mother, who is very deaf, that I'm
writing a loud letther?"


I think it is a very foolish thing for any man to become a _sleeping_
partner, because he may _awake_ and find himself in the Gazette.


"Dad," said an incipient legislator to his indulgent parent, who had
gratified him with a visit to the galleries of the capital, "say do you
see any row going on? I don't." "No," said the astonished father, "of
course not. Why did you ask?" "Cause the man in the big desk says--'the
_eyes_ have it!'--and just now he said the _nose_ had it--so I thought
there was some _fun_ down there some'ers!"


During a learned lecture by a German adventurer, one Baron
Vondullbrains, he illustrated the glory of mechanics, as a science,
thus:--"De t'ing dat is _made_ is more superior dan de _maker_, I shall
show you how in some t'ings. Suppose I make de round wheel of de coach?
Ver' well; dat wheel roll round five hundred mile!--and I cannot roll
one myself! Suppose I am a cooper, what you call, and I make de big tub
to hold wine? He hold tons and gallons; and _I cannot hold more dan five
bottle_! So you see dat what is made is more superior dan de maker."


"Doctor, that ere ratsbane of yourn is fust rate," said a Yankee to a
village apothecary.--"Know'd it," said the pleased vendor of drugs.
"Don't keep nothing but first-rate doctor's stuff."--"And, doctor," said
the joker, coolly, "I want to buy another pound of ye."--"Another
pound?"--"Yes, sir; I gin that pound I bought the other day to a
nibbling mouse, and it made him dreadful sick, and I am sure another
pound would kill him!"


Drunken Davy, after spending his day's earnings at a grocery, set out
for home. "Well," says he, "if I find my wife up, I'll kick her--what
business has she to sit up, wasting fire and light, eh? And if I find
her in bed, I'll kick her--what business has she to go to bed before I
get home?"

whether this is an intentional excerpt or a printer's error.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
