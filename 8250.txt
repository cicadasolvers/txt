Book 23 Isaiah
001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
        and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
        kings of Judah.
001:002 Hear, heavens, and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:
        I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
        rebelled against me.
001:003 The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib;
        but Israel doesn't know, my people don't consider.
001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people loaded with iniquity, a seed
        of evil-doers, children who deal corruptly!  They have
        forsaken Yahweh.  They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
        They are estranged and backward.
001:005 Why should you be beaten more, that you revolt more and more?
        The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
001:006 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness
        in it:  wounds, welts, and open sores.  They haven't been closed,
        neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
001:007 Your country is desolate.  Your cities are burned with fire.
        Strangers devour your land in your presence, and it is desolate,
        as overthrown by strangers.
001:008 The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
        like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city.
001:009 Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,
        we would have been as Sodom; we would have been like Gomorrah.
001:010 Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom!  Listen to the law
        of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
001:011 "What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says Yahweh.
        "I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat
        of fed animals.  I don't delight in the blood of bulls,
        or of lambs, or of male goats.
001:012 When you come to appear before me, who has required this
        at your hand, to trample my courts?
001:013 Bring no more vain offerings.  Incense is an abomination to me;
        new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:  I can't bear
        with evil assemblies.
001:014 My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.
        They are a burden to me.  I am weary of bearing them.
001:015 When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
        Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
        Your hands are full of blood.
001:016 Wash yourselves, make yourself clean.  Put away the evil
        of your doings from before my eyes.  Cease to do evil.
001:017 Learn to do well.  Seek justice.  Relieve the oppressed.
        Judge the fatherless.  Plead for the widow."
001:018 "Come now, and let us reason together," says Yahweh:  "Though your
        sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
        Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
001:019 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good
        of the land;
001:020 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;
        for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
001:021 How the faithful city has become a prostitute!  She was full
        of justice; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
001:022 Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.
001:023 Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves.
        Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards.
        They don't judge the fatherless, neither does the cause
        of the widow come to them.
001:024 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, the Mighty One
        of Israel, says:  "Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
        and avenge myself of my enemies;
001:025 and I will turn my hand on you, thoroughly purge away your dross,
        and will take away all your tin.
001:026 I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors
        as at the beginning.  Afterward you shall be called 'The city
        of righteousness, a faithful town.'
001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts
        with righteousness.
001:028 But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
        and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
        and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
001:030 For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden
        that has no water.
001:031 The strong will be like tinder, and his work like a spark.
        They will both burn together, and no one will quench them."
002:001 This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning
        Judah and Jerusalem.
002:002 It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's
        house shall be established on the top of the mountains,
        and shall be raised above the hills; and all nations shall
        flow to it.
002:003 Many peoples shall go and say, "Come, let's go up to
        the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths."
        For out of Zion the law shall go forth, and the word of
        Yahweh from Jerusalem.
002:004 He will judge between the nations, and will decide
        concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords
        into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.
        Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall
        they learn war any more.
002:005 House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
002:006 For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,
        because they are filled from the east, with those who practice
        divination like the Philistines, and they clasp hands with
        the children of foreigners.
002:007 Their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any
        end of their treasures.  Their land also is full of horses,
        neither is there any end of their chariots.
002:008 Their land also is full of idols.  They worship the work
        of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
002:009 Man is brought low, and mankind is humbled; therefore don't
        forgive them.
002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, from before the terror
        of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty.
002:011 The lofty looks of man will be brought low, the haughtiness
        of men will be bowed down, and Yahweh alone will be exalted
        in that day.
002:012 For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that
        is proud and haughty, and for all that is lifted up;
        and it shall be brought low:
002:013 For all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
        for all the oaks of Bashan,
002:014 For all the high mountains, for all the hills that are lifted up,
002:015 For every lofty tower, for every fortified wall,
002:016 For all the ships of Tarshish, and for all pleasant imagery.
002:017 The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
        of men shall be brought low; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted
        in that day.
002:018 The idols shall utterly pass away.
002:019 Men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes
        of the earth, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory
        of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
002:020 In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver,
        and their idols of gold, which have been made for themselves
        to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
002:021 To go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts
        of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Yahweh,
        and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake
        the earth mightily.
002:022 Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
        for of what account is he?
003:001 For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem
        and from Judah supply and support, the whole supply of bread,
        and the whole supply of water;
003:002 the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet,
        the diviner, the elder,
003:003 the captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor,
        the skilled craftsman, and the clever enchanter.
003:004 I will give boys to be their princes, and children shall
        rule over them.
003:005 The people will be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone
        by his neighbor.  The child will behave himself proudly
        against the old man, and the base against the honorable.
003:006 Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house
        of his father, saying, "You have clothing, you be our ruler,
        and let this ruin be under your hand."
003:007 In that day he will cry out, saying, I will not be a healer;
        for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
        You shall not make me ruler of the people.
003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their
        tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, to provoke the eyes
        of his glory.
003:009 The look of their faces testify against them.  They parade
        their sin like Sodom.  They don't hide it.  Woe to their soul!
        For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
003:010 Tell the righteous "Good!"  For they shall eat the fruit
        of their deeds.
003:011 Woe to the wicked!  Disaster is upon them; for the deeds
        of his hands will be paid back to him.
003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule
        over them.  My people, those who lead you cause you to err,
        and destroy the way of your paths.
003:013 Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.
003:014 Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people,
        and their leaders:  "It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
        The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
003:015 What do you mean that you crush my people, and grind the face
        of the poor?" says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
003:016 Moreover Yahweh said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
        and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,
        walking to trip as they go, jingling ornaments on their feet;
003:017 therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head
        of the women of Zion, and Yahweh will make their scalps bald."
003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets,
        the headbands, the crescent necklaces,
003:019 the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
003:020 the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume
        bottles, the charms,
003:021 the signet rings, the nose rings,
003:022 the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
003:023 the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras,
        and the shawls.
003:024 It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall
        be rottenness; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well
        set hair, baldness; instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth;
        and branding instead of beauty.
003:025 Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.
003:026 Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate
        and sit on the ground.
004:001 Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying,
        "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing:
        only let us be called by your name.  Take away our reproach."
004:002 In that day, Yahweh's branch will be beautiful and glorious,
        and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory
        of the survivors of Israel.
004:003 It will happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains
        in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is
        written among the living in Jerusalem;
004:004 when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters
        of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst,
        by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.
004:005 Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion,
        and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,
        and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all
        the glory will be a canopy.
004:006 There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat,
        and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
005:001 Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about
        his vineyard.  My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
005:002 He dug it up, gathered out its stones, planted it with
        the choicest vine, built a tower in its midst, and also cut
        out a winepress therein.  He looked for it to yield grapes,
        but it yielded wild grapes.
005:003 "Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, please judge
        between me and my vineyard.
005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have
        not done in it?  Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes,
        did it yield wild grapes?
005:005 Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
        I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.
        I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.
005:006 I will lay it a wasteland.  It won't be pruned nor hoed,
        but it will grow briers and thorns.  I will also command
        the clouds that they rain no rain on it."
005:007 For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,
        and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:  and he looked
        for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness,
        but, behold, a cry of distress.
005:008 Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field,
        until there is no room, and you are made to dwell alone
        in the midst of the land!
005:009 In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says:  "Surely many houses will
        be desolate, even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
005:010 For ten acres{literally, ten yokes, or the amount of land
        that ten yokes of oxen can plow in one day, which is about 10
        acres or 4 hectares.} of vineyard shall yield one bath,{1
        bath is about 22 litres, 5.8 U. S. gallons, or 4.8 imperial
        gallons} and a homer{1 homer is about 220 litres or 6 bushels}
        of seed shall yield an ephah.{1 ephah is about 22 litres or 0.6
        bushels or about 2 pecks)--only one tenth of what was sown.}"
005:011 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they
        may follow strong drink; who stay late into the night,
        until wine inflames them!
005:012 The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at
        their feasts; but they don't regard the work of Yahweh,
        neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
005:013 Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
        Their honorable men are famished, and their multitudes are
        parched with thirst.
005:014 Therefore Sheol{Sheol is the place of the dead.} has enlarged
        its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory,
        their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them,
        descend into it.
005:015 So man is brought low, mankind is humbled, and the eyes
        of the arrogant ones are humbled;
005:016 but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One
        is sanctified in righteousness.
005:017 Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, and strangers
        will eat the ruins of the rich.
005:018 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
        and wickedness as with cart rope;
005:019 Who say, "Let him make speed, let him hasten his work,
        that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One
        of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!"
005:020 Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness
        for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet,
        and sweet for bitter!
005:021 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent
        in their own sight!
005:022 Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and champions
        at mixing strong drink;
005:023 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice
        for the innocent!
005:024 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
        and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root
        shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust;
        because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,
        and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
005:025 Therefore Yahweh's anger burns against his people, and he has
        stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them.
        The mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse
        in the midst of the streets.  For all this, his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is still stretched out.
005:026 He will lift up a banner to the nations from far,
        and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.
        Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.
005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
        nor sleep; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,
        nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
005:028 whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent.  Their horses'
        hoofs will be like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.
005:029 Their roaring will be like a lioness.  They will roar like
        young lions.  Yes, they shall roar, and seize their prey
        and carry it off, and there will be no one to deliver.
005:030 They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.
        If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress.
        The light is darkened in its clouds.
006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on
        a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
006:002 Above him stood the seraphim.  Each one had six wings.
        With two he covered his face.  With two he covered his feet.
        With two he flew.
006:003 One called to another, and said, "Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh
        of Armies!  The whole earth is full of his glory!"
006:004 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him
        who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
006:005 Then I said, "Woe is me!  For I am undone, because I am a man of
        unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:
        for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!"
006:006 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand,
        which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
006:007 He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has
        touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away,
        and your sin forgiven."
006:008 I heard the Lord's voice, saying, "Whom shall I send,
        and who will go for us?"  Then I said, "Here I am.  Send me!"
006:009 He said, "Go, and tell this people, 'You hear indeed,
        but don't understand; and you see indeed, but don't perceive.'
006:010 Make the heart of this people fat.  Make their ears heavy,
        and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes,
        and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
        and turn again, and be healed."
006:011 Then I said, "Lord, how long?"  He answered, "Until cities
        are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man,
        and the land becomes utterly waste,
006:012 And Yahweh has removed men far away, and the forsaken places
        are many in the midst of the land.
006:013 If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed:
        as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they
        are felled; so the holy seed is its stock."
007:001 It happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
        of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
        and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to
        Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
007:002 It was told the house of David, saying, "Syria is allied
        with Ephraim."  His heart trembled, and the heart of his people,
        as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
007:003 Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz,
        you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit
        of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field.
007:004 Tell him, 'Be careful, and keep calm.  Don't be afraid,
        neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails
        of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria,
        and of the son of Remaliah.
007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted
        evil against you, saying,
007:006 "Let's go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let's divide
        it among ourselves, and set up a king in the midst of it,
        even the son of Tabeel."
007:007 This is what the Lord Yahweh says:  "It shall not stand,
        neither shall it happen."
007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
        and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces,
        so that it shall not be a people;
007:009 and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria
        is Remaliah's son.  If you will not believe, surely you shall
        not be established.'"
007:010 Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
007:011 "Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth,
        or in the height above."
007:012 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh."
007:013 He said, "Listen now, house of David:  Is it not enough for you
        to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience
        of my God also?
007:014 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
        Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall
        call his name Immanuel.{"Immanuel" means "God with us."}
007:015 He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil,
        and choose the good.
007:016 For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good,
        the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.
007:017 Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house,
        days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed
        from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
007:018 It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly
        that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt,
        and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
007:019 They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys,
        in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges,
        and on all pastures.
007:020 In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired
        in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria,
        the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also
        consume the beard.
007:021 It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow,
        and two sheep;
007:022 and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk
        which they shall give he shall eat butter:  for everyone will
        eat butter and honey that is left in the midst of the land.
007:023 It will happen in that day that every place where there
        were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels, shall be
        for briers and thorns.
007:024 People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all
        the land will be briers and thorns.
007:025 All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall
        not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be
        for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep."
008:001 Yahweh said to me, "Take a large tablet, and write on it with a
        man's pen, 'For Maher Shalal Hash Baz;{"Maher Shalal Hash Baz"
        means "quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil."}'
008:002 and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify:
        Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah."
008:003 I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son.
        Then said Yahweh to me, "Call his name 'Maher Shalal Hash Baz.'
008:004 For before the child knows how to say, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,'
        the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried
        away by the king of Assyria."
008:005 Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,
008:006 "Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah
        that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
008:007 now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood
        waters of the River:  the king of Assyria and all his glory.
        It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.
008:008 It will sweep onward into Judah.  It will overflow and pass through;
        it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its
        wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.
008:009 Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces!  Listen, all you
        from far countries:  dress for battle, and be shattered!
        Dress for battle, and be shattered!
008:010 Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing;
        speak the word, and it will not stand:  for God is with us."
008:011 For Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
        me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
008:012 "Don't say, 'A conspiracy!' concerning all about which this
        people say, 'A conspiracy!' neither fear their threats,
        nor be terrorized.
008:013 Yahweh of Armies is who you must regard as holy.
        He is the one you must fear.  He is the one you must dread.
008:014 He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel,
        he will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
008:015 Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared,
        and be captured."
008:016 Wrap up the testimony.  Seal the law among my disciples.
008:017 I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob,
        and I will look for him.
008:018 Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are
        for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies,
        who dwells in Mount Zion.
008:019 When they tell you, "Consult with those who have familiar
        spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:"
        shouldn't a people consult with their God?  Should they
        consult the dead on behalf of the living?
008:020 Turn to the law and to the testimony!  If they don't speak
        according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.
008:021 They will pass through it, sore distressed and hungry;
        and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry,
        and curse by their king and by their God.  They will turn
        their faces upward,
008:022 and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom
        of anguish.  They will be driven into thick darkness.
009:001 But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish.
        In the former time, he brought into contempt the land
        of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter
        time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea,
        beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
009:002 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
        Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them
        the light has shined.
009:003 You have multiplied the nation.  You have increased their joy.
        They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest,
        as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
009:004 For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder,
        the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian.
009:005 For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle,
        and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning,
        fuel for the fire.
009:006 For to us a child is born.  To us a son is given;
        and the government will be on his shoulders.  His name will be
        called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
        Prince of Peace.
009:007 Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall
        be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom,
        to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and
        with righteousness from that time on, even forever.
        The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.
009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it falls on Israel.
009:009 All the people will know, including Ephraim and the inhabitants
        of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
009:010 "The bricks have fallen, but we will build with hewn stone.
        The sycamore fig trees have been cut down, but we will put
        cedars in their place."
009:011 Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries
        of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,
009:012 The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they
        will devour Israel with open mouth.  For all this, his anger
        is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
009:013 Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,
        neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies.
009:014 Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail,
        palm branch and reed, in one day.
009:015 The elder and the honorable man is the head, and the prophet
        who teaches lies is the tail.
009:016 For those who lead this people lead them astray; and those
        who are led by them are destroyed.
009:017 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,
        neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;
        for everyone is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth
        speaks folly.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
009:018 For wickedness burns like a fire.  It devours the briers
        and thorns; yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,
        and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
009:019 Through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies, the land is
        burnt up; and the people are the fuel for the fire.
        No one spares his brother.
009:020 One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will
        eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.
        Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:
009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall
        be against Judah.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
010:001 Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers
        who write oppressive decrees;
010:002 to deprive the needy from justice, and to rob the poor among
        my people of their rights, that widows may be their spoil,
        and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
010:003 What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation
        which will come from afar?  To whom will you flee for help?
        Where will you leave your wealth?
010:004 They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall
        under the slain.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
010:005 Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand
        is my indignation!
010:006 I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people
        who anger me will I give him a charge to take the spoil
        and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire
        of the streets.
010:007 However he doesn't mean so, neither does his heart think so;
        but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not
        a few nations.
010:008 For he says, "Aren't all of my princes kings?
010:009 Isn't Calno like Carchemish?  Isn't Hamath like Arpad?
        Isn't Samaria like Damascus?"
010:010 As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved
        images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
010:011 shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols,
        so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
010:012 Therefore it will happen that, when the Lord has performed
        his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish
        the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria,
        and the insolence of his haughty looks.
010:013 For he has said, "By the strength of my hand I have done it,
        and by my wisdom; for I have understanding:  and I have removed
        the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures.
        Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.
010:014 My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest,
        and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, have I gathered
        all the earth.  There was no one who moved their wing,
        or that opened their mouth, or chirped."
010:015 Should an axe brag against him who chops with it?
        Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it?
        As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff
        should lift up someone who is not wood.
010:016 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat
        ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled
        like the burning of fire.
010:017 The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One
        for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his
        briers in one day.
010:018 He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field,
        both soul and body.  It will be as when a standard bearer faints.
010:019 The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few,
        so that a child could write their number.
010:020 It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel,
        and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more
        again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh,
        the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
010:021 A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob,
        to the mighty God.
010:022 For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea,
        only a remnant of them will return.  A destruction is determined,
        overflowing with righteousness.
010:023 For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end,
        and that determined, in the midst of all the earth.
010:024 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says "My people who dwell
        in Zion, don't be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike
        you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you,
        as Egypt did.
010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation against
        you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed
        to his destruction."
010:026 Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him,
        as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb.
        His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like
        he did against Egypt.
010:027 It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart
        from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck,
        and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
010:028 He has come to Aiath.  He has passed through Migron.
        At Michmash he stores his baggage.
010:029 They have gone over the pass.  They have taken up their lodging
        at Geba.  Ramah trembles.  Gibeah of Saul has fled.
010:030 Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim!  Listen, Laishah!
        You poor Anathoth!
010:031 Madmenah is a fugitive.  The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
010:032 This very day he will halt at Nob.  He shakes his hand at
        the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
010:033 Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror.
        The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
010:034 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
        and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
011:001 A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch
        out of his roots will bear fruit.
011:002 The Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him:  the spirit of wisdom
        and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
        of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.
011:003 His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh.  He will not judge
        by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing
        of his ears;
011:004 but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide
        with equity for the humble of the earth.  He will strike
        the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath
        of his lips he will kill the wicked.
011:005 Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness
        the belt of his waist.
011:006 The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down
        with the young goat; The calf, the young lion, and the fattened
        calf together; and a little child will lead them.
011:007 The cow and the bear will graze.  Their young ones will lie
        down together.  The lion will eat straw like the ox.
011:008 The nursing child will play near a cobra's hole, and the weaned
        child will put his hand on the viper's den.
011:009 They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;
        for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh,
        as the waters cover the sea.
011:010 It will happen in that day that the nations will seek
        the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples;
        and his resting place will be glorious.
011:011 It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand
        again the second time to recover the remnant that is left
        of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush,
        from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands
        of the sea.
011:012 He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble
        the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed
        of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
011:013 The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute
        Judah will be cut off.  Ephraim won't envy Judah, and Judah
        won't persecute Ephraim.
011:014 They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west.
        Together they will plunder the children of the east.
        They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children
        of Ammon will obey them.
011:015 Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
        and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River,
        and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march
        over in sandals.
011:016 There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his
        people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day
        that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
012:001 In that day you will say, "I will give thanks to you, Yahweh;
        for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away
        and you comfort me.
012:002 Behold, God is my salvation.  I will trust, and will not
        be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song;
        and he has become my salvation."
012:003 Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.
012:004 In that day you will say, "Give thanks to Yahweh!  Call on his name.
        Declare his doings among the peoples.  Proclaim that his
        name is exalted!
012:005 Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things!
        Let this be known in all the earth!
012:006 Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One
        of Israel is great in the midst of you!"
013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:
013:002 Set up a banner on the bare mountain!  Lift up your voice to them!
        Wave your hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
013:003 I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called
        my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.
013:004 The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people;
        the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations
        gathered together!  Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army
        for the battle.
013:005 They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven,
        even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy
        the whole land.
013:006 Wail; for the day of Yahweh is at hand!  It will come as
        destruction from the Almighty.
013:007 Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone's heart will melt.
013:008 They will be dismayed.  Pangs and sorrows will seize them.
        They will be in pain like a woman in labor.  They will look
        in amazement one at another.  Their faces will be faces of flame.
013:009 Behold, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger;
        to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners
        out of it.
013:010 For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give
        their light.  The sun will be darkened in its going forth,
        and the moon will not cause its light to shine.
013:011 I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked
        for their iniquity.  I will cause the arrogance of the proud
        to cease, and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible.
013:012 I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person
        than the pure gold of Ophir.
013:013 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will
        be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies,
        and in the day of his fierce anger.
013:014 It will happen that like a a hunted gazelle, and like sheep
        that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people,
        and will each flee to their own land.
013:015 Everyone who is found will be thrust through.  Everyone who is
        captured will fall by the sword.
013:016 Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes.
        Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped.
013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not
        value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it.
013:018 Their bows will dash the young men in pieces;
        and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb.
        Their eyes will not spare children.
013:019 Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans'
        pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
013:020 It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from
        generation to generation.  The Arabian will not pitch a tent there,
        neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.
013:021 But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their
        houses will be full of jackals.  Ostriches will dwell there,
        and wild goats will frolic there.
013:022 Wolves will cry in their castles, and jackals in the
        pleasant palaces.  Her time is near to come, and her days
        will not be prolonged.
014:001 For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will
        yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land.
        The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite
        with the house of Jacob.
014:002 The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place.
        The house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh's land for servants
        and for handmaids.  They will take as captives those whose
        captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
014:003 It will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from
        your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the hard service
        in which you were made to serve,
014:004 that you will take up this parable against the king
        of Babylon, and say, "How the oppressor has ceased!
        The golden city has ceased!"
014:005 Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter
        of the rulers,
014:006 who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled
        the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.
014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet.  They break out song.
014:008 Yes, the fir trees rejoice with you, with the cedars
        of Lebanon, saying, "Since you are humbled, no lumberjack
        has come up against us."
014:009 Sheol from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming.
        It stirs up the dead for you, even all the rulers of the earth.
        It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
014:010 They all will answer and ask you, "Have you also become as weak
        as we are?  Have you become like us?"
014:011 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, with the sound of your
        stringed instruments.  Maggots are spread out under you,
        and worms cover you.
014:012 How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn!
        How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low!
014:013 You said in your heart, "I will ascend into heaven!
        I will exalt my throne above the stars of God!  I will sit
        on the mountain of assembly, in the far north!
014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds!  I will make
        myself like the Most High!"
014:015 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the pit.
014:016 Those who see you will stare at you.  They will ponder you,
        saying, "Is this the man who made the earth to tremble,
        who shook kingdoms;
014:017 who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities;
        who didn't release his prisoners to their home?"
014:018 All the kings of the nations, sleep in glory, everyone in
        his own house.
014:019 But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch,
        clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword,
        who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body
        trodden under foot.
014:020 You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed
        your land.  You have killed your people.  The seed of evil-doers
        will not be named forever.
014:021 Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity
        of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth,
        and fill the surface of the world with cities.
014:022 "I will rise up against them," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and
        son's son," says Yahweh.
014:023 "I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools
        of water.  I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
014:024 Yahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, "Surely, as I have thought,
        so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:
014:025 that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him
        under foot on my mountains.  Then his yoke will leave them,
        and his burden leave their shoulders.
014:026 This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth.
        This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.
014:027 For Yahweh of Armies has planned, and who can stop it?
        His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?"
014:028 This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.
014:029 Don't rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that
        struck you is broken; for out of the serpent's root an adder
        will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.
014:030 The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie
        down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine,
        and your remnant will be killed.
014:031 Howl, gate!  Cry, city!  You are melted away, Philistia, all of you;
        for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler
        in his ranks.
014:032 What will they answer the messengers of the nation?
        That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his
        people will take refuge.
015:001 The burden of Moab:  for in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste,
        and brought to nothing; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
        and brought to nothing.
015:002 They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places,
        to weep.  Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba.
        Baldness is on all of their heads.  Every beard is cut off.
015:003 In their streets, they dress themselves in sackcloth.
        In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails,
        weeping abundantly.
015:004 Heshbon cries out with Elealeh.  Their voice is heard even
        to Jahaz.  Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud.
        Their souls tremble within them.
015:005 My heart cries out for Moab!  Her nobles flee to Zoar,
        to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith
        with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim, they raise up
        a cry of destruction.
015:006 For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has
        withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.
015:007 Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten,
        and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows.
015:008 For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab; its wailing
        to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.
015:009 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring
        yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab who escape,
        and on the remnant of the land.
016:001 Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness,
        to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
016:002 For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest,
        so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.
016:003 Give counsel!  Execute justice!  Make your shade like
        the night in the midst of the noonday!  Hide the outcasts!
        Don't betray the fugitive!
016:004 Let my outcasts dwell with you!  As for Moab, be a
        hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer.
        For the extortioner is brought to nothing.  Destruction ceases.
        The oppressors are consumed out of the land.
016:005 A throne will be established in loving kindness.  One will sit
        on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, seeking justice,
        and swift to do righteousness.
016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud;
        even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath.
        His boastings are nothing.
016:007 Therefore Moab will wail for Moab.  Everyone will wail.
        You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth,
        utterly stricken.
016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah.
        The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches,
        which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness.
        Its shoots were spread abroad.  They passed over the sea.
016:009 Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine
        of Sibmah.  I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh:
        for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle
        shout has fallen.
016:010 Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field;
        and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither
        joyful noise.  Nobody will tread out wine in the presses.
        I have made the shouting stop.
016:011 Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward
        parts for Kir Heres.
016:012 It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies
        himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray,
        that he will not prevail.
016:013 This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.
016:014 But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, "Within three years,
        as a worker bound by contract would count them, the glory of Moab
        shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude;
        and the remnant will be very small and feeble."
017:001 The burden of Damascus:  "Behold, Damascus is taken away
        from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.
017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken.  They will be for flocks,
        which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
017:003 The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
        from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria.  They will be as
        the glory of the children of Israel," says Yahweh of Armies.
017:004 "It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be
        made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
017:005 It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his
        arm reaps the grain.  Yes, it will be like when one gleans
        grain in the valley of Rephaim.
017:006 Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree,
        two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough,
        four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,"
        says Yahweh, the God of Israel.
017:007 In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes
        will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.
017:008 They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands;
        neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made,
        either the Asherim, or the incense altars.
017:009 In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places
        in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from
        before the children of Israel; and it will be a desolation.
017:010 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not
        remembered the rock of your strength.  Therefore you plant
        pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings.
017:011 In the day of your planting, you hedge it in.  In the morning,
        you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away
        in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
017:012 Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas;
        and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing
        of mighty waters!
017:013 The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters:
        but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will
        be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
        and like the whirling dust before the storm.
017:014 At evening, behold, terror!  Before the morning, they are no more.
        This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot
        of those who rob us.
018:001 Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond
        the rivers of Ethiopia;
018:002 that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
        papyrus on the waters, saying, "Go, you swift messengers,
        to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their
        beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down,
        whose land the rivers divide!"
018:003 All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth,
        when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look!
        When the trumpet is blown, listen!
018:004 For Yahweh said to me, "I will be still, and I will see in my
        dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud
        of dew in the heat of harvest."
018:005 For before the harvest, when the blossom is over,
        and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off
        the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take
        away the spreading branches.
018:006 They will be left together for the ravenous birds
        of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth.
        The ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the animals
        of the earth will winter on them.
018:007 In that time, a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies
        from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome
        from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out
        and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place
        of the name of Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion.
019:001 The burden of Egypt:  "Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud,
        and comes to Egypt.  The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence;
        and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst.
019:002 I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they
        will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against
        his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
019:003 The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst.  I will destroy
        its counsel.  They will seek the idols, the charmers,
        those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.
019:004 I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord.
        A fierce king will rule over them," says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
019:005 The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted
        and become dry.
019:006 The rivers will become foul.  The streams of Egypt will be
        diminished and dried up.  The reeds and flags will wither away.
019:007 The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all
        the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away,
        and be no more.
019:008 The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile
        will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.
019:009 Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave
        white cloth, will be confounded.
019:010 The pillars will be broken in pieces.  All those who work
        for hire will be grieved in soul.
019:011 The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish.  The counsel
        of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid.
        How do you say to Pharaoh, "I am the son of the wise,
        the son of ancient kings?"
019:012 Where then are your wise men?  Let them tell you now; and let
        them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.
019:013 The princes of Zoan have become fools.  The princes of Memphis
        are deceived.  They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are
        the cornerstone of her tribes.
019:014 Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her;
        and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works,
        like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
019:015 Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail,
        palm branch or rush, may do.
019:016 In that day the Egyptians will be like women.  They will tremble
        and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies,
        which he shakes over them.
019:017 The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt.  Everyone to whom
        mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans
        of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.
019:018 In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that
        speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies.
        One will be called "The city of destruction."
019:019 In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst
        of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.
019:020 It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies
        in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because
        of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender,
        and he will deliver them.
019:021 Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh
        in that day.  Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering,
        and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.
019:022 Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing.
        They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them,
        and will heal them.
019:023 In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
        and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian
        into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
019:024 In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
        a blessing in the midst of the earth;
019:025 because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying,
        "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands,
        and Israel my inheritance."
020:001 In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king
        of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;
020:002 at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
        saying, "Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist,
        and take your shoes from off your feet."  He did so,
        walking naked and barefoot.
020:003 Yahweh said, "As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and
        barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt
        and concerning Ethiopia,
020:004 so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt
        and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot,
        and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
020:005 They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia
        their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
020:006 The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, 'Behold,
        this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered
        from the king of Assyria.  And we, how will we escape?'"
021:001 The burden of the wilderness of the sea.  As whirlwinds
        in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness,
        from an awesome land.
021:002 A grievous vision is declared to me.  The treacherous
        man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys.
        Go up, Elam; attack!  I have stopped all of Media's sighing.
021:003 Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish.  Pains have
        taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in labor.
        I am in so much pain that I can't hear.  I so am dismayed
        that I can't see.
021:004 My heart flutters.  Horror has frightened me.  The twilight
        that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.
021:005 They prepare the table.  They set the watch.  They eat.
        They drink.  Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!
021:006 For the Lord said to me, "Go, set a watchman.  Let him declare
        what he sees.
021:007 When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop
        of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness."
021:008 He cried like a lion:  "Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower
        in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.
021:009 Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs."
        He answered, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved
        images of her gods are broken to the ground.
021:010 You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!"
        That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God
        of Israel, I have declared to you.
021:011 The burden of Dumah.  One calls to me out of Seir, "Watchman,
        what of the night?  Watchman, what of the night?"
021:012 The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night.
        If you will inquire, inquire.  Come back again."
021:013 The burden on Arabia.  In the forest in Arabia you will lodge,
        you caravans of Dedanites.
021:014 They brought water to him who was thirsty.  The inhabitants
        of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.
021:015 For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword,
        from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.
021:016 For the Lord said to me, "Within a year, as a worker bound
        by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,
021:017 and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty
        men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, has spoken it."
022:001 The burden of the valley of vision.  What ails you now,
        that you have all gone up to the housetops?
022:002 You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town;
        your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they
        dead in battle.
022:003 All your rulers fled away together.  They were bound by
        the archers.  All who were found by you were bound together.
        They fled far away.
022:004 Therefore I said, "Look away from me.  I will weep bitterly.
        Don't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter
        of my people.
022:005 For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity,
        from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision;
        a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains."
022:006 Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen;
        and Kir uncovered the shield.
022:007 It happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
        and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.
022:008 He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day
        to the armor in the house of the forest.
022:009 You saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many;
        and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
022:010 You numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down
        the houses to fortify the wall.
022:011 You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water
        of the old pool.  But you didn't look to him who had done this,
        neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago.
022:012 In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping,
        and to mourning, and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth:
022:013 and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and killing sheep,
        eating flesh and drinking wine:  "Let us eat and drink,
        for tomorrow we will die."
022:014 Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, "Surely this
        iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,"
        says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
022:015 Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, "Go, get yourself to
        this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,
022:016 'What are you doing here?  Who has you here, that you have
        dug out a tomb here?'  Cutting himself out a tomb on high,
        chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!"
022:017 Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently.
        Yes, he will grasp you firmly.
022:018 He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you
        like a ball into a large country.  There you will die,
        and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame
        of your lord's house.
022:019 I will thrust you from your office.  You will be pulled down
        from your station.
022:020 It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim
        the son of Hilkiah,
022:021 and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him
        with your belt.  I will commit your government into his hand;
        and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
        and to the house of Judah.
022:022 I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder.
        He will open, and no one will shut.  He will shut, and no
        one will open.
022:023 I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place.
        He will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.
022:024 They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house,
        the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups
        even to all the pitchers.
022:025 "In that day," says Yahweh of Armies, "the nail that was fastened
        in a sure place will give way.  It will be cut down, and fall.
        The burden that was on it will be cut off, for Yahweh
        has spoken it."
023:001 The burden of Tyre.  Howl, you ships of Tarshish!  For it
        is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in.
        From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
023:002 Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants
        of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
023:003 On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile,
        was her revenue.  She was the market of nations.
023:004 Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold
        of the sea, saying, "I have not travailed, nor brought forth,
        neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins."
023:005 When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at
        the report of Tyre.
023:006 Pass over to Tarshish!  Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!
023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days,
        whose feet carried her far away to travel?
023:008 Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns,
        whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable
        of the earth?
023:009 Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory,
        to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
023:010 Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish.
        There is no restraint any more.
023:011 He has stretched out his hand over the sea.  He has
        shaken the kingdoms.  Yahweh has ordered the destruction
        of Canaan's strongholds.
023:012 He said, "You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed
        virgin daughter of Sidon.  Arise, pass over to Kittim.
        Even there you will have no rest."
023:013 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans.  This people was not.
        The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness.
        They set up their towers.  They overthrew its palaces.
        They made it a ruin.
023:014 Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!
023:015 It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten
        seventy years, according to the days of one king.
        After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in
        the song of the prostitute.
023:016 Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has
        been forgotten.  Make sweet melody.  Sing many songs,
        that you may be remembered.
023:017 It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh
        will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her wages,
        and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world
        on the surface of the earth.
023:018 Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh.
        It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise
        will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently,
        and for durable clothing.
024:001 Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste,
        turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.
024:002 It will be as with the people, so with the priest;
        as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid,
        so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller;
        as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker
        of interest, so with the giver of interest.
024:003 The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste;
        for Yahweh has spoken this word.
024:004 The earth mourns and fades away.  The world languishes and
        fades away.  The lofty people of the earth languish.
024:005 The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they
        have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken
        the everlasting covenant.
024:006 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who
        dwell therein are found guilty.  Therefore the inhabitants
        of the earth are burned, and few men left.
024:007 The new wine mourns.  The vine languishes.
        All the merry-hearted sigh.
024:008 The mirth of tambourines ceases.  The sound of those who
        rejoice ends.  The joy of the harp ceases.
024:009 They will not drink wine with a song.  Strong drink will be
        bitter to those who drink it.
024:010 The confused city is broken down.  Every house is shut up,
        that no man may come in.
024:011 There is a crying in the streets because of the wine.
        All joy is darkened.  The mirth of the land is gone.
024:012 The city is left in desolation, and the gate is
        struck with destruction.
024:013 For it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples,
        as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when
        the vintage is done.
024:014 These shall lift up their voice.  They will shout for the majesty
        of Yahweh.  They cry aloud from the sea.
024:015 Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!
024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs.
        Glory to the righteous!  But I said, "I pine away!
        I pine away! woe is me!"  The treacherous have dealt treacherously.
        Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.
024:017 Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.
024:018 It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear
        will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the midst
        of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high
        are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
024:019 The earth is utterly broken.  The earth is torn apart.
        The earth is shaken violently.
024:020 The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back
        and forth like a hammock.  Its disobedience will be heavy on it,
        and it will fall and not rise again.
024:021 It shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army
        of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth
        on the earth.
024:022 They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
        in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after
        many days shall they be visited.
024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed;
        for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem;
        and before his elders will be glory.
025:001 Yahweh, you are my God.  I will exalt you!  I will praise your name,
        for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago,
        in complete faithfulness and truth.
025:002 For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city
        into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city.
        It will never be built.
025:003 Therefore a strong people will glorify you.  A city of awesome
        nations will fear you.
025:004 For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold
        to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm,
        a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones
        is like a storm against the wall.
025:005 As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise
        of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song
        of the dreaded ones will be brought low.
025:006 In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast
        of fat things, a feast of choice wines, of fat things full
        of marrow, of well refined choice wines.
025:007 He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering
        that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread
        over all nations.
025:008 He has swallowed up death forever!  The Lord Yahweh will wipe
        away tears from off all faces.  He will take the reproach
        of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh
        has spoken it.
025:009 It shall be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God!  We have
        waited for him, and he will save us!  This is Yahweh!  We have
        waited for him.  We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!"
025:010 For in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest.
        Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw
        is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.
025:011 He will spread out his hands in its midst, like one who swims
        spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled
        together with the craft of his hands.
025:012 He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low,
        and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
026:001 In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:  "We have
        a strong city.  God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.
026:002 Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:
        the one which keeps faith.
026:003 You will keep whoever's mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
        because he trusts in you.
026:004 Trust in Yahweh forever; for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.
026:005 For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
        He lays it low.  He lays it low even to the ground.
        He brings it even to the dust.
026:006 The foot shall tread it down; Even the feet of the poor,
        and the steps of the needy."
026:007 The way of the just is uprightness.  You who are upright make
        the path of the righteous level.
026:008 Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you.
        Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.
026:009 With my soul have I desired you in the night.
        Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly;
        for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants
        of the world learn righteousness.
026:010 Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not
        learn righteousness.  In the land of uprightness he will
        deal wrongfully, and will not see Yahweh's majesty.
026:011 Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don't see; but they
        will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed.
        Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.
026:012 Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also worked
        all our works for us.
026:013 Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,
        but by you only will we make mention of your name.
026:014 The dead shall not live.  The deceased shall not rise.
        Therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and caused
        all memory of them to perish.
026:015 You have increased the nation, O Yahweh.  You have increased
        the nation!  You are glorified!  You have enlarged all
        the borders of the land.
026:016 Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you.  They poured out
        a prayer when your chastening was on them.
026:017 Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time
        of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs;
        so we have been before you, Yahweh.
026:018 We have been with child.  We have been in pain.  We gave birth,
        it seems, only to wind.  We have not worked any deliverance
        in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
026:019 Your dead shall live.  My dead bodies shall arise.
        Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is
        like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast forth the dead.
026:020 Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your
        doors behind you.  Hide yourself for a little moment,
        until the indignation is past.
026:021 For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish
        the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.
        The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer
        cover her slain.
027:001 In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword
        will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan
        the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is
        in the sea.
027:002 In that day, sing to her, "A pleasant vineyard!
027:003 I, Yahweh, am its keeper.  I will water it every moment.
        Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.
027:004 Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns,
        I would do battle!  I would march on them and I would
        burn them together.
027:005 Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make
        peace with me.  Let him make peace with me."
027:006 In days to come, Jacob will take root.  Israel will blossom and bud.
        They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.
027:007 Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them?
        Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?
027:008 In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them.
        He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of
        the east wind.
027:009 Therefore, by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven,
        and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin:
        that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones
        that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense
        altars shall rise no more.
027:010 For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted
        and forsaken, like the wilderness.  The calf will feed there,
        and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.
027:011 When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off.
        The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people
        of no understanding.  Therefore he who made them will not
        have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show
        them no favor.
027:012 It will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from
        the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt;
        and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.
027:013 It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown;
        and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria,
        and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come;
        and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
028:001 Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to
        the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head
        of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!
028:002 Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one.  Like a storm of hail,
        a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing,
        he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.
028:003 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be
        trodden under foot.
028:004 The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head
        of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig
        before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon
        as he sees it.
028:005 In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory,
        and a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people;
028:006 and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
        and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
028:007 They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink.
        The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink.
        They are swallowed up by wine.  They stagger with strong drink.
        They err in vision.  They stumble in judgment.
028:008 For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.
028:009 Whom will he teach knowledge?  To whom will he explain the message?
        Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?
028:010 For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line,
        line on line; here a little, there a little.
028:011 But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and
        in another language;
028:012 to whom he said, "This is the resting place.  Give rest to weary;"
        and "This is the refreshing;" yet they would not hear.
028:013 Therefore the word of Yahweh will be to them precept on precept,
        precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little,
        there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken,
        be snared, and be taken.
028:014 Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, you scoffers, that rule
        this people in Jerusalem:
028:015 "Because you have said, 'We have made a covenant with death,
        and with Sheol are we in agreement.  When the overflowing scourge
        passes through, it won't come to us; for we have made lies
        our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.'"
028:016 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, "Behold, I lay in Zion
        for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone
        of a sure foundation.  He who believes shall not act hastily.
028:017 I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness
        the plumb line.  The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
        and the waters will overflow the hiding place.
028:018 Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement
        with Sheol shall not stand.  When the overflowing scourge
        passes through, then you will be trampled down by it.
028:019 As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning
        by morning it will pass through, by day and by night;
        and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message."
028:020 For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket
        is too narrow to wrap oneself in.
028:021 For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim.
        He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may
        do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act,
        his extraordinary act.
028:022 Now therefore don't be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong;
        for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh
        of Armies, on the whole earth.
028:023 Give ear, and hear my voice!  Listen, and hear my speech!
028:024 Does he who plows to sow plow continually?  Does he keep
        turning the soil and breaking the clods?
028:025 When he has leveled its surface, doesn't he plant the dill,
        and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows,
        the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?
028:026 For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.
028:027 For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument,
        neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill
        is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.
028:028 Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it.
        Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it,
        his horses don't grind it.
028:029 This also comes forth from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful
        in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
029:001 Woe to Ariel!  Ariel, the city where David encamped!
        Add year to year; let the feasts come around;
029:002 then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning
        and lamentation.  She shall be to me as an altar hearth{or, Ariel}.
029:003 I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay
        siege against you with posted troops.  I will raise siege
        works against you.
029:004 You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground.
        Your speech will mumble out of the dust.  Your voice will
        be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground,
        and your speech will whisper out of the dust.
029:005 But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust,
        and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away.
        Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.
029:006 She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder,
        with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm,
        and with the flame of a devouring fire.
029:007 The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
        even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who
        distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
029:008 It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold,
        he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn't satisfied;
        or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks;
        but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty.
        The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion
        will be like that.
029:009 Pause and wonder!  Blind yourselves and be blind!
        They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not
        with strong drink.
029:010 For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep,
        and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered
        your heads, the seers.
029:011 All vision has become to you like the words of a book that
        is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying,
        "Read this, please;" and he says, "I can't, for it is sealed:"
029:012 and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying,
        "Read this, please;" and he says, "I can't read."
029:013 The Lord said, "Because this people draws near with their mouth
        and with their lips to honor me, but they have removed their
        heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment
        of men which has been taught;
029:014 therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work
        among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder;
        and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding
        of their prudent men will be hidden."
029:015 Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh,
        and whose works are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us?"
        and "Who knows us?"
029:016 You turn things upside down!  Should the potter be thought
        to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him
        who made it, "He didn't make me;" or the thing formed say
        of him who formed it, "He has no understanding?"
029:017 Isn't it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned
        into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded
        as a forest?
029:018 In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book,
        and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and
        out of darkness.
029:019 The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor
        among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
029:020 For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases,
        and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off--
029:021 who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare
        for the arbiter in the gate, and who deprive the innocent
        of justice with false testimony.
029:022 Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
        the house of Jacob:  "Jacob shall no longer be ashamed,
        neither shall his face grow pale.
029:023 But when he sees his children, the work of my hands,
        in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name.
        Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand
        in awe of the God of Israel.
029:024 They also who err in spirit will come to understanding,
        and those who grumble will receive instruction."
030:001 "Woe to the rebellious children," says Yahweh, "who take counsel,
        but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit,
        that they may add sin to sin,
030:002 who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice;
        to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
        and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
030:003 Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame,
        and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
030:004 For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have
        come to Hanes.
030:005 They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can't
        profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame,
        and also a reproach."
030:006 The burden of the animals of the South.  Through the land
        of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper
        and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders
        of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels,
        to an unprofitable people.
030:007 For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I
        called her Rahab who sits still.
030:008 Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book,
        that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.
030:009 For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who
        will not hear the law of Yahweh;
030:010 who tell the seers, "Don't see!" and to the prophets,
        "Don't prophesy to us right things.  Tell us pleasant things.
        Prophesy deceits.
030:011 Get out of the way.  Turn aside from the path.
        Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us."
030:012 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Because you
        despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
        and rely on it;
030:013 therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready
        to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes
        suddenly in an instant.
030:014 He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it
        in pieces without sparing, so that there won't be found among
        the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth,
        or to dip up water out of the cistern."
030:015 For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, "You will
        be saved in returning and rest.  Your strength will be in
        quietness and in confidence."  You refused,
030:016 but you said, "No, for we will flee on horses;"
        therefore you will flee; and, "We will ride on the swift;"
        therefore those who pursue you will be swift.
030:017 One thousand will flee at the threat of one.  At the threat
        of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon
        on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.
030:018 Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you;
        and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you,
        for Yahweh is a God of justice.  Blessed are all those who
        wait for him.
030:019 For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem.  You will weep
        no more.  He will surely be gracious to you at the voice
        of your cry.  When he hears you, he will answer you.
030:020 Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water
        of affliction, yet your teachers won't be hidden anymore,
        but your eyes will see your teachers;
030:021 and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left,
        your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way.
        Walk in it."
030:022 You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images
        of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold.
        You shall cast them away as an unclean thing.  You shall
        tell it, "Go away!"
030:023 He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow
        the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be
        rich and plentiful.  In that day, your livestock will feed
        in large pastures.
030:024 The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will
        eat savory provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel
        and with the fork.
030:025 There shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain
        and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter,
        when the towers fall.
030:026 Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
        and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter,
        like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds
        up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they
        were struck with.
030:027 Behold, the name of Yahweh comes from far away, burning with
        his anger, and in thick rising smoke.  His lips are full
        of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire.
030:028 His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to
        the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction;
        and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws
        of the peoples.
030:029 You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept;
        and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come
        to Yahweh's mountain, to Israel's Rock.
030:030 Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show
        the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger,
        and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast,
        storm, and hailstones.
030:031 For through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed.
        He will strike him with his rod.
030:032 Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay
        on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps.
        He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.
030:033 For his burning place has long been ready.  Yes, for the king
        it is made ready.  He has made its pyre deep and large
        with fire and much wood.  Yahweh's breath, like a stream
        of sulfur, kindles it.
031:001 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses,
        and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen
        because they are very strong, but they don't look to the Holy One
        of Israel, and they don't seek Yahweh!
031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster, and will not call back
        his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers,
        and against the help of those who work iniquity.
031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
        and not spirit.  When Yahweh stretches out his hand,
        both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall,
        and they all shall be consumed together.
031:004 For thus says Yahweh to me, "As the lion and the young lion
        growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds is called
        together against him, will not be dismayed at their voice,
        nor abase himself for the noise of them, so Yahweh of Armies
        will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.
031:005 As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.
        He will protect and deliver it.  He will pass over
        and preserve it."
031:006 Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted,
        children of Israel.
031:007 For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and
        his idols of gold--sin which your own hands have made for you.
031:008 "The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword,
        not of mankind, shall devour him.  He will flee from the sword,
        and his young men will become subject to forced labor.
031:009 His rock will pass away by reason of terror, and his princes will
        be afraid of the banner," says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion,
        and his furnace in Jerusalem.
032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
        rule in justice.
032:002 A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert
        from the storm, as streams of water in a dry place,
        as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.
032:003 The eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears
        of those who hear will listen.
032:004 The heart of the rash will understand knowledge, and the tongue
        of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.
032:005 The fool will no longer be called noble, nor the scoundrel
        be highly respected.
032:006 For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity,
        to practice profanity, and to utter error against Yahweh, To make
        empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of
        the thirsty to fail.
032:007 The ways of the scoundrel are evil.  He devises wicked
        devices to destroy the humble with lying words, even when
        the needy speaks right.
032:008 But the noble devises noble things; and he will continue
        in noble things.
032:009 Rise up, you women who are at ease!  Hear my voice!
        You careless daughters, give ear to my speech!
032:010 For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women;
        for the vintage shall fail.  The harvest won't come.
032:011 Tremble, you women who are at ease!  Be troubled, you careless ones!
        Strip yourselves, make yourselves naked, and put sackcloth
        on your waist.
032:012 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
032:013 Thorns and briars will come up on my people's land; yes, on all
        the houses of joy in the joyous city.
032:014 For the palace will be forsaken.  The populous city will be deserted.
        The hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever,
        a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
032:015 Until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the
        wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field
        is considered a forest.
032:016 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness
        will remain in the fruitful field.
032:017 The work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect
        of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
032:018 My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in safe dwellings,
        and in quiet resting places.
032:019 Though hail flattens the forest, and the city is leveled completely.
032:020 Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the feet
        of the ox and the donkey.
033:001 Woe to you who destroy, but you weren't destroyed; and who betray,
        but nobody betrayed you!  When you have finished destroying,
        you will be destroyed; and when you have made an end of betrayal,
        you will be betrayed.
033:002 Yahweh, be gracious to us.  We have waited for you.
        Be our strength every morning, our salvation also in the
        time of trouble.
033:003 At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.
        When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.
033:004 Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.
        Men will leap on it as locusts leap.
033:005 Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high.  He has filled Zion
        with justice and righteousness.
033:006 There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation,
        wisdom, and knowledge.  The fear of Yahweh is your treasure.
033:007 Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors
        of peace weep bitterly.
033:008 The highways are desolate.  The traveling man ceases.
        The covenant is broken.  He has despised the cities.
        He doesn't regard man.
033:009 The land mourns and languishes.  Lebanon is confounded and
        withers away.  Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel
        are stripped bare.
033:010 "Now I will arise," says Yahweh; "Now I will lift myself up.
        Now I will be exalted.
033:011 You will conceive chaff.  You will bring forth stubble.
        Your breath is a fire that will devour you.
033:012 The peoples will be like the burning of lime, like thorns
        that are cut down and burned in the fire.
033:013 Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near,
        acknowledge my might."
033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid.  Trembling has seized the
        godless ones.  Who among us can live with the devouring fire?
        Who among us can live with everlasting burning?
033:015 He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; He who
        despises the gain of oppressions, who gestures with his hands,
        refusing to take a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing
        of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking at evil--
033:016 he will dwell on high.  His place of defense will be
        the fortress of rocks.  His bread will be supplied.
        His waters will be sure.
033:017 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.  They will see
        a distant land.
033:018 Your heart will meditate on the terror.  Where is he who counted?
        Where is he who weighed?  Where is he who counted the towers?
033:019 You will no longer see the fierce people, a people of a deep
        speech that you can't comprehend, with a strange language
        that you can't understand.
033:020 Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals.
        Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tent
        that won't be removed.  Its stakes will never be plucked up,
        nor will any of its cords be broken.
033:021 But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad
        rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars will go,
        neither will any gallant ship pass by there.
033:022 For Yahweh is our judge.  Yahweh is our lawgiver.
        Yahweh is our king.  He will save us.
033:023 Your rigging is untied.  They couldn't strengthen the foot
        of their mast.  They couldn't spread the sail.  Then the prey
        of a great spoil was divided.  The lame took the prey.
033:024 The inhabitant won't say, "I am sick."  The people who dwell
        therein will be forgiven their iniquity.
034:001 Come near, you nations, to hear!  Listen, you peoples.
        Let the earth and all it contains hear; the world,
        and everything that comes from it.
034:002 For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, and angry
        with all their armies.  He has utterly destroyed them.
        He has given them over for slaughter.
034:003 Their slain will also be cast out, and the stench of their dead
        bodies will come up; and the mountains will melt in their blood.
034:004 All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.  The sky will be
        rolled up like a scroll, and all its armies will fade away,
        as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.
034:005 For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.  Behold, it will come
        down on Edom, and on the people of my curse, for judgment.
034:006 Yahweh's sword is filled with blood.  It is covered with fat,
        with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys
        of rams; for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great
        slaughter in the land of Edom.
034:007 The wild oxen will come down with them, and the young bulls
        with the mighty bulls; and their land will be drunken with blood,
        and their dust made greasy with fat.
034:008 For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense
        for the cause of Zion.
034:009 Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into sulfur,
        And its land will become burning pitch.
034:010 It won't be quenched night nor day.  Its smoke will go up forever.
        From generation to generation, it will lie waste.
        No one will pass through it forever and ever.
034:011 But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.
        The owl and the raven will dwell in it.  He will stretch
        the line of confusion over it, and the plumb line of emptiness.
034:012 They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;
        and all its princes shall be nothing.
034:013 Thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles
        in its fortresses; and it will be a habitation of jackals,
        a court for ostriches.
034:014 The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,
        and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.  Yes, the night
        creature{literally, lilith, which could also be a night demon
        or night monster} shall settle there, and shall find herself
        a place of rest.
034:015 The arrow snake will make her nest there, and lay, hatch, and gather
        under her shade.  Yes, the kites will be gathered there,
        every one with her mate.
034:016 Search in the book of Yahweh, and read:  not one of these will
        be missing.  none will lack her mate.  For my mouth has commanded,
        and his Spirit has gathered them.
034:017 He has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it
        to them with a measuring line.  They shall possess it forever.
        From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
035:001 The wilderness and the dry land will be glad.  The desert
        will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
035:002 It will blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing.
        Lebanon's glory Lebanon will be given to it, the excellence
        of Carmel and Sharon.  They will see Yahweh's glory,
        the excellence of our God.
035:003 Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
035:004 Tell those who have a fearful heart, "Be strong.  Don't be afraid.
        Behold, your God will come with vengeance, God's retribution.
        He will come and save you.
035:005 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears
        of the deaf will be unstopped.
035:006 Then the lame man will leap like a deer, and the tongue of
        the mute will sing; for waters will break out in the wilderness,
        and streams in the desert.
035:007 The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground
        springs of water.  Grass with reeds and rushes will be in
        the habitation of jackals, where they lay.
035:008 A highway will be there, a road, and it will be called The Holy Way.
        The unclean shall not pass over it, but it will be for those
        who walk in the Way.  Wicked fools will not go there.
035:009 No lion will be there, nor will any ravenous animal go up on it.
        They will not be found there; but the redeemed will walk there.
035:010 The Yahweh's ransomed ones will return, and come with singing
        to Zion; and everlasting joy will be on their heads.
        They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing
        will flee away."
036:001 Now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
        that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified
        cities of Judah, and captured them.
036:002 The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
        to king Hezekiah with a large army.  He stood by the aqueduct
        from the upper pool in the fuller's field highway.
036:003 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
        and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder
        came out to him.
036:004 Rabshakeh said to them, "Now tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says
        the great king, the king of Assyria, "What confidence is this
        in which you trust?
036:005 I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words.
        Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?
036:006 Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt,
        which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it.
        So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
036:007 But if you tell me, 'We trust in Yahweh our God,' isn't that
        he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away,
        and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship
        before this altar?'"
036:008 Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king
        of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you
        are able on your part to set riders on them.
036:009 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least
        of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots
        and for horsemen?
036:010 Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it?
        Yahweh said to me, "Go up against this land, and destroy it."'"
036:011 Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak
        to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it;
        and don't speak to us in the Jews' language in the hearing
        of the people who are on the wall."
036:012 But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master
        and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit
        on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own
        urine with you?"
036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in
        the Jews' language, and said, "Hear the words of the great king,
        the king of Assyria!
036:014 Thus says the king, 'Don't let Hezekiah deceive you;
        for he will not be able to deliver you.
036:015 Don't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, "Yahweh will
        surely deliver us.  This city won't be given into the hand
        of the king of Assyria."'
036:016 Don't listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king
        of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me;
        and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree,
        and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;
036:017 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
        a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, "Yahweh will deliver us."
        Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands
        from the hand of the king of Assyria?
036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?  Where are the gods
        of Sepharvaim?  Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have
        delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should
        deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
036:021 But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply,
        for the king's commandment was, "Don't answer him."
036:022 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
        and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder,
        came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him
        the words of Rabshakeh.
037:001 It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes,
        covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh's house.
037:002 He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
        and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth,
        to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
037:003 They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of trouble,
        and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come
        to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.
037:004 It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
        whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God,
        and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard.
        Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
037:006 Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Don't be
        afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants
        of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
037:007 Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news,
        and will return to his own land.  I will cause him to fall
        by the sword in his own land."'"
037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
037:009 He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, "He has
        come out to fight against you."  When he heard it, he sent
        messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
037:010 "Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, 'Don't let
        your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, "Jerusalem won't
        be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
037:011 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria
        have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly.
        Shall you be delivered?
037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers
        have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden
        who were in Telassar?
037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king
        of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'"
037:014 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers
        and read it.  Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh's house,
        and spread it before Yahweh.
037:015 Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,
037:016 "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among
        the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms
        of the earth.  You have made heaven and earth.
037:017 Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear.  Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold.
        Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy
        the living God.
037:018 Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all
        the countries and their land,
037:019 and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they
        have destroyed them.
037:020 Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand,
        that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh,
        even you only."
037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus
        says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed
        to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
037:022 this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him.
        The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you.
        The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
037:023 Whom have you defied and blasphemed?  Against whom have
        you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high?
        Against the Holy One of Israel.
037:024 By your servants, have you defied the Lord, and have said,
        "With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height
        of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon.
        I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice fir trees.
        I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of
        its fruitful field.
037:025 I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I
        will dry up all the rivers of Egypt."
037:026 Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it
        in ancient times?  Now I have brought it to pass, that it
        should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them
        into ruinous heaps.
037:027 Therefore their inhabitants had little power.  They were dismayed
        and confounded.  They were like the grass of the field,
        and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops,
        and like a field before its crop has grown.
037:028 But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in,
        and your raging against me.
037:029 Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance
        has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook
        in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you
        back by the way by which you came.
037:030 This shall be the sign to you.  You will eat this year that
        which grows of itself, and in the second year that which
        springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap
        and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
037:031 The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again
        take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
037:032 For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth, and survivors
        will escape from Mount Zion.  The zeal of Yahweh of Armies
        will perform this.'
037:033 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will
        not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will
        he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
037:034 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return,
        and he shall not come to this city,' says Yahweh.
037:035 'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake,
        and for my servant David's sake.'"
037:036 The angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and
        eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians.
        When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were
        all dead bodies.
037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away,
        returned to Nineveh, and stayed there.
037:038 It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch
        his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him
        with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
        Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick and near death.
        Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him,
        "Thus says Yahweh, 'Set your house in order, for you will die,
        and not live.'"
038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,
038:003 and said, "Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked
        before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done
        that which is good in your sight."  Hezekiah wept bitterly.
038:004 Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying,
038:005 "Go, and tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David
        your father, "I have heard your prayer.  I have seen your tears.
        Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
038:006 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king
        of Assyria, and I will defend this city.
038:007 This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will
        do this thing that he has spoken.
038:008 Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down
        on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.
        So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it
        had gone down."'"
038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
        and had recovered of his sickness.
038:010 I said, "In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.
        I am deprived of the residue of my years."
038:011 I said, "I won't see Yah, Yah in the land of the living.
        I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
038:012 My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me like a
        shepherd's tent.  I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life.
        He will cut me off from the loom.  From day even to night
        you will make an end of me.
038:013 I waited patiently until morning.  He breaks all my bones like
        a lion.  From day even to night you will make an end of me.
038:014 I chattered like a swallow or a crane.  I moaned like a dove.
        My eyes weaken looking upward.  Lord, I am oppressed.
        Be my security."
038:015 What will I say?  He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.
        I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish
        of my soul.
038:016 Lord, men live by these things; and my spirit finds life
        in all of them:  you restore me, and cause me to live.
038:017 Behold, for peace I had great anguish, but you have in love
        for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;
        for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
038:018 For Sheol can't praise you.  Death can't celebrate you.
        Those who go down into the pit can't hope for your truth.
038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day.
        The father shall make known your truth to the children.
038:020 Yahweh will save me.  Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed
        instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh.
038:021 Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs, and lay
        it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover."
038:022 Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I will go up
        to the house of Yahweh?"
039:001 At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan,
        king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah;
        for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
039:002 Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house
        of his precious things, the silver, and the gold,
        the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house
        of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures.
        There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion,
        that Hezekiah didn't show them.
039:003 Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him,
        "What did these men say?  Where did they come from to you?"
        Hezekiah said, "They have come from a country far from me,
        even from Babylon."
039:004 Then he asked, "What have they seen in your house?"
        Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house.
        There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."
039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:
039:006 'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house,
        and that which your fathers have stored up until this day,
        will be carried to Babylon.  Nothing will be left,' says Yahweh.
039:007 'They will take away your sons who will issue from you,
        whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king
        of Babylon's palace.'"
039:008 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "Yahweh's word which you have
        spoken is good."  He said moreover, "For there will be peace
        and truth in my days."
040:001 "Comfort, comfort my people," says your God.
040:002 "Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her
        warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned,
        that she has received of Yahweh's hand double for all her sins."
040:003 The voice of one who calls out, "Prepare the way of Yahweh
        in the wilderness!  Make a level highway in the desert
        for our God.
040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
        be made low.  The uneven shall be made level, and the rough
        places a plain.
040:005 The glory of Yahweh shall be revealed, and all flesh shall
        see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
040:006 The voice of one saying, "Cry!"  One said, "What shall I cry?"
        "All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower
        of the field.
040:007 The grass withers, the flower fades, because Yahweh's breath
        blows on it.  Surely the people are like grass.
040:008 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our
        God stands forever."
040:009 You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain.
        You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your
        voice with strength.  Lift it up.  Don't be afraid.
        Say to the cities of Judah, "Behold, your God!"
040:010 Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one, and his
        arm will rule for him.  Behold, his reward is with him,
        and his recompense before him.
040:011 He will feed his flock like a shepherd.  He will gather
        the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom.
        He will gently lead those who have their young.
040:012 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
        and marked off the sky with his span, and calculated the dust
        of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
        and the hills in a balance?
040:013 Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh, or has taught him
        as his counselor?
040:014 Who did he take counsel with, and who instructed him,
        and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge,
        and showed him the way of understanding?
040:015 Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are
        regarded as a speck of dust on a balance.  Behold, he lifts
        up the islands like a very little thing.
040:016 Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its animals sufficient
        for a burnt offering.
040:017 All the nations are like nothing before him.  They are regarded
        by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
040:018 To whom then will you liken God?  Or what likeness will you
        compare to him?
040:019 A workman has cast an image, and the goldsmith overlays it
        with gold, and casts silver chains for it.
040:020 He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree
        that will not rot.  He seeks a skillful workman to set up
        an engraved image for him that will not be moved.
040:021 Haven't you known?  Haven't you heard, yet?  Haven't you
        been told from the beginning?  Haven't you understood from
        the foundations of the earth?
040:022 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its
        inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens
        like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;
040:023 who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the
        earth like meaningless.
040:024 They are planted scarcely.  They are sown scarcely.
        Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground.
        He merely blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind
        takes them away as stubble.
040:025 "To whom then will you liken me?  Who is my equal?"
        says the Holy One.
040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these,
        who brings out their army by number.  He calls them all by name.
        by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power,
        Not one is lacking.
040:027 Why do you say, Jacob, and speak, Israel, "My way is hidden
        from Yahweh, and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?"
040:028 Haven't you known?  Haven't you heard?  The everlasting
        God, Yahweh, The Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn't faint.
        He isn't weary.  His understanding is unsearchable.
040:029 He gives power to the weak.  He increases the strength of him
        who has no might.
040:030 Even the youths faint and get weary, and the young men utterly fall;
040:031 But those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength.
        They will mount up with wings like eagles.  They will run,
        and not be weary.  They will walk, and not faint.
041:001 "Keep silent before me, islands, and let the peoples renew
        their strength.  Let them come near, then let them speak.
        Let's meet together for judgment.
041:002 Who has raised up one from the east?  Whom called him to his foot
        in righteousness?  He hands over nations to him, and makes him
        rule over kings.  He gives them like the dust to his sword,
        like the driven stubble to his bow.
041:003 He pursues them, and passes by safely, Even by a way that he had
        not gone with his feet.
041:004 Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from
        the beginning?  I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last,
        I am he."
041:005 The islands have seen, and fear.  The ends of the earth tremble.
        They approach, and come.
041:006 Everyone helps his neighbor.  They say to their brothers,
        "Be strong!"
041:007 So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.  He who smoothes
        with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,
        saying of the soldering, "It is good;" and he fastens it
        with nails, that it might not totter.
041:008 "But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
        the seed of Abraham my friend,
041:009 You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,
        and called from its corners, and said to you, 'You are my servant,
        I have chosen you and not cast you away;'
041:010 Don't you be afraid, for I am with you.  Don't be dismayed,
        for I am your God.  I will strengthen you.  Yes, I will help you.
        Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.
041:011 Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed
        and confounded.  Those who strive with you will be like nothing,
        and shall perish.
041:012 You will seek them, and won't find them, even those who contend
        with you.  Those who war against you will be as nothing,
        as a non-existent thing.
041:013 For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you,
        'Don't be afraid.  I will help you.'
041:014 Don't be afraid, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel.
        I will help you," says Yahweh, "and your Redeemer is
        the Holy One of Israel.
041:015 Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument
        with teeth.  You will thresh the mountains, and beat them small,
        and will make the hills like chaff.
041:016 You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,
        and the whirlwind will scatter them.  You will rejoice in Yahweh.
        You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
041:017 The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.
        Their tongue fails for thirst.  I, Yahweh, will answer them.
        I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
041:018 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and springs in the midst
        of the valleys.  I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
        and the dry land springs of water.
041:019 I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.
        I will set fir trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;
041:020 that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,
        that the hand of Yahweh has done this, and the Holy One
        of Israel has created it.
041:021 Produce your cause," says Yahweh.  "Bring forth your strong reasons,"
        says the King of Jacob.
041:022 "Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen.
        Declare the former things, what they are, that we may consider them,
        and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.
041:023 Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we
        may know that you are gods.  Yes, do good, or do evil,
        that we may be dismayed, and see it together.
041:024 Behold, you are of nothing, and your work is of nothing.
        He who chooses you is an abomination.
041:025 "I have raised up one from the north, and he has come;
        from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name; and he shall
        come on rulers as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
041:026 Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?
        And before, that we may say, 'He is right?'  Surely, there is
        no one who declares.  Surely, there is no one who shows.
        Surely, there is no one who hears your words.
041:027 I am the first to say to Zion, 'Behold, look at them;'
        and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.
041:028 When I look, there is no man; even among them there is no
        counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
041:029 Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing.
        Their molten images are wind and confusion.
042:001 "Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen,
        in whom my soul delights--I have put my Spirit on him.
        He will bring justice to the nations.
042:002 He will not shout, nor raise his voice, nor cause it to be heard
        in the street.
042:003 He won't break a bruised reed.  He won't quench a dimly burning wick.
        He will faithfully bring justice.
042:004 He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he has set justice
        in the earth, and the islands will wait for his law."
042:005 Thus says God Yahweh, he who created the heavens and stretched
        them out, he who spread out the earth and that which comes
        out of it, he who gives breath to its people and spirit
        to those who walk in it.
042:006 "I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand,
        and will keep you, and make you a covenant for the people,
        as a light for the nations;
042:007 to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon,
        and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
042:008 "I am Yahweh.  That is my name.  I will not give my glory
        to another, nor my praise to engraved images.
042:009 Behold, the former things have happened, and I declare new things.
        I tell you about them before they come up."
042:010 Sing to Yahweh a new song, and his praise from the end of
        the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein,
        the islands and their inhabitants.
042:011 Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices, with the
        villages that Kedar inhabits.  Let the inhabitants of Sela sing.
        Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
042:012 Let them give glory to Yahweh, and declare his praise
        in the islands.
042:013 Yahweh will go out like a mighty man.  He will stir up zeal like a
        man of war.  He will raise a war cry.  Yes, he will shout aloud.
        He will triumph over his enemies.
042:014 "I have been silent a long time.  I have been quiet and
        restrained myself.  Now I will cry out like a travailing woman.
        I will both gasp and pant.
042:015 I will destroy mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs.
        I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
042:016 I will bring the blind by a way that they don't know.
        I will lead them in paths that they don't know.  I will make
        darkness light before them, and crooked places straight.
        I will do these things, and I will not forsake them.
042:017 "Those who trust in engraved images, who tell molten images,
        'You are our gods' will be turned back.  They will
        be utterly disappointed.
042:018 "Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see.
042:019 Who is blind, but my servant?  Or who is as deaf as my
        messenger whom I send?  Who is as blind as he who is at peace,
        and as blind as Yahweh's servant?
042:020 You see many things, but don't observe.  His ears are open,
        but he doesn't listen.
042:021 It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify
        the law, and make it honorable.
042:022 But this is a robbed and plundered people.  All of them
        are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prisons.
        They have become a prey, and no one delivers; and a spoil,
        and no one says, 'Restore them!'
042:023 Who is there among you who will give ear to this?
        Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
042:024 Who gave Jacob as plunder, and Israel to the robbers?
        Didn't Yahweh, he against whom we have sinned?  For they
        would not walk in his ways, and they disobeyed his law.
042:025 Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,
        and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire all around,
        but he didn't know; and it burned him, but he didn't take
        it to heart."
043:001 But now thus says Yahweh who created you, Jacob, and he who
        formed you, Israel:  "Don't be afraid, for I have redeemed you.
        I have called you by your name.  You are mine.
043:002 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
        and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
        When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,
        and flame will not scorch you.
043:003 For I am Yahweh your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
        I have given Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba
        in your place.
043:004 Since you have been precious and honored in my sight, and I
        have loved you; therefore I will give people in your place,
        and nations instead of your life.
043:005 Don't be afraid; for I am with you.  I will bring your seed
        from the east, and gather you from the west.
043:006 I will tell the north, 'Give them up!' and tell the south,
        'Don't hold them back!  Bring my sons from far, and my daughters
        from the ends of the earth--
043:007 everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created
        for my glory, whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made.'"
043:008 Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf
        who have ears.
043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples
        be assembled.  Who among them can declare this, and show us
        former things?  Let them bring their witnesses, that they
        may be justified; or let them hear, and say, "That is true."
043:010 "You are my witnesses," says Yahweh, "With my servant
        whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe me,
        and understand that I am he.  Before me there was no God formed,
        neither will there be after me.
043:011 I myself am Yahweh; and besides me there is no savior.
043:012 I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown; and there was
        no strange god among you.  Therefore you are my witnesses,"
        says Yahweh, "and I am God.
043:013 Yes, since the day was I am he; and there is no one who can
        deliver out of my hand.  I will work, and who can hinder it?"
043:014 Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
        "For your sake, I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring all
        of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships
        of their rejoicing.
043:015 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King."
043:016 Thus says Yahweh, who makes a way in the sea, and a path
        in the mighty waters;
043:017 who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man
        (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct,
        they are quenched like a wick):
043:018 "Don't remember the former things, and don't consider
        the things of old.
043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing.  It springs forth now.
        Don't you know it?  I will even make a way in the wilderness,
        and rivers in the desert.
043:020 The animals of the field shall honor me, the jackals and
        the ostriches; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers
        in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
043:021 the people which I formed for myself, that they might set
        forth my praise.
043:022 Yet you have not called on me, Jacob; but you have been weary
        of me, Israel.
043:023 You have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings;
        neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.
        I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied
        you with frankincense.
043:024 You have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled
        me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened me
        with your sins.  You have wearied me with your iniquities.
043:025 I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;
        and I will not remember your sins.
043:026 Put me in remembrance.  Let us plead together.  Set forth
        your case, that you may be justified.
043:027 Your first father sinned, and your teachers have transgressed
        against me.
043:028 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;
        and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling."
044:001 Yet listen now, Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen.
044:002 This is what Yahweh who made you, and formed you from the womb,
        who will help you says:  "Don't be afraid, Jacob my servant;
        and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
044:003 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams
        on the dry ground.  I will pour my Spirit on your seed,
        and my blessing on your offspring:
044:004 and they will spring up among the grass, as willows
        by the watercourses.
044:005 One will say, 'I am Yahweh's;' and another will be called by the name
        of Jacob; and another will write with his hand 'to Yahweh,'
        and honor the name of Israel."
044:006 This is what Yahweh, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Yahweh
        of Armies, says:  "I am the first, and I am the last;
        and besides me there is no God.
044:007 Who is like me?  Who will call, and will declare it, and set
        it in order for me, since I established the ancient people?
        Let them declare the things that are coming, and that will happen.
044:008 Don't fear, neither be afraid.  Haven't I declared it
        to you long ago, and shown it?  You are my witnesses.
        Is there a God besides me?  Indeed, there is not.
        I don't know any other Rock."
044:009 Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain.  The things that they
        delight in will not profit.  Their own witnesses don't see,
        nor know, that they may be disappointed.
044:010 Who has fashioned a god, or molds an image that is
        profitable for nothing?
044:011 Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed; and the workmen are
        mere men.  Let them all be gathered together.  Let them stand up.
        They will fear.  They will be put to shame together.
044:012 The blacksmith takes an axe, works in the coals,
        fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm.
        He is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water,
        and is faint.
044:013 The carpenter stretches out a line.  He marks it out with a pencil.
        He shapes it with planes.  He marks it out with compasses,
        and shapes it like the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man,
        to reside in a house.
044:014 He cuts down cedars for himself, and takes the cypress and the oak,
        and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest.
        He plants a fir tree, and the rain nourishes it.
044:015 Then it will be for a man to burn; and he takes some of it,
        and warms himself.  Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread.
        Yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it an engraved image,
        and falls down to it.
044:016 He burns part of it in the fire.  With part of it, he eats meat.
        He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.  Yes, he warms himself,
        and says, "Aha!  I am warm.  I have seen the fire."
044:017 The rest of it he makes into a god, even his engraved image.
        He bows down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says,
        "Deliver me; for you are my god!"
044:018 They don't know, neither do they consider:  for he has
        shut their eyes, that they can't see; and their hearts,
        that they can't understand.
044:019 No one thinks, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,
        "I have burned part of it in the fire.  Yes, I have also baked
        bread on its coals.  I have roasted meat and eaten it.
        Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?
        Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?"
044:020 He feeds on ashes.  A deceived heart has turned him aside;
        and he can't deliver his soul, nor say, "Isn't there a lie
        in my right hand?"
044:021 Remember these things, Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant.
        I have formed you.  You are my servant.  Israel, you will
        not be forgotten by me.
044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and,
        as a cloud, your sins.  Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
044:023 Sing, you heavens, for Yahweh has done it!  Shout, you lower
        parts of the earth!  Break out into singing, you mountains,
        O forest, all of your trees, for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob,
        and will glorify himself in Israel.
044:024 Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, and he who formed you from the womb:
        "I am Yahweh, who makes all things; who alone stretches out
        the heavens; who spreads out the earth by myself;
044:025 who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad;
        who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;
044:026 who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel
        of his messengers; who says of Jerusalem, 'She will be inhabited;'
        and of the cities of Judah, 'They will be built,' and I
        will raise up its waste places;'
044:027 who says to the deep, 'Be dry,' and 'I will dry up your rivers;'
044:028 Who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
        my pleasure,' even saying of Jerusalem, 'She will be built;'
        and of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"
045:001 Thus says Yahweh to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand
        I have held, to subdue nations before him, and strip kings
        of their armor; to open the doors before him, and the gates
        shall not be shut:
045:002 "I will go before you, and make the rough places smooth.
        I will break the doors of brass in pieces, and cut apart
        the bars of iron.
045:003 I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches
        of secret places, that you may know that it is I, Yahweh,
        who call you by your name, even the God of Israel.
045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my chosen, I have
        called you by your name.  I have surnamed you, though you
        have not known me.
045:005 I am Yahweh, and there is none else.  Besides me, there is no God.
        I will strengthen{or, equip} you, though you have not known me;
045:006 that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west,
        that there is none besides me.  I am Yahweh, and there is
        no one else.
045:007 I form the light, and create darkness.  I make peace,
        and create calamity.  I am Yahweh, who does all these things.
045:008 Distil, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour
        down righteousness.  Let the earth open, that it may bring
        forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up
        with it.  I, Yahweh, have created it.
045:009 Woe to him who strives with his Maker--a clay pot among the clay
        pots of the earth!  Shall the clay ask him who fashions it,
        'What are you making?' or your work, 'He has no hands?'
045:010 Woe to him who says to a father, 'What have you become the father of?'
        or to a mother, 'To what have you given birth?'"
045:011 Thus says Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:  "You ask
        me about the things that are to come, concerning my sons,
        and you command me concerning the work of my hands!
045:012 I have made the earth, and created man on it:  I, even my hands,
        have stretched out the heavens; and all their army
        have I commanded.
045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight
        all his ways:  he shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles
        go free, not for price nor reward, says Yahweh of Armies.
045:014 Thus says Yahweh:  "The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise
        of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
        to you, and they shall be yours.  They shall go after you.
        In chains they shall come over; and they shall fall down to you.
        They shall make supplication to you:  'Surely God is in you;
        and there is none else, there is no other god.
045:015 Most certainly you are a God who hid yourself, God of Israel,
        the Savior.'"
045:016 They shall be disappointed, yes, confounded, all of them;
        they shall go into confusion together who are makers of idols.
045:017 [But] Israel shall be saved by Yahweh with an everlasting salvation:
        you shall not be disappointed nor confounded world without end.
045:018 For thus says Yahweh who created the heavens, the God
        who formed the earth and made it, who established it and
        didn't create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited:
        I am Yahweh; and there is no one else.
045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness;
        I didn't say to the seed of Jacob, Seek you me in vain:
        I, Yahweh, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you who
        have escaped from the nations:  they have no knowledge
        who carry the wood of their engraved image, and pray to a god
        that can't save.
045:021 Declare you, and bring [it] forth; yes, let them take
        counsel together:  who has shown this from ancient time?
        who has declared it of old?  Haven't I, Yahweh? and there
        is no God else besides me, a just God and a Savior;
        there is no one besides me.
045:022 Look to me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth;
        for I am God, and there is none else.
045:023 By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth
        [in] righteousness, and shall not return, that to me every
        knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
045:024 Only in Yahweh, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength;
        even to him shall men come; and all those who were incensed
        against him shall be disappointed.
045:025 In Yahweh shall all the seed of Israel be justified,
        and shall glory.
046:001 Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the animals,
        and on the livestock:  the things that you carried about are
        made a load, a burden to the weary [animal].
046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver
        the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
046:003 Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house
        of Israel, that have been borne [by me] from their birth,
        that have been carried from the womb;
046:004 and even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs will I
        carry you.  I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry,
        and will deliver.
046:005 To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
        that we may be like?
046:006 Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance.
        They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god.
        They fall down--yes, they worship.
046:007 They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in
        its place, and it stands, from its place it shall not move:
        yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer, nor save him
        out of his trouble.
046:008 Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again
        to mind, you transgressors.
046:009 Remember the former things of old:  for I am God, and there
        is none else; [I am] God, and there is none like me;
046:010 declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
        things that are not [yet] done; saying, My counsel shall stand,
        and I will do all my pleasure;
046:011 calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from
        a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass;
        I have purposed, I will also do it.
046:012 Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:
046:013 I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off,
        and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation
        in Zion for Israel my glory.
047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon;
        sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans:
        for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil,
        strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.
047:003 Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen:
        I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.
047:004 Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
047:005 Sit you silent, and get you into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans;
        for you shall no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.
047:006 I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance,
        and gave them into your hand:  you did show them no mercy;
        on the aged have you very heavily laid your yoke.
047:007 You said, I shall be mistress forever; so that you did not lay
        these things to your heart, neither did remember the latter
        end of it.
047:008 Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures,
        who sit securely, who say in your heart, I am, and there
        is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow,
        neither shall I know the loss of children:
047:009 but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day,
        the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure
        shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries,
        and the great abundance of your enchantments.
047:010 For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, None sees me;
        your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you,
        and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is none
        else besides me.
047:011 Therefore shall evil come on you; you shall not know the dawning
        of it:  and mischief shall fall on you; you shall not be able
        to put it away:  and desolation shall come on you suddenly,
        which you don't know.
047:012 Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude
        of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth;
        if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.
047:013 You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels:  let now
        the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
        stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you.
047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
        they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
        it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.
047:015 Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored:
        those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander
        everyone to his quarter; there shall be none to save you.
048:001 Hear you this, house of Jacob, who are called by the name
        of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah;
        who swear by the name of Yahweh, and make mention of the God
        of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness
048:002 (for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
        on the God of Israel; Yahweh of Armies is his name):
048:003 I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went
        forth out of my mouth, and I shown them:  suddenly I did them,
        and they happened.
048:004 Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an
        iron sinew, and your brow brass;
048:005 therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it
        came to pass I shown it you; lest you should say, My idol
        has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten image,
        has commanded them.
048:006 You have heard it; see all this; and you, will you not declare it?
        I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things,
        which you have not known.
048:007 They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day
        you didn't hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.
048:008 Yes, you didn't hear; yes, you didn't know; yes, from of old
        your ear was not opened:  for I knew that you did deal
        very treacherously, and was called a transgressor from the womb.
048:009 For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise
        will I refrain for you, that I not cut you off.
048:010 Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen
        you in the furnace of affliction.
048:011 For my own sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should [my
        name] be profaned? and my glory I will not give to another.
048:012 Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called:  I am he;
        I am the first, I also am the last.
048:013 Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my
        right hand has spread out the heavens:  when I call to them,
        they stand up together.
048:014 Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has
        declared these things?  He whom Yahweh loves shall perform his
        pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.
048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him,
        and he shall make his way prosperous.
048:016 Come you near to me, hear you this; from the beginning I have
        not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I:
        and now the Lord Yahweh has sent me, and his Spirit.
048:017 Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:  I am
        Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you
        by the way that you should go.
048:018 Oh that you had listened to my commandments! then had your
        peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves
        of the sea:
048:019 your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your
        body like the grains of it:  his name would not be cut off
        nor destroyed from before me.
048:020 Go you forth from Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans;
        with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it
        even to the end of the earth:  say you, Yahweh has redeemed
        his servant Jacob.
048:021 They didn't thirst when he led them through the deserts;
        he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them;
        he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
048:022 There is no peace, says Yahweh, to the wicked.
049:001 Listen, islands, to me; and listen, you peoples, from far:
        Yahweh has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
        mother has he made mention of my name:
049:002 and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow
        of his hand has he hid me:  and he has made me a polished shaft;
        in his quiver has he kept me close:
049:003 and he said to me, You are my servant; Israel, in whom I
        will be glorified.
049:004 But I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength
        for nothing and vanity; yet surely the justice [due] to me
        is with Yahweh, and my recompense with my God.
049:005 Now says Yahweh who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
        to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered to him
        (for I am honorable in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God is
        become my strength);
049:006 yes, he says, It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
        to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved
        of Israel:  I will also give you for a light to the nations,
        that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.
049:007 Thus says Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, [and] his Holy One,
        to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors,
        to a servant of rulers:  Kings shall see and arise; princes,
        and they shall worship; because of Yahweh who is faithful,
        [even] the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.
049:008 Thus says Yahweh, In an acceptable time have I answered you,
        and in a day of salvation have I helped you; and I will preserve you,
        and give you for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land,
        to make them inherit the desolate heritage:
049:009 saying to those who are bound, Go forth; to those who are
        in darkness, Show yourselves.  They shall feed in the ways,
        and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.
049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
        sun strike them:  for he who has mercy on them will lead them,
        even by springs of water he will guide them.
049:011 I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways
        shall be exalted.
049:012 Behold, these shall come from far; and behold, these from
        the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
049:013 Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break forth
        into singing, mountains:  for Yahweh has comforted his people,
        and will have compassion on his afflicted.
049:014 But Zion said, Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord
        has forgotten me.
049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
        compassion on the son of her womb? yes, these may forget,
        yet I will not forget you.
049:016 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
        your walls are continually before me.
049:017 Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made
        you waste shall go forth from you.
049:018 Lift up your eyes round about, and see:  all these gather
        themselves together, and come to you.  As I live, says Yahweh,
        you shall surely clothe you with them all as with an ornament,
        and gird yourself with them, like a bride.
049:019 For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land
        that has been destroyed, surely now shall you be too small
        for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up shall
        be far away.
049:020 The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears,
        The place is too small for me; give place to me that I may dwell.
049:021 Then shall you say in your heart, Who has conceived these for me,
        seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary,
        an exile, and wandering back and forth? and who has brought
        up these?  Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?
049:022 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will lift up my hand
        to the nations, and set up my banner to the peoples;
        and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your
        daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
049:023 Kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens
        your nursing mothers:  they shall bow down to you with
        their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me
        shall not be disappointed.
049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
        captives be delivered?
049:025 But thus says Yahweh, Even the captives of the mighty shall
        be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered;
        for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I
        will save your children.
049:026 I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they
        shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine:
        and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior,
        and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
050:001 Thus says Yahweh, Where is the bill of your mother's divorce,
        with which I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it
        to whom I have sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities were you sold,
        and for your transgressions was your mother put away.
050:002 Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there
        none to answer?  Is my hand shortened at all, that it can't
        redeem? or have I no power to deliver?  Behold, at my
        rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness:
        their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.
050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
        their covering.
050:004 The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught,
        that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary:
        he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear
        as those who are taught.
050:005 The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious,
        neither turned away backward.
050:006 I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked
        off the hair; I didn't hide my face from shame and spitting.
050:007 For the Lord Yahweh will help me; therefore I have not
        been confounded:  therefore have I set my face like a flint,
        and I know that I shall not be disappointed.
050:008 He is near who justifies me; who will bring charges against me?
        Let us stand up together:  who is my adversary?
        Let him come near to me.
050:009 Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help me; who is he who shall
        condemn me?  Behold, all they shall wax old as a garment,
        the moth shall eat them up.
050:010 Who is among you who fears Yahweh, who obeys the voice
        of his servant?  He who walks in darkness, and has no light,
        let him trust in the name of Yahweh, and rely on his God.
050:011 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who gird yourselves
        about with firebrands; walk you in the flame of your fire,
        and among the brands that you have kindled.  This shall you
        have of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
051:001 Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,
        you who seek Yahweh:  look to the rock whence you were hewn,
        and to the hold of the pit whence you were dug.
051:002 Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you;
        for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him,
        and made him many.
051:003 For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he has comforted all her
        waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden,
        and her desert like the garden of Yahweh; joy and gladness
        shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
051:004 Attend to me, my people; and give ear to me, my nation:
        for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my
        justice for a light of the peoples.
051:005 My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and my
        arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for me,
        and on my arm shall they trust.
051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath;
        for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth
        shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell therein
        shall die in like manner:  but my salvation shall be forever,
        and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
051:007 Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose
        heart is my law; don't you fear the reproach of men,
        neither be you dismayed at their insults.
051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall
        eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be forever,
        and my salvation to all generations.
051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Yahweh; awake, as in
        the days of old, the generations of ancient times.
        Isn't it you who did cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the monster?
051:010 Isn't it you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep;
        who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed
        to pass over?
051:011 The ransomed of Yahweh shall return, and come with singing
        to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads:
        they shall obtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and sighing
        shall flee away.
051:012 I, even I, am he who comforts you:  who are you, that you are
        afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall
        be made as grass;
051:013 and have forgotten Yahweh your Maker, who stretched forth
        the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fear
        continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor,
        when he makes ready to destroy? and where is the fury
        of the oppressor?
051:014 The captive exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die
        [and go down] into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.
051:015 For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves
        of it roar:  Yahweh of Armies is his name.
051:016 I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in
        the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay
        the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion, You are my people.
051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand
        of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; you have drunken the bowl
        of the cup of staggering, and drained it.
051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has
        brought forth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand
        among all the sons who she has brought up.
051:019 These two things have happened to you.  Who will bemoan you?
        Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword;
        how shall I comfort you?
051:020 Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets,
        as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Yahweh,
        the rebuke of your God.
051:021 Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken,
        but now with wine:
051:022 Thus says your Lord Yahweh, and your God who pleads the cause
        of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup
        of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath;
        you shall no more drink it again:
051:023 and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,
        who have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over;
        and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street,
        to those who go over.
052:001 Awake, awake, put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful
        garments, Jerusalem, the holy city:  for henceforth there shall
        no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.
052:002 Shake yourself from the dust; arise, sit [on your throne], Jerusalem:
        loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter
        of Zion.
052:003 For thus says Yahweh, You were sold for nothing; and you shall
        be redeemed without money.
052:004 For thus says the Lord Yahweh, My people went down at the first
        into Egypt to sojourn there:  and the Assyrian has oppressed
        them without cause.
052:005 Now therefore, what do I here, says Yahweh, seeing that my people
        is taken away for nothing? those who rule over them do howl,
        says Yahweh, and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.
052:006 Therefore my people shall know my name:  therefore [they shall
        know] in that day that I am he who does speak; behold, it is I.
052:007 How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings
        good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good,
        who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns!
052:008 The voice of your watchmen! they lift up the voice,
        together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye,
        when Yahweh returns to Zion.
052:009 Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem;
        for Yahweh has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
052:010 Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
        and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation
        of our God.
052:011 Depart you, depart you, go you out from there, touch no unclean thing;
        go you out of the midst of her; cleanse yourselves,
        you who bear the vessels of Yahweh.
052:012 For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight:
        for Yahweh will go before you; and the God of Israel will
        be your rearward.
052:013 Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted
        and lifted up, and shall be very high.
052:014 Like as many were astonished at you (his visage was so marred
        more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),
052:015 so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths
        at him:  for that which had not been told them shall they see;
        and that which they had not heard shall they understand.
053:001 Who has believed our message?  To whom has the arm of
        Yahweh been revealed?
053:002 For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root
        out of dry ground.  He has no form nor comeliness.
        When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
053:003 He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of suffering,
        and acquainted with disease.  He was despised as one from whom
        men hide their face; and we didn't respect him.
053:004 Surely he has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering;
        yet we considered him plagued, struck by God, and afflicted.
053:005 But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed
        for our iniquities.  The punishment that brought our peace
        was on him; and by his wounds we are healed.
053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray.  Everyone has turned to his
        own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
053:007 He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth.
        As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that
        before its shearers is mute, so he didn't open his mouth.
053:008 He was taken away by oppression and judgment; and as for
        his generation, who considered that he was cut off out
        of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience
        of my people?
053:009 They made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man
        in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was
        any deceit in his mouth.
053:010 Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.  He has caused him to suffer.
        When you make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed.
        He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Yahweh shall
        prosper in his hand.
053:011 After the suffering of his soul, he will see the
        light{So read the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint.
        Masoretic Text omits "the light".} and be satisfied.
        My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;
        and he will bear their iniquities.
053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,
        and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured
        out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;
        yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession
        for the transgressors.
054:001 Sing, barren, you who didn't bear; break forth into singing,
        and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child:
        for more are the children of the desolate than the children
        of the married wife, says Yahweh.
054:002 Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch
        forth the curtains of your habitations; don't spare:
        lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.
054:003 For you shall spread aboard on the right hand and on the left;
        and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate
        cities to be inhabited.
054:004 Don't be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed:
        neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed:
        for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach
        of your widowhood shall you remember no more.
054:005 For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name:
        and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole
        earth shall he be called.
054:006 For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved
        in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,
        says your God.
054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies
        will I gather you.
054:008 In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment;
        but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you,
        says Yahweh your Redeemer.
054:009 For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn
        that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth,
        so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you,
        nor rebuke you.
054:010 For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed;
        but my loving kindness shall not depart from you,
        neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, says Yahweh
        who has mercy on you.
054:011 You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold,
        I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your
        foundations with sapphires.
054:012 I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of
        sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
054:013 All your children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall
        be the peace of your children.
054:014 In righteousness shall you be established:  you shall be far
        from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror,
        for it shall not come near you.
054:015 Behold, they may gather together, but not by me:  whoever shall
        gather together against you shall fall because of you.
054:016 Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals,
        and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created
        the waster to destroy.
054:017 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every
        tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn.
        This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh, and their
        righteousness which is of me, says Yahweh.
055:001 Ho, everyone who thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has
        no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk
        without money and without price.
055:002 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your
        labor for that which doesn't satisfy? listen diligently to me,
        and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight
        itself in fatness.
055:003 Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live:
        and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure
        mercies of David.
055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,
        a leader and commander to the peoples.
055:005 Behold, you shall call a nation that you don't know;
        and a nation that didn't know you shall run to you,
        because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel;
        for he has glorified you.
055:006 Seek you Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while
        he is near:
055:007 let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
        and let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him;
        and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
        my ways, says Yahweh.
055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
        higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
055:010 For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,
        and doesn't return there, but waters the earth, and makes it
        bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread
        to the eater;
055:011 so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth:
        it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish
        that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing I sent
        it to do.
055:012 For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:
        the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you
        into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall
        clap their hands.
055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree;
        and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:
        and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign
        that shall not be cut off.
056:001 Thus says Yahweh, Keep you justice, and do righteousness;
        for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness
        to be revealed.
056:002 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds
        it fast; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps
        his hand from doing any evil.
056:003 Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to Yahweh,
        speak, saying, Yahweh will surely separate me from his people;
        neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
056:004 For thus says Yahweh of the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
        and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:
056:005 To them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial
        and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give
        them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
056:006 Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister
        to him, and to love the name of Yahweh, to be his servants,
        everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds
        fast my covenant;
056:007 even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
        joyful in my house of prayer:  their burnt offerings and their
        sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall
        be called a house of prayer for all peoples.
056:008 The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet will
        I gather [others] to him, besides his own who are gathered.
056:009 All you animals of the field, come to devour, [yes], all you
        animals in the forest.
056:010 His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge;
        they are all mute dogs, they can't bark; dreaming, lying down,
        loving to slumber.
056:011 Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough;
        and these are shepherds who can't understand:
        they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain,
        from every quarter.
056:012 Come you, [say they], I will get wine, and we will fill
        ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day,
        [a day] great beyond measure.
057:001 The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful
        men are taken away, none considering that the righteous
        is taken away from the evil [to come].
057:002 He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks
        in his uprightness.
057:003 But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed
        of the adulterer and the prostitute.
057:004 Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you
        a wide mouth, and put out the tongue?  Aren't you children
        of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,
057:005 you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree;
        who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts
        of the rocks?
057:006 Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is your portion;
        they, they are your lot; even to them have you poured
        a drink offering, you have offered an offering.
        Shall I be appeased for these things?
057:007 On a high and lofty mountain have you set your bed;
        there also you went up to offer sacrifice.
057:008 Behind the doors and the posts have you set up your memorial:
        for you have uncovered [yourself] to another than me,
        and are gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you
        a covenant with them:  you loved their bed where you saw it.
057:009 You went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes,
        and did send your ambassadors far off, and did debase yourself
        even to Sheol.
057:010 You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn't say,
        It is in vain:  you found a reviving of your strength;
        therefore you weren't faint.
057:011 Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie,
        and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart?
        Haven't I held my peace even of long time, and you don't fear me?
057:012 I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works,
        they shall not profit you.
057:013 When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you;
        but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away:
        but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land,
        and shall inherit my holy mountain.
057:014 He will say, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up
        the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
057:015 For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,
        whose name is Holy:  I dwell in the high and holy place,
        with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,
        to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart
        of the contrite.
057:016 For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry;
        for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who
        I have made.
057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him;
        I hid [my face] and was angry; and he went on backsliding
        in the way of his heart.
057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him:  I will lead him also,
        and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
057:019 I create the fruit of the lips:  Peace, peace, to him who is far
        off and to him who is near, says Yahweh; and I will heal him.
057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can't rest,
        and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
057:021 There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.
058:001 Cry aloud, don't spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet,
        and declare to my people their disobedience, and to the house
        of Jacob their sins.
058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways:
        as a nation that did righteousness, and didn't forsake
        the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments;
        they delight to draw near to God.
058:003 Why have we fasted, [say they], and you don't see? [why]
        have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?
        Behold, in the day of your fast you find [your own] pleasure,
        and exact all your labors.
058:004 Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike
        with the fist of wickedness:  you don't fast this day so as
        to make your voice to be heard on high.
058:005 Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man
        to afflict his soul?  Is it to bow down his head as a rush,
        and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call
        this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?
058:006 Isn't this the fast that I have chosen:  to loose the bonds
        of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let
        the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?
058:007 Isn't it to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring
        the poor who are cast out to your house? when you see the naked,
        that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from
        your own flesh?
058:008 Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your healing
        shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go
        before you; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard.
058:009 Then shall you call, and Yahweh will answer; you shall cry,
        and he will say, Here I am.  If you take away from
        the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger,
        and speaking wickedly;
058:010 and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy
        the afflicted soul:  then shall your light rise in darkness,
        and your obscurity be as the noonday;
058:011 and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul
        in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall
        be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,
        whose waters don't fail.
058:012 Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places;
        you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;
        and you shall be called The repairer of the breach,
        The restorer of paths to dwell in.
058:013 If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your
        pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight,
        [and] the holy of Yahweh honorable; and shall honor it,
        not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure,
        nor speaking [your own] words:
058:014 then shall you delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will
        make you to ride on the high places of the earth;
        and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:
        for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.
059:001 Behold, Yahweh's hand is not shortened, that it can't save;
        neither his ear heavy, that it can't hear:
059:002 but your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
        and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he
        will not hear.
059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity;
        your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.
059:004 None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth:
        they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief,
        and bring forth iniquity.
059:005 They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web:
        he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed
        breaks out into a viper.
059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
        themselves with their works:  their works are works of iniquity,
        and the act of violence is in their hands.
059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood:
        their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and
        destruction are in their paths.
059:008 The way of peace they don't know; and there is no justice
        in their goings:  they have made them crooked paths;
        whoever goes therein does not know peace.
059:009 Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness
        overtake us:  we look for light, but, behold, darkness;
        for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those
        who have no eyes:  we stumble at noonday as in the twilight;
        among those who are lusty we are as dead men.
059:011 We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves:
        we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation,
        but it is far off from us.
059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins
        testify against us; for our transgressions are with us,
        and as for our iniquities, we know them:
059:013 transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following
        our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering
        from the heart words of falsehood.
059:014 Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off;
        for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness can't enter.
059:015 Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself
        a prey.  Yahweh saw it, and it displeased him that there
        was no justice.
059:016 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
        no intercessor:  therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;
        and his righteousness, it upheld him.
059:017 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation
        on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,
        and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay,
        wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies;
        to the islands he will repay recompense.
059:019 So shall they fear the name of Yahweh from the west,
        and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come
        as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.
059:020 A Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from
        disobedience in Jacob, says Yahweh.
059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh:
        my Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth,
        shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth
        of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed,
        says Yahweh, from henceforth and forever.
060:001 Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of Yahweh
        is risen on you.
060:002 For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
        the peoples; but Yahweh will arise on you, and his glory
        shall be seen on you.
060:003 Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness
        of your rising.
060:004 Lift up your eyes round about, and see:  they all gather
        themselves together, they come to you; your sons shall come
        from far, and your daughters shall be carried in the arms.
060:005 Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill
        and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be
        turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries
        of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come;
        they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim
        the praises of Yahweh.
060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you,
        the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come
        up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house
        of my glory.
060:008 Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
060:009 Surely the islands shall wait for me, and the ships of
        Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver
        and their gold with them, for the name of Yahweh your God,
        and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.
060:010 Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall
        minister to you:  for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor
        have I had mercy on you.
060:011 Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be
        shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the wealth
        of the nations, and their kings led captive.
060:012 For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish;
        yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine,
        and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary;
        and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
060:014 The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you;
        and all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at
        the soles of your feet; and they shall call you The city
        of Yahweh, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
060:015 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man
        passed through you, I will make you an eternal excellency,
        a joy of many generations.
060:016 You shall also suck the milk of the nations, and shall suck the breast
        of kings; and you shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior,
        and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
        and for wood brass, and for stones iron.  I will also make
        your officers peace, and righteousness your ruler.
060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, desolation nor
        destruction within your borders; but you shall call your
        walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
060:019 The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness
        shall the moon give light to you:  but Yahweh will be to you
        an everlasting light, and your God your glory.
060:020 Your sun shall no more go down, neither shall your moon
        withdraw itself; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light,
        and the days of your mourning shall be ended.
060:021 Your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit
        the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,
        that I may be glorified.
060:022 The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one
        a strong nation; I, Yahweh, will hasten it in its time.
061:001 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed
        me to preach good news to the humble; he has sent me to bind
        up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
        and the opening [of the prison] to those who are bound;
061:002 to proclaim the year of Yahweh's favor, and the day of vengeance
        of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
061:003 to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them
        a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment
        of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be
        called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh,
        that he may be glorified.
061:004 They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
        former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,
        the desolations of many generations.
061:005 Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners
        shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
061:006 But you shall be named the priests of Yahweh; men shall call
        you the ministers of our God:  you shall eat the wealth
        of the nations, and in their glory shall you boast yourselves.
061:007 Instead of your shame [you shall have] double; and instead
        of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion:
        therefore in their land they shall possess double;
        everlasting joy shall be to them.
061:008 For I, Yahweh, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity;
        and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will
        make an everlasting covenant with them.
061:009 Their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring
        among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them,
        that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.
061:010 I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God;
        for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has
        covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom
        decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself
        with her jewels.
061:011 For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden
        causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth;
        so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise
        to spring forth before all the nations.
062:001 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake
        I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness,
        and her salvation as a lamp that burns.
062:002 The nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory,
        and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth
        of Yahweh shall name.
062:003 You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh,
        and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
062:004 You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land
        any more be termed Desolate:  but you shall be called Hephzibah,
        and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your
        land shall be married.
062:005 For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you;
        and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall
        your God rejoice over you.
062:006 I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they shall
        never hold their peace day nor night:  you who call on Yahweh,
        take no rest,
062:007 and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes
        Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
062:008 Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,
        Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies;
        and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which
        you have labored:
062:009 but those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Yahweh;
        and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts
        of my sanctuary.
062:010 Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people;
        cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
        lift up a banner for the peoples.
062:011 Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth,
        Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes;
        behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
062:012 They shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh:
        and you shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
063:001 Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from
        Bozrah? this who is glorious in his clothing, marching in
        the greatness of his strength?  I who speak in righteousness,
        mighty to save.
063:002 Why are you red in your clothing, and your garments like him
        who treads in the wine vat?
063:003 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was
        no man with me:  yes, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them
        in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,
        and I have stained all my clothing.
063:004 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my
        redeemed is come.
063:005 I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there
        was none to uphold:  therefore my own arm brought salvation to me;
        and my wrath, it upheld me.
063:006 I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk
        in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.
063:007 I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh,
        [and] the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has
        bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,
        which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies,
        and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
063:008 For he said, Surely, they are my people, children who will
        not deal falsely:  so he was their Savior.
063:009 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
        presence saved them:  in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;
        and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
063:010 But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit:
        therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself
        fought against them.
063:011 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people,
        [saying], Where is he who brought them up out of the sea
        with the shepherds of his flock? where is he who put his holy
        Spirit in the midst of them?
063:012 who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses?
        who divided the waters before them, to make himself
        an everlasting name?
063:013 who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness,
        so that they didn't stumble?
063:014 As the livestock that go down into the valley, the Spirit
        of Yahweh caused them to rest; so did you lead your people,
        to make yourself a glorious name.
063:015 Look down from heaven, and see from the habitation of your
        holiness and of your glory:  where are your zeal and your
        mighty acts? the yearning of your heart and your compassion
        is restrained toward me.
063:016 For you are our Father, though Abraham doesn't know us,
        and Israel does not acknowledge us:  you, Yahweh, are our Father;
        our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
063:017 O Yahweh, why do you make us to err from your ways,
        and harden our heart from your fear?  Return for your servants'
        sake, the tribes of your inheritance.
063:018 Your holy people possessed [it] but a little while:
        our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
063:019 We are become as they over whom you never bear rule,
        as those who were not called by your name.
064:001 Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down,
        that the mountains might quake at your presence,
064:002 as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes
        the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries,
        that the nations may tremble at your presence!
064:003 When you did terrible things which we didn't look for,
        you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
064:004 For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,
        neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him
        who waits for him.
064:005 You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember
        you in your ways:  behold, you were angry, and we sinned:
        in them [have we been] of long time; and shall we be saved?
064:006 For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our
        righteousness is as a polluted garment:  and we all fade as a leaf;
        and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
064:007 There is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself
        to take hold of you; for you have hid your face from us,
        and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
064:008 But now, Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you
        our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
064:009 Don't be furious, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever:
        see, look, we beg you, we are all your people.
064:010 Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become
        a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
064:011 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you,
        is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
064:012 Will you refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? will you
        hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?
065:001 I am inquired of by those who didn't ask; I am found by those
        who didn't seek me:  I said, See me, see me, to a nation
        that was not called by my name.
065:002 I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people,
        who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
065:003 a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing
        in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;
065:004 who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places;
        who eat pig's flesh, and broth of abominable things is
        in their vessels;
065:005 who say, Stand by yourself, don't come near to me,
        for I am holier than you.  These are a smoke in my nose,
        a fire that burns all the day.
065:006 Behold, it is written before me:  I will not keep silence,
        but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,
065:007 your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
        says Yahweh, who have burned incense on the mountains,
        and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure
        their work into their bosom.
065:008 Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
        and one says, Don't destroy it, for a blessing is in it:
        so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not
        destroy them all.
065:009 I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah
        an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it,
        and my servants shall dwell there.
065:010 Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place
        for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.
065:011 But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain,
        who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed
        wine to Destiny;
065:012 I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down
        to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer;
        when I spoke, you did not hear; but you did that which was
        evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn't delight.
065:013 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, my servants shall eat,
        but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink,
        but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice,
        but you shall be disappointed;
065:014 behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall
        cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
065:015 You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen;
        and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call his servants
        by another name:
065:016 so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself
        in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear
        by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten,
        and because they are hid from my eyes.
065:017 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former
        things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
065:018 But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;
        for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
065:019 I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people;
        and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping
        and the voice of crying.
065:020 There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old
        man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die
        one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years
        old shall be accursed.
065:021 They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
        plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
065:022 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,
        and another eat:  for as the days of a tree shall be the days
        of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work
        of their hands.
065:023 They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity;
        for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their
        offspring with them.
065:024 It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer;
        and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
065:025 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
        eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food.
        They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
        says Yahweh.
066:001 Thus says Yahweh, heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool:
        what manner of house will you build to me? and what place
        shall be my rest?
066:002 For all these things has my hand made, and [so] all these things
        came to be, says Yahweh:  but to this man will I look,
        even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who
        trembles at my word.
066:003 He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices
        a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering,
        [as he who offers] pig's blood; he who burns frankincense,
        as he who blesses an idol.  Yes, they have chosen their own ways,
        and their soul delights in their abominations:
066:004 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
        on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke,
        they did not hear:  but they did that which was evil in my eyes,
        and chose that in which I didn't delight.
066:005 Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word:
        Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake,
        have said, Let Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your joy;
        but it is those who shall be disappointed.
066:006 A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple,
        a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies.
066:007 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
        she was delivered of a boy.
066:008 Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things?
        Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought
        forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought
        forth her children.
066:009 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?
        says Yahweh:  shall I who cause to bring forth shut [the
        womb]? says your God.
066:010 Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who
        love her:  rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;
066:011 that you may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of
        her consolations; that you may milk out, and be delighted
        with the abundance of her glory.
066:012 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,
        and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream:
        and you shall suck [of it]; you shall be borne on the side,
        and shall be dandled on the knees.
066:013 As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you;
        and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
066:014 You shall see [it], and your heart shall rejoice,
        and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass:
        and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants;
        and he will have indignation against his enemies.
066:015 For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots shall
        be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness,
        and his rebuke with flames of fire.
066:016 For by fire will Yahweh execute judgment, and by his sword,
        on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many.
066:017 Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go]
        to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating pig's flesh,
        and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an
        end together, says Yahweh.
066:018 For I [know] their works and their thoughts:  [the time] comes,
        that I will gather all nations and languages; and they shall come,
        and shall see my glory.
066:019 I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape
        of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw
        the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the islands afar off,
        who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory;
        and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
066:020 They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an
        offering to Yahweh, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters,
        and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem,
        says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their offering
        in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.
066:021 Of them also will I take for priests [and] for Levites, says Yahweh.
066:022 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
        shall remain before me, says Yahweh, so shall your seed
        and your name remain.
066:023 It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from
        one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship
        before me, says Yahweh.
066:024 They shall go forth, and look on the dead bodies of the men
        who have transgressed against me:  for their worm shall not die,
        neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be
        an abhorring to all flesh.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
