THE

ART

OF

CONFECTIONARY.




_Of the Manner of clarifying Sugar, and the different Ways of boiling
it._


Since the Ground-work of the Confectioner's Art depends on the
Knowledge of clarifying and boiling Sugars, I shall here distinctly
set them down, that the several Terms hereafter mentioned may the more
easily be understood; which, when thoroughly comprehended, will
prevent the unnecessary Repetitions of them, which would encumber the
Work and confound the Practitioner, were they to be explained in every
Article, as the Variety of the Matter should require: I shall
therefore, through the whole Treatise, stick to these Denominations of
the several Degrees of boiling Sugar, _viz._ Clarifying, Smooth,
Blown, Feather'd, Cracked, and Carmel.


_To Clarify Sugar._

Break into your preserving Pan the White of one Egg, put in four
Quarts of Water, beat it up to a Froth with a Whisk, then put in
twelve Pounds of Sugar, mixed together, and set it over the Fire; when
it boils up, put in a little cold Water, which will cause it to sink;
let it rise again, then put in a little more Water; so do for four or
five times, till the Scum appears thick on the Top; then remove it
from the Fire and let it settle; then take off the Scum, and pass it
through your straining Bag.

    _Note_, If the Sugar doth not appear very fine, you must boil it
    again before you strain it; otherwise in boiling it to an Height,
    it will rise over the Pan, and give the Artist a great deal of
    Trouble.


_The boiling Sugar to the Degree called Smooth._

When your Sugar is thus clarified, put what Quantity you shall have
Occasion for over the Fire, to boil smooth, the which you will prove
by dipping your Scummer into the Sugar; and then touching it with your
Fore-finger and Thumb, in opening them a little you will see a small
Thread drawn betwixt, which immediately breaks, and remains in a Drop
on your Thumb; thus it is a little smooth; then boiling it more, it
will draw into a larger String; then it is become very smooth.


_The Blown Sugar._

Boil your Sugar yet longer than the former, and try it thus, _viz._
Dip in your Scummer, and take it out, shaking off what Sugar you can
into the Pan, and then blow with your Mouth strongly through the
Holes, and if certain Bubbles or Bladders blow through, it is boiled
to the Degree called Blown.


_The Feathered Sugar_,

Is a higher Degree of boiling Sugar, which is to be proved by dipping
the Scummer when it hath boiled somewhat longer; shake it first over
the Pan, then giving it a sudden Flurt behind you; if it be enough,
the Sugar will fly off like Feathers.


_The Crackled Boiling_,

Is proved by letting it boil somewhat longer; and then dipping a Stick
into the Sugar, which immediately remove into a Pot of cold Water
standing by you for that Purpose, drawing off the Sugar that cleaves
to the Stick, and if it becomes hard, and will snap in the Water, it
is enough; if not, you must boil it till it comes to that Degree.

    _Note_, Your Water must be always very cold, or it will deceive
    you.


_The Carmel Sugar_,

Is known by boiling yet longer, and is proved by dipping a Stick, as
aforesaid, first in the Sugar, and then in the Water: But this you
must observe, when it comes to the Carmel Height, it will snap like
Glass the Moment it touches the cold Water, which is the highest and
last Degree of boiling Sugar.

    _Note_, There is this to be observed, that your Fire be not very
    fierce when you boil this, lest flaming up the Sides of your Pan,
    it should occasion the Sugar to burn, and so discolour it.


_To preserve Seville-Oranges Liquid._

Take the best Seville-Oranges, and pare them very neatly, put them
into Salt and Water for about two Hours; then boil them very tender
till a Pin will easily go into them; then drain them well from the
Water, and put them into your preserving Pan, putting as much
clarified Sugar to them as will cover them, laying some Trencher or
Plate on them to keep them down; then set them over a Fire, and by
Degrees heat them till they boil; then let them have a quick boil till
the Sugar comes all over them in a Froth; then set them by till next
Day, when you must drain the Syrup from them, and boil it till it
becomes very smooth, adding some more clarified Sugar; put it upon the
Oranges, and give them a Boil, then set them by till next Day, when
you must do as the Day before. The fourth Day drain them and strain
your Syrup through a Bag, and boil it till it becomes very smooth;
then take some other clarified Sugar, boil it till it blows very
strong, and take some Jelly of Pippins drawn from the Pippins, as I
shall immediately express, with the Juice of some other Oranges: As
for Example, if you have six Oranges, after they are preserved as
above directed, take two Pounds of clarified Sugar, boil it to blow
very strong; then one Pint and half of Pippin Jelly, and the Juice of
four or five Oranges, boil all together; then put in the Syrup that
has been strained and boiled to be very smooth, and give all a Boil;
then put your Oranges into your Pots or Glasses, and fill them up with
the above made Jelly; when cold cover them, and set them by for Use.

    _Note_, You must be sure in all your Boilings to clear away the
    Scum, otherwise you will endanger their Working: And if you find
    they will swim above your Jelly, you must bind them down with a
    Sprig of a clean Whisk.


_To draw a Jelly from Pippins._

Take the fairest and firmest Pippins, pour them into fair Water, as
much as will cover them; set them over a quick Fire, and boil them to
Mash; then put them on a Sieve over an earthen Pan, and press out all
the Jelly, which Jelly strain through a Bag, and use as directed in
the Oranges before mentioned, and such others as shall be hereafter
described.


_To make Orange Marmalade._

Take six Oranges, grate two of the Rinds of them upon a Grater, then
cut them all, and pick out the Flesh from the Skins and Seeds; put to
it the grated Rind, and about half a Pint of Pippin Jelly; take the
same Weight of Sugar as you have of this Meat so mingled; boil your
Sugar till it blows very strong; then put in the Meat, and boil all
very quick till it becomes a Jelly, which you will find by dipping the
Scummer, and holding it up to drain; if it be a Jelly, it will break
from the Scummer in Flakes; if not, it will run off in little Streams:
When it is a good Jelly, put it into your Glasses or Pots.

    _Note_, If you find this Composition too sweet, you may in the
    boiling add more Juice of Oranges; the different Quickness they
    have, makes it difficult to prescribe.


_To preserve Oranges with a Marmalade in them._

Pare your Oranges as before, make a round Hole in the Bottom, where
the Stalk grew, the Bigness of a Shilling; take out the Meat, and put
them into Salt and Water for two or three Hours; then boil them very
tender, then put them into clarified Sugar, give them a boil the next
Day, drain the Syrup and boil it till it becomes smooth; put in your
Oranges and give them a good boil. When a little cool, drain them and
fill them with a Marmalade made as before directed, putting in the
round Piece you cut out; with the Syrup, some other Sugar, and Pippin
Juice, make a Jelly, and fill up your Pots or Glasses.


_To make a Compote of Oranges._

Cut the Rind off your Oranges into Ribs, leaving part of the Rind on;
cut them into eight Quarters, throw them into boiling Water; when a
Pin will easily go through the Rind, drain and put them into boiling
Water, when a Pin will easily go through the Rind, drain and put them
into as much Sugar boiled, till it becomes smooth, as will cover them,
give all a Boil together, adding some Juice of Oranges to what
Sharpness you please; you may put a little Pippin Jelly into the
Boiling, if you please; when cold serve them to Table on Plates.


_To make Orange-Rings and Faggots._

Pare your Oranges as thin, and as narrow as you can, put the Parings
into Water, whilst you prepare the Rings, which are done by cutting
the Oranges so pared into as many Rings as you please; then cut out
the Meat from the Inside; then put the Rings and Faggots into boiling
Water; boil them till tender; then put them into clarified Sugar, as
much as will cover them; set them by till next Day; then boil all
together, and set them by till the Day after; then drain the Syrup,
and boil it till very smooth; then return your Oranges into it, and
give all a Boil; the next Day boil the Syrup till it rises up to
almost the Top of your Pan; then return the Oranges into it, and give
it a Boil; then put them by in some Pot to be candied, as hereafter
mentioned, whenever you shall have Occasion.


_To candy Orange, Lemon, and Citron._

Drain what Quantity you will candy clean from the Syrup, and wash it
in luke-warm Water, and lay it on a Sieve to drain; then take as much
clarified Sugar as you think will cover what you will candy, boil it
till it blows very strong, then put in your Rings, and boil them till
it blows again; then take it from the Fire, and let it cool a little;
then with the back of a Spoon rub the Sugar against the Inside of your
Pan till you see the Sugar becomes white; then with a Fork take out
the Rings one by one, lay them on a Wire-grate to drain, then put in
your Faggots, and boil them as before directed; then rub the Sugar,
and take them up in Bunches, having some-body to cut them with a Pair
of Scizers to what Bigness you please, laying them on your Wire to
drain.

    _Note_, Thus may you candy all Sorts of Oranges and Lemon-Peals or
    Chips.

    Lemon Rings and Faggots are done the same Way, with this
    Distinction only, that the Lemons ought to be pared twice over,
    that the Ring may be the whiter; so will you have two Sorts of
    Faggots: But you must be sure to keep the outward Rind from the
    other, else it will discolour them.


_To make Orange-Cakes._

Take six Sevil-Oranges, grate the Rinds of two of them, and then cut
off the Rinds of all six to the very Juice; boil them in Water till
very tender; then squeeze out all the Water you can, and beat them to
a Paste in a Marble-Morter; then rub it through a Sieve of Hair; what
will not easily rub through must be beat again till all is got
through; then cut to Pieces the Insides of the Oranges, and rub as
much of that through as you possibly can; then boil about six or eight
Pippins in as much Water as will almost cover them, and boil them to a
Paste, and rub it through a Sieve to the rest; then put all into a Pan
together, and give a thorough Heat, till it is well mingled; then to
every Pound of this Paste take one Pound and a Quarter of Loaf-sugar;
clarify the Sugar, and boil it to the Crick; then put in your Paste
and the grated Peal, and stir it all together over a slow Fire till it
is well mixed, and the Sugar all melted; then with a Spoon fill your
round Tin-Moulds as fast as you can; when cold, draw off your Moulds,
and set them in a warm Stove to dry; when dry on the Tops, turn them
on Sieves to dry on the other Side; and when quite dry, box them up.


_Lemon-Cakes._

Take six thick-rinded Lemons, grate two of them, then pare off all the
yellow Peal, and strip the White to the Juice, which White boil till
tender, and make a Paste exactly as above.


_To preserve White-Citrons._

Cut your White-Citrons into what sized Pieces you please; put them
into Water and Salt for four or five Hours; then wash them in fair
Water, and boil them till tender; then drain them, and put them into
as much clarified Sugar as will cover them, and set them by till next
Day; then drain the Syrup, and boil it a little smooth; when cool, put
it on your Citrons; the next Day boil your Syrup quite smooth, and
pour on your Citrons; the Day after boil all together and put into a
Pot to be candied, or put in Jelly, or compose as you please.

    _Note_, You must look over these Fruits so kept in Syrup; and if
    you perceive any Froth on them you must give them a Boil; and if
    by Chance they should become very frothy and sour, you must first
    boil the Syrup, and then all together.


_To preserve Golden-Pippins in Jelly._

Pare your Pippins from all Spots, and with a narrow-pointed Knife make
a Hole quite through them, then boil them in fair Water about a
Quarter of an Hour; then drain them, and take as much Sugar as will
cover them; boil it till it blows very strong, then put in your
Pippins, and give them a good Boil; let them cool a little, then give
them another Boil; then if you have, for example a Dozen of Pippins,
take a Pound of Sugar, and boil it till it blows very strong; then put
in Half a Pint of Pippin Jelly and the Juice of three or four Lemons;
boil all together, and put to the Golden-Pippins; give them all a
Boil, scum them, and put them into the Glasses or Pots.


_To dry Golden-Pippins._

Pare your Pippins, and make a Hole in them, as above, then weigh them,
and boil them till tender; then take them out of the Water, and to
every Pound of Pippins take a Pound and a Half of Loaf-Sugar, and boil
it till it blows very strong; then put in the Fruit, and boil it very
quick, till the Sugar flies all over the Pan; then let them settle,
and cool them, scum them, and set them by till the next Day, then
drain them, and lay them out to dry, dusting them with fine Sugar
before you put them into the Stove; the next Day turn them and dust
them again, when dry, pack them up.

    _Note_, You must dry them in Slices or Quarters, after the same
    Manner.


_To make Orange Clear-Cakes._

Take the best Pippins, pare them into as much Water as will cover
them; boil them to a Mash; then press out the Jelly upon a Sieve, and
strain it through a Bag, adding Juice of Oranges to give it an
agreeable Taste: To every Pound of Jelly take one Pound and a Quarter
of Loaf Sugar, boil it till it cracks, then put in the Jelly and the
Rind of a grated Orange or two, stir it up gently over a slow Fire,
till all is incorporated together; then take it off, and fill your
Clear-cake Glasses, what Scum arises on the Top, you must carefully
rake off before they are cold, then put them into the Stove; when you
find them begin to crust upon the upper Side, turn them out upon
Squares of Glasses, and put them to dry again; when they begin to have
a tender Candy, cut them into Quarters, or what Pieces you please, and
let them dry till hard, then turn them on Sieves; when thorough dry,
put them up into your Boxes.

    _Note_, As they begin to sweat in the Box, you must shift them
    from Time to Time, and it will be requisite to put no more than
    one Row in a Box at the Beginning, till they do not sweat.

    Lemon-colour Cakes are made with Lemons, as these.


_To make Pomegranate Clear-Cakes._

Draw your Jelly as for the Orange Clear-Cakes, then boil into it the
Juice of two or three Pomegranate-seeds, and all with the Juice of an
Orange and a Lemon, the Rind of each grated in, then strain it
through a Bag, and to every Pound of Jelly put one Pound and a Quarter
boiled till it cracks to help the Colour to a fine Red; put in a
Spoonful of Cocheneal, prepared as hereafter directed; then fill your
Glasses, and order them as your Orange.


_To Prepare Cocheneal._

Take one Ounce of Cocheneal, and beat it to a fine Powder, then boil
it in three Quarters of a Pint of Water to the Consumption of one
Half, then beat Half an Ounce of Roach Allum, and Half an Ounce of
Cream of Tartar very fine, and put them to the Cocheneal, boil them
all together a little while, and strain it through a fine Bag, which
put into a Phial, and keep for Use.

    _Note_, If an Ounce of Loaf-sugar be boiled in with it, it will
    keep from moulding what you do not immediately use.


_To make Pippin-Knots._

Pare your Pippins, and weigh them, then put them into your preserving
Pan; to every Pound put four Ounces of Sugar, and as much Water as
will scarce cover them; boil them to a Pulp, and then pulp them
through a Sieve; then to every Pound of the Apples you weighed, take
one Pound of Sugar clarified, boil it till it almost cracks, then put
in the Paste, and mix it well over a slow Fire, then take it off and
pour it on flat Pewter-plates or the Bottoms of Dishes, to the
Thickness of two Crowns; set them in the Stove for three or four
Hours, then cut it into narrow Slips and turn it up into Knots to what
Shape or Size you please; put them into the Stove to dry, dusting them
a little, turn them and dry them on the other Side, and when thorough
dry, put them into your Box.

    _Note_, You may make them red by adding a little Cocheneal, or
    green by putting in a little of the following Colour.


_To prepare a Green Colour._

Take Gumbouge one Quarter of an Ounce, of Indico and Blue the same
Quantity; beat them very fine in a Brass Mortar, and mix with it a
Spoonful of Water, so will you have a fine Green; a few Drops are
sufficient.


_To make a Compote of Boonchretien Pears._

Pare your Fruit, and cut them into Slices, scald them a little,
squeezing some Juice of Lemon on them in the scalding to keep them
white; then drain them, and put as much clarified Sugar as will just
cover them, give them a Boil, and then squeeze the Juice of an Orange
or Lemon, which you best approve of, and serve them, to Table when
cold.


_Compote of Baked Wardens._

Bake your Wardens in an earthen Pot, with a little Claret, some Spice,
Lemon-peal, and Sugar; when you will use them peal off the Skin and
dress them in Plates, either Whole or in Halfs; then make a Jelly of
Pippins, sharpened well with the Juice of Lemons, and pour it upon
them, and when cold, break the Jelly with a Spoon, so will it look
very agreeable upon the red Pears.


_Zest of China-Oranges._

Pare off the outward Rind of the Oranges very thin, and only strew it
with fine Powder-Sugar, as much as their own Moisture will take, dry
them in a hot Stove.


_To Rock Candy-Violets._

Pick the Leaves off the Violets, then boil some of the finest
Loaf-sugar till it blows very strong, which pour into your
Candying-Pan, being made of Tin, in the Form of a Dripping-Pan, about
three Inches deep; then strew the Leaves of the Flowers as thick on
the Top as you can; then put it into a hot Stove for eight or ten
Days; when you see it is hard candied, break a Hole in one Corner of
it, and drain all the Syrup that will run from it, then break it out,
and lay it on Heaps on Plates to dry in the Stove.


_To candy Violets whole._

Take the double Violets, and pick off the green Stalk, then boil some
Sugar till it blows very strong; throw in the Violets, and boil it
till it blows again, then with a Spoon rub the Sugar against the Side
of the Pan till white, then stir all till the Sugar leaves them; then
sift them and dry them.

    _Note_, Junquils are done the same Way.


_To preserve Angelico in Knots._

Take young and thick Stalks of Angelico, cut them into Lengths of
about a Quarter of a Yard, then scald them; next put them into cold
Water, then strip off the Skins, and cut them into narrow Slips; then
lay them on your preserving Pan, then put to them a thin Sugar, that
is, to one Part Sugar as clarified, and one Part Water; then set it
over the Fire and let it boil, and set it by till next Day, then turn
it in the Pan, and give it another Boil; the Day after drain it and
boil the Sugar till it is a little smooth, then pour it on your
Angelico, and if it be a good Green boil it no more, if not, heat it
again; the Day following boil the Sugar till it is very smooth, and
pour it upon your Angelico; the next Day boil your Syrup till it rises
to the Top of your Pan, then put your Angelico into your Pan, and pour
your Syrup upon it, and keep it for Use.


_To dry it out._

Drain what Quantity you will from the Syrup, and boil as much Sugar as
will cover it till it blows, put in your Angelico, and give it a Boil
till it blows again; when cold, drain it, and tie it in Knots and put
it into a warm Stove to dry, first dusting it a little; when dry on
one Side turn it, and dry the other, then pack it up.


_To preserve Angelico in Sticks._

Take Angelico, not altogether so young as the other, cut it into short
Pieces about half a Quarter of a Yard, or less, scale it a little,
then drain it and put it into a thin Sugar as before; boil it a
little, the next Day turn it in the Pan the Bottom upwards, and boil
it, so finish it as the other for Knots.

    _Note_, When you will candy it, you must drain it from the Syrup,
    wash it and candy it as the Orange and Lemon.


_Angelico-Paste._

Take the youngest and most pithy Angelico you can get, boil it very
tender, then drain it, and press out all the Water you possibly can,
then beat it in a Mortar to as fine a Paste as may be, then rub it
through a Sieve; next Day dry it over a Fire, and to every Pound of
this Paste take one Pound of fine Sugar in fine Powder; when your
Paste is hot, put in the Sugar, stirring it over a gentle Fire till it
is well incorporated; when so done, drop it on Plates long or round,
as you shall judge proper; dust it a little and put it into the Stove
to dry.


_To preserve Apricots Green._

Take the Apricots when about to stone, before it becomes too hard for
a Pin easily to press through; pare them in Ribs very neatly because
every Stroke of the Knife will be seen; then put them into fair Water
as you pare them, then boil them till tender enough to slip easily
from your Pin, then drain them, and put them into a thin Sugar, that
is to say, one Part Sugar clarified, and one Part Water; boil them a
little, then set them by till next Day, then give them another Boil;
the Day after drain them and boil your Syrup a little smooth, and put
it to them, giving them a Boil; the next Day boil your Syrup a little
smooth and put it upon them without boiling your Fruit; then let them
remain in the Syrup four or five Days; then boil some more Sugar till
it blows, and add it to them; give all a Boil, and let them be till
the Day following; then drain them from the Syrup, and lay them out to
dry, dusting them with a little fine Sugar before you put them into
the Stove.


_To put them up in Jelly._

You must keep them in the Syrup so preserved till Codlins are pretty
well grown; take Care to visit them sometimes that they do not sour,
which if they do, the Syrup will be lost; by reason it will become
muddy, and then you will be obliged to make your Jelly with all fresh
Sugar, which will be too sweet; but when Codlins are of an indifferent
Bigness, draw a Jelly from them as from Pippins, as you are directed
in _p._ 8; then drain the Apricots from the Syrup, boil it and strain
it through your Strain-bags; then boil some Sugar (proportionable to
your Quantity of Apricots you design to put up) till it blows, then
put in the Jelly and boil it a little with the Sugar, then put in the
Syrup and the Apricots, and give them all a Boil together, till you
find the Syrup will be a Jelly; then remove them from the Fire, and
scum them very well, and put them into your Pots or Glasses, observing
as they cool if they be regular in the Glasses to sink, and disperse
them to a proper Distance, and when thorough cold to cover them up.


_To preserve Green Almonds._

Take the Almonds when pretty well grown, and make a Lye with Wood or
Charcoal-Ashes, and Water; boil the Lye till it feels very smooth,
strain it through a Sieve and let it settle till clear, then pour off
the Clear into another Pan, then set it on the Fire in order to blanch
off the Down that is on the Almonds, which you must do in this Manner,
_viz._ when the Lye is scalding hot throw in two or three Almonds, and
try, when they have been in some Time, if they will blanch; if they
will, put in the rest, and the Moment you find their Skins will come
off, remove them from the Fire, and put them into cold Water, and
blanch them one by one rubbing them with Salt, the better to clean
them; when you have so done, wash them in several Waters, the better
to clean them, in short, till you see no Soil in the Water; when you
have so done, throw them into boiling Water, and let them boil till
very tender, till a Pin will very easily pass through them; then drain
them, and put them into clarified Sugar without Water, they being
green enough, do not require a thin Sugar to bring them to a Colour,
but, on the contrary, if too much heated, they will become too dark a
Green; the next Day boil the Syrup, and put it on them; the Day after
boil it till it becomes very smooth; the Day following give all a Boil
together, scum them, and let them rest four or five Days; then, if you
will dry them or put them in Jelly, you must follow the Directions as
for green Apricots, _p._ 24.

    _Note_, If you will have a Compose of either, it is but serving
    them to Table when they are first entered, by boiling the Sugar a
    little more.


_To preserve Goosberries green._

Take the long Sort of Goosberries the latter End of _May_ or the
Beginning of _June_, before the green Colour has left them; set some
Water over the Fire, and when it is ready to boil, throw in the
Goosberries, and let them have a Scald, then take them out and
carefully remove them into cold Water, and set them over a very slow
Fire to green, cover them very close so that none of the Steam can get
out; when you have obtained their green Colour, which will perhaps be
four or five Hours, then drain them gently into clarified Sugar, and
give them a Heat; set them by, and give them another Heat; this you
must repeat four or five Times in order to bring them to a very good
green Colour: Thus you may serve them to Table by Way of Compose; if
you will preserve them to keep either dry or in Jelly, you must follow
the Directions as for green Apricots aforementioned, _p._ 24.


_To preserve Goosberries white._

Take the large _Dutch_ Goosberries when full grown, but before they
are quite ripe; pare them into fair Water, and stone them; then put
them into boiling Water, and let them boil very tender, then put them
into clarified Sugar in an earthen Pan, and put as many in one Pan as
will cover the Bottom; then set them by till next Day, and boil the
Syrup a little, and pour it on them; the Day after boil it till
smooth, and pour it on them; the third Day give them a gentle Boil
round, by setting the Side of the Pan over the Fire, and as it boils,
turning it about till they have had a Boil all over, the Day following
make a Jelly with Codlins, and finish them as you do the others, in
_p._ 28.


_To dry Goosberries._

TO every Pound of Goosberries, when stoned, put two Pounds of Sugar,
but boil the Sugar till it blows very strong; then strew in the
Goosberries, and give them a thorough Boil, till the Sugar comes all
over them, let them settle a Quarter of an Hour, then give them
another good Boil, then scum them, and set them by till the next Day;
then drain them, and lay them out on Sieves to dry, dusting them very
much, and put a good brisk Fire into the Stove; when dry on one Side,
turn them and dust them on the other; and when quite dry, put them
into your Box.


_To make Goosberry-Paste._

Take the Goosberries when full grown, wash them, and put them into
your preserving Pan, with as much Spring-water as will almost cover
them, and boil them very quick all to a Pommish; then strew them on a
Hair-sieve over an earthen Pot or Pan, and press out all the Juice;
then to every Pound of this Paste, take one Pound and two Ounces of
Sugar, and boil it till it cracks; then take it from the Fire and put
in your Paste, and mix it well over a slow Fire till the Sugar is very
well incorporated with the Paste; then scum it and fill your
Paste-Pots, then scum them again, and when cold, put them into the
Stove, and when crusted on the Top, turn them, and set them in the
Stove again, and when a little dry, cut them in long Pieces, and set
them to dry quite; and when so crusted that they will bear touching,
turn them on Sieves and dry the other Side, then put them into your
Box.

    _Note_, You may make them red or green, by putting the Colour when
    the Sugar and Paste is all mixed, giving it a Warm altogether.


_Goosberry Clear-Cakes._

Goosberry Clear-Cakes are made after the same Manner as the Paste,
with this Difference only, that you strain the Jelly through the Bag
before you weigh it for Use.


_To dry Cherries._

Stone your Cherries and weigh them, to eight Pounds of Cherries put
two Pounds of Sugar, boil it till it blows very strong: put the
Cherries to the Sugar, and heat them by Degrees till the Sugar is
thoroughly melted, for when the Cherries come in, it will so cool the
Sugar that it will seem like Glew, and should you put it on a quick
Fire at first, it will endanger the Burning; when you find the Sugar
is all melted, then boil them as quick as possible till the Sugar
flies all over them, then scum them, and set them by in an earthen
Pan; for where the Sugar is so thin, it will be apt to cancker in a
Copper or Brass, or stain in a Silver; the next Day drain them, and
boil the Sugar till it rises, then put in your Cherries, and give
them a Boil, scum them and set them by till the next Day, then drain
them and lay them out on Sieves, and dry them in a very hot Stove.


_To preserve Cherries Liquid._

Take the best Morello Cherries when ripe, either stone them or clip
their Stalks; and to every Pound take a Pound of Sugar, and boil it
till it blows very strong, then put in the Cherries, and by Degrees,
bring them to boil as fast as you can, that the Sugar may come all
over them, scum them and set them by; the next Day boil some more
Sugar to the same Degree, and put some Jelly of Currants, drawn as
hereafter directed; For Example, if you boil one Pound of Sugar, take
one Pint of Jelly, put in the Cherries and the Syrup to the Sugar;
then add the Jelly, and give all a Boil together; scum them, and fill
your Glasses or Pots; take Care as they cool, to disperse them
equally, or otherwise they will swim all to the Top.


_To draw Jelly of Currants._

Wash well your Currants, put them into your Pan, and mash them; then
put in a little Water and boil them to a Pommish; then strew it on a
Sieve, and press out all your Juice, of which you make the Jelly for
all the wet Sweet-meats that are red.

    _Note_, Where white Currant-Jelly is prescribed, it is to be drawn
    after the same Manner; but observe you strain it first.


_To make Cherry-Paste._

Take two Pounds of Morello Cherries, stone them and press the Juice
out; dry them in a Pan and mash them over the Fire; then weigh them,
and take their Weight in Sugar beaten very fine; heat them over the
Fire till the Sugar is well mixed, then dress them on Plates or
Glasses, dust them when cold, and put them into the Stove to dry.


_To dry Currants in Bunches._

Stone your Currants and tie them up in little Bunches, and to every
Pound of Currants you must boil two Pounds of Sugar, till it blows
very strong, then slip in the Currants, and let them boil very fast,
till the Sugar flies all over them; let them settle a Quarter of an
Hour, then boil them again till the Sugar rises almost to the Top of
the Pan, then let them settle, scum them, and set them by till next
Day; then you must drain them, and lay them out, taking Care to spread
the Sprigs that they may not dry clogged together: then dust them very
much, and dry them in a hot Stove.


_To preserve Currants in Jelly._

Stone your Currants, and clip off the black Tops, and strip them from
the Stalks, and to every Pound boil two Pounds of Sugar till it blows
very strong, then slip in the Currants, and give them a quick Boil,
then take them from the Fire and let them settle a little; then give
them another Boil, and put in a Pint of Currant-Jelly, drawn as
directed in _p._ 33; boil all well together, till you see the Jelly
will flake from the Scummer; then remove it from the Fire, and let it
settle a little; then scum them, and put them into your Glasses; but
as they cool, take Care to disperse them equally.


_To preserve Violet-Plumbs._

Violet Plumbs are a long Time Yellow, and are ripe in the Month of
_June_, which are preserved as follows; put them into clarified Sugar,
just enough to cover them, and boil them pretty quick; the next Day
boil them again as before; the Day after drain them again, and take
away their Skins, which you will find all flown off, then put them
into a Sugar, boil it till it blows a little, give them a Boil; the
Day following boil some more Sugar till it blows a little, give them a
Boil; the next Day boil some more Sugar to blow very strong, put the
Plumbs in the Syrup, boil a little, and scum them; the next Day drain
them, and lay them out to dry, but dust them before you put them into
the Stove.


_To preserve Orange-Flowers._

Take the Orange-Flowers just as they begin to open, put them into
boiling Water, and let them boil very quick till they are tender,
putting in a little Juice of Lemons as they boil, to keep them white;
then drain them and dry them carefully between two Napkins; then put
them into a clarified Sugar, as much as will cover them; the next Day
drain the Syrup, and boil it a little smooth; when almost cold, pour
it on the Flowers; the Day after you may drain them and lay them out
to dry, dusting them a very little.


_To put them in Jelly._

After they are preserved, as before directed, you must clarify a
little more Sugar, with Orange-Flower-Water, and make a Jelly of
Codlins, which, when ready, put in the Flowers Syrup and all; give
them a Boil, scum them, and put them into your Glasses or Pots.

    _Note_, When you boil the Syrup, you must add Sugar if it wants,
    as well in the Working the foregoing Fruits, as these.


_To make Orange-Flower-Cakes._

Take four Ounces of the Leaves of Orange-Flowers, put them into fair
Water for about an Hour, then drain them and put them between two
Napkins, and with a Rolling-pin roll them till they are bruised; then
have ready boiled one Pound of Double-refined-sugar to a bloom Degree;
put in the Flowers, and boil it till it comes to the same Degree
again, then remove it from the Fire, and let it cool a little; then
with a Spoon grind the Sugar to the Bottom or Sides of the Pan, and
when it becomes white, pour it into little Papers or Cards, made in
the Form of a Dripping-pan; when quite cold, take them out of the
Pans, and dry them a little in a Stove.


_To make Orange-Flower-Paste._

Boil one Pound of the Leaves of Orange-Flowers very tender; then take
two Pounds and two Ounces of double-refined Sugar in fine Powder; and
when you have bruised the Flowers to a Pulp, stir in the Sugar by
Degrees over a slow Fire till all is in and well melted; then make
little Drops and dry them.


_To preserve Apricots whole._

Take the Apricots when full grown, pare them, and take out their
Stones; then have ready a Pan of boiling Water, throw them into it,
and scald them till they rise to the Top of the Water; then take them
out carefully with your Scummer, and lay them on a Sieve to drain;
then lay them in your preserving Pan, and put over them as much Sugar
boiled to blow as will cover them, give them a Boil round, by setting
the Pan half on the Fire, and turning it about as it boils; then set
it full on the Fire, and let it have a covered Boiling; then let them
settle a Quarter of an Hour, and pick those that look clear to one
Side, and those that do not to the other; then boil that Side that is
not clear till they become clear; and as they do so, pick them away,
lest they boil to a Paste; when you see they look all alike, give them
a covered Boiling, scum them, and set them by; the next Day boil a
little more Sugar to blow very strong, put it to the Apricots, and
give them a very good Boil, then scum them, and cover them with a
Paper, and put them into a Stove for two Days; then drain them, and
lay them out to dry, first dusting the Plates you lay them on, and
then the Apricots, extraordinary well, blowing off what Sugar lies
white upon them, then put them into a very warm Stove to dry, and when
dry on one Side, turn and dust them again; and when quite dry, pack
them up.

    _Note_, In the turning them you must take Care there be no little
    Bladders in them, for if there be, you must prick them with a
    Point of a Pen-knife, and squeeze them out, otherwise they will
    blow and sour.


_To preserve Apricot-Chips._

Split the Apricots, and take out the Stones, then pare them, and turn
them into a circular form with your Knife; then put them into your Pan
without scalding, and put as much Sugar boiled very smooth as will
cover them, then manage them on the Fire as the whole Apricots, scum
them, and set them in the Stove; the next Day boil some more Sugar, to
boil very strong, then drain the Syrup from the Apricots, and boil it
very smooth; then put it to the fresh Sugar, and give it a Boil; then
put in the Apricots and boil them first round, and then let them have
a covered Boil, scum them, and cover them with a Paper; then put them
into the Stove for two or three Days, drain them, and lay them out to
dry, first dusting them.


_To preserve Apricots in Jelly._

Pare and stone your Apricots, then scald them a little, and lay them
in your Pan, and put as much clarified Sugar to them as will cover
them; the next Day drain the Syrup, and boil it smooth, then slip in
your Apricots, and boil as before; the next Day make a Jelly with
Codlins, boiling some Apricots amongst them, to give a better Taste;
when you have boiled the Jelly to its proper Height, put in the
Apricots with their Syrup, and boil all together; when enough, scum
them very well, and put them into your Glasses.


_To make Apricot-Paste._

Boil some Apricots that are full ripe to a Pulp, and rub the Fine of
it thro' a Sieve; and to every Pound of Pulp take one Pound and two
Ounces of fine Sugar, beaten to a very fine Powder; heat well your
Paste, and then, by Degrees, put in your Sugar; when all is in, give
it a thorough Heat over the Fire, but take Care not to let it boil;
then take it off and scrape it all to one Side of the Pan, let it cool
a little, then with a Spoon lay it out on Plates in what Form you
please, then dust them, and put them into the Stove to dry.


_To make Apricot Clear-Cakes._

First, draw a Jelly from Codlins, then boil in that Jelly some very
ripe Apricots, which press upon a Sieve over an earthen Pan, then
strain it through your Jelly-bag; and to every Pound of Jelly take the
like Quantity of fine Loaf-sugar, which clarify, and boil till it
cracks; then put in the Jelly, and mix it well, then give it a Heat on
the Fire, scum it and fill your Glasses; in the Drying, order them as
has been already directed in _p._ 16.


_To make Jam of Apricots._

Pare the Apricots, and take out the Stones, break them, and take out
the Kernels, and blanch them; then to every Pound of Apricots boil one
pound of Sugar till it blows very strong, then put in the Apricots,
and boil them very brisk till they are all broke, then take them off,
and bruise them well, put in the Kernels and stir them all together
over the Fire, then fill your Pots or Glasses with them.

    _Note_, If you find it too sweet, you may put in a little
    White-Currant-Jelly to sharpen it to your Liking.


_To preserve Rasberries Liquid._

Take the largest and fairest Rasberries you can get, and to every
Pound of Rasberries take one Pound and a Half of Sugar, clarify it,
and boil it till it blows very strong; then put in the Rasberries, and
let them boil as fast as possible, strewing a little fine beaten Sugar
on them as they boil; when they have had a good Boil, that the Sugar
rises all over them, take them from the Fire, and let them settle a
little, then give them another Boil, and put to every Pound of
Rasberries half a Pint of Currant-Jelly; let them have a good Boil,
till you perceive the Syrup hangs in Fleeks from your Scummer; then
remove them from the Fire, take off the Scum, and put them into your
Glasses or Pots.

    _Note_, Take Care to remove what Scum there may be on the Top;
    when cold, make a little Jelly of Currants, and fill up the
    Glasses; then cover them with Paper first wet in fair Water, and
    dry'd a little betwixt two Cloths, which Paper you must put close
    to the Jelly; then wipe clean your Glasses, and cover the Tops of
    them with other Paper.


_To make Rasberry-Cakes._

Pick all the Grubs and spotted Rasberries away; then bruise the rest,
and put them on a Hair-sieve over an earthen Pan, putting on them a
Board and Weight to press out all the Water you can; then put the
Paste into your preserving Pan, and dry it over the Fire, till you
perceive no Moisture left in it, that is, no Juice that will run from
it, stirring it all the Time it is on the Fire to keep it from
burning; then weigh it, and to every Pound take one Pound and two
Ounces of Sugar, beat to a fine Powder, and put in the Sugar by
Degrees; when all is in, put it on the Fire, and incorporate them well
together; then take them from the Fire and scrape it all to one Side
of the Pan; let it cool a very little, then put it into your Moulds;
when quite cold, put them into your Stove without dusting it, and dry
it as other Sorts of Paste.

    _Note_, You must take particular Care that your Paste doth not
    boil after your Sugar is in; for if it does, it will grow greasy
    and never dry well.


_To make Rasberry Clear-Cakes._

Take two Quarts of ripe Goosberries, or white Currants, and one Quart
of red Rasberries, put them into a Stone-Jug and stop them close; then
put it into a Pot of cold Water, as much as will cover the Neck of the
Jug; then boil them in that Water till all comes to a Paste, then turn
them out in a Hair-sieve, placed over a Pan, press out all the Jelly
and strain it thro' the Jelly-bag; to every Pound of Jelly take twenty
Ounces of Double-refined Sugar, and boil it till it will crack in the
Water; then take it from the Fire and put in your Jelly, stirring it
over a slow Fire, till all the Sugar is melted; then give it a good
Heat till all is incorporated; then take it from the Fire, scum it
well, and fill your Clear-cake-glasses; then take off what Scum is on
them, and put them into the Stove to dry, observing the Method
directed in _p._ 16.

    _Note_, In filling out your Clear-cakes and Clear-pastes, you must
    be as expeditious as possible, for if it cools it will be a Jelly
    before you can get it into them.

    White Rasberry Clear-cakes are made after the same Manner, only
    mixing white Rasberries with the Goosberries in the Infusion.


_To make Rasberry Clear-Paste._

Take two Quarts of Goosberries, and two Quarts of red Rasberries, put
them in a Pan, with about a Pint and an Half of Water; boil them over
a very quick Fire to a Pommish, then throw them upon an earthen Pan,
and press out all the Juice; then take that Juice and boil in it
another Quart of Rasberries, then throw them on a Sieve, and rub all
through the Sieve that you can; then put in the Seeds and weigh the
Paste, and to every Pound take twenty Ounces of fine Loaf-sugar,
boiled, when clarified, till it cracks, then remove it from the Fire,
and put in your Paste, mix it well, and set it over a slow Fire,
stirring it till all the Sugar is melted, and you find it is become a
Jelly; then take it from the Fire and fill your Pots or Glasses,
whilst very hot, then scum them and put them into the Stove; observe,
when cold, the drying them, as in _p._ 16.


_To make Rasberry-Biscakes._

Press out the Juice, and dry the Paste a little over the Fire, then
rub all the Pulp through a Sieve; then weigh, and to every Pound take
eighteen Ounces of Sugar, sifted very fine, and the Whites of four
Eggs, put all in the Pan together, and with a Whisp beat till it is
very stiff, so that you may lay it in pretty high Drops; and when it
is so beaten, drop it in what Form you please on the back Sides of
Cards, (Paper being too thin, it will be difficult to get it off;)
dust them a little with a very fine Sugar, and put them into a very
warm Stove to dry; when they are dry enough, they will come easily
from the Cards; but whilst soft, they will not stir; then take and
turn then on a Sieve, and let them remain a Day or two in the Stove;
then pack them up in your Box, and they will, in a dry Place, keep all
the Year without shifting.


_To make Currant-Paste._

Wash well your Currants and put them into your preserving Pan, bruise
them, and with a little Water, boil them to a Pulp, press out the
Juice, and to every Pound take twenty Ounces of Loaf-sugar, boil it to
crack; then take it from the Fire, and put in the Paste; then heat it
over the Fire, take off the Scum, and put it into your Paste-pots or
Glasses, then dry and manage them as other Pastes.


_To make Rasberry-Jam._

Press out the Water from the Rasberries; then to every Pound of
Rasberries take one Pound of Sugar, first dry the Rasberries in a Pan
over the Fire, but keep them stirring, lest they burn; put in your
Sugar, and incorporate them well together, and fill your Glasses or
Pots, covering them with thin white Paper close to the Jam, whilst it
is hot; and when cold, tie them over with other Paper.


_To preserve Peaches whole._

Take the _Newington_ Peach, when full ripe, split it, and take out the
Stone, then have ready a Pan of boiling Water, drop in the Peaches,
and let them have a few Moments scalding; then take them out, and put
them into as much Sugar, only clarified, as will cover them, give them
a Boil round, then scum them and set them by till the next Day; then
boil some more Sugar to blow very strong, which Sugar put to the
Peaches, and give them a good Boil, scum them, and set them by till
the Day following; then give them another good Boil, scum them and put
them into a warm Stove for the Space of two Days; then drain them, and
lay them out one half over the other, dust them and put them into the
Stove; the next Day turn them and dust them, and when thorough dry,
pack them up for Use.


_To preserve Peach-Chips._

Pare your Peaches, and take out the Stones, then cut them into very
thin Slices, not thicker than the Blade of a Knife; then to every
Pound of Chips take one Pound and an Half of Sugar, boiled to blow
very strong, then throw in the Chips, and give them a good Boil, then
let them settle a little, take off the Scum, and let them stand a
Quarter of an Hour, then give them another good Boil, and let them
settle as before; then take off the Scum, cover them, and set them by;
the next Day drain them, and lay them out Bit by Bit, dust them, and
dry them in a warm Stove; when dry on one Side, take them from the
Plate with a Knife, and turn them on a Sieve; and then again, if they
are not pretty dry, which they generally are.


_To put them in Jelly._

Draw a Jelly from Codlins, and when they are boiled enough, take as
much Jelly as Sugar, boil the Sugar to blow very strong, then put in
the Jelly, give it a Boil and put it to the Chips; give all a Boil
and scum them, then put them into your Glasses.


_To preserve Walnuts White._

Take the largest _French_ Walnuts, when full grown, but before they
are hard, pare off the green Shell to the White, and put them into
fair Water; then throw them into boiling Water, and boil them till
very tender; then drain them and put them into a clarified Sugar, give
them a gentle Heat; the next Day boil some more Sugar to blow, and put
it to them, giving them a Boil; the next Day boil some more Sugar to
blow very strong, put it to the Walnuts, give them a Boil, scum them,
and put them by, then drain them and put them on Plates, dust them and
put them into a warm Stove to dry.


_To preserve Walnuts Black._

Take of the smaller Sort of Walnuts, when full grown, and not shelled;
boil them in Water till very tender, but not to break, so they will
become black; then drain them, and stick a Clove in every one, and put
them into your preserving Pan, and if you have any Peach Syrup, or of
that of the white Walnuts, it will be as well or better than Sugar;
put as much Syrup as will cover the Walnuts, boil them very well, then
scum them and set them by; the next Day boil the Syrup till it becomes
smooth, then put in the Walnuts and give them another good Boil; the
Day after drain them and boil the Syrup till it becomes very smooth,
adding more Syrup, if Occasion; give all a Boil, scum them, and put
them in your Pot for Use.

    _Note_, These Walnuts are never offered as a Sweet-meat, being of
    no Use but to purge gently the Body, and keep it open.


_To preserve Nectarines._

Split the Nectarines, and take out the Stones, then put them into a
clarified Sugar; boil them round, till they have well taken Sugar;
then take off the Scum, cover them with a Paper and set them by; the
next Day boil a little more Sugar till it blows very strong, and put
it to the Nectarines, and give them a good Boil; take off the Scum,
cover them, and put them into the Stove; the next Day drain them and
lay them out to dry, first dusting them a little, then put them into
the Stove.


_To preserve green Amber-Plumbs._

Take the green Amber-Plumbs, when full grown, prick them in two or
three Places, and put them into cold Water; then set them over the
Fire to scald, in which you must be very careful not to let the Water
become too hot, lest you hurt them; when they are very tender, put
them into a very thin Sugar, that is to say, one Part Sugar, and two
Parts Water; give them a little Warm in this Sugar, and cover them
over; the next Day give them a Warm again; the third Day drain them
and boil the Syrup, adding a little more Sugar; then put the Syrup to
the Plumbs, and give them a Warm; the next Day do the same; the Day
following boil the Syrup till it becomes a little smooth, put in the
Plumbs and give them a Boil; the Day after boil the Syrup till very
smooth, then put it to the Plumbs, cover them, and put them into the
Stove; the next Day boil some more Sugar to blow very strong, put it
to the Fruit and give all a Boil, then put them into the Stove for two
Days; then drain them and lay them out to dry, first dusting them very
well, and manage them in the Drying as other Fruits.

    _Note_, If you find them shrink when first you put them into
    Sugar, you must let them lie in that thin Syrup three or four
    Days, till they begin to work; then casting away that Syrup, begin
    the Work as already set down.


_To preserve Green Orange-Plumbs._

Take the green Orange-Plumbs, when full grown, before they turn, prick
them with a fine Bodkin, as thick all over as possible you can; put
them into cold Water as you prick them, when all are done, set them
over a very slow Fire, and scald them with the utmost Care you can,
nothing being so subject to break, for if the Skin flies they are
worth nothing; when they are very tender, take them off the Fire and
set them by in the same Water for two or three Days; when they become
sour, and begin to float on the Top of the Water, be careful to drain
them very well; then put them in single Rows in your preserving Pan,
and put to them as much thin Sugar as will cover them, that is to say,
one Part Sugar, and two Parts Water; then set them over the Fire, and
by Degrees warm them till you perceive the Sourness to be gone, and
the Plumbs are sunk to the Bottom, set them by; and the next Day throw
away that Syrup, and put to them a fresh Sugar, of one Part Sugar, and
one Part Water; in this Sugar give them several Heats, but not to
boil, lest you burst them; then cover them, and set them in a warm
Stove that they may suck in what Sugar they will; the next Day drain
the Sugar, and boil it till it becomes smooth, adding some more fresh
Sugar; pour this Sugar on them, and return them into the Stove; the
next Day boil the Syrup to become very smooth, and pour it upon your
Plumbs, and give all a gentle Boil, scum it and put them into the
Stove; the Day following drain them out of that Syrup, and boil some
fresh Sugar, as much as you judge will cover them, till very smooth
put it to your Plumbs, and give all a very good covered Boiling; then
take off the Scum and cover them, let them stand in the Stove two
Days, then drain them and lay them out to dry, dusting them very well.


_To preserve the green Mogul-Plumb._

Take this Plumb when just upon the turning ripe, prick with a
Pen-knife to the very Stone on that Side where the Cleft is, put them
into cold Water as you do them, then set them over a very slow Fire to
scald; when they are become very tender, take them carefully out of
the Water and put them into a thin Sugar, that is, half Sugar, and
half Water, warm them gently, then cover them, and set them by; the
next Day give them another Warm and set them by; the Day following
drain their Syrup and boil it smooth, adding to it a little fresh
Sugar, and give them a gentle Boil, the Day after boil the Sugar very
smooth, pour it upon them and set them in the Stove for two Days; then
drain them and boil a fresh Sugar to be very smooth, or just to blow a
little, put it to your Plumbs and give them a good covered Boiling;
then scum them and put them into the Stove for two Days, then drain
them and lay them out to dry, dusting them very well.


_To preserve the Green Admirable-Plumb._

    This is a little round Plumb, about the Size of a Damson; it
    leaves the Stone, when ripe, is somewhat inclining to a Yellow in
    Colour, and very well deserves its Name, being of the finest Green
    when done, and with the tenth Part of the Trouble and Charge, as
    you will find by the Receipt.

Take this Plumb, when full grown, and just upon the Turn, prick them
with a Pen-knife in two or three Places, and scald them, by Degrees,
till the Water becomes very hot, for they will even bear boiling;
continue them in the Water till they become green, then drain them,
and put them into a clarified Sugar, boil them very well, then let
them settle a little, and give them another Boil; if you perceive they
shrink and take not the Sugar in very well, prick them with a Fork all
over as they lie in the Pan, and give them another Boil, scum them,
and set them by; the next Day boil some other Sugar till it blows, and
put it to them, and give them a good Boil, then scum them and set them
in the Stove for one Night; the next Day drain them and lay them out,
first dusting them.


_To preserve yellow Amber-Plumbs._

Take these Plumbs, when full ripe, put them into your preserving Pan,
and put to them as much Sugar as will cover them, and give them a very
good Boil; then let them settle a little, and give them another Boil
three or four Times round the Fire, scum them, and the next Day drain
them from the Syrup, and return them again into the Pan, and boil as
much fresh Sugar as will cover them to blow; give them a thorough
Boiling, and scum them, and set them in the Stove twenty-four Hours;
then drain them, and lay them out to dry, after having dusted them
very well.

    _Note_, In the scalding of green Plumbs, you must always have a
    Sieve in the Bottom of your Pan to put your Plumbs in, that they
    may not touch the Bottom, for those that do, will burst before the
    others are any thing warm.


_To put Plumbs in Jelly._

Any of these Sorts of Plumbs are very agreeable in Jelly, and the same
Method will do for all as for one: I might make some Difference which
would only help to confound the Practitioner, and thereby swell this
Treatise in many Places; but, as I have promised, so I will endeavour
to lay down the easiest Method I can to avoid Prolixity, and proceed
as above, _viz._

[Plumbs in Jelly.] When your Plumbs are preserved in their first
Sugar, and you have drained them in order to put them in a second,
they are then fit to be put up Liquid, which you must do thus: Drain
the Plumbs, and strain the Syrup through a Bag; then make a Jelly of
some ripe Plumbs and Codlins together, by boiling them in just as much
Water as will cover them, press out the Juice and strain it, and to
every Pint of Juice boil one Pound of Sugar to blow very strong, put
in the Juice and boil it a little; then put in the Syrup and the
Plumbs, and give all a good Boil; then let them settle a little, scum
them and fill your Glasses or Pots.


_To preserve green Figs._

Take the small green Figs, slit them on the Top, and put them in Salt
and Water for ten Days, and make your Pickle as follows.

Put in as much Salt into the Water as will make it bear an Egg, then
let it settle, take the Scum off, and put the clear Brine to the Figs,
and keep them in Water for ten Days; then put them into fresh Water,
and boil them till a Pin will easily pass into them; then drain them
and put them into other fresh Water, shifting them every Day for four
Days; then drain them, and put them into a clarified Sugar; give them
a little Warm, and let them stand till the next Day; then warm them
again, and when they are become green give them a good Boil, then boil
some other Sugar to blow, put it to them, and give them another good
Boil; the next Day drain them and dry them.


_To preserve ripe Figs._

Take the white Figs, when ripe, slit them in the Top, and put them
into a clarified Sugar, and give them a good Boil; then scum them, and
set them by; the next Day boil some more Sugar till it blows, and pour
it upon them, and boil them again very well, scum them and set them in
the Stove; the Day after drain them and lay them out to dry, first
dusting them very well.


_To preserve green Oranges._

Take the green Oranges and slit them on one Side, and put them into a
Brine of Salt and Water, as strong as will bear an Egg, in which you
must soak them at least fifteen Days; then drain them and put them
into fresh Water, and boil them tender; then put them into fresh
Water, again, shifting them every Day for five Days together; then
give them another Scald, and put them into a clarified Sugar; then
give them a Boil, and set them by till next Day, then boil them again;
the next Day add some more Sugar, and give them another Boil; the Day
after boil the Syrup very smooth and pour it on them, and keep them
for Use.

    _Note_, That if at any Time you perceive the Syrup begin to work,
    you must drain them, and boil the Syrup very smooth and pour it on
    them; but if the first prove sour, you must boil it likewise.
    Green Lemons are done after the same Manner.

    _Note also_, If the Oranges are any thing large, you must take out
    the Meat from the inside.


_To preserve green Grapes._

Take the largest and best Grapes before they are thorough ripe, stone
them and scald them, but let them lie two Days in the Water they were
scalded in; then drain them and put them into a thin Syrup, and give
them a Heat over a slow Fire; the next Day turn the Grapes in the Pan
and warm them again; the Day after drain them and put them into a
clarified Sugar, give them a good Boil, and scum them, and set them
by; the following Day boil some more Sugar to blow, and put it to the
Grapes, and give them a good Boil, scum them and set them in a warm
Stove all Night; the next Day drain them and lay them out to dry,
first dusting them very well.


_To preserve Bell-Grapes in Jelly._

Take the long, large Bell, or Rouson-Grapes, and pick them from the
Stalks, then Stone them and put them in boiling Water, and give them a
thorough Scald; then take them from the Fire and cover them close
down, so that no Steam can come out; then set them upon a very gentle
Fire, so as not to boil for two or three Hours; then take them out,
and put them into a clarified Sugar boiled, till it blows very strong,
as much Sugar as will a little more than cover them; then give them a
good Boil and let them settle a little: then give them another Boil,
scum them, and then boil some other Sugar to blow very strong; and
take as much Plumb-Jelly as Sugar, and give all a Boil, then add to it
the Grapes, and give them all a Boil together, scum them well, and put
them up into your Pots or Glasses.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
