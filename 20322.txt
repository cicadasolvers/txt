CORRECTIONS ADOPTED BY POPE FROM THE DUNCES.

In Pope's "Letter to the Honourable James Craggs," dated June 15, 1711,
after making some observations on Dennis's remarks on the _Essay on
Criticism_, he says--

    "Yet, to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines
    with reason; and I will alter them in case of another edition: I will
    make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury, and so serve
    instead of a friend."

An interesting paper might be drawn up from the instances, for they are
rather numerous, in which Pope followed out this very sensible rule. I do
not remember seeing the following one noted. One of the heroes of the
_Dunciad_, Thomas Cooke, the translator of Hesiod, was the editor of a
periodical published in monthly numbers, in 8vo., of which nine only
appeared, under the title of _The Comedian, or Philosophical Inquirer_, the
first number being for April, and the last for December, 1732. It contains
some curious matter, and amongst other papers is, in No. 2., "A Letter in
Prose to Mr. Alexander Pope, occasioned by his Epistle in Verse to the Earl
of Burlington." It is very abusive, and was most probably written either by
Cooke or Theobald. After quoting the following lines as they then stood:

 "He buys for Topham drawings and designs,
  For Fountain statues, and for Curio coins,
  Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone,
  And books for Mead, and rarities for Sloane,"

the letter-writer thus unceremoniously addresses himself to the author:

    "Rarities! how could'st thou be so silly as not to be particular in the
    rarities of Sloane, as in those of the other five persons? What
    knowledge, what meaning is conveyed in the word _rarities_? Are not
    some drawings, some statues, some coins, all monkish manuscripts, and
    some books, _rarities_? Could'st thou not find a trisyllable to express
    some parts of nature for a collection of which that learned and worthy
    physician is eminent? Fy, fy! correct and write--

     'Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone,
      And books for Mead, and butterflies for Sloane.'

    {542}

    "Sir Hans Sloane is known to have the finest collection of butterflies
    in England, and perhaps in the world; and if rare monkish manuscripts
    are for Hearne only, how can rarities be for Sloane, unless thou
    specifyest what sort of rarities? O thou numskull!"--No. 2., pp.
    15--16.

The correction was evidently an improvement, and therefore Pope wisely
accepted the benefit, and was the channel through which it was conveyed;
and the passage accordingly now stands as altered by the letter-writer.

NOTES ON SEVERAL MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS.

(_Continued from_ p. 522.)

_Dare_, to lurk, or cause to lurk; used both transitively and
intransitively. Apparently the root of _dark_ and _dearn_.

 "Here, quod he, it ought ynough suffice,
  Five houres for to slepe upon a night:
  But it were for an olde appalled wight,
  As ben thise wedded men, that lie and _dare_,
  As in a fourme sitteth a wery hare."

Tyrwhitt's utterly unwarranted adoption of Speght's interpretation is
"_Dare_, v. Sax. to stare." The reader should always be cautious how he
takes upon trust a glossarist's sly fetch to win a cheap repute for
learning, and over-ride inquiry by the mysterious letters Sax. or Ang.-Sax.
tacked on to his exposition of an obscure word. There is no such Saxon
vocable as _dare_, to stare. Again, what more frequent blunder than to
confound a secondary and derivative sense of a word with its radical and
primary--indeed, sometimes to allow the former to usurp the precedence, and
at length altogether oust the latter: hence it comes to pass, that we find
_dare_ is one while said to imply peeping and prying, another while
trembling or crouching; moods and actions merely consequent or attendant
upon the elementary signification of the word:

 "I haue an hoby can make larkys to _dare_."
    Skelton's _Magnifycence_, vol. i. p.269. l. 1358., Dyce's edition;

on which line that able, but therein mistaken editor's note is, "_to dare_,
i. e. to be terrified, to tremble" (he however also adds, it means to lurk,
to lie hid, and remits his reader to a note at p. 379., where some most
pertinent examples of its true and only sense are given), to which add
these next:

 "    .    .   let his grace go forward,
  And _dare_ vs with his cap, like larkes."
    First Fol., _Henry VIII._, Act III, Sc. 2.

 "Thay questun, thay quellun,
  By frythun by fellun,
  The dere in the dellun,
  Thay droupun and _daren_".
    _The Anturs of Arthur at the Tarnewathelan_,
    St. IV. p. 3. Camden Society's Publications.

 "She sprinkled vs with bitter juice of vncouth herbs, and strake
  The awke end of hir charmed rod vpon our heades, and spake
  Words to the former contrarie. The more she charm'd, the more
  Arose we vpward from the ground on which we _darde_ before."
    The XIIII. Booke of Ouid's _Metamorphosis_,
    p. 179. Arthur Golding's translation: London, 1587.

    "Sothely it _dareth_ hem weillynge this thing; that heuenes weren
    before," &c.

And again, a little further on:

    "Forsothe yee moste dere, one thing _dare_ you nougt (or be not
    unknowen): for one day anentis God as a thousande yeeris, and a
    thousande yeer as one day."--_C^m 3^m Petre 2._, Wycliffe's
    translation:

in the Latin Vulgate, _latet_ and _lateat_ respectively; in the original,
[Greek: lanthanei] and [Greek: lanthaneto]. Now the book is before me, I
beg to furnish MR. COLLIER with the references to his usage of _terre_,
mentioned in Todd's _Dictionary_, but not given (Collier's _Shakspeare_,
vol. iv. p. 65., note), namely, 6th cap. of Epistle to Ephesians, _prop.
init._; and 3rd of that to Colossians, _prop. fin._

       *       *       *       *       *


_Die and live._--This _hysteron proteron_ is by no means uncommon: its
meaning is, of course, the same as live and die, _i. e._ subsist from the
cradle to the grave:

 "    .    .    .   Will you sterner be.
  Than he that _dies and lives_ by bloody drops?"
      First Fol., _As You Like It_, Act III. Sc. 5.

All manner of whimsical and farfetched constructions have been put by the
commentators upon this very homely sentence. As long as the question was,
whether their wits should have licence to go a-woolgathering or no, one
could feel no great concern to interfere: but it appears high time to come
to Shakspeare's rescue, when MR. COLLIER'S "clever" old commentator, with
some little variation in the letters, and not much less in the sense, reads
"kills" for dies; but then, in the _Merry Wives of Windsor_, Act II. Sc.
3., the same "clever" authority changes "cride-game (cride I ame), said I
well?" into "curds and cream, said I well?"--an alteration certainly not at
odds with the host's ensuing question, "said I well?" saving that that, to
liquorish palate, might seem a rather superfluous inquiry.

 "With sorrow they both _die and live_
  That unto richesse her hertes yeve."
      _The Romaunt of the Rose_, v. 5789-90.

 "He is a foole, and so shall he _dye and liue_,
  That thinketh him wise, and yet can he nothing."
      _The Ship of Fooles_, fol. 67., by Alexander Barclay, 1570.

{543}

    "Behold how ready we are, how willingly the women of Sparta will _die
    and live_ with their husbands."--_The Pilgrimage of Kings and Princes_,
    p. 29.

Except in Shakspeare's behalf, it would not have been worth while to
exemplify so unambiguous a phrase. The like remark may also be extended to
the next word that falls under consideration.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Kindly_, in accordance with kind, viz. nature. Thus, the love of a parent
for a child, or the converse, is kindly: one without natural affection
([Greek: astorgos]) is unkind, kindless, as in--

 "Remorselesse, treacherous, letcherous, _kindles_ villaine."
                          _Hamlet_, Act II. Sc. 2.

Thence _kindly_ expanded into its wider meaning of general benevolence. So
under another phase of its primary sense we find the epithet used to
express the excellence and characteristic qualities proper to the idea or
standard of its subject, to wit, genuine, thrifty, well-liking,
appropriate, not abortive, monstrous, prodigious, discordant. In the
Litany, "the _kindly_ fruits of the earth" is, in the Latin versions
"genuinus," and by Mr. Boyer rightly translated "les fruits de la terre
chaqu'un selon son espece;" for which Pegge takes him to task, and
interprets _kindly_ "fair and good," through mistake or preference adopting
the acquired and popular, in lieu of the radical and elementary meaning of
the word. (_Anonymiana_, pp. 380--1. Century VIII. No. LXXXI.) The
conjunction of this adjective with _gird_ in a passage of _King Henry VI_.
has sorely gravelled MR. COLLIER: twice over he essays, with equal success,
to expound its purport. First, _loc. cit._, he finds fault with _gird_ as
being employed in rather an unusual manner; or, if taken in its common
meaning of taunt or reproof, then that _kindly_ is said ironically; because
there seems to be a contradiction in terms. (Monck Mason's rank distortion
of the words, there cited, I will not pain the reader's sight with.) MR.
COLLIER'S note concludes with a supposition that _gird_ may possibly be a
misprint. This is the misery! Men will sooner suspect the text than their
own understanding or researches. In Act I. Sc. 1. of _Coriolanus_,
dissatisfied with his previous note, MR. COLLIER tries again, and thinks a
_kindly gird_ may mean a gentle reproof. That the reader may be able to
judge what it does mean, it will be necessary to quote the king's _gird_,
who thus administers a kindly rebuke to the malicious preacher against the
sin of malice, _i.e._ chastens him with his own rod:

 "_King._ Fie, uncle Beauford, I have heard you preach,
  That mallice was a great and grievous sinne:
  And will not you maintaine the thing you teache,
  But prove a chief offender in the same?

  _Warn._ Sweet king: the bishop hath a _kindly gyrd_."
    First Part of _King Henry VI._, Act III. Sc. 1. 1st Fol.

A _gird_, akin to, in keeping with, fitting, proper to the cardinal's
calling; an evangelical _gird_ for an evangelical man: what more _kindly_?
_Kindly_, connatural, homogeneous. But now for a bushel of examples, some
of which will surely avail to insense the reader in the purport of this
epithet, if my explanation does not:

    "God in the congregation of the gods, what more proper and
    _kindly_"?--Andrewes' Sermons, vol. v. p. 212. _Lib. Ang.-Cath. Theol._

    "And that (pride) seems somewhat _kindly_ too, and to agree with this
    disease (the plague). That pride which swells itself should end in a
    tumour or swelling, as, for the most part, this disease doth."--_Id._,
    p. 228.

    "And so, you are found; and they, as the children of perdition should
    be, are lost. Here are you: and where are they? Gone to their own
    place, to Judas their brother. And, as is most _kindly_, the sons to
    the father of wickedness; there to be plagued with him for
    ever."--_Id._, vol. iv. p. 98.

    "For whatsoever, as the Son of God, He may do, it is _kindly_ for Him,
    as the Son of Man, to save the sons of men."--_Id._, p. 253.

    "There cannot be a more _kindly_ consequence than this, our not failing
    from their not failing: we do not, because they do not."--_Id._, p.
    273.

    "And here falls in _kindly_ this day's design, and the visible 'per
    me,' that happened on it."--_Id._, p. 289.

    "And having then made them, it is _kindly_ that viscera misericordiae
    should be over those opera that came de visceribus."--_Id._, p. 327.

    "The children came to the birth, and the right and _kindly_ copulative
    were; to the birth they came, and born they were: in a kind consequence
    who would look for other?"--_Id._, p. 348.

    "For usque adeo proprium est operari Spiritui, ut nisi operetur, nec
    sit. So _kindly_ (proprium) it is for the spirit to be working as if It
    work not, It is not."--_Id._, vol. iii. p. 194.

    "And when he had overtaken, for those two are but presupposed, the more
    _kindly_ to bring in [Greek: epelabeto], when, I say, He had overtaken
    them, cometh in fitly and properly [Greek: epilambanetai]."--_Id._,
    vol. i. p. 7.

    "No time so _kindly_ to preach de Filio hodie genito as hodie."--_Id._,
    p. 285.

    "A day whereon, as it is most _kindly_ preached, so it will be most
    _kindly_ practised of all others."--_Id._, p. 301.

    "Respice et plange: first, 'Look and lament' or mourn; which is indeed
    the most _kindly_ and natural effect of such a spectacle."--_Id._, vol.
    ii. p. 130.

    "Devotion is the most proper and most _kindly_ work of
    holiness."--_Id._, vol. iv. p. 377.

Perhaps the following will be thought so apposite, that I may be spared the
labour, and the reader the tedium of perusing a thousand other examples
that might be cited:

    And there is nothing more _kindly_ than for them that will be touching,
    to be touched themselves, and to {544} be touched home, in the same
    _kind_ themselves thought to have touched others."--_Id._, vol. iv. p.
    71.[1]

(_To be continued._)

[Footnote 1: _Kindly_ is quite a pet word with Andrewes, as, besides the
passages quoted, he employs it in nearly the same sense in vol. iii., at
pp. 18. 34. 102. 161. 189. 262. 308. 372. 393. 397.; in vol. i., at pp.
100. 125. 151. 194. 214.; in vol. ii. at pp. 53. 157. 307. 313. 338. The
same immortal quibbler is also very fond of the word _item_, using it, as
our cousins across the Atlantic and we in Herefordshire do at the present
day, for "a hint."]

DEVONIANISMS.

_Miserable._--_Miserable_ is very commonly used in Devonshire in the
signification of _miserly_, with strange effect until one becomes used to
it. Hooker the Judicious, a Devonshire man, uses the word in this sense in
the _Eccl. Polity_, book v. ch. lxv. p. 21.:

    "By means whereof it cometh also to pass that the mean which is virtue
    seemeth in the eyes of each extreme an extremity; the liberal-hearted
    man is by the opinion of the prodigal _miserable_, and by the judgment
    of the _miserable_ lavish."

_Few._--Speaking of broth, people in Devon say a _few broth_ in place of a
little, or some broth. I find a similar use of the word in a sermon
preached in 1550, by Thomas Lever, Fellow of St. John's College, preserved
by Strype (in his _Eccles. Mem._, ii. 422.). Speaking of the poor students
of Cambridge, he says:

    "At ten of the clock they go to dinner, whereas they be content with a
    penny piece of beef among four, having a _few pottage_ made of the
    broth of the same beef, with salt and oatmeal, and nothing else."

_Figs, Figgy._--Most commonly _raisins_ are called _figs_, and plum-pudding
_figgy_ pudding. So with plum-cake, as in the following rhymes:--

 "Rain, rain, go to Spain,
  Never come again:
  When I brew and when I bake,
  I'll give you a _figgy_ cake."

_Against_ is used like the classical _adversum_, in the sense of _towards_
or _meeting_. I have heard, both in Devonshire and in Ireland, the
expression to send _against_, that is, to send _to meet_, a person, &c.

The foregoing words and expressions are probably provincialisms rather than
Devonianisms, good old English forms of expression; as are, indeed, many of
the so-called Hibernicisms.

_Pilm, Farroll._--What is the derivation of _pilm_=dust, so frequently
heard in Devon, and its derivatives, _pilmy_, dusty: it _pilmeth_? The
cover of a book is there called the _farroll_; what is the derivation of
this word?

THE POEMS OF ROWLEY.

The tests propounded by MR. KEIGHTLEY (Vol. vii. p. 160.) with reference to
the authenticity of the poems of Rowley, namely the use of "its," and the
absence of the feminine rhyme in _e_, furnish additional proof, if any were
wanting, that Chatterton was the author of those extraordinary productions.
Another test often insisted upon is the occurrence, in those poems, of
borrowed thoughts--borrowed from poets of a date posterior to that of their
pretended origin. Of this there is one instance which seems to have escaped
the notice of Chatterton's numerous annotators. It occurs at the
commencement of _The Tournament_, in the line,--

 "The _worlde_ bie _diffraunce_ ys ynn _orderr_ founde."

It will be seen that this line, a very remarkable one, has been cleverly
condensed from the following passage in Pope's _Windsor Forest_:--

 "But as the _world_, harmoniously confused,
  Where _order_ in variety we see;
  And where, tho' all things _differ_, all agree."

This sentiment has been repeated by other modern writers. Pope himself has
it in the _Essay on Man_, in this form,--

 "The lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife
  Gives all the strength and colour of our life."

It occurs in one of Pascal's _Pensees_:

    "J'ecrirai ici mes pensees sans ordre, et non pas peut-etre dans une
    confusion sans dessein: C'est le veritable ordre, et qui marquera
    toujours mon objet par le desordre meme."

Butler has it in the line,--

 "For discords make the sweetest airs."

Bernardin de St. Pierre, in his _Etudes de la Nature_:

    "C'est des contraires que resulte l'harmonie du monde."

And Burke, in nearly the same words, in his _Reflections on the French
Revolution_:

    "You had that action and counteraction, which, in the natural and in
    the political world, from the reciprocal struggle of discordant powers,
    draws out the harmony of the universe."

Nor does the sentiment belong exclusively to the moderns. I find it in
Horace's twelfth Epistle:

 "Nil parvum sapias, et adhuc sublimia cures,
      .    .    .    .    .    .
  Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors."

{545}

Lucan, I think, has the same expression in his _Pharsalia_; and it forms
the basis of Longinus's remark on the eloquence of Demosthenes:

    [Greek: "Oukoun ten men phusin ton epanaphoron kai asundeton pantei
    phulattei tei sunechei metabolei? houtos autoi kai he taxis atakton,
    kai empalin he ataxia poian perilambanei taxin."]

It may be said that, as Pope adopted the thought from Horace or Lucan, so a
poet of the fifteenth century (such as the supposed Rowley) might have
taken it from the same sources. But a comparison of the line in _The
Tournament_ with those in _Windsor Forest_ will show that the borrowing
embraces not only the thought, but the very words in which it is expressed.

_Legend of Llangefelach Tower._--A different version of the legend also
exists in the neighbourhood, viz. that the day's work on the tower being
pulled down each night by the old gentleman, who was apparently
apprehensive that the sound of the bells might keep away all evil spirits,
a saint, of now forgotten name, told the people that if they would stand at
the church door, and throw a stone, they would succeed in building the
tower on the "spot where it fell," which accordingly came to pass.

_Wedding Divination._--Being lately present on the occasion of a wedding at
a town in the East Riding of Yorkshire, I was witness to the following
custom, which seems to take rank as a genuine scrap of folk-lore. On the
bride alighting from her carriage at her father's door, a plate covered
with morsels of bride's cake was flung from a window of the second story
upon the heads of the crowd congregated in the street below; and the
divination, I was told, consists in observing the fate which attends its
downfall. If it reach the ground in safety, without being broken, the omen
is a most _un_favourable one. If on the other hand, the plate be shattered
to pieces (and the more the better), the auspices are looked upon as most
happy.

SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.

_Shakspearian Drawings._--I have very recently become possessed of some
curious drawings by Hollar; those relating to Shakspeare very interesting,
evidently done for one Captain John Eyre, who could himself handle the
pencil well.

The inscription under one is as follows, in the writing of the said J.
Eyre:

    "Ye house in ye Clink Streete, Southwarke, now belonging to Master
    Ralph Hansome, and in ye which Master Shakspeare lodged in ye while he
    writed and played at ye Globe, and untill ye yeare 1600 it was at the
    time ye house of Grace Loveday. Will had ye two Rooms over against ye
    Doorway, as I will possibly show."

Size of the drawing, 12 x 7, "W. Hollar delin., 1643." It is an exterior
view, beautifully executed, showing very prominently the house and a
continuation of houses, forming one side of the street.

The second has the following inscription in the same hand:

    "Ye portraiture of ye rooms in ye which Master Will Shakspeare lodged
    in Clink Streete, and which is told to us to be in ye same state as
    when left by himself, as stated over ye door in ye room, and on the
    walls were many printed verses, also a portraiture of Ben Jonson with a
    ruff on a pannel."

Size of the drawing 11-5/8 x 6-7/8, "W. Hollar delin., 1643:" shows the
interior of three sides, and the floor and ceiling, with the tables,
chairs, and reading-desk; an open door shows the interior of his
sleeping-room, being over the entrance door porch.

The third--

    "Ye Globe, as to be seen before ye Fire in ye year 1615, when this
    place was burnt down. This old building," &c.

Here follows a long interesting description. It is an exterior view; size
of drawing 71/4 wide x 9-7/8 high, "W. H. 1640."

The fourth shows the stage, on which are two actors: this drawing, 7-7/8 x
61/2, was done by J. Eyre, 1629, and on which he gives a curious description
of his accompanying Prince Charles, &c.; at this time he belonged to the
Court, as he also accompanied that prince to Spain.

The fifth, done by the same hand in a _most masterly manner_, pen and ink
portrait of Shakspeare, copied, as he writes, from a portrait belonging to
the Earl of Essex, with interesting manuscript notice.

The sixth, done also by J. Eyre:

    "Ye portraiture of one Master Ben Jonson, as on ye walls of Master Will
    Shakspeare's rooms in Clinke Streete, Southwarke."--J. E. 1643.

The first three, in justice to Hollar, independent of the admirers of the
immortal bard and lovers of antiquities, should be engraved as "Facsimiles
of the Drawings." This shall be done on my receiving the names of sixty
subscribers, the amount of subscription one guinea, for which each
subscriber will receive three engravings, to be paid for when delivered.

_Thomas Shakspeare._--From a close examination of the documents referred to
(as bearing the signature of Thomas Shakspeare) in my last {546}
communication to "N. & Q.," Vol. vii., p. 405.), and from the _nature_ of
the _transaction_ to which they relate, _my impression_ is, that he was by
profession a money scrivener in the town of Lutterworth; a circumstance
which may possibly tend to the discovery of his family connexion (if any
existed) with William Shakspeare.

CHARLECOTE.

_Passage in Macbeth, Act I. Sc. 5._--

 "    .    .    .   Come, thick night,
  And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
  That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
  Nor heaven peep through the _blanket_ of the dark,
  To cry, Hold, hold!"

In MR. PAYNE COLLIER'S _Notes and Emendations_, p. 407., we are informed
that the old corrector substitutes _blankness_ for _blanket_. The change is
to me so exceedingly bad, even if made on some sort of authority (as an
extinct 4to.), that I should have let it be its own executioner, had not
MR. COLLIER apparently given in his adhesion to it. I now beg to offer a
few obvious reasons why _blanket_ is unquestionably Shakspeare's word.

In the _Rape of Lucrece_, Stanza CXV., we have a passage very nearly
parallel with that in _Macbeth_:

 "O night, thou furnace of foul reeking smoke,
  Let not the jealous day behold thy face,
  Which underneath thy _black all-hiding cloak_,
  Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace."

In _Lucrece_, the _cloak_ of night is invoked to screen a deed of adultery;
in _Macbeth_ the _blanket_ of night is invoked to hide a murder: but the
foul, reeking, smoky cloak of night, in the passage just quoted, is clearly
parallel with the smoky blanket of night in _Macbeth_. The complete imagery
of both passages has been happily caught by Carlyle (_Sartor Resartus_,
1841, p. 23.), who, in describing night, makes Teufelsdroeckh say:

    "Oh, under that _hideous coverlet of vapours, and putrefactions, and
    unimaginable gases_, what a fermenting-vat lies simmering and hid!"

_"Discourse of Reason"_ (Vol. vii., p. 497.).--This phrase, "generally
supposed to be peculiarly Shakspearian," which A. E. B. has indicated in
his quotation from Philemon Holland, occurs also in Dr. T. Bright's
_Treatise of Melancholy_, the date of which is 1586. In the third page of
the dedicatory epistle there is this sentence:

    "Such as are of quicke conceit, and delighted in _discourse of reason_
    in naturall things."

Here, then, is another authority against Gifford's proposed "emendation" of
the expression as it occurs in _Hamlet_.

Minor Notes.

_The MSS. of Gervase Hollis._--These were taken during the reign of Charles
I., and continue down to the middle of Charles II. In Harl. MSS. 6829, will
be found a most curious and valuable volume, containing the painted glass,
arms, monuments, brasses, and epitaphs in the various churches and chapels,
&c. throughout the county of Lincoln. The arms are all drawn in the margin
in colours. Being taken before the civil war, they contain all those which
were destroyed or defaced by the Parliament army. They were all copied by
Gough, which he notices in his _Brit. Top._, vol. i. p. 519., but not
printed.

His genealogical collections are contained in a series of volumes marked
with the letters of the alphabet, and comprehended in the Lansdowne
Catalogue under No. 207. The Catalogue is very minute, and the contents of
the several volumes very miscellaneous; and some of the genealogical notes
are simply short memoranda, which, in order to be made available, must be
wrought out from other sources. They all relate more or less to the county
of Lincoln. One of these, called "Trusbut," was presented to the British
Museum by Sir Joseph Banks in 1817, and will be found in Add. MSS. 6118.

Queries.

SMITH, YOUNG, AND SCRYMGEOUR MSS.

Thomas Smith, in his _Vitae Illustrium_, gives extracts from a so-called
Ephemeris of Sir Peter Young, but which Sir Peter compiled during the
latter years of his life. Thomas Hearne says, in a note to the Appendix to
Leland's _Collectanea_, that he had had the use of some of Smith's MSS.
This Ephemeris of Sir Peter Young may be worth the publishing if it can be
found: can any of your readers say whether it is among Smith's or Hearne's
MSS., or if it be preserved elsewhere? Peter Young, and his brother
Alexander, were pupils of Theodore Beza, having been educated chiefly at
the expense of their maternal uncle Henry Scrymgeour, to whose valuable
library Peter succeeded. It was brought to Scotland by Alexander about the
year 1573 or 1574, and was landed at Dundee. It was especially rich in
Greek MSS.; and Dr. Irvine, in his "Dissertation on the Literary History of
Scotland," prefixed to his _Lives of the Scottish Poets_, says of these
MSS. and library, "and the man who is so fortunate as to redeem them from
obscurity, shall assuredly be thought to have merited well from the
republic of letters." It is much to be feared, however, that as to the MSS.
this good fortune awaits no man; for Sir Peter Young seems to have given
them to his fifth son, Patrick Young, the eminent Greek scholar, who was
librarian to Prince Henry, and, after his death, to the king, and to
Charles I. Patrick Young's house was unfortunately burned, and in it
perished many MSS. belonging to himself and to others. If Scrymgeour's MSS.
escaped the fire, they are to be sought for in the remnant of Patrick
Young's collection, wherever that went, or in the King's Library, of which
a considerable part was preserved. Young's house was burned in 1636, and he
is supposed to have carried off a large number of MSS. from the royal
library, after the king's death in 1649. If therefore Scrymgeour's MSS.
were among these, it is possible that they may yet be traced, for they
would be sold with Young's own, after his death in 1652. This occurred on
the 7th of September, rather suddenly, and he left no will, and probably
gave no directions about his MSS. and library, which were sold _sub hasta_,
probably within a few months after his death, and with them any of the MSS.
which he may have taken from the King's Library, or may have had in his
possession belonging to others. Smith says that he had seen a large
catalogue of MSS. written in Young's own hand. Is this catalogue extant?
Patrick Young left two daughters, co-heiresses: the elder married to John
Atwood, Esq.; the younger, to Sir Samuel Bowes, Kt. A daughter of the
former gave to a church in Essex a Bible which had belonged to Charles I.;
but she knew so little of her grandfather's history that she described him
as Patrick Young, Esq., library keeper to the king, quite unconscious that
he had been rector of two livings, and a canon and treasurer of St. Paul's.
Perhaps, after all, the designation was not so incorrect, for though he
held so many preferments, he never was in priest's orders, and sometimes
was not altogether free from suspicion of not being a member of the Church
of England at all, except as a recipient of its dues, and of course, a
deacon in its orders.

But it may be worthy of note, as affording another clue by which,
perchance, to trace some of Scrymgeour's MSS., that Sir Thomas Bowes, Kt.,
who was Sir Symonds D'Ewes's literary executor, employed Patrick Young to
value a collection of coins, &c., among which he recognised a number that
had belonged to the king's cabinet, and which Sir Symonds had purchased
from Hugh Peters, by whom they had been purloined. Young taxed Peters with
having taken books, and MSS. also, which the other denied, with the
exception of two or three, but was not believed. I do not know what
relation Sir Thomas Bowes was to Sir Samuel, who married Young's second
daughter, nor to Paul Bowes, who edited D'Ewes's _Journals_ in 1682. It is
quite possible that some of Scrymgeour's MSS. may have fallen into D'Ewes's
hands, may have come down, and be recognisable by some mark.

As to Scrymgeour's books, it is probable that they were deposited in Peter
Young's house of Easter Seatoun, near to Arbroath, of which he obtained
possession about 1580, and which remained with his descendants for about
ninety years, when his great-grandson sold it, and purchased the castle and
part of the lands of Aldbar. That any very fine library was removed thither
is not probable, especially any bearing Henry {548} Scrymgeour's name; and
for this reason, that Thomas Ruddiman was tutor to David Young, and was
resident at Aldbar, and would hardly have failed to notice, or to record,
the existence of any so remarkable a library as Scrymgeour's, or even of
Sir Peter Young's, who was himself an ardent collector of books, as appears
from some of his letters to Sir Patrick Vans (_recte_ Vaux) which I have
seen, and as might be inferred from his literary tastes and pursuits. There
is perhaps reason to believe that Sir Peter's library did not descend in
his family beyond his eldest son, Sir James Young, who made an attempt to
deprive the sons of his first marriage (the elder of whom died in infancy)
of their right of succession to their grandfather's estates, secured to
them under their father's marriage contract, and which attempt was defeated
by their uncle, Dr. John Young, Dean of Winchester (sixth son of Sir
Peter), who acquired from Lord Ramsay, eldest son of the Earl of Dalhousie,
part of the barony of Baledmouth in Fife. Dean Young founded a school at
St. Andrew's, on the site of which is now built Dr. Bell's Madras College.

Sir Peter Young the elder, knighted in 1605, has been sometimes confounded
with his third son, Peter, who received his knighthood at the hands of
Gustavus Adolphus, on the occasion of that king being invested with the
Order of the Garter.

Another fine library (Andrew Melville's) was brought into Scotland about
the same time as Scrymgeour's; and it is creditable to the statesmen of
James's reign that there was an order in the Scotch exchequer, that books
imported into Scotland should be free from custom. A note of this order is
preserved among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum; but my reference
to the number is not at hand.

_The Cross in Mexico and Alexandria._--In _The Unseen World; Communications
with it, real and imaginary, &c._, 1850, a work which is attributed to an
eminent divine and ecclesiastical historian of the English Church, it is
stated that--

    "It was a tradition in Mexico, before the arrival of the Spaniards,
    that when that form (the sign of the cross) should be victorious, the
    old religion should disappear. The same sign is also said to have been
    {549} discovered on the destruction of the temple of Serapis at
    Alexandria, and the same tradition to have been attached to it."--P.

The subject is very curious, and one in which I am much interested. I am
anxious to refer to the original authorities for the tradition in both
cases. It is known that the Mexicans worshipped the cross as the god of
rain. We have the following curious account thereof in _The Pleasant
Historie of the Conquest of West India, now called Newe Spayne_, translated
out of the Spanish tongue by T. N., anno 1578:

    "At the foote of this temple was a plotte like a churchyard, well
    walled and garnished with proper pinnacles; in the midst whereof stoode
    a crosse of ten foote long, the which they adored for god of the rayne;
    for at all times whe they wanted rayne, they would go thither on
    procession deuoutely, and offered to the crosse quayles sacrificed, for
    to appease the wrath that the god seemed to have agaynste them: and
    none was so acceptable a sacrifice, as the bloud of that little birde.
    They used to burne certaine sweete gume, to perfume that god withall,
    and to besprinkle it with water; and this done, they belieued assuredly
    to haue rayne."--P. 41.

_Passage in St. James._--I hope you will not consider the following Query
unsuited to your publication, and in that case I may confidently anticipate
the removal of my difficulty.

In reading yesterday Jeremy Taylor's _Holy Living and Dying_, I came to
this passage (p. 308. Bohn's edition):

    "St. James, in his epistle, notes the folly of some men, his
    contemporaries, who were so impatient of the event of to-morrow, or the
    accidents of next year, or the good or evils of old age, that they
    would consult astrologers and witches, oracles and devils, what should
    befall them the next calends--what should be the event of such a
    voyage--what God had written in his book concerning the success of
    battles, the election of emperors, &c.... Against this he opposes his
    counsel, that we should not search after forbidden records, much less
    by uncertain significations," &c.

Now my Query is, To what epistle of St. James does the eloquent bishop
refer? If to the canonical epistle, to what part? To the words (above
quoted) "forbidden records" there is a foot-note, which contains only the
well-known passage in Horace, lib. i. od. xi., and two others from
Propertius and Catullus.

_Santa Claus._--Reading _The Wide Wide World_ recalled to my mind this
curious custom, which I had remarked when in America. I was then not a
little surprised to find so strange a superstition lingering in puritanical
New England, and which, it is needless to remark, was quite novel to me.
_Santa Claus_ I believe to be a corruption of _Saint Nicholas_, the
tutelary saint of sailors, and consequently a great favourite with the
Dutch. Probably, therefore, the custom was introduced into the western
world by the compatriots of the renowned Knickerbocker.

It is unnecessary to describe the nature of the festivity, as it is so
graphically pourtrayed in Miss Wetherell's, or rather Warner's work, to
which I would refer those desirous of further acquaintance with the
subject; the object of this Query being to learn, through some of the
American or other correspondents of "N. & Q.," the original legend, as well
as the period and events connected with the immigration into "The States"
of that beneficent friend of Young America, _Santa Claus_.

    palmer's staff, which he had made hollow before on purpose, and so he
    brought this root into this realm, with venture of his life; for if he
    had been taken, by the law of the country from whence it came, he had
    died for the fact."

_Isping Geil._--In a charter of Joanna Fossart, making a grant of lands and

passage as given in Dugdale's _Monasticon_ (I quote from Bohn's edition,
1846, vol. vi. p. 1025.):

    "Dedi eis insuper domos meas in Eboraco; illas scilicet quae sunt inter
    domos Laurentii clerici quae fuerunt Benedicti Judaei et _Isping Geil_,

Can any of your readers, and in particular any of our York antiquaries,
inform me whether the "Isping Geil" mentioned in this passage is the name
of a person, or of some locality in that city now obsolete? In either case
I should be glad of any information as to the etymology of so singular
{550} a designation, which may possibly have undergone some change in
copying.

I have a singular copy of this book, and know at present of no other copy.
The booksellers all seem at a loss as to who the author was; some say
Jeremy Taylor, others George Herbert; but my date does not allow the
latter,--at least it makes it very improbable, unless it was published
after his death. The book itself is like George Herbert's style, very solid
and homely; it is evidently by some masterly hand. Should you be able to
give me information, or get it for me, I should be obliged. I think of

Minor Queries with Answers.

_Turkey Cocks._--Why are Turkey cocks so called, seeing they were not
imported from Turkey?

CAPE.

    [This Query did not escape the notice of Dr. Samuel Pegge. He says;
    "The cocks which Pancirollus (ii. tit. 1.) mentions as brought from
    America, were Turkey cocks, as Salmuth there (p. 28.) rightly observes.
    The French accordingly call this bird _Coq d'Inde_, and from _d'Inde_
    comes the diminutive _Dindon_, the young Turkey; as if one should say,
    'the young Indian fowl.' Fetching the Turkey from America accords well
    with the common notion:

     'Turkeys, carps, hops, pikarel, and beer,
      Came into England all in a year;'

    that is, in the reign of Henry VIII., after many voyages had been made
    to North America, where this bird abounds in an extraordinary manner.
    But Query how this bird came to be called Turkey? Johnson latinizes it
    _Gallina Turcica_, and defines it, 'a large domestic fowl brought from
    Turkey;' which does not agree with the above account from Pancirollus.
    Brookes says (p. 144.), 'It was brought into Europe either from India
    or Africa.' And if from the latter, it might be called _Turkey_, though
    but improperly."--_Anonymiana_, cent. x. 79.]

_Bishop St. John._--The following passage occurs at vol. iv. p. 84. of the
Second Series of Ellis's _Original Letters, Illustrative of English

1685-6, and addressed "for John Ellis, Esq., Secretary of his Majesty's
Revenue in Ireland, Dublin:"

    "The Bishop of London's fame runs high in the vogue of the people. The
    London pulpits ring strong peals against Popery; and I have lately
    heard there never were such eminently able men to serve in those cures.
    The Lord Almoner Ely is thought to stand upon too narrow a base now in
    his Majesty's favour, from a late violent sermon on the 5th of
    November. I saw him yesterday at the King's Levy; and very little
    notice taken of him, which the more confirms what I heard. Our old

"PYLADES AND CORRINA."--PSALMANAZAR AND DEFOE.

(Vol. vii., pp. 206. 305. 435. 479.)

I had forwarded for insertion a short answer to the Query as to _Pylades
and Corinna_ before DR. MAITLAND'S communication was printed; but as it now
appears more distinctly what was the object of the Query, I can address
myself more directly to the point he has raised. And, in the first place, I
cannot suppose that Defoe had anything to do with _Pylades and Corinna_, or
the _History of Formosa_. In all Defoe's fictions there is at least some
trace of the master workman, but in neither of these works is there any
putting forth of his power, or any similitude to his manner or style. When
the _History of Formosa_ appeared (1704), he was ingrossed in politics, and
was not, as far as any evidence has yet informed us, in the habit of
translating or doing journeyman work for booksellers. Then the book itself
is, in point of composition, far beneath Defoe, even in his most careless
moods. As to _Pylades and Corinna_, Defoe died so soon after Mrs.
Thomas--she died on the 3rd February, 1731, and he on the 24th April
following, most probably worn out by illness--that time seems scarcely
afforded for getting together and working up the materials of the two
volumes published. The editor, who signs himself "Philalethes," dates his
Dedication to the first volume, in which are contained the particulars
about Psalmanazar, "St. John Baptist, 1731," which day would be after
Defoe's death. Nor is there any ground for supposing that Defoe and Curll
had much connexion as author and publisher. Curll only printed two works of
Defoe, as far as I have been able to discover, the _Memoirs of Dr.
Williams_ (1718, 8vo.), and the _Life of Duncan Campbell_ (1720, 8vo.), and
for his doing so, in each case, a good reason may be given. As regards the
genuineness of the correspondence in _Pylades and Corinna_, I do not see
any reason to question it. Sir Edward Northey's certificate, and various
little particulars in the letters themselves, entirely satisfy me that the
correspondence is not a fictitious one. The anecdotes of Psalmanazar are
quite in accordance with his own statements in his Life--(see particularly
p. 183., _Memoirs_, 1765, 8vo.); and if they were pure fiction, is it not
likely that, living in London at the time when they appeared, he would have
contradicted them? In referring (Vol. vii., p. 436., "N. & Q.") to the
_Gentleman's Magazine_ for these anecdotes, I had not overlooked their
having appeared in _Pylades and Corinna_, but had not then the latter book
at hand to include it in the reference. DR. MAITLAND considers _Pylades and
Corinna_ "a farrago of low rubbish, utterly beneath criticism." Is not this
rather too severe and sweeping a character? Unquestionably the poetry is
but so-so, and of the poem the greater part might have been dispensed with;
but, like all Curll's collections, it contains some matter of interest and
value to those who do not despise the minutiae of literary investigation.
The Autobiography of the unfortunate authoress (Mrs. Thomas), who was only
exalted by Dryden's praise to be ignominiously degraded by Pope, and "whose
whole life was but one continued scene of the utmost variety of human
misery," has always appeared to me an interesting and rather affecting
narrative; and, besides a great many occasional notices in the
correspondence, which are not without their use, there are interspersed
letters from Lady Chudleigh, Norris of Bemerton, and others, which are not
to be elsewhere met with, and which are worth preserving.

For Psalmanazar's character, notwithstanding his early peccadilloes, I can
assure DR. MAITLAND that I have quite as high a respect as himself, even
without the corroborative evidence of our great moralist, which on such a
subject may be considered as perfectly conclusive.

ROBERT WAUCHOPE, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH.

(Vol. vii., p. 66.)

This prelate seems to have been a cadet of the family of Wauchope, of
Niddry, or Niddry Marischall, in the county of Midlothian, to which family
once belonged the lands of Wauchopedale in Roxburghshire. The exact date of
his birth I have never been able to discover, nor which "laird of Niddrie"
he was the son of. Robert was a favourite name in the family long before
his time, as is evidenced by an inscription at the entry to a burial chapel
belonging to the family to this effect: "This tome was Biggit Be Robert
Vauchop of Niddrie Marchal, and interit heir 1387." I am at present out of
reach of all books of reference, and have only a few manuscript memoranda
to direct further research; and these memoranda, I am sorry to say, are not
so precise in their reference to chapter and verse as they ought to be.

According to these notes, mention is made of Robert Wauchope, doctor of
Sorbonne, by Leslie, bishop of Ross, in the 10th book of his _History_; by
Labens, a Jesuit, in the 14th tome of his _Chronicles_; by Cardinal
Pallavicino, in the 6th book of his _Hist. Conc. Trid._; by Fra Paolo
Sarpi, in his _Hist. Conc. Trid._ Archbishop Spottiswood says that he died
in Paris in the year 1551, "much lamented of all the university," on his
return home from one of his missions to Rome.

One of my notes, taken from the _Memoirs of Sir James Melville_, I shall
transcribe, as it is suggestive of other Queries more generally
interesting. The date is 1545:

    "Now the ambassador met in a secret part with Oneel(?) and his
    associates, and heard their offers and overtures. And the patriarch of
    Ireland did meet him there, who was a Scotsman born, called Wauchope,
    and was blind of both his eyes, and yet had been divers times at Rome
    by post. He did great honour to the ambassadour, and conveyed him to
    see St. Patrick's Purgatory, which is like an old coal pit which had
    taken fire, by reason of the smoke that came out of the hole."

Query 1. What was the secret object of the ambassador?

Query 2. Has St. Patrick's Purgatory any existence at the present time?

SEAL OF WILLIAM D'ALBINI.

(Vol. vii., p. 452.)

The curious article of your correspondent SENEX relative to this seal, as
described and figured in Barrett's _History of Attleburgh_, has a peculiar
interest as connected with the device of a man combating a lion.

The first time I saw this device was in a most curious MS. on "Memorial
Trophies and Funeral Monuments, both in the old Churches of London before
the Fire, and the Churches and Mansions in many of the Counties of
England." The MS. is written by Henry St. George, and will be found in
Lansd. MSS. 874. The arms and tombs are all elaborately and carefully
drawn, with their various localities, and the epitaphs which belong to
them; and the whole is accompanied with an Index of Persons, and another of
Places.

At p. 28. this device of a man combating a lion is represented associated
with a shield of arms of many quarterings, showing the arms and alliances
of the royal family of Stuart, and is described as having formed the
subject of a window in the stewards house adjoining the church of St.
Andrew's, Holborn. In the _Catalogue of the Lansdowne MSS._ is a long and
interesting note on this device, with references to the various works where
it may be found, to which I have had access at the Museum, and find them
correct, and opening a subject for investigation of a most curious kind.

The figure of the knight, in this drawing, differs considerably from that
on Dr. Barrett's seal. He is here represented on foot, dressed in the chain
mail and tunic of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with a close-barred
helmet, with a broad flat crown, such as was worn in France in the time of
Louis IX., called St. Louis. The lion is in the act of springing upon him,
and he is aiming a deadly blow at him with a ragged staff, as his sword
lies broken at his feet. The figure is represented as fighting on the green
sward. From a cloud over the lion proceeds an arm clothed in chain mail,
and holding in the hand, suspended by a baldrick, a shield bearing the arms
of France (modern[3])--Azure, three fleurs-de-lis or. On a scutcheon of
pretence in the centre, Argent, a lion ramp. gules, debruised with ragged
staff, proper. This device forms the 1st quarter of the quarterings of the
Stuart family.

In this device there is no figure of a lizard, dragon, or chimera,
whichever it is, under the horse's feet, as represented in the seal of
D'Albini.

I could much extend this reply, by showing the antiquity of this device,
which by a long process of investigation I have traced as connected with
the legendary songs of the troubadours; but I think I have said sufficient
for the present, in reply to SENEX.

In addition to the above, I may mention a seal of a somewhat similar
character to that of D'Albini, representing a knight on horseback, with his
sword in his hand, and his shield of arms, which are also on the housings
of the horse, under whose feet is the dragon: on the reverse is the {553}
combat of the knight with the lion. The knight is holding his shield in
front, and holding his sword in his left hand. This seal is that of Roger
de Quincy, earl of Winchester, and appended to a deed "M.CC. Quadrigresimo
Quinto." It occurs in Harl. MSS. 6079. p. 127.

[Footnote 3: I say _modern_, for the ancient arms of France were Azure,
semee of fleurs-de-lis, as they are represented in old glass, when
quartered with those of England by our Henries and Edwards.]

Pray request SENEX to withdraw every word he has said about me. I do not
recollect that I ever said or wrote a word about the Seal of William
D'Albini; and I cannot find that my name occurs in Dr. Barrett's volume.

"WILL" AND "SHALL."

(Vol. vii., p. 356.)

The difficulty as to the proper use of the auxiliaries _shall_ and _will_,
will be found to arise from the fact, that while these particles
respectively convey a different idea in the _first_ person singular and
plural, from that which they imply in the _second_ and _third_ persons
singular and plural, the distinction has been lost sight of in the
amalgamation of _both_; as if they were interchangeable, in _one_ tense,
according to the old grammatical formula _I shall_ or _will_. With a view
of giving my own views on the subject, and attempting to supply what
appears to me a grammatical deficiency, I shall proceed to make a few
remarks; from which I trust your Hong Kong correspondent W. T. M. may be
able to form "a clear and definite rule," and students of English assisted
in their attempts to overcome this formidable conversational "shibboleth."

The fact is simply thus:--_Will_ is _volitive_ in the _first_ persons
singular and plural; and simply _declarative_ or _promissory_ in the
_second_ and _third_ persons singular and plural. _Shall_, on the other
hand, is _declaratory_ or _promissory_ in the _first_ person singular and
plural; _volitive_ in the _second_ and _third_ singular and plural. Thus,
the so-called future is properly divisible into _two_ tenses: the _first_
implying _influence_ or _volition_; the _second_ (or future proper)
_intention_ or _promise_. Thus:

      1.                         2.

  I _will_ go.        I _shall_ go.
  Thou _shalt_ go.    Thou _wilt_ go.
  He _shall_ go.      He _will_ go.
  We _will_ go.       We _shall_ go.
  You _shall_ go.     You _will_ go.
  They _shall_ go.    They _will_ go.

When the above is thoroughly comprehended by the pupil, it will be only
necessary to impress upon his mind (as a concise rule) the necessity of
making use of a different auxiliary in speaking of the future actions of
_others_, when he wishes to convey the same idea respecting _such actions_
which he has done, or should do, in speaking of his _own_, and _vice
versa_. Thus:

  I _will_ go, and you _shall_ accompany me.

(_i. e._ it is my _wish_ to go, and also that you shall accompany me.)

  I _shall_ go, and you _will_ accompany me.

(_i. e._ it is my _intention_ to go; and believe, or know, that it is your
_intention_ to accompany me.)

The philosophical reason for this distinction will be evident, when we
reflect upon the various ideas produced in the mind by the expression of
either _volition_ or mere _intention_ (in so far as the latter is
distinguishable from active _will_) with regard to _our own_ future
actions, and the same terms with reference to the future actions of
_others_. It will be seen that a mere _intention_ in the _first_ person,
becomes _influence_ when it extends to the _second_ and _third_; we know
nothing, _a priori_ (as it were) of the _intentions_ of others, except in
so far as we may have the power of _determining_ them. When I say "_I_
shall go" (_j'irai_), I merely express an _intention_ or _promise_ to go;
but if I continue "_You_ and _they_ shall go," I convey the idea that _my_
intention or promise is operative on _you_ and _them_; and the terms which
I thus use become unintentionally influential or expressive of an extension
of _my_ volition to the actions of _others_. Again, the terms which I use
to signify _volition_, with reference to _my own_ actions, are but
_declaratory_ or _promissory_ when I speak of _your_ actions, or those of
_others_. I am conscious of _my own_ wish to go; but _my_ wish not
influencing _you_, I do, by continuing the use of the same auxiliary, but
express my belief or knowledge that _your_ wish is, or will be, coincident
with _my own_. When I say "I will go" (_je veux aller_), I express a desire
to go; but if I add, "_You_ and _they_ will go," I simply promise on behalf
of _you_ and _them_, or express _my_ belief or knowledge that _you_ and
_they_ will also desire to go.

It is not unworthy of note, that the nice balance between _shall_ and
_will_ is much impaired by the constant use of the ellipse, "I'll, you'll,"
&c.; and that _volition_ and _intention_ are, to a great extent,
co-existent and inseparable in the _first_ person: the metaphysical reasons
for this do not here require explanation.

I am conscious that I have not elucidated this apparently simple, but
really complex question, in so clear and concise a manner as I could have
wished; but, feeling convinced that my principle at least is sound, I leave
it, for better consideration, in the hands of your correspondent.

Brightland's rule is,--

 "In the first person simply _shall_ foretells;
  In _will_ a threat or else a promise dwells:
  {554}
  _Shall_ in the second and the third does threat;
  _Will_ simply then foretells the coming feat."

Mitford, _Harmony of Language_; and note 5. in Rev. R. Twopeny's

The inconsistency in the use of _shall_ and _will_ is best explained by a
doctrine of Mr. Hare's (J. C.  H.), the _usus ethicus_ of the future. (See
_Cambridge Philological Museum_, vol. ii. p. 203., where the subject is
mentioned incidentally, and in illustration; and Latham's _English

INSCRIPTIONS IN BOOKS.

(Vol. vii., p. 127.)

Your correspondent BALLIOLENSIS, at p. 127. of the current volume of "N. &
Q.," gives several forms of inscriptions in books. The following may prove
interesting to him, if not to the generality of your readers.

A MS. preserved in the Bibliotheque Sainte Genevieve--it appears to have
been the cellarer's book of the ancient abbey of that name, and to have
been written about the beginning of the sixteenth century--bears on the
fly-sheet the name of "Mathieu Monton, religieux et celerier de l'eglise de
ceans," with the following verses:

 "Qui ce livre cy emblera,
  Propter suam maliciam
  Au gibet pendu sera,
  Repugnando superbiam
  Au gibet sera sa maison,
  Sive suis parentibus,
  Car ce sera bien raison,
  Exemplum datum omnibus."

An Ovid, printed in 1501, belonging to the Bibliotheque de Chinon, has the
following verses:

 "Ce present livre est a Jehan Theblereau.

   "Qui le trouvera sy lui rende:
    Il lui poyra bien le vin
    Le jour et feste Sainct Martin,
    Et une mesenge a la Sainct Jean,
          Sy la peut prendre.

    "Tesmoin mon synet manuel, cy mis le x^e jour de avril mil v^c trente
    et cyns, apres Pasque."

Here follows the paraphe.

School-boys in France write the following lines in their books after their
names, and generally accompany them with a drawing of a man hanging on a
gibbet:

 "Aspice Pierrot pendu,
  Quod librum n'a pas rendu;
  Pierrot pendu non fuisset,
  Si librum reddidisset."

English school-boys use these forms:

 "Hic liber est meus
  Testis est Deus.
  Si quis furetur
  A collo pendetur
  Ad hunc modum."

This is always followed by a drawing of a gibbet.

         "John Smith, his book.
  God give him grace therein to look;
  Not only look but understand,
  For learning is better than house or land.
  When house and land are gone and spent,
  Then learning is most excellent."

 "John Smith is my name,
  England is my nation,
  London is my dwelling-place,
  And Christ is my salvation.
  When I am dead and in my grave,
  And all my bones are rotten,
  When this you see, remember me,
  When I am 'most forgotten."

 "Steal not this book, my honest friend,
  For fear the gallows should be your end,
  And when you're dead the Lord should say,
  Where is the book you stole away?"

 "Steal not this book for fear of shame,
  For under lies the owner's name:
  The first is JOHN, in letters bright,

BACON'S "ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING."

(Vol. vii., p.493.)

I have to thank L. for his notice of my edition of the _Advancement of
Learning_, as well as for the information which he has given me, of which I
hope to have an early opportunity of availing myself. As he expresses a
hope that it may be followed by similar editions of other of Bacon's works,
I may state that the _Essays_, with the _Colours of Good and Evil_, are
already printed, and will be issued very shortly. I am quite conscious that
the references in the margin are by no means complete: indeed, as I had
only _horae subsecivae_ to give to the work, I did not attempt to make them
so. {555} But I thought it might be useful to give a general indication of
the sources from which the writer drew, and therefore put in all that I
could find, without the expenditure of a great deal of time. Consequently I
fear that those I have omitted will not be found to be the most obvious.

I shall be glad to make a few remarks on some of the passages noticed by L.

P. 25.--Of this piece of carelessness--for which I do not the less feel
that I deserved a rebuke because L. has not administered it--I had already
been made aware by the kindness of a friend. I confess I had never heard of
Osorius, which is perhaps no great matter for wonder; but I looked for his
name both in Bayle and the catalogue of the library of the British Museum,
and by some oversight missed it. I have since found it in both. I cannot
help, however, remarking that this is a good example of the advantage of
noting _every_ deviation from the received text. Had I tacitly transposed
three letters of the word in question (a small liberty compared with some
that my predecessors have taken), my corruption of the text might have
passed unnoticed. I have not had much experience in these things; but if
the works of English writers in general have been tampered with by editors
as much as I have found the _Advancement_ and _Essays_ of Lord Bacon to be,
I fear they must have suffered great mutilation. I rather incline to think
it is the case, for I have had occasion lately to compare two editions of
Paley's _Horae Paulinae_, and I find great differences in the text. All this
looks suspicious.

P. 34.--I spent some time in searching for this passage in Aristotle, but I
could not discover it. I did not look elsewhere.

P. 60.--In the forthcoming edition of the _Essays_ I have referred to
Plutarch, _Gryll._, 1., which I incline to think is the passage Bacon had
in his mind. The passage quoted from Cicero I merely meant to point out for
comparison.

P. 146.--The passage quoted is from Sen. _ad Lucil._, 52.

P. 147.--_Ad Lucil._, 53.

P. 159.--_Ad Lucil._, 71.

Two or three other passages from Seneca will be found without any
reference. One of them, p. 13., "Quidam sunt tam umbratiles ut putent in
turbido esse quicquid in luce est," I have taken some pains to hunt for,
but hitherto without success. Another noticeable one, "Vita sine proposito
languida et vaga est," is from _Ep. ad Lucil._, 95.

For the reference to Aristotle I am much obliged. I was anxious to trace
all the quotations from Aristotle, but could not find this one.

P. 165.--I cannot answer this question. Is it possible that he was thinking
of St. Augustine? In the _Confessions_, i. 25., we kind the expression
_vinum erroris_.

P. 177.--No doubt Bacon had read the treatise of Sallust quoted, but my
impression is that he thought the proverb had grown out of the line in
Plautus.

P. 180.--I have searched again for "alimenta socordiae," as it is quoted in
the _Colours of Good and Evil_, but cannot fix upon any passage from which
I can say it was taken, though there are many which might have suggested
it. One at p. 19. of the _Advancement_, which I missed at first, I have
since met with. It is from the _Cherson._, p. 106.

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_Test for a good Lens._--The generality of purchasers of photographic
lenses can content themselves with merely the following rules when they
buy. It ought to be achromatic, _i. e._ consisting of the usual two pieces
of crown and flint glass, that its curves are the most recommended, and
that it is free from bubbles: to ascertain the latter, hold the lens
between the finger and thumb of the right hand, much as an egg-merchant
examines an egg before a strong gas flame, and a little to the right of it;
this reveals every bubble, however small, and another kind of texture like
minute gossamer threads. If these are too abundant, it should not be
chosen; although the best lenses are never altogether free from these
defects, it is on the whole better to have one or two good-sized bubbles
than any density of texture; because it follows, that every inequality will
refract pencils of light out of the direction they ought to go; and as
bubbles do the same thing, but as they do not refract away so much light,
they are not of much consequence.

I believe if a lens is made as thin as it safely can be, it will be quicker
than a thicker one. I have two precisely the same focus, and one thinner
than the other; the thinner is much the quicker of the two. An apparently
indifferent lens should be tried with several kinds of apertures, till it
will take sharp pictures; but if no size of aperture can make it, or a
small aperture takes a very long time, it is a bad lens. M. Claudet, whose
long experience in the art has given him the requisite judgment, changes
the diameter of his lenses often during the day; and tries occasionally, in
his excellent plan, the places of the chemical focus: by this his time is
always nearly the same, and the results steady. As he is always free in
communicating his knowledge, he will, I think, always explain his method
when he is applied to. The inexperienced photographer is often too prone to
blame his lens when the failure proceeds more from the above causes. The
variation of the chemical focus during a day's work is often the cause of
disappointment: though it does not affect the landscape so much as the
portrait operator. {556}

If any one has a lens, the chemical and visual focus being different, his
only remedy is M. Claudet's method. And this method will also prove better
than any other way at present known of ascertaining whether a lens will
take a sharp picture or not. If, however, any plan could be devised for
making the solar spectrum visible upon a sheet of paper inside the camera,
it would reduce the question of taking sharp pictures at once into a matter
of certainty.

All lenses, however, should be tried by the opticians who sell them; and if
they presented a specimen of their powers to a buyer, he could see in a
moment what their capabilities were.

_Photography and the Microscope_ (Vol. vii., p. 507.).--I beg to inform
your correspondents R. I. F. and J., that in Number 3. of the _Quarterly
Journal of Microscopical Science_ (Highley, Fleet Street) they will find
three papers containing more or less information on the subject of their
Query; and a plate, exhibiting two positive photographs from collodion
negatives, in the same number, will give a good idea of what they may
expect to attain in this branch of the art.

Practically, I know nothing of photography; but, from my acquaintance with
the modern achromatic microscope, I venture to say that photography applied
to this instrument will be of no farther use than as _an assistant to the
draughtsman_. A reference to the plates alluded to will show how
incompetent it is to produce _pictures_ of microscopic objects: any one who
has seen these objects under a good instrument will acknowledge that these
specimens give but a very faint idea of what the microscope actually
exhibits.

It is unfortunately the case, that the more perfect the instrument, the
less adapted it is for producing photographic pictures; for, in those of
the latest construction, the aperture of the object-glasses is carried to
such an extreme, that the observer is obliged to keep his hand continually
on the fine adjustment, in order to accommodate the focus to the different
_planes_ in which different parts of the object lie. This is the case even
with so low a power as the half-inch object-glasses, those of Messrs.
Powell and Lealand being of the enormous aperture of 65 deg.; and if this is
the case while looking through the instrument when this disadvantage is
somewhat counteracted by the power which the eye has, to a certain degree,
of adjusting itself to the object under observation, how much more
inconvenient will it be found in endeavouring to focus the whole object at
once on the ground glass plate, where such an accommodating power no longer
exists. The smaller the aperture of the object-glasses, in reason, the
better they will be adapted for photographic purposes.

Again, another peculiarity of the object-glasses of the achromatic
microscope gives rise to a farther difficulty; they are over-corrected for
colour, the spectrum is reversed, or the violet rays are projected beyond
the red: this is in order to meet the requirements of the eye-piece. But
with the photographic apparatus the eye-piece is not used, so that, after
the object has been brought visually into focus in the camera, a farther
adjustment is necessary, in order to focus for the actinic rays, which
reside in the violet end of the spectrum. This is effected by withdrawing
the object-glass a little from the object, in which operation there is no
guide but experience; moreover, the amount of withdrawal differs with each
object-glass.

However, the inconvenience caused by this over-chromatic correction may, I
think, be remedied by the use of the achromatic condenser in the place of
an object-glass; that kind of condenser, at least, which is supplied by the
_first_ microscopic makers. I cannot help thinking that this substitution
will prove of some service; for, in the first place, the power of the
condenser is generally equal to that of a quarter of an inch object-glass,
which is perhaps the most generally useful of all the powers; and again,
its aperture is, I think, not usually so great as that which an
object-glass of the same power would have; and, moreover, as to correction,
though it is slightly spherically under-corrected to accommodate the
plate-glass under the object, yet the chromatic correction is _perfect_.
The condenser is easily detached from its "fittings," and its application
to the camera would be as simple as that of an ordinary object-glass.

However, my conviction remains that, in spite of all that perseverance and
science can accomplish, it never will be in the power of the photographer
to produce a picture of an object under the microscope, _equally distinct
in all its parts_; and unless his art can effect this, I need scarcely say
that his best productions can be but useful auxiliaries to the draughtsman.

I see by an advertisement that the Messrs. Highley supply everything that
is necessary for the application of photography to the microscope.

In reply to your correspondent J., I would ask if he has any photographic
apparatus? if so, the answer to his question "What extra apparatus is
required to a first-rate microscope in order to obtain photographic
microscopic pictures?" would be _None_; but if not, he would require a
camera, or else a wooden conical body, with plate-holder, &c., besides the
ordinary photographic outfit. Part III. of the _Microscopical Journal_,
published by Highley & Son, Fleet Street, will give him all the information
he requires. {557}

[phi]. (p. 506.) may find a solution of his difficulties regarding the
production of stereoscopic pictures, in the following considerations. The
object of having two pictures is to present to _each eye_ an image of what
it sees in nature; but as the angle subtended by a line, of which the
pupils of the eyes form the extremities, must differ for every distance,
and for objects of varying sizes, it follows there is no _absolute_ rule
that can be laid down as the only correct one. For _distant_ views there is
in nature scarcely any stereoscopic effect; and in a photographic
stereoscopic view the effect produced is not really a representation to the
eye of the _view itself_, but of _a model of such view_; and the apparent
size of the model will vary with the angle of incidence of the two
pictures, being _smaller_ and _nearer_ as the angle increases. I believe
Professor Wheatstone recommends for landscapes 1 in 25, or about half an
inch to every foot.

_Cement for Glass Baths._--In reply to numerous inquiries which have
appeared in "N. & Q." relative to a good cement for making glass baths for
photographic purposes, I send a recipe which I copied a year or two ago
from some newspaper, and which seems likely to answer the purpose: I have
not tried it myself, not being a photographer.

Caoutchouc 15 grains, chloroform 2 ounces, mastic 1/2 an ounce. The two
first-named ingredients are to be mixed first, and after the gum is
dissolved, the mastic is to be added, and the whole allowed to macerate for
a week. When great elasticity is desirable, more caoutchouc may be added.
This cement is perfectly transparent, and is to be applied with a brush
cold.

_Mr. Lyte's Mode of Printing._--All persons who have experienced
disappointment in the printing of their positive pictures will feel obliged
by MR. LYTE'S suggestion as to the bath; but as the preparation of the
positive paper has also a great deal to say to the ultimate result, MR.
LYTE would confer an additional obligation if he gave the treatment he
adopts for this.

I have observed that the negative collodion picture exercises a good deal
of influence on the ultimate colour of the positive, and that different
collodion negatives will give different results in this respect, when the
paper and treatment with each has been precisely the same. Does this
correspond with other persons' experience?

_Eulenspiegel or Ulenspiegel_ (Vol. vii., pp. 357. 416. 507.).--MR. THOMS'S
suggestion, and his quotation in proof thereof from the Chronicler, are
farther verified by the following inscription and verses which I transcribe
from an engraved portrait of the famous jester:

"Ulenspiegel.

    "Ligt Begraben zu Dom in Flandern in der grosen Kirch, auf dem
    Grabister also Likend abgebildet. Starb A^o. 1301."

These lines are above the portrait, and beneath it are the verses next
following:

 "Tchau _Ulenspiegeln_ hier. Das Bildniss macht dich lachen:
  Was wurdst du thun siehst du jhn selber Possen machen?
    Zwar _Thyle_ ist ein Bild und _Spiegel_ dieser Welt,
  Viel Bruder er verliess; Wir treiben Narretheyen,
  In dem uns dunckt, dass wir die grosten Weysen seyen,
    Drum lache deiner selbst; diss Blat dich dir vorstellt."

The portrait, evidently that of a man of large intellect, is very
life-like, and full of animation. He seems to be some fifty years of age or
so; he has a cap, ornamented by large feather, on his head. He is seated in
a chair, has a book in his hand, and is attired in a kind of magisterial
robe bordered with fur. There is a good-humoured roguish twinkle in his
eyes; and I should be inclined to call him, judging from the portrait
before me, an epigrammatist rather than mere vulgar jester. The engraving
is beautifully executed: it has neither date nor place of publication, but
its age may perhaps be determined by the names of the painter (Paulus
Furst) and engraver (P. Troschel). The orthography is by no means of recent
date. I cannot translate the verses to my own satisfaction; and should feel
much obliged if you, MR. EDITOR, or MR. THOMS, would favour the readers of
"N. & Q." with an English version thereof.

correct in his statement as to the colour of barristers' bags; but from the

to red at some period anterior to the trial of Queen Caroline. In Queen
Anne's time they were _green_.

_"Nine Tailors make a Man"_ (Vol. vi., pp. 390. 563.; Vol. vii., p.

collection of Breton ballads, _Barzas-Breiz_, vol. i. p. 35., has the
following passage:

    "Les tailleurs, cette classe vouee au ridicule, en Bretagne, comme dans
    le pays de Galles, en Irlande, en Ecosse, en Allemagne et ailleurs, et
    qui l'etait jadis chez toutes les nations guerrieres, dont la vie
    agitee et errante s'accordait mal avec une existence casaniere et
    paisible. Le peuple dit encore de nos jours en Bretagne, _qu'il faut
    neuf tailleurs pour faire un homme_, et jamais il ne prononce leur nom,
    sans oter son chapeau, et sans dire: 'Sauf votre respect.'"

The saying is current also in Normandy, at least in those parts which
border on Britany. Perhaps some of the readers of "N. & Q." may be able to
say whether it is to be found in other parts of Europe.

_Carr Pedigree_ (Vol. vii., pp. 408. 512.).--W. ST. says that William Carr
married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Sing, Bishop of Cork. The name is
Synge, not Sing. The family name was originally Millington, and was changed
to Synge by Henry VIII. or Queen Elizabeth, on account of the sweetness of
the voice of one of the family, who was a clergyman, and the ancestor of
George Synge, Bishop of Cloyne; Edward Synge, Bishop of Ross; Edward Synge,
Archbishop of Tuam; Edward Synge, Bishop of Leighlin and Ferns; Nicholas
Synge, Bishop of Killaloe; the late Sir Samuel Synge Hutchinson, Archdeacon
of Killala; and of the present Sir Edward Synge.

I cannot find that any of these church dignitaries had a daughter married
to Wm. Carr. Nicholas Synge, Bishop of Killaloe, left a daughter,
Elizabeth, who died unmarried in 1834, aged ninety-nine; but I cannot
discover that either of the other bishops of that family had a daughter
Elizabeth.

_How to stain Deal_ (Vol. vii., p. 356.).--Your correspondent C. will find
that a solution of {559} asphaltum in boiling turpentine is a very good
stain to dye deal to imitate oak. This must be applied when cold with a
brush to the timbers: allowed to get dry, then size and varnish it.

The dye, however, which I always use, is a compound of raw umber and a
small portion of blue-black diluted to the shade required with strong size
in solution: this must be used hot. It is evident that this will not
require the preparatory sizing before the application of the varnish.
Common coal, ground in water, and used the same as any other colour, I have
found to be an excellent stain for roof timbers.

_Old Fogie_ (Vol. vii., p. 354.).--MR. KEIGHTLEY supposes the term of _old
fogie_, as applied to "mature old warriors," to be "of pure Irish origin,"
or "rather of Dublin birth." In this he is certainly mistaken, for the word
_fogie_, as applied to old soldiers, is as well known, and was once as
familiarly used in Scotland, as it ever was or could have been in Ireland.
The race was extinct before my day, but I understand that formerly the
permanent garrisons of Edinburgh, and I believe also of Stirling, Castles,
consisted of veteran companies; and I remember, when I first came to
Edinburgh, of people who had seen them, still talking of "the Castle
fogies."

Dr. Jamieson, in his _Scottish Dictionary_, defines the word "foggie or
fogie," to be first, "an invalid, or garrison soldier," secondly, "a person
advanced in life" and derives it from "Su. G. _fogde_, formerly one who had
the charge of a garrison."

This seems to me a more satisfactory derivation than MR. KEIGHTLEY'S, who
considers it a corruption or diminutive of _old folks_.

    music, parish beadles, and the mobility. It is afterwards placed on the
    top of the Guildhall, and then the fair commences: on the taking down
    of the glove, the fair terminates.--P."

At Macclesfield, in Cheshire, a large glove was, perhaps is, always
suspended from the outside of the window of the town-hall during the
holding of a fair; and as long as the glove was so suspended, every one was
free from arrest within the {560} township, and, I have heard, while going
and returning to and from the fair.

At Free Mart, at Portsmouth, a glove used to be hung out of the town-hall
window, and no one could be arrested during the fortnight that the fair
lasted.

_Arms--Battle-axe_ (Vol. vii., p. 407.).--The families which bore three
Dane-axes or battle-axes in their coats armorial were very numerous in
ancient times. It may chance to be of service to your Querist A.C. to be
informed, that those of Devonshire which displayed these bearings were the
following: Dennys, Batten, Gibbes, Ledenry, Wike, Wykes, and Urey.

_Enough_ (Vol. vii., p. 455.).--In Staffordshire, and I believe in the
other midland counties, this word is usually pronounced _enoo_, and written
_enow_. In Richardson's _Dictionary_ it will be found "enough or enow;" and
the etymology is evidently from the German _genug_, from the verb
_genugen_, to suffice, to be enough, to content, to satisfy. The
Anglo-Saxon is _genog_. I remember the burden of an old song which I
frequently heard in my boyish days:

 "I know not, I care not,
    I cannot tell how to woo,
  But I'll away to the merry green woods,
    And there get nuts _enow_."

This evidently shows what the pronunciation was when it was written.

J. A. H.

_Enough_ is from the same root as the German _genug_, where the first _g_
has been lost, and the latter softened and almost lost in its old English
pronunciation, _enow_. The modern pronunciation is founded, as that of many
other words is, upon an affected style of speech, ridiculed by
Holofernes.[4] The word _bread_, for example, is almost universally called
_bred_; but in Chaucer's poetry and indeed now in Yorkshire, it is
pronounced bre-aed, a dissyllable.

[Footnote 4: The Euphuists are probably chargeable with this corruption.]

In Vol. vii., p. 455. there is an inquiry respecting the change in the
pronunciation of the word _enough_, and quotations are given from Waller,
where the word is used, rhyming with _bow_ and _plough_. But though spelt
_enough_, is not the word, in both places, really _enow_? and is there not,
in fact, a distinction between the two words? Does not _enough_ always
refer to _quantity_, and _enow_ to _number_: the former, to what may be
_measured_; the latter, to that which may be _counted_? In both quotations
the word _enough_ refers to _numbers_?

_Feelings of Age_ (Vol. vii., p. 429.).--A.C. asks if it "is not the
general feeling, that man in advancing years would not like to begin life
again?" I fear not. It is a wisdom above the average of what men possess
that made the good Sir Thomas Browne say:

    "Though I think no man can live well once, but he that could live
    twice, yet for my own part I would not live over my hours past, or
    begin again the thread of my dayes: not upon Cicero's ground--because I
    have lived them well--but for fear I should live them worse. I find my
    growing judgment daily instruct me how to be better, but my untamed
    affections and confirmed vitiosity make me daily do worse. I find in my
    confirmed age the same sins I discovered in my youth; I committed many
    then, because I was a child, and, because I commit them still, I am yet
    an infant. Therefore I perceive a man may be twice a child before the
    days of dotage, and stand in need of AEson's bath before threescore."

The annotator refers to _Cic._, lib. xxiv. ep. 4.:

    "Quod reliquum est, sustenta te, mea Terentia, ut potes, honestissime.
    Viximus: floruimus: non vitium nostrum, sed virtus nostra, nos
    afflixit. Peccatum est nullum, nisi quod non una animam cum ornamentis
    amisimus."--Edit. Orell., vol. iii. part i. p. 335.

However, it seems probable that Sir Thomas meant that this sentiment is
rather to be gathered from Cicero's writings,--not enunciated in a single
sentence.

_Optical Query_ (Vol. vii., p. 430.).--In reply to the optical Query by
H. H., I venture to suggest that a stronger gust of wind than usual might
easily occasion the illusion in question, as I myself have frequently found
in looking at the fans on the tops of chimneys. Or possibly the eyes may
have been confused by gazing on the revolving blades, just as the tongue is
frequently influenced in its accentuation by pronouncing a word of two
syllables in rapid articulations.

_Cross and Pile_ (Vol. vii., p.487.).--Here is another explanation at least
as satisfactory as some of the previous ones:

    "The word _coin_ itself is money struck on the _coin_ or head of the
    flattened metal, by which word _coin_ or _head_ is to be understood the
    _obverse_, the only side which in the infancy of coining bore the
    stamp. Thence the Latin _cuneus_, from _cune_ or _kyn_, the head.

    "This side was also called _pile_, in corruption from _poll_, a head,
    not only from the side itself being the _coin_ or _head_, but from its
    being impressed most commonly with some head in contradistinction to
    the reverse, which, in latter times, was oftenest a cross. Thence the
    vulgarism, _cross or pile, poll, head_."--Cleland's _Specimen of an
    Etymological Vocabulary_, p. 157.

_Capital Punishments_ (Vol. vii., pp. 52. 321.).--The authorities to which
W. L. N. refers not being generally accessible, he would confer a very
great obligation by giving the names and dates of execution of any of the
individuals alluded to by him, who have undergone capital punishment in
this country for exercising the Roman Catholic religion. Herein, it is
almost needless to remark, I exclude such cases as those of Babington,
Ballard, Parsons, Garnett, Campion, Oldcorne, and others, their fellows,
who suffered, as every reader of history knows, for treasonable practices
against the civil and christian policy and government of the realm.

_Thomas Bonnell_ (Vol. vii., p. 305.).--In what year was this person, about
whose published _Life_ J. S. B. inquires, Mayor of Norwich? His name, as
such, does not occur in the lists of Nobbs, Blomefield, or Ewing.

COWGILL.

_Passage in the First Part of Faust_ (Vol. vii., p. 501.).--MR. W. FRASER
will find good illustrations of the question he has raised in his second
suggestion for the elucidation of this passage in _The Abbot_, chap. 15.
_ad fin._ and _note_.

A few weeks after giving this reference, in answer to a question by EMDEE
(see "N. & Q.," Vol. i., p. 262.; Vol. ii., p. 47.), I sent in English, for
I am not a German scholar, as an additional reply to EMDEE, the very same
passage that MR. FRASER has just forwarded, but it was not inserted,
probably because its fitness as an illustration was not very evident.

My intention in sending that second reply was to show that, as in
_Christabel_ and _The Abbot_, the voluntary and _sustained_ effort required
to introduce the evil spirit was of a physical, so in _Faust_ it was of a
mental character; and I confess that I am much pleased now to find my
opinion supported by the accidental testimony of another correspondent.

It must, however, be allowed that the peculiar wording of the passage under
consideration may make it difficult, if not impossible, to separate
_earnest_ from the _magical_ form in which Faust's command to enter his
room is given. Goethe's intention, probably, was to combine and illustrate
both.

As proofs of the belief in the influence of the number _three_ in
incantation, I may refer to Virg. _Ecl._ viii. 73--78.; to a passage in
Apuleius, which describes the resuscitation of a corpse by Zachlas, the
Egyptian sorcerer;

    "Propheta, sic propitiatus, herbulam quampiam ter ob os corporis, et
    aliam pectori ejus imponit."--Apul. _Metamorph._, lib. ii. sect. 39.

nan Shian. (See _The Monastery_, chaps. xi. and xvii.)

_Claret_ (Vol. vii., p. 237.).--The word _claret_ is evidently derived
directly from the French word _clairet_; which is used, even at the present
day, as a generic name for the "_vins ordinaires_," of a light and thin
quality, grown in the south of France. The name is never applied but to red
wines; and it is very doubtful whether it takes its appellation from any
place, being always used adjectively--"_vin clairet_," not _vin_ de
_clairet_. I am perhaps not quite correct in stating, that the word is
always used as an adjective; for we sometimes find _clairet_ used alone as
a substantive; but I conceive that in this case the word _vin_ is to be
understood, as we say "du Bordeaux," "du Champagne," meaning "du vin de
Bordeaux," "du vin de Champagne." _Eau clairette_ is the name given to a
sort of cherry-brandy; and lapidaries apply the name _clairette_ to a
precious stone, the colour of which is not so deep as it ought to be. This
latter fact may lead one to suppose that the wine derived its name from
being _clearer_ and lighter in colour than the more full-bodied vines of
the south. The word is constantly occurring in old drinking-songs. A song
of Olivier Basselin, the minstrel of Vire, begins with these words:

 "Beau nez, dont les rubis out coute mainte pipe
    De vin blanc et clairet."

By the way, this song is the original of one in the musical drama of _Jack
Sheppard_, which many of the readers of "N. & Q." may remember, as it
became rather popular at the time. It began thus:

 "Jolly nose, the bright gems that illumine thy tip,
    Were dug from the mines of Canary."

I am not aware that the plagiarism has been noticed before.

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

Now that the season is arriving for the sportsman, angler, yachtsman, and
lover of nature to visit the wild and solitary beauties of _Gamle Norge_,
nothing could be better timed than the pleasant gossiping _Month in
Norway_, by J. G. Holloway, which forms this month's issue of Murray's
_Railway Library_; or the splendidly illustrated _Norway and its Scenery_,
comprising the _Journal of a Tour_ by Edward Price, Esq., and a _Road Book
for Tourists, with Hints to Anglers and Sportsmen_, edited by T. Forster,
Esq., which forms the new number of Bohn's _Illustrated Library_, and {562}
which is embellished with a series of admirable views by Mr. Price, from
plates formerly published at a very costly price, but which, in this new
form, are now to be procured for a few shillings.

As the Americans have been among the most successful photographic
manipulators, we have looked with considerable interest at a work devoted
to the subject which has just been imported from that country, _The History
and Practice of the Art of Photography, &c._, by Henry H. Snelling, _Fourth
Edition_; and though we are bound to admit that it contains many hints and
notes which may render it a useful addition to the library of the
photographer, we still must pronounce it as a work put together in a loose,
unsatisfactory manner, and as being for the most part a compilation from
the best writers in the Old World.

When Dr. Pauli's _Life of Alfred_ made its appearance it received, as it
deserved, our hearty commendation. We have now to welcome a translation of
it, which has just been published in Bohn's _Antiquarian Library_,--_The
Life of Alfred the Great, translated from the German of Dr. Pauli; to which
is appended Alfred's Anglo-Saxon Version of Orosius, with a literal English
Translation, and an Anglo-Saxon Alphabet and Glossary by_ Benjamin Thorpe;
and it speaks favourably for the spread of the love of real learning, that
it should answer the publisher's purpose to put forth such a valuable book
in so cheap and popular a form. Mr. Thorpe's scholarship is too well known
to require recognition at our hands.

BOOKS RECEIVED.--_Remains of Pagan Saxondom, principally from Tumuli in
England, by_ J. Y. Akerman. The present number contains coloured engravings
of the _Umbo of Shield and Weapons found at Driffield_, and of a _Bronze
Patera from a Cemetery at Wingham, Kent_.--_Gervinus' Introduction to the
History of the Nineteenth Century_. Apparently a carefully executed
translation of Dr. Gervinus' now celebrated brochure issued by Mr. Bohn;
who has, in his _Standard Library_, given us a new edition of _De Lolme on
the Constitution_, with notes by J. Macgregor, M.P.; and in his _Classical
Library_ a translation by C. D. Yonge of _Diogenes Laertius' Lives and
Opinions of the Ancient Philosophers_.

I. A. N. (93rd Highlanders.) _Several correspondents, as well as yourself,
complain of the difficulty of obtaining amber varnish. There are several
Eastern gums which much resemble amber, as also a substance known as
"Highgate resin." Genuine amber, when rubbed together, emits a very
fragrant odour similar to a fresh lemon, and does not abrade the surface.
The fictitious amber, on the contrary, breaks or becomes rough, and has a
resinous turpentine-like smell. Genuine amber is to be obtained generally
of the tobacconists, who have often broken mouth-pieces by them: old
necklaces, now out of use, are sold at a very moderate price by the
jewellers. The amber of commerce, used in varnish-making, contains so much
impurity that the waste of chloroform renders it very undesirable to use.
The amber should be pounded in a mortar, and, to an ounce by_ measure _of
chloroform, add a drachm and a half of amber (only about one-fourth of it
will be dissolved), and this requires two days' maceration. It should be
filtered through fine blotting-paper. Being so very fluid, it runs most
freely over the collodion, and, when well prepared and applied, renders the
surface so hard, and so much like the glass, that it is difficult to know
on which side of the glass the positive really is. The varnish is to be
obtained properly made at from_ 2s. _to_ 2s. 6d. _per ounce; and although
this appears dear, it is not so in use, so very small a portion being
requisite to effectually cover a picture; and the effects exceed every
other application with which we are acquainted,--to say nothing of its_
instantaneously _becoming hard, in itself a most desirable requisite._

---- (Islington). _Your note has been mislaid, but in all probability the
spots in your collodion would be removed by dipping into the bottle a small
piece of iodide of potassium. Collodion made exactly as described by_ DR.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
