  "Indeed Little Susan, I will, if I may."                  22

  I was walking up the street,
  The steeple bells were ringing                            23

  Now, isn't that the best way for little girls to go?      24

  Tommy was a silly boy,
    "I can fly," he said                                    30

  Higgledy, piggledy, see how they run!
  Hopperty, popperty! what is the fun?                      31

  Which is the way to Somewhere Town?
    Oh, up in the morning early                             32

  The boat sails away, like a bird on the wing,
  And the little boys dance on the sands in a ring          33

    Fast as you can                                         36

  "For what are you longing, you three little boys?
    Or what would you like to eat?                          37

[Illustration]

  O ring the bells! O ring the bells!
    We bid you, sirs, good morning                          38

[Illustration]

  Then ring the bells! then ring the bells!
    For this fair time of Maying                            39

  I saw a ship that sailed the sea,
    It left me as the sun went down                         40

[Illustration]

  Yes, that's the girl that struts about,
    She's very proud--so very proud!                        41

  It was Tommy who said,
    "The sweet spring-time is come                          42

  "Shall I sing?" says the Lark,
    "Shall I bloom?" says the Flower                        43

  Little Miss Patty and Master Paul
  Have found two snails on the garden wall                  44

[Illustration]

  Yes, it is sad of them,
    Shocking to me                                          45

[Illustration]

  Now, all of you, give heed unto
    The tale I now relate                                   46

[Illustration]

  What is Tommy running for,
    Running for, running for?                               47

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    Were twelve sweet little girls                          49

  Heigh ho!--time creeps but slow:
    I've looked up the hill so long                         53

  My house is red--a little house,
    A happy child am I                                      54

  Three little girls were sitting on a rail,
    Sitting on a rail, sitting on a rail                    55

  Ring the bells--ring!
  Hip, hurrah for the King!                                 56

UNDER THE WINDOW


  Under the window is my garden,
    Where sweet, sweet flowers grow;
  And in the pear-tree dwells a robin,
    The dearest bird I know.

  Tho' I peep out betimes in the morning,
    Still the flowers are up the first;
  Then I try and talk to the robin,
    And perhaps he'd chat--if he durst.




[Illustration]


  Will you be my little wife,
    If I ask you? Do!
  I'll buy you such a Sunday frock,
    A nice umbrella, too.

  And you shall have a little hat,
    With such a long white feather,
  A pair of gloves, and sandal shoes,
    The softest kind of leather.

  And you shall have a tiny house,
    A beehive full of bees,
  A little cow, a largish cat,
    And green sage cheese.




[Illustration]


  You see, merry Phillis, that dear little maid,
    Has invited Belinda to tea;
  Her nice little garden is shaded by trees--
    What pleasanter place could there be?

  There's a cake full of plums, there are strawberries too,
    And the table is set on the green;
  I'm fond of a carpet all daisies and grass--
    Could a prettier picture be seen?

  A blackbird (yes, blackbirds delight in warm weather,)
    Is flitting from yonder high spray;
  He sees the two little ones talking together--
    No wonder the blackbird is gay!




[Illustration]


  Three tabbies took out their cats to tea,
  As well-behaved tabbies as well could be:
  Each sat in the chair that each preferred,
  They mewed for their milk, and they sipped and purred.
  Now tell me this (as these cats you've seen them)--
  How many lives had these cats between them?




[Illustration]


  Little Fanny wears a hat
    Like her ancient Grannie;
  Tommy's hoop was (think of that!)
    Given him by Fanny.




[Illustration]


  "Margery Brown, on the top of the hill,
  Why are you standing, idle still?"
  "Oh, I'm looking over to London town;
  Shall I see the horsemen if I go down?"

  "Margery Brown, on the top of the hill,
  Why are you standing, listening still?"
  "Oh, I hear the bells of London ring,
  And I hear the men and the maidens sing."

  "Margery Brown, on the top of the hill,
  Why are you standing, waiting still?"
  "Oh, a knight is there, but I can't go down,
  For the bells ring strangely in London town."




[Illustration]


  Little wind, blow on the hill-top,
    Little wind, blow down the plain;
  Little wind, blow up the sunshine,
    Little wind, blow off the rain.




[Illustration]


  Indeed it is true, it is perfectly true;
    Believe me, indeed, I am playing no tricks;
  An old man and his dog bide up there in the moon,
    And he's cross as a bundle of sticks.




[Illustration]


  School is over,
    Oh, what fun!
  Lessons finished,
    Play begun.
  Who'll run fastest,
    You or I?
  Who'll laugh loudest?
    Let us try.




[Illustration]


  "Little Polly, will you go a-walking to-day?"
  "Indeed, little Susan, I will, if I may."
  "Little Polly, your mother has said you may go;
  She was nice to say 'Yes;' she should never say 'No.'"

  "A rook has a nest on the top of the tree--
  A big ship is coming from over the sea:
  Now, which would be nicest, the ship or the nest?"
  "Why, that would be nicest that Polly likes best."




[Illustration]


  As I was walking up the street,
    The steeple bells were ringing;
  As I sat down at Mary's feet,
    The sweet, sweet birds were singing.

  As I walked far into the world,
    I met a little fairy;
  She plucked this flower, and, as it's sweet,
    I've brought it home to Mary.




[Illustration]


  Five little sisters walking in a row;
  Now, isn't that the best way for little girls to go?
  Each had a round hat, each had a muff,
  And each had a new pelisse of soft green stuff.

  Five little marigolds standing in a row;
  Now, isn't that the best way for marigolds to grow?
  Each with a green stalk, and all the five had got
  A bright yellow flower, and a new red pot.




[Illustration]


  In go-cart so tiny
    My sister I drew;
  And I've promised to draw her
    The wide world through.

  We have not yet started--
    I own it with sorrow--
  Because our trip's always
    Put off till to-morrow.




[Illustration]


  Some geese went out a-walking,
    To breakfast and to dine;
  They craned their necks, and plumed themselves--
    They numbered four from nine;
  With their cackle, cackle, cackle!
    They thought themselves so fine.

  A dame went walking by herself,
    A very ancient crone;
  She said, "I wish that all you geese
    Were starved to skin and bone!
  Do stop that cackle, cackle, now,
    And leave me here alone."




[Illustration]


  You are going out to tea to-day,
    So mind how you behave;
  Let all accounts I have of you
    Be pleasant ones, I crave.

  Don't spill your tea, or gnaw your bread,
    And don't tease one another;
  And Tommy mustn't talk too much,
    Or quarrel with his brother.

  Say "If you please," and "Thank you, Nurse:"
    Come home at eight o'clock;
  And, Fanny, pray be careful that
    You do not tear your frock.

  Now, mind your manners, children five,
    Attend to what I say;
  And then, perhaps, I'll let you go
    Again another day.




[Illustration]


  Poor Dicky's dead!--The bell we toll,
  And lay him in the deep, dark hole.
  The sun may shine, the clouds may rain,
  But Dick will never pipe again!
  His quilt will be as sweet as ours--
  Bright buttercups and cuckoo flowers.




[Illustration]


  Up you go, shuttlecocks, ever so high!
  Why come you down again, shuttlecocks--why?
  When you have got so far, why do you fall?
  Where all are high, which is highest of all?




[Illustration]


  Tommy was a silly boy,
    "I can fly," he said;
  He started off, but very soon,
    He tumbled on his head.

  His little sister Prue was there,
    To see how he would do it;
  She knew that, after all his boast,
    Full dearly Tom would rue it!




[Illustration]


  Higgledy, piggledy! see how they run!
  Hopperty, popperty! what is the fun?
  Has the sun or the moon tumbled into the sea?
  What is the matter, now? Pray tell it me!

  Higgledy, piggledy! how can I tell?
  Hopperty, popperty! hark to the bell!
  The rats and the mice even scamper away;
  Who can say what may not happen to-day?




[Illustration]


  Which is the way to Somewhere Town?
    Oh, up in the morning early;
  Over the tiles and the chimney-pots,
    That is the way, quite clearly.

  And which is the door to Somewhere Town?
    Oh, up in the morning early;
  The round red sun is the door to go through,
    That is the way, quite clearly.




[Illustration]


  The boat sails away, like a bird on the wing,
  And the little boys dance on the sands in a ring.
  The wind may fall, or the wind may rise--
  You are foolish to go; you will stay if you're wise.
  The little boys dance, and the little girls run:
  If it's bad to have money, it's worse to have none.




[Illustration]


  Pipe thee high, and pipe thee low,
    Let the little feet go faster;
  Blow your penny trumpet--blow!
    Well done, little master!




[Illustration]


  Polly's, Peg's, and Poppety's
    Mamma was kind and good:
  She gave them each, one happy day,
    A little scarf and hood.

  A bonnet for each girl she bought,
    To shield them from the sun;
  They wore them in the snow and rain,
    And thought it mighty fun.

  But sometimes there were naughty boys,
    Who called to them at play,
  And made this rude remark--"My eye!
    Three Grannies out to-day!"




[Illustration]


  Bowl away! bowl away!
    Fast as you can;
  He who can fastest bowl,
    He is my man!

  Up and down, round about,--
    Don't let it fall;
  Ten times, or twenty times,
    Beat, beat them all!




[Illustration]


  "For what are you longing, you three little boys?
    Oh, what would you like to eat?"
  "We should like some apples, or gingerbread--
    Or a fine big drum to beat."

  "Oh, what will you give me, you three little boys,
    In exchange for these good, good things?"
  "Some bread and cheese, and some radishes,
    And our little brown bird that sings."

  "Now, that won't do, you three little chums,
    I'll have something better than that--
  Two of your fingers, and two of your thumbs,
    In the crown of your largest hat!"




[Illustration]


  O ring the bells! O ring the bells!
    We bid you, sirs, good morning;
  Give thanks, we pray--our flowers are gay,
    And fair for your adorning.

  O ring the bells! O ring the bells!
    Good sirs, accept our greeting;
  Where we have been, the woods are green.
    So, hey! for our next meeting.




[Illustration]


  Then ring the bells! then ring the bells!
    For this fair time of Maying;
  Our blooms we bring, and while we sing,
    O! hark to what we're saying.

  O ring the bells! O ring the bells!
    We'll sing a song with any;
  And may each year bring _you_ good cheer,
    And each of _us_ a penny.




[Illustration]


  I saw a ship that sailed the sea,
    It left me as the sun went down;
  The white birds flew, and followed it
    To town--to London town.

  Right sad were we to stand alone,
    And see it pass so far away;
  And yet we knew some ship would come--
    Some other ship--some other day.




[Illustration]


  Yes, that's the girl that struts about,
    She's very proud,--so very proud!
  Her _bow-wow's_ quite as proud as she:
  They both are very wrong to be
    So proud--so very proud.

  See, Jane and Willy laugh at her,
    They say she's very proud!
  Says Jane, "My stars!--they're very silly;"
  "Indeed they are," cries little Willy,
   "To walk so stiff and proud."




[Illustration]


  It was Tommy who said,
    "The sweet spring-time is come;
  I see the birds flit,
    And I hear the bees hum.

  "Oho! Mister Lark,
     Up aloft in the sky,
  Now, which is the happiest--
    Is it you, sir, or I?"




[Illustration]


  "Shall I sing?" says the Lark,
    "Shall I bloom?" says the Flower;
  "Shall I come?" says the Sun,
    "Or shall I?" says the Shower.

  Sing your song, pretty Bird,
    Roses, bloom for an hour;
  Shine on, dearest Sun,
    Go away, naughty Shower!




[Illustration]


  Little Miss Patty and Master Paul
  Have found two snails on the garden wall.
  "These snails," said Paul, "how slow they walk!
  A great deal slower than we can talk.
  Make haste, Mr. Snail, travel quicker, I pray;
  In a race with our tongues you'd be beaten to-day."




[Illustration]


  Yes, it is sad of them--
    Shocking to me;
  Bad--yes, it's bad of them--
    Bad of all three.

  Warnings they've had from me.
    Still I repeat them--
  Cold is the water--the
    Fishes will eat them.

  Yet they will row about,
    Tho' I say "Fie!" to them;
  Fathers may scold at it,
    Mothers may cry to them.




[Illustration]


  Now, all of you, give heed unto
    The tale I now relate,
  About two girls and one small boy,
    A cat, and a green gate.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Alack! since I began to speak
    (And what I say is true),
  It's all gone out of my poor head--
    And so good-bye to you!




[Illustration]


  What is Tommy running for,
      Running for,
      Running for?
  What is Tommy running for,
    On this fine day?

  Jimmy will run after Tommy,
      After Tommy,
      After Tommy;
  That's what Tommy's running for,
    On this fine day.

  A butcher's boy met a baker's boy
    (It was all of a summer day);
  Said the butcher's boy to the baker's boy,
    "Will you please to walk my way?"

  Said the butcher's boy to the baker's boy,
    "My trade's the best in town,"
  "If you dare say that," said the baker's boy,
    "I shall have to knock you down!"

  Said the butcher's boy to the baker's boy,
    "That's a wicked thing to do;
  And I think, before you've knocked me down,
    The cook will blow up you!"

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    Were twelve sweet little girls;
  Some wore their hair in pigtail plaits,
    And some of them wore curls.

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    Had dinner every day;--
  A not uncommon thing at all,
    You probably will say.

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    Went sometimes for a walk;
  It also is a well-known fact
    That all of them could talk.

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes,
    Of course, to school were sent;
  Their parents wished them to excel
    In each accomplishment.

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    Played music--_Fal-lal-la!_
  Which consequently made them all
    The pride of their papa.

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    Learnt dancing and the globes;
  Which proves that they were wise, and had
    That patience which was Job's.

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    Were always most polite--
  Said "If you please," and "Many thanks,"
    "Good morning," and "Good night."

  The twelve Miss Pelicoes
    You plainly see, were taught
  To do the things they didn't like,
    Which means, the things they ought.

  Now, fare ye well, Miss Pelicoes,
    I wish ye a good day;--
  About these twelve Miss Pelicoes
    I've nothing more to say.

  Little baby, if I threw
  This fair blossom down to you,
  Would you catch it as you stand,
  Holding up each tiny hand,
  Looking out of those grey eyes,
  Where such deep, deep wonder lies?




[Illustration]


  The finest, biggest fish, you see,
  Will be the trout that's caught by me,
  But if the monster will not bite,
  Why, then I'll hook a little mite.

  Prince Finikin and his mamma
    Sat sipping their bohea;
  "Good gracious!" said his Highness, "why,
    What girl is this I see?

  "Most certainly it cannot be
    A native of our town;"
  And he turned him round to his mamma,
    Who set her teacup down.

  But Dolly simply looked at them,
    She did not speak a word;
  "She has no voice!" said Finikin;
    "It's really quite absurd."

  Then Finikin's mamma observed,
    "Dear Prince, it seems to me,
  She looks as if she'd like to drink
    A cup of my bohea."

  So Finikin poured out her tea,
    And gave her currant-pie;
  Then Finikin said, "Dear mamma,
    What a kind Prince am I!"

  Heigh ho!--time creeps but slow;
    I've looked up the hill so long;
  None come this way, the sun sinks low,
    And my shadow's very long.

  They said I should sail in a little boat,
    Up the stream, by the great white mill;
  But I've waited all day, and none come my way;
    I've waited--I'm waiting still.

  They said I should see a fairy town,
    With houses all of gold,
  And silver people, and a gold church steeple;--
    But it wasn't the truth they told.




[Illustration]


  My house is red--a little house,
    A happy child am I,
  I laugh and play the livelong day
    I hardly ever cry.

  I have a tree, a green, green tree,
    To shade me from the sun;
  And under it I often sit,
    When all my work is done.

  My little basket I will take,
    And trip into the town;
  When next I'm there I'll buy some cake,
    And spend my bright half-crown.

  Three little girls were sitting on a rail,
      Sitting on a rail,
      Sitting on a rail;
  Three little girls were sitting on a rail,
    On a fine hot day in September.

  What did they talk about that fine day,
      That fine day,
      That fine day?
  What did they talk about that fine day,--
    That fine hot day in September?

  The crows and the corn they talked about,
      Talked about,
      Talked about;
  But nobody knows what was said by the crows,
    On that fine hot day in September.

  The dunce fell into the pool, oh!
  The dunce was going to school, oh!

      Fished him out with a hook,
  And he piped his eye like a fool, oh!

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
