MACMILLAN'S
THREE-AND-SIXPENNY
LIBRARY OF BOOKS
BY POPULAR AUTHORS

Crown 8vo.


_This Series, which comprises over four hundred volumes in various
departments of Literature, has lately received some notable additions.
Prominent among these is a new and attractive edition of_ The Works
of Thackeray, _issued under the editorship of Mr. Lewis Melville.
It contains all the Original Illustrations, and includes a great
number of scattered pieces and illustrations which have not hitherto
appeared in any collected edition of the works._ The Works of
Charles Dickens, _reprinted from the first editions, with all the
Original Illustrations, and with Introductions, Biographical and
Bibliographical, by Charles Dickens the Younger, and an attractive
edition of_ The Novels of Charles Lever, _illustrated by Phiz and
G. Cruikshank, have also a place in the Library. The attention of
book buyers may be especially directed to_ The Border Edition of
the Waverley Novels, _edited by Mr. Andrew Lang, which, with its
large type and convenient form, and its copious illustrations by
well-known artists, possesses features placing it in the forefront of
editions now obtainable of the famous novels._ The Works of Mr. Thomas
Hardy, _including the poems, have also been recently added to the
Three-and-Sixpenny Library. Among other works by notable contemporary
authors will be found those of_ Mr. F. Marion Crawford, Rolf
Boldrewood, Mr. H. G. Wells, Gertrude Atherton, Mr. Egerton Castle,
Mr. A. E. W. Mason, Maarten Maartens, and Miss Rosa Nouchette Carey;
_while among the productions of an earlier period may be mentioned the
works of_ Charles Kingsley, Frederick Denison Maurice, Thomas Hughes,
_and_ Dean Farrar; _and the novels and tales of_ Charlotte M. Yonge,
Mrs. Craik, _and_ Mrs. Oliphant.


THE
WORKS OF THACKERAY

_Reprints of the First Editions, with all the Original Illustrations,
and with Facsimiles of Wrappers, etc._

Messrs. MACMILLAN & CO., Limited, beg leave to invite the attention
of book buyers to the Edition of THE WORKS OF THACKERAY in their
Three-and-Sixpenny Library, which, when finished, will be the
Completest Edition of the Author's Works which has been placed on the
market.

The Publishers have been fortunate in securing the services of Mr.
LEWIS MELVILLE, the well-known Thackeray Expert. With his assistance
they have been able to include in this Edition a great number of
scattered pieces from Thackeray's pen, and illustrations from his
pencil which have not hitherto been contained in any collected edition
of the works. Mr. Melville has read all the sheets as they passed
through the press, and collated them carefully with the original
editions. He has also provided Bibliographical Introductions and
occasional Footnotes.

SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS

     _TIMES._--"It would be difficult to find in these days a more
     competent and sympathetic editor of Scott than his countryman, the
     brilliant and versatile man of letters who has undertaken the task,
     and if any proof were wanted either of his qualifications or of his
     skill and discretion in displaying them, Mr. Lang has furnished it
     abundantly in his charming Introduction to 'Waverley.' The editor's
     own notes are judiciously sparing, but conspicuously to the point,
     and they are very discreetly separated from those of the author, Mr.
     Lang's laudable purpose being to illustrate and explain Scott, not to
     make the notes a pretext for displaying his own critical faculty and
     literary erudition. The illustrations by various competent hands are
     beautiful in themselves and beautifully executed, and, altogether,
     the 'Border Edition' of the Waverley Novels bids fair to become the
     classical edition of the great Scottish classic."

     _SPECTATOR._--"We trust that this fine edition of our greatest and
     most poetical of novelists will attain, if it has not already done
     so, the high popularity it deserves. To all Scott's lovers it is
     a pleasure to know that, despite the daily and weekly inrush of
     ephemeral fiction, the sale of his works is said by the booksellers to
     rank next below Tennyson's in poetry, and above that of everybody else
     in prose."

     _ATHENAEUM._--"The handsome 'Border Edition' has been brought to a
     successful conclusion. The publisher deserves to be complimented on
     the manner in which the edition has been printed and illustrated, and
     Mr. Lang on the way in which he has performed his portion of the work.
     His introductions have been tasteful and readable; he has not overdone
     his part; and, while he has supplied much useful information, he has
     by no means overburdened the volumes with notes."

     _NOTES AND QUERIES._--"This spirited and ambitious enterprise has been
     conducted to a safe termination, and the most ideal edition of the
     Waverley Novels in existence is now completed."

     _SATURDAY REVIEW._--"Of all the many collections of the Waverley
     Novels, the 'Border Edition' is incomparably the most handsome and
     the most desirable.... Type, paper, illustrations, are altogether
     admirable."

     _MAGAZINE OF ART._--"Size, type, paper, and printing, to say
     nothing of the excessively liberal and charming introduction of the
     illustrations, make this perhaps the most desirable edition of Scott
     ever issued on this side of the Border."

     _DAILY CHRONICLE._--"There is absolutely no fault to be found with it,
     as to paper, type, or arrangement."

SOME PRESS OPINIONS OF THE THREE-AND-SIXPENNY ISSUE

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"... their charming edition of the
     works of Thomas Hardy ... the price asked for it ... is
     absurdly cheap.... Any more convenient and beautiful form
     of presentation for these books it would be difficult to
     find."

     _ATHENAEUM._--"This edition is so comely and so moderate in
     price that it may well placate those who have sighed for
     earlier issues out of their reach. Mr. Hardy's prefaces
     to the volumes should not be missed, for they are models
     of a difficult art, whether reflective, informative, or
     combative."

THE NOVELS OF
F. MARION CRAWFORD

MR. ISAACS: A Tale of Modern India.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"A work of unusual ability.... It fully
     deserves the notice it is sure to attract."

DOCTOR CLAUDIUS: A True Story.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"Few recent books have been so difficult to
     lay down when once begun."

A ROMAN SINGER.

     _TIMES._--"A masterpiece of narrative.... Unlike any other
     romance in English literature."

ZOROASTER.

     _GUARDIAN._--"An instance of the highest and noblest form
     of novel.... Alike in the originality of its conception
     and the power with which it is wrought out, it stands on a
     level that is almost entirely its own."

MARZIO'S CRUCIFIX.

     _TIMES._--"A subtle compound of artistic feeling, avarice,
     malice, and criminal frenzy is this carver of silver
     chalices and crucifixes."

A TALE OF A LONELY PARISH.

     _GUARDIAN._--"The tale is written with all Mr. Crawford's skill."

PAUL PATOFF.

     _ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE._--"Those who neglect to read _Paul
     Patoff_ will throw away a very pleasurable opportunity."

WITH THE IMMORTALS.

     _SPECTATOR._--"Cannot fail to please a reader who enjoys
     crisp, clear, vigorous writing, and thoughts that are alike
     original and suggestive."

GREIFENSTEIN.

     _SPECTATOR._--"Altogether, we like _Greifenstein_
     decidedly--so much so as to doubt whether it does not
     dislodge _A Roman Singer_ from the place hitherto occupied
     by the latter as our favourite amongst Mr. Crawford's
     novels."

TAQUISARA: A Novel.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"Cannot fail to be read with interest
     and pleasure by all to whom clever characterisation and
     delicate drawing make appeal."

A ROSE OF YESTERDAY.

     _SPEAKER._--"There is something in _A Rose of Yesterday_
     which makes the book linger with a distinct aroma of its
     own in the reader's memory."

SANT' ILARIO.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"The plot is skilfully concocted, and the
     interest is sustained to the end.... A very clever piece of
     work."

A CIGARETTE-MAKER'S ROMANCE.

     _GLOBE._--"We are inclined to think this is the best of Mr.
     Marion Crawford's stories."

KHALED: A Tale of Arabia.

     _ANTI-JACOBIN._--"Mr. Crawford has written some stories
     more powerful, but none more attractive than this."

THE THREE FATES.

     _NATIONAL OBSERVER._--"Increases in strength and in
     interest even to the end."

THE WITCH OF PRAGUE.

     _ACADEMY._--"It is so remarkable a book as to be certain of
     as wide a popularity as any of its predecessors; it is a
     romance of singular daring and power."

MARION DARCHE: A Story without Comment.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"Readers in search of a good novel may be
     recommended to lose no time in making the acquaintance of
     Marion Darche, her devoted friends, and her one enemy."

KATHARINE LAUDERDALE.

     _PUNCH._--"Admirable in its simple pathos, its unforced
     humour, and, above all, in its truth to human nature."

THE CHILDREN OF THE KING.

     _DAILY CHRONICLE._--"Mr. Crawford has not done better than
     _The Children of the King_ for a long time. The story
     itself is a simple and beautiful one."

PIETRO GHISLERI.

     _SPEAKER._--"Mr. Marion Crawford is an artist, and a great
     one, and he has been brilliantly successful in a task in
     which ninety-nine out of every hundred writers would have
     failed."

DON ORSINO.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"_Don Orsino_ is a story with many strong
     points, and it is told with all the spirit we have been
     wont to expect from its author."

CASA BRACCIO.

     _GUARDIAN._--"A very powerful story and a finished work of art."

ADAM JOHNSTONE'S SON.

     _DAILY NEWS._--"Mr. Crawford has written stories richer
     in incident and more powerful in intention, but we do not
     think that he has handled more deftly or shown a more
     delicate insight into tendencies that go towards making
     some of the more spiritual tragedies of life."

THE RALSTONS.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"The present instalment of what promises to be
     a very voluminous family history, increasing in interest
     and power as it develops, turns upon the death of Robert
     and the disposition of his millions, which afford ample
     scope for the author's pleasantly ingenious talent in
     raising and surmounting difficulties of details."

CORLEONE: A Tale of Sicily.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"A splendid romance."

VIA CRUCIS: A Romance of the Second Crusade.

     _GRAPHIC._--"A stirring story."

IN THE PALACE OF THE KING: A Love Story of Old Madrid.

     _SPECTATOR._--"A truly thrilling tale."

CECILIA: A Story of Modern Rome.

     _TIMES._--"Thoroughly interesting from beginning to end....
     Fully worthy of his reputation."

     _ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS._--"Can only enhance Mr.
     Crawford's reputation.... Admirably treated with all the
     subtlety, finesse, and delicacy which are characteristic of
     the author at his best."

MARIETTA: A Maid of Venice.

     _PUNCH._--"Marion Crawford is at his very best in
     _Marietta, A Maid of Venice_. It is a powerfully
     dramatic story of Venice under 'The Ten,' told in a
     series of picturesque scenes described in strikingly
     artistic word-painting, the action being carried on by
     well-imagined, clearly-defined characters."


THE NOVELS OF
ROLF BOLDREWOOD

ROBBERY UNDER ARMS.

A STORY OF LIFE AND ADVENTURE IN THE BUSH AND IN THE GOLD-FIELDS OF
AUSTRALIA.

     _GUARDIAN._--"A singularly spirited and stirring tale of
     Australian life, chiefly in the remoter settlements."

A MODERN BUCCANEER.

     _DAILY CHRONICLE._--"We do not forget _Robbery under Arms_,
     or any of its various successors, when we say that Rolf
     Boldrewood has never done anything so good as _A Modern
     Buccaneer_. It is good, too, in a manner which is for the
     author a new one."

THE MINER'S RIGHT.

A TALE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOLD-FIELDS.

     _WORLD._--"Full of good passages, passages abounding in
     vivacity, in the colour and play of life.... The pith of
     the book lies in its singularly fresh and vivid pictures of
     the humours of the gold-fields--tragic humours enough they
     are, too, here and again."

THE SQUATTER'S DREAM.

     _FIELD._--"The details are filled in by a hand evidently
     well conversant with his subject, and everything is
     _ben trovato_, if not actually true. A perusal of these
     cheerfully-written pages will probably give a better idea
     of realities of Australian life than could be obtained from
     many more pretentious works."

A SYDNEY-SIDE SAXON.

     _GLASGOW HERALD._--"The interest never flags, and
     altogether _A Sydney-Side Saxon_ is a really refreshing
     book."

A COLONIAL REFORMER.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"A series of natural and entertaining pictures
     of Australian life, which are, above all things, readable."

NEVERMORE.

     _OBSERVER._--"An exciting story of Ballarat in the
     'fifties. Its hero, Lance Trevanion, is a character which
     for force of delineation has no equal in Rolf Boldrewood's
     previous novels."

PLAIN LIVING. A Bush Idyll.

     _ACADEMY._--"A hearty story, deriving charm from the odours
     of the bush and the bleating of incalculable sheep."

MY RUN HOME.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"Rolf Boldrewood's last story is a
     racy volume. It has many of the best qualities of
     Whyte-Melville, the breezy freshness and vigour of Frank
     Smedley, with the dash and something of the abandon of
     Lever.... His last volume is one of his best."

THE SEALSKIN CLOAK.

     _TIMES._--"A well-written story."

THE CROOKED STICK; or, Pollie's Probation.

     _ACADEMY._--"A charming picture of Australian station life."

OLD MELBOURNE MEMORIES.

     _NATIONAL OBSERVER._--"His book deserves to be read in
     England with as much appreciation as it has already gained
     in the country of its birth."

A ROMANCE OF CANVAS TOWN, and other Stories.

     _ATHENAEUM._--"The book is interesting for its obvious
     insight into life in the Australian bush."

WAR TO THE KNIFE; or, Tangata Maori.

     _ACADEMY._-"A stirring romance."

BABES IN THE BUSH.

     _OUTLOOK._--"A lively and picturesque story."

     _DAILY TELEGRAPH._--"Bristles with thrilling incident."

IN BAD COMPANY, and other Stories.

     _DAILY NEWS._--"The best work this popular author has done
     for some time."

THE NOVELS OF
ROSA N. CAREY

Over Half-a-Million of these works have been printed.

47th Thousand.
NELLIE'S MEMORIES.

     _STANDARD._--"Miss Carey has the gift of writing naturally
     and simply, her pathos is true and unforced, and her
     conversations are sprightly and sharp."

33rd Thousand.
WEE WIFIE.

     _LADY._--"Miss Carey's novels are always welcome; they are
     out of the common run, immaculately pure, and very high in
     tone."

29th Thousand.
BARBARA HEATHCOTE'S TRIAL.

     _DAILY TELEGRAPH._--"A novel of a sort which it would be a
     real loss to miss."

25th Thousand.
ROBERT ORD'S ATONEMENT.

     _STANDARD._--"_Robert Ord's Atonement_ is a delightful
     book, very quiet as to its story, but very strong in
     character, and instinct with that delicate pathos which is
     the salient point of all the writings of this author."

32nd Thousand.
WOOED AND MARRIED.

     _STANDARD._--"There is plenty of romance in the heroine's
     life. But it would not be fair to tell our readers wherein
     that romance consists or how it ends. Let them read the
     book for themselves. We will undertake to promise that they
     will like it."

24th Thousand.
HERIOT'S CHOICE.

     _MORNING POST._--"Deserves to be extensively known and
     read.... Will doubtless find as many admirers as readers."

35th Thousand.
NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"Like all the other stories we have
     had from the same gifted pen, this volume, _Not Like Other
     Girls_, takes a sane and healthy view of life and its
     concerns.... It is an excellent story to put in the hands
     of girls."

     _NEW YORK HOME JOURNAL._--"One of the sweetest, daintiest,
     and most interesting of the season's publications."

24th Thousand.

     much grace and unaffected pathos."

FOR LILIAS.

     _VANITY FAIR._--"A simple, earnest, and withal very
     interesting story; well conceived, carefully worked out,
     and sympathetically told."

28th Thousand.
UNCLE MAX.

     _LADY._--"So intrinsically good that the world of
     novel-readers ought to be genuinely grateful."

21st Thousand.
RUE WITH A DIFFERENCE.

     _BOOKMAN._--"Fresh and charming.... A piece of distinctly good work."

34th Thousand.
ONLY THE GOVERNESS.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"This novel is for those who like
     stories with something of Jane Austen's power, but with
     more intensity of feeling than Jane Austen displayed, who
     are not inclined to call pathos twaddle, and who care to
     see life and human nature in their most beautiful form."


24th Thousand.
LOVER OR FRIEND?

     _GUARDIAN._--"The refinement of style and delicacy of
     thought will make _Lover or Friend?_ popular with all
     readers who are not too deeply bitten with a desire for
     things improbable in their lighter literature."

21st Thousand.
BASIL LYNDHURST.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"We doubt whether anything has been
     written of late years so fresh, so pretty, so thoroughly
     natural and bright. The novel as a whole is charming."

22nd Thousand.
SIR GODFREY'S GRAND-DAUGHTERS.

     _OBSERVER._--"A capital story. The interest steadily grows,
     and by the time one reaches the third volume the story has
     become enthralling."

24th Thousand.
THE OLD, OLD STORY.

     _DAILY NEWS._--"Miss Carey's fluent pen has not lost its
     power of writing fresh and wholesome fiction."

24th Thousand.
THE MISTRESS OF BRAE FARM.

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"Miss Carey's untiring pen loses none
     of its power, and her latest work is as gracefully written,
     as full of quiet home charm, as fresh and wholesome, so to
     speak, as its many predecessors."

12th Thousand.
MRS. ROMNEY and "BUT MEN MUST WORK."

     _PALL MALL GAZETTE._--"By no means the least attractive of
     the works of this charming writer."

_New Impression._
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES.

     _BRADFORD OBSERVER._--"There is a quiet charm about this
     story which finds its way into the innermost shrines of
     life. The book is wholesome and good, and cannot fail to
     give pleasure to those who love beauty."

25th Thousand.
HERB OF GRACE.

     _WESTMINSTER GAZETTE._--"A clever delineator of character,
     possessed of a reserve of strength in a quiet, easy,
     flowing style, Miss Carey never fails to please a large
     class of readers. _Herb of Grace_ is no exception to the
     rule...."

20th Thousand.
THE HIGHWAY OF FATE.

     _BOOKMAN._--"This pretty love story ... is charming,
     sparkling, and never mawkish."

19th Thousand.
A PASSAGE PERILOUS.

     _TIMES._--"Told with all Miss Carey's usual charm of quiet,
     well-bred sentiment."

     _OUTLOOK._--"A pretty story of English country-house life
     during the terribly anxious 'waiting days' of Ladysmith.
     The soldier's young bride is charmingly suggested and the
     love portions approach the idyllic."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
