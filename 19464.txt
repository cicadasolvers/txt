OSAGE TRADITIONS.


BY REV. J. OWEN DORSEY.





INTRODUCTION.


When the author visited the Osage, in the Indian Territory, in January,
1883, he learned of the existence of a secret society of seven degrees, in
which, it was alleged, the traditions of the people have been preserved to
the present time. Owing to the shortness of his visit, one month and
eleven days, he was unable to gain more than fragmentary accounts of the
society, including parts of two traditions, from several Osage who had
been initiated.

The version of the first tradition was dictated to the author by
Ha*d*a-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se (Red Corn), a halfbreed Osage of the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e gens. He
obtained it from Sa*d*ekice. Ha*d*a-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se was adopted in childhood by a
white man named Matthews, who sent him to a Jesuit college in Missouri(?)
to be educated for the priesthood. But the boy left the institution after
he had been taught to read and write, as he did not wish to become a
priest. He took the name of William P. Matthews, but among his white
associates he is known as Bill Nix. He has tried several occupations and
is now an Indian doctor. The author was inclined at first to underrate Mr.
Matthews's accomplishments and stock of information, but subsequently
changed his opinion of him, as he obtained much that agreed with what had
been furnished by members of other tribes in former years. Besides, the
author obtained partial accounts of similar traditions from other Osage,
who used the same chant which Ha*d*a-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se had sung. None of the younger
Osage men knew about these matters and the author was urged not to speak
to them on this subject. He observed that several of the elder men,
members of the secret order in which these traditions are preserved, had
parts of the accompanying symbolic chart (Fig. 389) tattooed on their
throats and chests. This chart is a fac simile of one that was drawn for
the author by Ha*d*a-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se. At the top we see a tree near a river. The
tree is a cedar, called the tree of life. It has six roots, three on each
side. Nothing is said about this tree till the speaker nearly reaches the
end of the tradition. Then follows the "ceremony of the cedar." The tree
is described very minutely. Then follows a similar account of the river
and its branches.

Just under the river, at the left, we see a large star, the Red or Morning
Star. Next are six stars, Taca*d*cin. The Omaha know a similar group,
which they call "Minxa si {~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}anga," or "Large foot of a goose." Next is the
Evening Star; and last comes the small star, "Mikak'e-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}in{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a." Beneath
these four we see the seven stars, or Pleiades (Mikak'e u*d*atse
pecun*d*a, the Seven Gentes of Stars), between the Moon (on the left) and
the Sun (on the right). Beneath these are the peace pipe (on the left) and
the hatchet (on the right). A bird is seen hovering over the four upper
worlds. These worlds are represented by four parallel horizontal lines,
each of which, except the lowest one, is supported by two pillars. The
lowest world rests on a red oak tree.

The journey of the people began at a point below the lowest upper world,
on the left side of the chart. Then the people had neither human bodies
nor souls, though they existed in some unknown manner. They ascended from
the lowest upper world, on the left, to the highest. There they obtained
human souls in the bodies of birds, according to Sa*d*ekice.
{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}ahi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e-wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}ayin{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a said that there they met a male red bird, to whom they
appealed for aid. (See p. 383, line 18.) This was distinct from the female
Red Bird, who gave them human bodies. They descended to the first world,
and from that they traveled until they alighted on the red oak tree. (See
p. 383, line 30.) The ground was covered with grass and other kinds of
vegetation. Then the paths of the people separated: some marched on the
left, being the peace gentes that could not take life; they subsisted on
roots &c.; while those on the right killed animals. By and by the gentes
exchanged commodities.

The small figures on the left, in going from the tree (on the right when
facing the tree), show the heavenly bodies or beings to whom the Black
Bear went for help, and those on the right, in going from the tree (on the
left when facing the top of the chart), show similar bodies or beings to
whom the Wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}e or war gentes applied for assistance. These are unknown to
the members of the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u gentes. After the female red bird gave bodies to
the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u people, the Black Bear found seven skins, which were used for
tents. Subsequently the people discovered four kinds of rocks, which were
the In'qe sa*d*e, or black rock; In'qe tuhu,(1) or blue (green?) rock;
In'qe {~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se, or red rock; and In'qe ska, or white rock. Therefore, when a
child is named, four stones are heated for the sweat bath. After finding
the rocks, according to {~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}ahi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e-wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}ayin{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a, four buffalo bulls approached
the people, as one of the men was returning to the company. When the first
bull arose after rolling on the ground, an ear of red corn and a red
pumpkin fell from his left hind leg. The leader of the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e
noticed them, and asked his younger brother to pick them up and taste
them. The leader of the Bald Eagle subgens did so. Then the elder brother
said: "These will be good for the children to eat. Their limbs will
stretch and increase in strength." When the second bull arose after
rolling, an ear of spotted corn and a spotted pumpkin dropped from his
left hind leg. These, too, were tasted and declared good for the children.
When the third bull arose after rolling, an ear of dark corn and a dark
(black?) pumpkin dropped from his left hind leg. From the left hind leg of
the fourth buffalo dropped an ear of white corn and a white pumpkin.
Therefore, when a child is named in the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u gens (alone?) the head man
of that gens ({~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}ahi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e-wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}ayin{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a himself, according to his statement) takes
a grain of each kind of corn and a slice of each variety of pumpkin, which
he puts into the mouth of the infant. Ha*d*a-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se knew that the four
kinds of rocks were found, "but he could not say in what part of the
tradition the account belonged. He said that subsequently the Wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}e and
Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u gentes came to the village of the Han'{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a-utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se, a very war-like
people, who then inhabited earth lodges. They subsisted on animals, and
bodies of all kinds lay around their village, making the air very
offensive. The Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u succeeded at last in making peace with the
Han'{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a-utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se. After this followed the part of the account given to the
author by {~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}ahi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e-wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}ayin{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a:

"After the council between the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u, Wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}e, and Han'{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a-utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se, two
old men were sent off to seek a country in which all might dwell. One of
these was a Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e and the other a Pan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H~}ka-wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e. Each man
received a pipe from the council and was told to go for seven days without
food or drink. He carried a staff to aid him in walking. Three times a day
he wept, in the morning, at noon, and near sunset. They returned to the
people at the end of the seven days, being very thin. The report of the
Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u man was accepted, so the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u gens is superior to the
Pan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H~}ka-wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e or Watsetsi. A Wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}e man acted as crier and told all about
the new home of the nation. All the old men decorated their faces with
clay. The next morning the two old men who had gone in search of the new
home led their respective sides of the nation, who marched in parallel
roads. When they reached the land the policemen ran around in a circle,
just as they do previous to starting to war. The Wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}e man ran around
from right to left and the cuqe man from left to right. At different
stations the two old leaders addressed the people. Finally the men took
sharp pointed sticks, which they stuck into the ground, each one saying 'I
wish my lodge to be here.' The next day the Cuka or messenger of the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u
old man went to summon the Elk crier. The latter was ordered to make a
proclamation to all the people, as follows: 'They say that you must remove
to-day! Wakan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}a has made good weather! They say that you must remove today
to a good land!' In those days the Osage used dogs instead of horses. When
the old Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u man made his speech, he went into details about every part
of a lodge, the fireplace, building materials, implements, &c. Four sticks
were placed in the fireplace, the first pointing to the west. When this
was laid down, the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u leader spoke about the West Wind, and also about
a young buffalo bull (Tse{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}u'-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}in{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a), repeating the name Wani'e-ska. When
the stick at the north was laid down, he spoke of Tsehe qu{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se (gray
buffalo horns) or a buffalo bull. When the stick at the east was laid down
he spoke of Tse{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}u{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a tan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a (a large buffalo bull). On laying down the
fourth stick at the south, he spoke of Tse min{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a (a buffalo cow). At the
same time a similar ceremony was performed by the aged Pan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H~}ka man on the
right side of the tribe.(2)

"In placing the stick to the east, Ta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se {~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}aqpa tse, The East Wind, and
Tahe ca*d*e, Dark-Horned Deer, were mentioned; to the north, Ta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se *P*asan
tse, The North Wind, and The Deer with gray horns were mentioned; to the
west, Ta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se Man'ha tse, The West Wind, and an animal which makes a lodge
and is with the Tahe pasi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e were mentioned; to the south, T]a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se Ak'a tse,
The South Wind, and Ta wanka he a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}ca{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}i skutan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a were mentioned."(3)

{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}ahi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e-wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}ayin{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a gave no further information, as a reported case of
smallpox near the agency led the author to start for the East February 21,
1883. Since then he has learned of the existence of similar societies
among the Kansa and the Ponka, and he suspects that there were formerly
such societies among the Omaha.(4)

                              _Translation_.

The following translation is arranged in lines to correspond to the lines
in the original text:

1 The first of the race
Was saying, "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies.
3 "We shall seek bodies for our children.
"Ho, younger brother! you shall attend to it."
They reached one upper world and stood.
6 There they were not human beings.
"Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.
"We must seek bodies for our children."
9 They reached the second upper world and stood.
There they were not human beings.
"Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.
12 "We must seek bodies for our children."
They reached the third upper world and stood.
There they were not human beings.
15 "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.
"We must seek bodies for our children."
They reached the fourth upper world and stood.
18 There they became human beings.
Still, the children were without (human) bodies.
"We must continue to seek bodies for our children."
21 They returned to the third upper world and stood.
The children were really without bodies.
"Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.
24 "We must continue to seek bodies for our children."
They returned to the second upper world and stood.
The children did not find bodies for themselves.
27 "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.
"We must make an examination awhile longer."
They returned to the first upper world and stood.
30 They came to a red oak and were standing on it.
On a very fine day they came hither and stood.
Kaxe-wahue-san (the Black Bear), who was then moving,
33 Came directly to them and stood.
"Ho, elder brother!" (said the Black Bear.)
"You shall continue to burn my feet for me."
36 "Ho, Kaxe-wahue-san!" was he (the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u) saying.
Kaxe-wahue-san went to the star Watse-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}u{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a.
"Ho, grandfather!" he was saying.
39 "The children have no bodies."
Watse-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}u{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a replied, "Can I give the children bodies?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
42 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
Then Kaxe-wahue-san went to the star Watse-min{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a.
44 "Ho, grandmother!" he said;
"The children have no bodies."
She replied, "Can I give bodies to the children?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
48 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
Then he went to the mysterious one of day.
"Ho, grandfather!" said he;
51 "The children have no bodies."
Said he, "Can I give the children bodies?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
54 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
Then he went to the mysterious one of night.
"Ho, grandfather!" said he;
57 "The children have no bodies, grandfather!"
The Moon replied, "Can I give bodies to the children?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
60 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
Then he went to the Pleiades, saying,
"Ho, grandfathers!
63 "The children have no bodies."
One of these replied, "Can I give bodies to the children?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
66 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
Then he went to the constellation called Three Deer.
"Ho, grandfather," said he;
69 "The children have no bodies."
The latter replied, "Can I give the children bodies?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
72 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
Then he went to the Morning Star, saying,
"Ho, grandfather!
75 "The children have no bodies."
The star replied, "Can I give bodies to the children?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
78 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
Then he went to the Small Star, saying,
"Ho, grandfather!
81 "The children have no bodies."
The star replied, "Can I give bodies to the children?
"I am not the only mysterious one;
84 "You shall attend to it awhile longer."
The female Red Bird, who had been moving, was sitting on her nest.
To her he came, saying,
87 "Ho, grandmother!
"The children have no bodies."
She replied, "I can cause your children to have (human) bodies from my
own,
90 "My left wing shall be a left arm for the children.
"My right wing shall be a right arm for them.
"My head shall be a head for them.
93 "My mouth shall be a mouth for them.
"My forehead shall be a forehead for them.
"My neck shall be a neck for them.
96 "My throat shall be a throat for them.
"My chest shall be a chest for them.
98 "My bowels shall be bowels for them.
"My thighs shall be thighs for them.
"My knees shall be knees for them.
"The calves of my legs shall be calves of their legs.
102 "My heels shall be their heels.
"My toes shall be their toes.
"My claws shall be their toenails.
105 "You shall continue to exist without any cause of destruction for your
race.
"Your children shall live as human beings.
"The speech (or breath) of children will I bestow on your children."

1 "O younger brother! we must see what can be done to make human beings
of the children."
The Black Bear came to them and stood.
3 He went to the mysterious one of day, saying,
"Ho, grandfather! the children have no bodies."
He replied, "I have an everlasting road (in which I must keep);
6 I am not the only mysterious one;
You must still seek for help."
(On reporting to the leader, the latter said,)
"O Kaxe-wahue-san, my younger brother! we must still see what can be
done."
9 So the Black Bear went to the star "Watse-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}u{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a, saying,
"Ho, grandfather! the children have no bodies."
He replied, "I have an everlasting road (in which I must keep);
12 "I am not the only mysterious one;
"You must still seek for help."
(On reporting to the leader, the latter said),
"O Kaxe-wahue-san, my younger brother! we must still see what can be
done."
15 So the Black Bear went to the Bowl of the Great Dipper, saying,
"O grandfather! the children have no bodies!"
He replied, "I have an everlasting road (in which I must keep);
18 "I am not the only mysterious one;
"You must still seek for help."
(On reporting to the leader, the latter said),
"O Kaxe-wahue-san, my younger brother! we must still see what can be
done."
21 Then he went to the Seven Stars, saying,
"Ho, grandfather! the children have no bodies."
He replied, "I have an everlasting road (in which I must keep);
24 "I am not the only mysterious one;
"You must still seek for help."
(On reporting this to the leader, the latter said),
26 "O Kaxe-wahue-san, my younger brother! we must still see what can be
done."
So he went to the Morning Star, saying,
"Ho, grandfather! the children have no bodies."
He replied, "I have an everlasting road (in which I must keep);
30 "I am not the only mysterious one;
"You must still seek for help."
(On reporting this to the leader, the latter said),
" O Kaxe-wahue-san, my younger brother! we must still see what can be
done."
33 So he went to the Red Bird, who was sitting (on her nest), saying,
"Ho, grandmother!
The children have no bodies."
*       *       *       *       *
36 They went to the good land of day.
In four revolutions or gyrations of the upper worlds, we became human
beings.
Though we were human beings, we did not find bodies.
39 They arrived at the second revolution of the upper worlds.
There we were not (complete) human beings.
They arrived at the third revolution of the upper worlds.
42 There we were not (complete) human beings.
They arrived at the fourth revolution of the upper worlds
They stood on a sycamore tree.
45 They stood there at harvest time.
"Ho, younger brother! a man has left a trail."
"Ho, elder brother!" said the Black Bear; "you have said that a man has
left a trail.
"This is the man."
48 "Ho, elder brother!" (said the stranger) "I am Young Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a."
[Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u.] "Ho, younger brother! a man has left a trail."
[Black Bear.] "Ho, elder brother! you have said that a man has left a
trail.
"This is the man."
51 "Ho, elder brother!" (said the stranger) "I am Osage.
"We shall be Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a people."
Some people left a trail.
54 Those were the lodges of the Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se.
(The Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se leader said)
"Ho! some persons have come.
"Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u and Watsetsi have come."
57 They thought of what was good for the children.
They decided that the two should continue as chiefs for the children.
They decided that the two should continue without anything that would be
fatal to the children. (And they said)
60 "There shall be an assembly of the children.
"You two shall seek a land in which the children may become men."
They two arranged for the location of a land in order that the children
might become men in it.
63 The Female Beaver, who had been traveling, came to the confines of the
village (of the Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se?)

Good Voice, of the Mink'in gens, knew the history of the Female Beaver,
but he failed to keep his promise to dictate it to the author.





CONCLUDING REMARKS.


An Osage said to the author: "We do not believe that our ancestors were
really animals, birds, &c., as told in the traditions. These things are
only wa-wi'-ku-ska'-ye [symbols] of something higher." On saying this he
pointed to the sky.

Apart from such traditions or myths, it is found that even the taboos and
the names of the gentes, subgentes, phratries, and persons are objects of
mysterious reverence among many, if not all, of the Siouan tribes. Such
names are never used in ordinary conversation. This is especially the case
in tribes where the secret society continues in all its power, as among
the Osage, the Ponka, and the Kansa. When the author was questioning these
Indians he was obliged to proceed very cautiously in order to obtain
information of this character, which was not communicated till they
learned about his acquaintance with some of the myths. When several Dakota
delegations visited Washington he called on them and had little trouble in
learning the names of their gentes, their order in the camping circle,
&c., provided the interpreters were absent. During his visit to the Omaha,
from 1878 to 1880, he did not find them very reticent in furnishing him
with such information, though he was generally referred to the principal
chief of each gens as the best authority for the names in his own
division. But he found it very difficult to induce any of them to admit
that the gentes had subdivisions, which were probably the original gentes.
It was not till 1880, and after questioning many, that by the merest
accident he obtained the clew from the keeper of a sacred pipe.

The Iowa, who have these social divisions and personal names of mythic
significance, also have sacred songs, but these are in the Winnebago
language. It is probable that they are the property of a secret order, as
they, too, show how some of the gentes descended as birds from the upper
world. The names of the Winnebago gentes and of some members of the tribe
have been recorded by the author, who has also learned parts of their
traditions. He infers that their secret society has not been abolished.

When a man of the Kansa tribe observed that the author had an inkling of
the matter he related part of the tradition of that tribe, explaining the
origin of the names and the taboos of several Kansa gentes. The ancestors
of these gentes were spoken of as birds which descended from an upper
world. The phratries in that tribe, the "Wa-yun min-'dun," or "(Those who)
sing together," refer to mystic songs and strengthen the view that the
secret society exists among these Indians. Several members of the tribe
have positively stated its existence.

As one phratry is composed of the two gentes, Large and Small Hanka, that
have the sole right to sing the war songs, time may show that these songs,
which, with their chart of pictographs(23), are used by the Osage, are
substantially those of the seventh degree in the Osage society. This is
rendered the more probable by the fact that the Kansa have grouped their
gentes in seven phratries, just the number of the degrees in the society.
And this arrangement by sevens is the rule among Osage, Kansa, Ponka,
Omaha, and Dakota, though there are apparent exceptions.

Further investigation may tend to confirm the supposition that in any
tribe which has mythic names for its members and its social divisions (as
among the Osage, Kansa, Quapaw, Omaha, Ponka, Iowa, Oto, Missouri, Tutelo,
and Winnebago), or in one which has mythic names only for its members and
local or other names for its social divisions (as among the Dakota,
Assiniboin, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Crow), there are now or there have been
secret societies or "The Mysteries."

    1 The sound of this inverted u, between o and u, as well as the sounds
      of other letters used in this article, except that of the inverted {~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H~}
      (which is a sound approximating ch in the German word ich), is to be
      found on page 206, Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.

    2 It is probable, however, that the Pan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H~}ka (Ponka) man began with the
      stick at the east, as he must use the right hand and foot first.

    3 Meaning uncertain; it may refer to the female or doe.

    4 See "Omaha Sociology,"  14-16, 19, 28, 33, 34, 36, 56, 143,

      Bureau of Ethnology.

    5 The literal rendering of the title is "Growth told. Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u Peacemaker
      theirs." This may be translated freely by "Revelations of the elders
      of the Red Eagle gens."

    6 Oin'{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a weha{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}ice, "The first end of the children" or "The beginning
      of the race." This reckoning was backward. The Ponka have a similar
      usage: uhange, _an end_; uhange pahanga te, _the first end_ or
      _beginning_. Adintau, formed by crasis from a*d*e and intau, may
      refer to the words of the old men who have handed down these
      traditions. Tsika is unintelligible to the younger Osage of the
      present day. One man told the author that he thought it meant, "O
      grandfather," being addressed to the principal Wakan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}a. He said that
      it was substituted for another name of that being.

    7 The chorus or refrain at the end of each line is omitted in the free
      translation, as it would make confusion. If retained, the first four
      lines would read thus:

      The first of the race: he really said, O grandfather!

      He was saying, "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies":
      he really said, O grandfather!

      "We shall seek bodies for our children": he really said, O
      grandfather!

      "Ho, younger brother! you shall attend to it": he really said, O
      grandfather!

    8 E{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}i anka refers to the preceding words, which were those of one of
      the mythic speakers. He was an ancestor of the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u gens. Here he
      addressed his younger brother. At this time the brothers were
      destitute of human souls and bodies, though they possessed conscious
      existence and could talk, as well as move about from place to place.

      complete human beings_.

   11 A different reading of lines 17 to 25 is as follows:

      stood | he really said | O grandfather!

                                 _Translation._

      At the fourth upper world they were made human beings.

      "Still," said he (the elder brother?), indeed he really said,

      "The children have no bodies.

      "Ho, younger brother!

      "We must give this matter our attention."

      They came to the third upper world.

      "The children have no bodies."

      "Still must we give this our attention," said one.

      They came to the second upper world. (From this line on there is no
      variation from what has been given above.)

   12 Here they obtained human souls, though they were in the bodies of
      birds. See the bird hovering above the four upper worlds in the
      chart. Then began the descent to this earth.

   13 Why the Black Bear was called Kaxe-wahue-san was not explained to the
      author.

      supernatural beings or gods. So were all of the heavenly bodies to

   20 This fragment of the tradition of the Bald Eagle subgens of the
      Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e gens was told by Pahue-ska, the chief, to Ha*d*a-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se,
      who related it to the writer on the following day.

      Ha*d*a-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}ue{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se, told some of the tradition first in English, but on
      chanting it in Osage he did not give all; so the former account is
      now given in these notes: "When the ancestors of the Bald Eagle
      people came to this earth they alighted on a sycamore tree, as all
      of the surrounding country was under water. This water was dried up
      by the ancestors of the Elk people, according to the tradition of
      the Upqan or Elk gens; but this is disputed by the members of the
      I*d*ats'e gens, who are Kansa or Wind people. They say that their
      ancestors blew on the water, drying it up and causing the growth of
      vegetation. As soon as the water was gone the Bald Eagle people
      alighted on the ground. Then they met the Black Bear, who offered to
      become the servant of the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e people. So he was sent to
      "Watse-{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}u{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a, who was a red star; then to Watse-min{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a, a star near
      the Morning Star; then to the Sun, Moon, and Seven Stars. As the
      people journeyed, the Black Bear said to the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u leader, 'Brother,
      I see a man's trail. Here is the man.' The stranger said, 'I am a
      young Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a. I am fit for work.' So they took him with them. Then
      they saw another trail, of which the Black Bear spoke to the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u
      leader. They overtook the man, who was Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}aqtsi or Real Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a. By
      and by they reached the village of the Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se. They entered
      the village and made peace with the inhabitants. Then the leader of
      the Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se said, 'We have some people come to us, and we
      will make them our chiefs.' So the two wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e were made chiefs. The
      wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e were then sent to search for a land where they might dwell,
      as the village of the Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a utacan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED T~}se was filthy and offensive on
      account of the dead bodies in and around it. This council was the
      first one of the whole nation. The two wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e went out as mourners
      for seven days. The Han{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}a wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e (Pan{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H~}ka = Ponka) came back first,
      saying, 'I have found a place.' Afterwards the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e
      returned and reported. The council was held again to decide to which
      place they would go. They agreed to settle at the place visited by
      the Tsi{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}u wacta{~LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED K~}e. Then four standards were made by members of the
      Wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}e (wanun gens, two for each side of the tribe. These were the
      standards made of minxa ha (swan or goose skins), and they were
      carried on the hunting road as well as on the war path. But the
      otter skin standards were always retained by the Wa{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}a{~LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O~}e gens."

      On comparing this version with that of Sa*d*ekice we notice that in
      one or the other a transposition of some parts has been made. In
      this latter tradition the appeals to the heavenly bodies and to the
      Red Bird were made before the journey to the four revolutions of the
      upper worlds.

   21 Here is where the two roads begin.

   22 At this point begins the account of the Female Beaver. She was an
      ancestor of the Osage, according to a statement published in Long's
      Expedition to the Rocky Mountains.

   23 See the author's paper in the American Naturalist for 1885, entitled
      "Kansas mourning and war customs," with which was published part of
      the chart mentioned above.

1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.

NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND -- If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.

exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.

any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of
this or any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, and (c) any Defect

           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}'s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at

  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

      General Information About Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
