The plant here represented has long been cultivated as a greenhouse
plant in this country under the name of _Convolvulus Cantabrica_, but it
differs so essentially from that plant, as figured and described by
Prof. Jacquin in his _Flora Austr._ and accords so little with the other
species described by Linnaeus, that we have been induced to regard it as
a perfectly distinct species; in most points it agrees with _Convolvulus
Cneorum_, but differs in having leaves much narrower, more pointed, and
less silky.

It strikes most readily from cuttings, is a hardy greenhouse plant, and
flowers during most of the Summer, qualities which many of the modern
and more shewy greenhouse plants cannot boast.

The precise time of its introduction here, together with its particular
place of growth, we have not as yet been able satisfactorily to
ascertain.

[Illustration: N^o. 290]

The Amaryllis lutea is a hardy perennial bulbous plant, a native of
Spain, and other of the more Southern parts of Europe, and was
cultivated in our Gardens in the time of Gerard, and Parkinson.

Flora, who commences her revolutionary reign, by enlivening the flower
border with the Spring Crocus, and its numerous varieties, terminates it
with flowers equally pleasing, and of similar hues; thus we have the
present plant, the Saffron Crocus, and the Colchicum, flowering nearly
at the same time, from the end of September, through October, and
sometimes part of November.

Similar as the Amaryllis is to the yellow Spring Crocus, in the colour,
and form of its flowers, it differs obviously in the number of its
stamina, the breadth of its leaves, and the size and colour of its root.

Authors describe it as varying in size, in the breadth of its leaves,
the height of its flowers, and multiplication of the Corolla.

The Dutch Florists export it under the title of yellow Colchicum,
following the name of some of the old writers.

It succeeds best in a soil moderately moist, in which it increases
considerably by offsets, and flowers to the most advantage when the
roots have remained for some few years undisturbed in the same spot.

[Illustration: N^o. 291]

We are happy in having it in our power to lay before our readers a
representation of the Caper shrub, whose blossoms are rarely seen in
this country, though its flower-buds are in very general use as a
pickle; indeed, so great is their consumption, that they form a very
considerable article of commerce.

The plant grows spontaneously in the more southern parts of Europe,
especially in Italy and the Levant; in its wild state it forms a shrub
of low growth, having numerous, spreading, spinous branches, somewhat
thickly beset with smooth roundish leaves; the blossoms grow alternately
on the branches, and when the plant begins to flower, one opens
generally every other morning, but so delicate are its parts, that on a
hot summer's day it fades before noon: the petals are white; the
filaments, which are extremely numerous, are white below, and of a rich
purple above; in these the beauty of the flower chiefly consists, as in
the pistillum or pointal does its great singularity; at first view, one
would be led to conclude, that the part so conspicuous in the centre of
the flower was the style terminated by the stigma in the usual way; but
if we trace this part of the flower to a more advanced state, we shall
perceive, that what we took for the style, was merely an elongation of
the flower-stalk, and what we took for the stigma, was in reality the
germen placed on it, crowned with a minute stigma, without any
intervening style; this germen swells, turns downward, and ultimately
becomes the seed-vessel, rarely ripening in this country.

Miller observes, that these plants are with difficulty preserved in
England, for they delight to grow in crevices of rocks, and the joints
of old walls and ruins, and always thrive best in an horizontal
position; so that when they are planted either in pots or the full
ground, they rarely thrive, though they may be kept alive for many
years.

It flowers in May and June, and is usually raised from seeds.

Mr. Aiton regards it as a greenhouse plant, and informs us that it was
cultivated by Gerard in 1596.

[Illustration: N^o. 292]

The _Passerina_ here figured, distinguished from all the other known
species by the largeness of its flowers, is described in the _Suppl.
Pl._ of the younger Linnaeus, but not enumerated in the _Hortus Kewensis_
of Mr. Aiton: it is indeed a plant recently introduced to this country
from the Cape; we saw it last Summer in great perfection, at Messrs. Lee
and Kennedy's, Hammersmith; it forms a small neat shrub, somewhat like
the _Phylica ericoides_, is a hardy greenhouse plant, flowering in May
and June, and increased without difficulty from cuttings.

     CHONDRILLA caerulea cyani capitulo. _Bauh. Pin. 130._

[Illustration: N^o. 293]

The _Catananche caerulea_ is a native of the South of France, where it
grows in hilly situations that are stony: it is a perennial herbaceous
plant, moderately hardy, and has long been cultivated in our gardens,
Mr. Aiton says, by Parkinson in 1640: Miller, who treats of it in his
Dictionary, describes it as a pretty ornament to a garden, and one that
is easily kept within bounds; there is certainly much about it to excite
our admiration, more especially in the structure of the calyx, and the
florets: the flowers, which are of a pale blue colour with a dark eye,
make their appearance from July to October.

It is propagated by seeds, which Miller recommends to be sown in the
Spring; the seedlings should be transplanted in the Autumn, into the
borders where they are to remain; it may also be increased by slips: the
plant requires a situation moderately dry, and is most productive of
flowers and seeds when it stands long in one spot.

In the 14th _edit._ of the _Systema Vegetab._ of Prof. Murray, mention
is made of a variety with double flowers, which we believe has not been
seen in this country.

[Illustration: N^o. 294]

The Guernsey Lily, as it is most commonly called, is originally a native
of Japan; where it is described to grow by Kaempfer and Thunberg, who
visited that island, the latter says on the hills about Nagasaki, from
thence roots are said to have been introduced to the garden of Johannes
Morinus at Paris, in which it flowered, October 1634: its introduction
to this country, which was subsequent to that date, as Dr. Douglass
relates in his _Monographia_ on this plant, "happened by a very singular
melancholy accident, of which Dr. Morison, who no doubt had it from some
persons then residing in Guernsey, gives us the following account: A
Dutch or English ship, it is uncertain which, coming from Japan, with
some of the roots of this flower on board, was cast away on the island
of Guernsey; the roots were thrown upon a sandy shore, and so by the
force of the winds and waves, were soon buried in sand; there they
remained for some years, and afterwards, to the great surprise and
admiration of the inhabitants, the flowers appeared in all their pomp
and beauty." Some of these soon made their appearance in this country:
Mr. Aiton relates, that the plant was cultivated here in 1659, by
General Lambert, at Wimbledon.

Fatal as Guernsey proved to the unfortunate mariners, it afforded the
roots of our plant a soil and situation apparently congenial to their
own; in that island they have flourished ever since, there they are
propagated in the open borders of the flower-garden with the least
possible trouble, flowering most readily, but we believe never producing
any ripe seeds; from thence most of the roots which flower with the
curious here, are yearly imported in the Autumn.

In Guernsey, the cold of the Winter is far less intense than with us;
many of those plants which we keep in our greenhouses, stand with them
in the open ground; the superior mildness of the climate enables them to
cultivate this plant with more success than we can do, even perhaps with
all the expence and trouble to which we might subject ourselves; to
such, however, whose situations may be favourable, and who may be fond
of making experiments, we recommend the perusal of Fairchild's
Directions, a practical Gardener of great ingenuity, and who appears to
have had much experience in the culture of this plant[A].

It is usual to plant the imported bulbs in pots of sand, or light loam,
as soon as they arrive, and place them in the parlour window, or
greenhouse; they blossom in September and October; the flowers, which
continue about a month in perfection, are inodorous, but make up for
that deficiency by the superior splendour of their colours: Dr. Douglass
thus describes them, each flower when in its prime looks like a fine
gold tissue wrought on a rose-coloured ground, but when it begins to
fade and decay, it looks more like a silver tissue, or what they call a
pink colour: when we look upon the flower in full sun-shine, each leaf
appears to be studded with thousands of little diamonds, sparkling and
glittering with a most surprising and agreeable lustre; but if we view
the same by candle-light, these numerous specks or spangles look more
like fine gold dust.

Both Kaempfer and Thunberg agree, that the Japanese regard the root as
poisonous.

[Footnote A: "They love a light earth, made with dung and sand, and a
little lime rubbish with it does very well, it keeps the roots sound;
for if the earth be too stiff or wet, you may keep them for many years
before they blow. If they are in pots, they should be put in the house
in Winter, to keep them from the severe frosts, which are apt to rot the
roots. The time of moving them is when they have no leaves on the root,
that is from June to August: those that come with six leaves this year,
seldom fail blowing the next year: they need not be put in fresh earth
above once in two or three years: by this method of management I have
had the same roots blow again in four years time. The many miscarriages
that happen to the Guernsey Lily, are by letting the leaves be killed by
the fierceness of the frost in Winter, or by cutting them off, as some
people do, when they are green, which will so much weaken the plants,
that they may keep them twenty years and not have them blow; by the
above management, where there is a stock, there will be continually some
blowing.

"Miller recommends for these roots the following compost: Take a
third-part of fresh virgin earth from a pasture-ground which is light,
then put near an equal part of sea-sand, to which you should add rotten
dung and sifted lime rubbish, of each an equal quantity."

The great business in the culture of this flower, next to a proper
soil and situation, seems to consist in giving the plant as much air as
possible, and in preserving the foliage in the Winter from the injury of
frost.]

Mr. Aiton informs us in his _Hortus Kewensis_, that the charming annual
here figured, the liveliness of whose colours no paint can express, was
cultivated by Miller in 1739; seeing it is a plant of such beauty, and
honoured with so distinguished an appellation, it is singular that it
should not by this time have made its way more generally into our
gardens.

The Cockle of our corn-fields is an ornamental plant, the present
species resembles it; but while the plant itself is much smaller, its
flowers are proportionably larger, and their colours more vivid.

It is an annual of ready growth, a native of Sicily and the Levant,
flowering in July and August, and ripening its seeds in September and
October.

It appears to most advantage when several plants of it grow together;
the best mode, therefore, is to sow about a dozen seeds early in April
on the several spots of the flower-border where you intend they shall
remain; no other care is necessary than to keep the plants free from
weeds and vermin.

The _Agr. Coeli rosa_ of _Miller's Gard. Dict. ed. 6 4to._ is the

[Illustration: N^o. 296]

We know of no figure of this plant, the first and only account of which
is to be found in the _Hort. Kew._ of Mr. Aiton; there it is
specifically described, and from thence we discover that it was
introduced from the Canary Islands, where it is a native, by Mr. Masson,
in 1779.

It is a shrubby plant of low growth, producing numerous fleshy leaves
growing thickly together, which being evergreen, and making a pretty
appearance the year through, render the plant worthy a place in all
general collections at least, of greenhouse plants; and though it cannot
vie with many of the more shewy high-priced novelties, it is an abiding
plant, not subject to casualties, while many of those are here to day
and gone to morrow.

It throws up its flowering stems, supporting numerous, starry,
stonecrop-like flowers, in July and August, and is most readily
propagated by cuttings.

It is one of those species of Houseleek which connect the genera _Sedum_
& _Sempervivum_.

[Illustration: N^o. 297]

Many of the plants of this genus diffuse an agreeable odour, which
renders them most desirable objects for the flower-garden: this quality
the present species possesses in a superior degree to most others; a few
of its flowers communicate to a nosegay a delicate and most delicious
smell, or placed in a vial of water they will even scent a small
apartment[B]: it is to be regretted, however, that the blossoms, unless
placed in water, from their extreme delicacy, flag soon after they are
gathered.

It may be doubted whether the _Dianthus superbus_ of _Miller's Dict. ed.
6. 4to._ be our plant; if it be, the description is not drawn up with
that accuracy which distinguishes his descriptions in general; the mode
of culture, however, which he recommends is strictly applicable to it,
as the plant rarely continues in vigour more than two years, and as it
is in its greatest beauty the first year of its flowering, he recommends
that young plants should be annually raised for succession from seeds,
which are plentifully produced; the seeds of this plant ought therefore
to be kept in the shops with annuals and biennials.

The _Dianthus superbus_ is a native of Germany, Switzerland, France, and
Denmark: Clusius found it growing in the moist meadows about Vienna, and
on the borders of woods adjoining to such, with some of its flowers
white, others purplish; Parkinson describes them of these two colours,
but says the most ordinary with us are pure white, which is contrary to
what we now find them: they are rarely produced before August, from
which period they will continue frequently to blossom till October.

The Spring is the best time for sowing its seeds; the plants require no
very nice or particular treatment.

[Footnote B: This fragrance has been noticed by all the old authors who
have treated of the plant: Clusius describes the flowers as _suavissimi
odoris et e longinquo nares ferientis_, of which words Parkinson's are
almost a literal translation "of a most fragrant sent, comforting the
spirits and senses afarre off."]

[Illustration: N^o. 298]

By the name of Dittany of Crete, the species of Origanum here figured,
has long been known in this country as a medicinal plant; to the
purposes of physic it still indeed continues to be applied, as imported
in a dried state from the Levant: when bruised, the whole plant gives
forth an aromatic fragrance, highly grateful; as an ornamental plant, it
has also been long, and is now, very generally cultivated in this
country. Turner, whose Herbal was printed in 1568, writes thus
concerning it, "I have sene it growynge in England in Maister Riches
gardin naturally, but it groweth no where ellis that I know of, saving
only in Candy." As at this period no idea was entertained of a
greenhouse, the plant must have been cultivated in the open ground,
where it would doubtless grow readily, if secured from the severity of
the weather, it being more hardy than many plants usually kept in
greenhouses.

This plant is at all times ornamental, but more particularly so when in
flower, in which state it appears during most of the summer and autumnal
months.

It is usually increased by cuttings, which strike readily.

[Illustration: N^o. 299]

_Hermannia_ is a genus of plants named in honour of Dr. Paul Herman, a
Dutch Botanist of great celebrity, author of the _Paradisus Batavus_,
and other valuable works: twenty-six species are enumerated in the 13th
edition of the _Syst. Naturae_ of Linnaeus by Prof. Gmelin, and eight in
the _Hortus Kewensis_ of Mr. Aiton; most of those in the latter work are
cultivated in the nurseries near town: they form a set of the more hardy
greenhouse plants, grow readily, and flower freely; their blossoms are
for the most part yellow, and have a considerable affinity with those of
the _Mahernia_.

The present species flowers very early in the spring, from February to
May, producing a great profusion of bloom during that period; is a
native of the Cape, and was cultivated by Mr. Miller, in 1728.

It rarely ripens its seeds with us, but is readily increased by
cuttings.

The nurserymen near town regard this plant as the _grossularifolia_ of
Linnaeus, calling another, equally common species, with longer and
narrower leaves, _alnifolia_, and which does not appear to be described
by Linnaeus or mentioned by Mr. Aiton; our plant accords exactly with the
Linnaean description of _alnifolia_, and there is we think no doubt of
its being the _alnifolia_ of the _Hortus Kewensis_, and Mr. Miller's
_Dictionary_.

In the summer of 1794, towards the end of July, the Gnaphalium here
figured, the most magnificent and shewy of all the species hitherto
introduced to this country, flowered in great perfection at Messrs. Lee
and Kennedy's, Hammersmith: Mr. Lee informs me, that he raised it from
seeds given him by Capt. William Paterson, author of a Narrative of four
journeys into the country of the Hottentots, and Caffraria, and who has
most laudably exerted himself in introducing many new and interesting
plants to this country; this gentleman assured Mr. Lee, that the plant
was found in a wild state, five hundred miles from the Cape, on the
borders of the Caffre country, from whence the natives bring bundles of
the dried plant to the Cape as presents; in the state the plant has long
since been imported from that fertile coast: if we mistake not, a
specimen of this sort is figured in Petiver's works, and a coloured
representation is given of it in Edwards's History of Birds, taken from
a dried plant, brought from the Cape, by Capt. Isaac Worth, in 1749.

The plants we saw were about a foot and a half high, the stalks shrubby,
and but little branched; the foliage and flowers as represented on the
plate.

Several of the Gnaphaliums it is well known are liable to be killed by
moisture, especially in the winter season; during that time, this plant
in particular, should be kept as dry as possible, and, if convenient, on
a shelf, separate from the other plants of the greenhouse; when it is
necessary to give it water, it should never come in contact with the
foliage or flowers: with these precautions it may be kept very well in a
good greenhouse, in which it should remain, even during summer.

It may be raised from seeds, and also from cuttings.

There are few flowers that do not secrete from some kind of a glandular
substance, honey, or nectar, to a greater or smaller amount; in those of
the present genus, this liquid is particularly abundant, even dropping
from the flowers of the _major_, in considerable quantity; in the
present species it flows not so copiously, but is retained in the lower
part of the blossom, and is of a dark brown colour, an unusual
phenomenon.

There are only two species of this genus described, the _major_ and the
_minor_, both of which are cultivated in our nurseries; the _major_ is
by far the most common, the most hardy, and the most ornamental plant;
its foliage indeed is peculiarly elegant: this species will succeed in
the open border, especially if placed at the foot of a wall with a south
or south-west aspect, taking care to cover the root to a considerable
depth with rotten tan in severe frosts: the _minor_ is always kept in
the greenhouse, in which, when it has acquired a certain age, it flowers
regularly in the spring, and constantly so, as far as we have observed
of the plants in Chelsea Garden; Mr. Aiton says in August, and Commelin
the summer through.

The _Melianthus minor_ grows to the height of three, four, or five feet;
its stem, which is shrubby, during the flowering season is apt to
exhibit a naked appearance, having fewer leaves on it at that period,
and those not of their full size; but this, perhaps, may in some degree
be owing to the plant's being placed at the back of others.

The foliage when bruised has an unpleasant smell.

It is a native of the Cape, and, according to Mr. Aiton, was cultivated
by the Duchess of Beaufort, in 1708; is propagated readily by cuttings.

[Illustration: N^o. 302]

The seeds of this species of Mimosa having been sent over in plenty,
with some of the first vegetable productions of New South-Wales, and
growing readily, the plant has been raised by many cultivators in this
country; Mr. Hoy, gardener to the Duke of Northumberland, produced a
specimen of it in flower at a meeting of the Linnean Society in 1790; it
is a shrub of quick growth, and a ready blower: a plant of it in the
stove of Chelsea-Garden has this year (May 10, 1795) produced ripe pods,
and perfect seeds. In the greenhouse, where it flowers from February to
April, the blossoms go off without shewing any tendency to produce
fruit.

It is first described by Dr. Smith, in the Transactions of the Linnean
Society; the leaves in the plants that have fallen under our notice have
not accorded exactly with those he has described, having neither been of
a glaucous green colour, according to the usual acceptation of that
term, nor very much undulated; and though those of an individual plant
may have presented such an appearance, we are persuaded they do not do
so generally when growing and in good health.

The foliage is usually edged with red, and the flowers are fragrant.

[Illustration: N^o. 303]

The Erica here figured has some affinity in the form of its flowers to
the _E. ventricosa_, as these in their shape resemble a flask or bottle,
especially of that kind in which water is usually kept, we have named it
_ampullacea_; it is of very modern introduction.

On the 11th of June 1784, we had the pleasure to see a small plant of
this species in flower, with Mr. Williams, Nurseryman, Turnham-Green, an
unwearied and ingenious cultivator of this beautiful tribe of plants in
particular, the richness of whose collection will appear in the
subsequent list; by him it was raised from Cape seeds, though not more
than the height of ten inches, it produced eighteen branches, most of
which put forth flowers at their summits; we counted sixty-six blossoms
on this small plant.

The leaves are short, linear, somewhat triangular, rigid, edged with
fine crooked hairs, very visible when magnified, and terminating in a
mucro or point, on the older branches recurved and mostly eight-rowed;
each branch is usually terminated by four or five flowers, at first
growing closely together, and covered so strongly with a glutinous
substance, as to look as if varnished, and which is so adhesive as to
catch ants and small flies; as the flowering advances, they separate
more widely from each other, and finally a young branch grows out of the
centre from betwixt them; the true calyx is composed of four lanceolate
leaves, sitting close to and glued as it were to the corolla; besides
these, there are several other leaves, which might be mistaken for those
of the calyx, but which may with more propriety be called Bracteae or
Floral-leaves; some of these, like the calyx, are wholly red, others red
and green mixed together, and broader than the leaves of the plant; the
flowers are about an inch and a quarter in length, inflated below, and
contracted above into a long narrow neck, dilating again so as to form a
kind of knob, in which the antherae are contained, just below the limb,
which divides into four somewhat ovate obtuse segments, the upper side
of these segments is of a very pale flesh colour, the under side of them
as well as the dilated part just below them bright red, the body of the
flower flesh colour, marked with eight longitudinal stripes, of a deeper
hue; filaments eight, antherae within the tube; style projecting about
the eighth of an inch beyond the corolla; stigma, a round glutinous
head.

The flowers as they decay become of a deeper red colour, and finally
pale brown, still retaining their form and appearing to
advantage;--hitherto the plant has produced no seeds here, is increased
with difficulty either by cuttings or layers, but with most certainty in
the latter way.

The _Hermannia_ here figured is a plant of humble growth, forming a
small bushy shrub, a foot or a foot and a half in height, and producing
numerous flowers thinly scattered over the branches, the greatest part
of the summer; it is this disposition which it has of flowering so
freely, that renders it a desirable plant for the greenhouse, in which
it is commonly kept, and of which it is an old inhabitant.

Dillenius has figured it in his admirable work the _Hortus Elthamensis_,
published in 1732; hence we learn that it was cultivated in Mr.
Sherard's celebrated garden at Eltham prior to that date.

It is a native of the Cape, and is readily increased by cuttings.

Mr. Aiton, in his _Hortus Kewensis_, has inserted this species of
Amaryllis, as named and described by the younger Linnaeus; he informs us,
that it is a native of the West-Indies, and was introduced by Dr.
William Pitcairn, in 1778: as its time of flowering is not mentioned, we
may presume, that it had not blossomed in the royal garden when the
publication before mentioned first made its appearance; it no doubt has
since, as we have seen it in that state in the collections of several
Nurserymen, particularly those of Mr. Grimwood and Mr. Colvill.

It flowers towards the end of April.

The flowering stem rises above the foliage, to the height of about a
foot or more, produces from one to three flowers, similar to, but not
quite so large as those of the Mexican Amaryllis, to which it is nearly
related; it differs however from that plant essentially in this, that
the lower part of the flower projects further than the upper, which
gives to its mouth that obliquity which Linnaeus describes.

The spatha is composed of two leaves, which standing up at a certain
period of the plant's flowering like ears, give to the whole flower a
fancied resemblance of a horse's head; whether Linnaeus derived his name
of _equestris_ from this circumstance or not, he does not condescend to
inform us.

Mr. Aiton regards it as a greenhouse plant; like those of many of the
Ixias, however, the bulbs are of the more tender kind.

It is propagated by offsets, but not very readily.

The _Othonna pectinata_ is a native of Africa, a long-established and
common plant in greenhouses, having been cultivated by Mr. Miller, in
1731; it recommends itself chiefly on account of its foliage, which
forms a pleasing contrast to the darker greens of other plants.

It flowers in May and June, is moderately hardy, and readily increased
by cuttings.

In many collections we meet with old plants of it three or four feet
high; formerly, when greenhouse plants were few in numbers and the
houses large, it might be proper to keep such; but now there is not that
necessity, especially since the vast accession of plants from the Cape
and New-Holland, made within these few years.

proportionably large, and of a deep yellow colour, inclined to orange.

It is a plant of free growth, much disposed to produce flowers during
most of the summer months; hence it is kept very generally in
collections of greenhouse plants: is propagated readily by cuttings.

It has fallen to the lot of this plant to have an unusual degree of
attention bestowed on it by various botanists, and after being regarded
as a distinct genus by several, to be finally classed with the
_Verbena_; in the _Supplementum Plantarum_ of the younger Linnaeus it is
minutely described.

We learn from the _Hortus Kewensis_ of Mr. Aiton that it is a native of
North-America, introduced by Mons. Richard in 1774, and that it flowers
in June and July.

The extreme brilliancy of its colours renders it a very ornamental
greenhouse plant, it seldom grows above the height of two feet; in
favourable seasons ripens its seeds readily, by which it is usually
propagated, being a biennial.

[Illustration: N^o. 309]

This singular and most beautiful species of Pelargonium, recently
introduced to this country, this Summer flowered with Mr. Colvill,
Nurseryman, in the King's-Road, Chelsea, from one of whose plants our
figure and description have been taken.

Stalk green, surface smooth and somewhat glossy, fleshy, beset with
spines which bend back and terminate in brownish somewhat weak points;
these appear to have been primarily the stipulae, which become thus
fleshy and rigid, and from this circumstance not altogether peculiar to
this species, it takes the name of _echinatum_; the leaves stand on long
footstalks, are somewhat heart-shaped, mostly roundish, divided into
three or five lobes, veiny, soft, and downy, especially on the under
side, which is of a much lighter colour than the upper, the flowering
stem proceeds from the summit of the stalk, and is a foot or more in
height; as it advances it throws out its branches, or peduncles,
ultimately about five in number, each of which has a leaf at its base,
similar to the other leaves of the plant, but smaller, and terminates in
an umbel of seven or eight flowers; as the umbels blossom in succession,
a period of several months usually intervenes betwixt the blowing of the
first and the last; when the flower is expanded, the hindmost leaf of
the calyx continues upright, the others are reflexed as in other species
of this genus, they are all beset with fine long hairs; the three
lowermost petals are pure white, with a little gibbosity at the base of
each, the two uppermost are marked each with three irregular spots, of a
rich purple colour, inclining to carmine, the two lowermost spots
narrowest and of the deepest colour; of the stamina there are six
filaments which have antherae, and four of which have none; stigma red,
divided into five parts, and a little longer than the fertile filaments.

In its habit this plant resembles somewhat the _Pelargonium
cordifolium_, is a native of the Cape, flowers from May to September, in
favourable seasons has produced seeds here, but is more usually
increased by cuttings.

Varies with petals of a rich purple colour, in which the spots are
similar, though not so conspicuous.

It is a very desirable little plant for the decoration of rock work,
growing in close tufts, and producing numerous flowers of a lively
purple colour during most of the summer months.

Is increased without difficulty by parting its roots in Autumn, or from
seed; in the winter some plants of it should be kept in pots under a
frame or hand-glass, as it is liable to be injured by wet and frost.

There are few trees or shrubs which have contributed more to adorn our
plantations, and shrubberies, than those of this genus, nine species of
which are enumerated in the _Hort. Kew._ of Mr. Aiton, most of these are
natives either of North-America, or Siberia: the present species, an
inhabitant of Carolina, is perhaps the most ornamental of the whole: its
large pendant bunches of rose-coloured flowers load the branches in May
and June, and sometimes a second crop will be produced late in the
season, these with us usually fall off without producing any
seed-vessels.

This shrub is not disposed to grow very tall in America, it is most
prudent indeed to keep it humble, to the height of four or five feet,
and to plant it in a sheltered part of the garden, as its branches are
liable to be broken by high winds: Marshall (_Arb. Amer._) describes it
as spreading much from its running roots; we have not observed it to do
so in any great degree here; it is propagated by layers, by cuttings of
the roots, and by grafting; it is of ready growth, disposed to blow even
when young, and not nice as to soil, or situation; the flowers afford a
good example of the class Diadelphia, they are large and beautiful, but
without scent.

Was cultivated by Mr. Miller in 1758. _Ait. Kew._

There is a considerable similarity betwixt the representation of the
present plant and that of the _Linum arboreum_ figured on the 234th
plate of this work, they are nevertheless two species widely differing,
the _flavum_ being a hardy herbaceous perennial, a native of Germany,
the _arboreum_ a greenhouse shrub from the Levant, both possessing
considerable beauty, and highly worthy a place in all collections of
ornamental plants.

The _Linum flavum_ is not mentioned either in the Dictionary of Mr.
Miller, or the Hortus Kewensis of Mr. Aiton, and as far as our knowledge
extends was a stranger in this country, till we raised it the year
before last from seeds sent us by Mr. Daval, of Orbe in Switzerland;
Clusius gives us a representation of it in flower, and Prof. Jacquin
another much superior; according to the latter, it grows by the sides of
hedges and among shrubs in mountainous situations, and rarely exceeds a
foot in height.

From the little experience we have had of this plant, it appears to be
easy of culture, and to succeed best in a soil moderately stiff and
moist; the flowers expand most in a morning when the sun shines, and
continue in succession during June, July, and part of August; it appears
as if it would ripen its seeds in my garden; these vegetate freely: the
plant may also be increased by parting its roots in autumn, or by
cuttings of the young shoots.

This charming little shrub is a native of Switzerland and Austria:
Clusius informs us that it grows in great abundance on many of the
mountains near Vienna, so much so that women gather it when in flower
and sell it in the markets; its beautiful and fragrant blossoms come
forth in April and May, the principal season for its flowering, but it
frequently blows during most of the Summer, and even in the Autumn; it
varies with white blossoms.

It is extremely hardy, thrives remarkably well in road sand in almost
any situation; is propagated by seeds, which very rarely ripen with us,
by layers, and by grafting it on the stock of the Mezereon, whereby it
acquires an elevation superior to what it has naturally.

Mons. L'Heritier, author of many modern publications in Botany,
distinguished for their accuracy and elegance, was the first who
described and figured this species of Genista, a native of Corsica, and
cultivated here by John Ord, Esq. as long since as the year 1770.

It is a hardy, evergreen, trailing shrub, producing a vast profusion of
bloom; which renders it eminently conspicuous in May and June; its
flowers are rarely succeeded by seed-vessels, so that it is usually
propagated by layers.

When tied up properly, and carefully trained to stake, it may vie with
most of our ornamental shrubs: for covering a wall, or paling, where the
situation is not too shady, it probably would succeed very well, at
least it is deserving of trial.

Mr. Aiton informs us that this species of Pelargonium, which is one of
the more fleshy kinds, is a native of the South-West Coast of Africa,
and was introduced to the Royal Garden at Kew by Mr. Anthony Hove in
1786.

It flowers during most of the Summer months, and ripens its seeds, by
which it may be increased, as also by cuttings; it is found to be more
tender than many others, and more liable to be injured by damps, and
hence it will require a treatment more applicable to a dry stove plant.

[Illustration: N^o. 316]

Clusius, in his _Hist. Pl. rar._ gives an accurate description and good
figure of the present plant, before unnoticed (as he observes) by any
author; it has since been particularly described by Haller and Jacquin;
the former makes a distinct genus of it, by the name of _Polygaloides_.

It is an elegant little evergreen shrub of low growth, rarely exceeding
a foot in height, with leaves like those of box, producing flowers from
May to October, but most plentifully in May and June; each flower stands
on a peduncle proceeding from a kind of triphyllous cup, formed of
floral leaves, the true calyx is composed of three leaves, which are
nearly white; the two outermost petals, similar to the wings of a
papilionaceous flower, are also white, or nearly so; the third petal
which forms a kind of tube and contains the eight stamina with the
pistillum, is white at the base, but yellow towards the extremity, where
it changes by degrees to a bright bay colour: both Clusius and Jacquin
observed a variety of this plant, in which the calyx and wings were of a
beautiful purple; this variety, we believe, has not yet been introduced
to this country: the common sort was cultivated in the garden at Oxford,
in 1658.

Miller describes it as a plant difficult of cultivation; it is not now
regarded as such; both Clusius and Jacquin describe it as having
creeping roots; such plants are generally increased without difficulty,
and so is this; planted in bog earth on a shady border, it thrives
extremely well, and spawns much, so that there is no necessity for
having recourse to its seeds. It grows spontaneously on the Alps of
Austria and Switzerland.

[Illustration: N^o. 317]

This charming little shrub, highly deserving of being more generally
known, is a native of the South of France; and was cultivated here by
Miller in 1748.

In favourable situations, it produces blossoms in great profusion during
most of the Summer, and ripens seed in abundance: the situation it
affects is dry and sandy, but it is a shrub by no means nice, as to soil
or place of growth, and so hardy as to have borne the severity of last
Winter, 1795, without injury.

In the collections about town we frequently find it in pots, kept with
greenhouse plants.

It is said to vary with white flowers.

The best mode of raising it is from seed.

Botanists are divided in their opinions respecting the genus of this
plant; Linnaeus considers it as an _Anthericum_, Haller and Miller make
it an _Hemerocallis_.

It is a native of Switzerland, where, Haller informs us, it grows
abundantly in the Alpine meadows, and even on the summits of the
mountains; with us it flowers in May and June.

It is a plant of great elegance, producing on an unbranched stem about a
foot and a half high, numerous flowers of a delicate white colour, much
smaller but resembling in form those of the common white lily,
possessing a considerable degree of fragrance, their beauty is
heightened by the rich orange colour of their antherae; unfortunately
they are but of short duration.

Miller describes two varieties of it differing merely in size.

A loamy soil, a situation moderately moist, with an eastern or western
exposure, suits this plant best; so situated, it will increase by its
roots, though not very fast, and by parting of these in the autumn, it
is usually propagated.

Parkinson describes and figures it in his _Parad. Terrest._ observing
that "divers allured by the beauty of its flowers, had brought it into
these parts."

In Italy and Spain, where this plant grows spontaneously, it is an
annual, producing seed in abundance; with us (as far at least as we have
observed) it produces no seed, but like the _Senecio elegans_, and some
other annuals, is renewed, and rendered perennial by cuttings, which
strike freely, and by which the plant requires to be renovated once or
twice in a season; though described as growing with an upright stem, it
requires to be tied up to a stick; and if this be neatly and dexterously
done, its brilliant azure flowers springing from every side of the stem,
render it a charming ornament for the greenhouse or window: it flowers
during most of the year.

Clusius called it _Anagallis Monnelli_, the first knowledge he had of
the plant being from his friend Johannes Monnellus.

On the same plant we find the leaves grow two, three, or four together,
with flowers corresponding.

[Illustration: N^o. 320]

This species of _Lobelia_, so eminently distinguished for the richness
of its scarlet blossoms, is a native of the colder as well as warmer
parts of North-America. Parkinson, who cultivated it in 1629, informs us
that he received plants of it from France for his garden, and that "it
groweth neere the river of Canada, where the French plantation in
America is seated."

It is a hardy herbaceous plant, growing in favourable situations to the
height of three or four feet; the main spike of flowers which terminates
the stalk, is often a foot in length; by the time that most of its
flowers are blown, side branches shoot out, and flower; so that the
plant continues in bloom six weeks or two months: if the Autumn prove
favourable, the plant with us produces plenty of seed in the open
ground; to insure its ripening, some place pots of it, when blowing, in
the greenhouse or stove.

Beautiful and hardy as this plant is, and long as it has been introduced
to this country, we do not find it generally in gardens; we attribute
this to its having, in a greater degree than many other plants, a
partiality for a particular soil; in certain districts, where the soil
is stiff and moist, it grows as freely as any weed, in other soils it is
perpetually going off: it is also one of those plants whose roots
require to be often parted; if this be done every Autumn, and they be
planted in a stiff loam, the situation somewhat moist and shady, this
very desirable plant may be had to grow and blossom in perfection.

It flowers from the latter end of July to October.

Is increased by parting its roots, by cuttings of the stalk and from
seed.

[Illustration: N^o. 321]

The _Cotyledon orbiculata_ is one of our oldest succulents, being
introduced as long since as 1690, by Mr. Bentick[C]: it still retains a
place in most collections, deservedly indeed, for it has every claim to
our notice; its appearance is magnificent, the glaucous colour of its
foliage highly pleasing, its flowers large and of long duration; it
blows freely, grows rapidly, is easily increased by cuttings, and will
succeed in a house or window, with the common treatment of an African
Geranium.

When suffered to grow, it will become a shrub of considerable size; but
this is not necessary for its flowering, as young and small plants are
disposed to throw out blossoms, which is not the case with a plant
extremely similar to, and often confounded with it, viz. the _Crassula
Cotyledon_, whose foliage indeed scarcely differs from our plant but in
being finely dotted.

It is a native of the Cape, and flowers from June or July to September.

In the _Hort. Kew._ of Mr. Aiton, four varieties are enumerated,
differing chiefly in the form of their foliage.

Linnaeus describes this plant in the _Amoenitates Academicae_ under the
name of _Selago tomentosa_, by which name he continues to call it in the
third edition of the _Spec. Pl._ in his _Mantissa_ he describes it more
minutely, and changes it to the Genus _Manulea_, first established by
him in the said work; he observes, that in this species the corolla is
more regular than in the others.

Mr. Aiton regards it as a biennial, its stalk is a foot or a foot and a
half high, and woolly, its branches are opposite, not alternate as
Linnaeus describes them; in this perhaps they may vary; leaves opposite,
sessile, obovate, narrowing to the base, toothed on the edge, edge
rolled back a little in the young leaves, flowers grow in a long
thyrsus, from two to five proceed from one common short peduncle; they
are at first lemon-coloured, or greenish yellow, finally deep orange;
Linnaeus says the whole of the plant except the corolla is woolly, the
tube of that even is hairy, the segments are smooth, with their edges
rolled back, the upper part of the tube in which the stamina are
included is dilated somewhat, as is also the lower part, so that it is
narrowest in the middle. The flowers which make their appearance from
May to November are usually succeeded by seeds, by which the plant is
propagated.

It is a native of the Cape, and, according to Mr. Aiton, was introduced
by Mr. Masson, in 1774.

The blossoms have a singular but unpleasant smell, not perceivable at a
distance.

The variety of pleasant colours so conspicuous in the flowers, renders
this rare plant desirable to such as aim at a general collection.

[Illustration: N^o. 323]

Botanists and Gardeners have given to this species of Rubus the name of
_flowering_, not because it is the only one which produces flowers, but
from its being regarded for its flowers merely; they indeed are so
shewy, and so plentifully produced, that the plant has long been thought
to merit a place in most shrubberies; to the various inhabitants of
which, both in the largeness and elegant form of its leaves, and the
colour of its blossoms, it forms a pleasing contrast.

It is extremely hardy, and easily propagated by suckers; the only care
which it requires, is to keep it within proper bounds: young plants of
it produce the largest and finest flowers.

It blossoms from June to September, is a native of different and distant
parts of North-America, and was cultivated here by Mr. Miller, in 1739.

Cornutus, who first figured and described this plant, gave it the name
of _odoratus_, on account of the fragrance of its foliage; his words are
"elegantissimi hujus folia fragrantissima sunt, paremque agrimonio
odorato spirant odorem;" the fruit, rarely produced with us, he
observes, is like the common Raspberry, but not so pleasant.

appears to have been a stranger to the particoloured variety now so
generally cultivated as an ornamental annual in our gardens; in its wild
state the flowers of this _Antirrhinum_ are of a yellow hue, with little
or no purple in them, such indeed are frequently produced from seeds
sown in our gardens.

It is a hardy annual, a native of Spain and Sicily, a plant of ready
growth, requiring the common treatment of annuals sown in the Spring,
and much disposed indeed to come up spontaneously where it has once
grown; in sowing its seeds, care should be taken to preserve the produce
of such flowers as have the most purple in them.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
