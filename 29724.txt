PREFACE.


This book has been prepared with the idea that teachers generally would
be glad to introduce into their classes work dealing with the real
objects of nature, provided the work chosen were of a character that
would admit of its being studied at all seasons and in all localities,
and that the subject were one of general interest, and one that could be
taught successfully by those who have had no regular scientific
instruction.

The trees of our forests, lawns, yards, orchards, streets, borders, and
parks give us just such a department. Though many consider a large part
of the vegetable kingdom of little importance, and unworthy of any
serious study, there are few who do not admire, and fewer still who do
not desire to know, our trees, the monarchs of all living things.

The difficulty in tree study by the aid of the usual botanies lies
mainly in the fact that in using them the first essential parts to be
examined are the blossoms and their organs. These remain on the trees a
very short time, are often entirely unnoticed on account of their small
size or obscure color, and are usually inaccessible even if seen. In
this book the leaves, the wood, the bark, and, in an elementary way, the
fruit are the parts to which the attention is directed; these all can be
found and studied throughout the greater part of the year, and are just
the parts that must be thoroughly known by all who wish to learn to
recognize trees.

Though every teacher is at liberty to use the book as he thinks best,
the author, who has been a class teacher for over twenty years, is of
the opinion that but little of Part I. need be thoroughly studied and
recited, with the exception of Chapter III. on leaves. The object of
this chapter is not to have the definitions recited (the recitation of
definitions in school work is often useless or worse than useless), but
to teach the pupil to use the terms properly and to make them a portion
of his vocabulary. The figures on pages 38-43 are designed for class
description, and for the application of botanical words. The first time
the chapter is studied the figure illustrating the term should be
pointed out by the pupil; then, as a review of the whole chapter, the
student should be required to give a full description of each leaf.

After this work with Chapter III., and the careful reading of the whole
of Part I., the pupils can begin the description of trees, and, as the
botanical words are needed, search can be made for them under the proper
heads or in the Glossary.

The Keys are for the use of those who know nothing of scientific botany.
The advanced botanist may think them too artificial and easy; but let
him remember that this work was written for the average teacher who has
had no strictly scientific training. We can hardly expect that the great
majority of people will ever become scientific in any line, but it is
possible for nearly every one to become interested in and fully
acquainted with the trees of his neighborhood.

The attainment of such botanical knowledge by the plan given in this
volume will not only accomplish this useful purpose, but will do what is
worth far more to the student, _i.e._, teach him to employ his own
senses in the investigation of natural objects, and to use his own
powers of language in their description.

With hardly an exception, the illustrations in the work are taken from
original drawings from nature by the author. A few of the scales of
pine-cones were copied from London's "Encyclopaedia of Trees"; some of
the Retinospora cones were taken from the "Gardener's Chronicle"; and
three of the illustrations in Part I. are from Professor Gray's works.

The size of the illustration as compared with the specimen of plant is
indicated by a fraction near it; 1/4 indicates that the drawing is one
fourth as long as the original, 1/1 that it is natural size, etc. The
notching of the margin is reduced to the same extent; so a margin which
in the engraving looks about entire, might in the leaf be quite
distinctly serrate. The only cases in which the scale is not given are
in the cross-sections of the leaves among the figures of coniferous
plants. These are uniformly three times the natural size, except the
section of Araucaria imbricata, which is not increased in scale.

The author has drawn from every available source of information, and in
the description of many of the species no attempt whatever has been made
to change the excellent wording of such authors as Gray, Loudon, etc.

The ground covered by the book is that of the wild and cultivated trees
found east of the Rocky Mountains, and north of the southern boundary of
Virginia and Missouri. It contains not only the native species, but all
those that are successfully cultivated in the whole region; thus
including all the species of Ontario, Quebec, etc., on the north, and
many species, both wild and cultivated, of the Southern States and the
Pacific coast. In fact, the work will be found to contain so large a
proportion of the trees of the Southern States as to make it very useful
in the schools of that section.

Many shrubby plants are introduced; some because they occasionally grow
quite tree-like, others because they can readily be trimmed into
tree-forms, others because they grow very tall, and still others because
they are trees in the Southern States.

In nomenclature a conservative course has been adopted. The most
extensively used text-book on the subject of Botany, "Gray's Manual,"
has recently been rewritten. That work includes every species, native
and naturalized, of the region covered by this book, and the names as
given in that edition have been used in all cases.

Scientific names are marked so as to indicate the pronunciation. The
vowel of the accented syllable is marked by the grave accent (`) if
long, and by the acute (') if short.

In the preparation of this book the author has received much valuable
aid. His thanks are especially due to the authorities of the Arnold
Arboretum, Boston, Massachusetts, and of the Missouri Botanical Garden,
St. Louis, for information in regard to the hardiness of species; to Mr.
John H. Redfield, of the Botanical Department of the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences, for books, specimens from which to make
illustrations, etc.; and to Dr. A. C. Stokes, of Trenton, New Jersey,
for assistance in many ways, but especially for the accurate manner in
which he has inked the illustrations from the author's pencil-drawings.

The author also wishes to acknowledge the help received from many
nurserymen in gathering specimens for illustration and in giving
information of great value. Among these, special thanks are due to Mr.
Samuel C. Moon, of Morrisville Nurseries, who placed his large
collection of living specimens at the author's disposal, and in many
other ways gave him much intelligent aid.

TREES.




PART I.

THE ESSENTIAL ORGANS, AND THE TERMS NEEDED FOR THEIR DESCRIPTION.




CHAPTER I.

_Roots._


Though but little study of the roots of trees is practicable, some
knowledge of their forms, varieties, and parts is important.

The great office of the roots of all plants is the taking in of food
from the soil. Thick or fleshy roots, such as the radish, are stocks of
food prepared for the future growth of the plant, or for the production
of flowers and fruit. The thick roots of trees are designed mainly for
their secure fastening in the soil. The real mouths by which the food is
taken in are the minute tips of the hair-like roots found over the
surface of the smaller branches. As trees especially need a strong
support, they all have either a _tap-root_--one large root extending
from the lower end of the trunk deep down into the ground; or _multiple
roots_--a number of large roots mainly extending outward from the base
of the trunk.

Trees with large tap-roots are very hard to transplant, and cannot with
safety be transferred after they have attained any real size. The
Hickories and Oaks belong to this class.

Trees having multiple roots are readily transplanted, even when large.
The Maples and Elms are of this class.

Roots that grow from the root-end of the embryo of the seed are called
_primary roots_; those growing from slips or from stems anywhere are
_secondary roots_.

Some trees grow luxuriantly with only secondary roots; such trees can
readily be raised from stems placed in the ground. The Willows and
Poplars are good examples of this group. Other trees need all the
strength that primary roots can give them; these have to be raised from
seed. Peach-trees are specially good examples, but practically most
trees are best raised from seed.

A few trees can be easily raised from root-cuttings or from suckers
which grow up from roots. The Ailanthus, or "Tree of Heaven," is best
raised in this way. Of this tree there are three kinds, two of which
have disagreeable odors when in bloom, but the other is nearly odorless.
By using the roots or the suckers of the third kind, only those which
would be pleasant to have in a neighborhood would be obtained. One of
the large cities of the United States has in its streets thousands of
the most displeasing of these varieties and but few of the right sort,
all because the nurseryman who originally supplied the city used
root-cuttings from the disagreeable kind.

If such trees were raised from the seed, only about one third would be
desirable, and their character could be determined only when they had
reached such a size as to produce fruit, when it would be too late to
transplant them. Fruit-trees, when raised from the seed, have to be
grafted with the desired variety in order to secure good fruit when they
reach the bearing age.




CHAPTER II.

_Stems and Branches._


The stem is the distinguishing characteristic of trees, separating them
from all other groups of plants. Although in the region covered by this
book the trees include all the very large plants, size alone does not
make a tree.

A plant with a single trunk of woody structure that does not branch for
some distance above the ground, is called a _tree_. Woody plants that
branch directly above the soil, even though they grow to the height of
twenty feet or more, are called _shrubs_, or, in popular language,
_bushes_. Many plants which have a tendency to grow into the form of
shrubs may, by pruning, be forced to grow tree-like; some that are
shrubs in the northern States are trees further south.

All the trees that grow wild, or can be cultivated out of doors, in the
northern States belong to one class, the stems having a separable bark
on the outside, a minute stem of pith in the center, and, between these,
wood in annual layers. Such a stem is called _exogenous_
(outside-growing), because a new layer forms on the outside of the wood
each year.

Another kind of tree-stem is found abundantly in the tropics; one, the
Palmetto, grows from South Carolina to Florida. While in our region
there are no trees of this character, there are plants having this kind
of stem, the best illustration being the corn-stalk. In this case there
is no separable bark, and the woody substance is in threads within the
pithy material. In the corn-stalk the woody threads are not very
numerous, and the pith is very abundant; in most of the tropical trees
belonging to this group the threads of wood are so numerous as to make
the material very durable and fit for furniture. A stem of this kind is
called _endogenous_ (inside-growing). Fig. 1 represents a longitudinal
and a cross section of an exogenous stem, and Fig. 2 of an endogenous
one.

[Illustration: Fig. 1.]

[Illustration: Fig. 2.]

Since all the stems with which we have to deal are exogens, a particular
description of that class will here be given. Fig. 1 shows the
appearance of a section of an Ash stem six years old. The central
portion, which is about as thick as wrapping-twine, is the _pith_; from
this outward toward the bark can be seen the six annual layers of the
_wood_; and then comes the _bark_, consisting of two portions. First
there is an inside layer of greenish material, the fresh-growing
portion, and lastly the outer or dead matter. This outer portion must
crack open, peel off, or in some way give a chance for the constant
growth of the trunk. The different kinds of trees are readily known by
the appearance of the bark of the trunk, due to the many varieties of
surface caused by the allowance for growth. None of the characteristics
of trees afford a better opportunity for careful observation and study
than the outer bark.

The Birches have bark that peels off in thin horizontal layers--the
color, thinness, and toughness differing in the different species; the
Ashes have bark which opens in many irregular, netted cracks moderately
near each other; the bark of the Chestnut opens in large longitudinal
cracks quite distant from one another. The color of the bark and the
character of the scales are quite different in the White and the Black
Oaks.

In the woody portion radiating lines may be seen; these are the _silver
grain_; they are called by the botanist _medullary rays_.

The central portion of the wood of many large stems is darker in color
than the rest. This darker portion is dead wood, and is called
_heart-wood_; the outer portion, called _sap-wood_, is used in carrying
the sap during the growing season. The heart-wood of the Walnut-tree is
very dark brown; that of the Cherry, light red; and that of the Holly,
white and ivory-like. The heart-wood is the valuable part for lumber.

If examined under a magnifying glass, the _annual layers_ will be seen
to consist of minute tubes or cells. In most trees these tubes are much
larger in the portion that grew early in the season, while the wood
seems almost solid near the close of the annual layer; this is
especially true in the Ashes and the Chestnut; some trees, however, show
but little change in the size of the cells, the Beech being a good
example. In a cross-section, the age of such trees as the Chestnut can
readily be estimated, while in the Beech it is quite difficult to do
this. Boxwood, changing least in the character of its structure, is the
one always used for first-grade wood-engravings.

When wood is cut in the direction of the silver grain, or cut
"quartering" as it is called by the lumbermen, the surface shows this
cellular material spread out in strange blotches characteristic of the
different kinds of wood. Fig. 16 shows an Oak where the blotches of
medullary rays are large. In the Beech the blotches are smaller; in the
Elm quite small. Lumber cut carefully in this way is said to be
"quartered," and with most species its beauty is thereby much increased.

Any one who studies the matter carefully can become acquainted with all
the useful and ornamental woods used in a region; the differences in the
color of the heart-wood, the character of the annual layers, and the
size and the distribution of the medullary rays, afford enough
peculiarities to distinguish any one from all others.


BRANCHING.--The regular place from which a branch grows is the _axil_ of
a leaf, from what is called an _axillary bud_; but branches cannot grow
in the axils of all leaves. A tree with opposite leaves occasionally has
opposite branches; while a tree with alternate leaves has all its
branches alternate.

Most branches continue their growth year after year by the development
of a bud at the end, called a _terminal bud_. Many trees form this bud
for the next year's growth so early in the year that it is seldom or
never killed by the winter weather; such trees grow very regularly and
are symmetrical in form. Most evergreens are good examples. Fig. 3
represents a good specimen. The age of such trees, if not too great, can
be readily ascertained by the regularity of each year's growth. The tree
represented is sixteen years old. The branches that started the fifth
year, about the age at which regular growth begins, are shown by their
scars on the trunk.

[Illustration: Fig. 3.]

The terminal buds of many trees are frequently killed by the frosts of
winter; such trees continue their growth by the development of axillary
buds; but as growth from an axillary bud instead of a terminal one will
make a branch crooked, such trees are irregular in their branching and
outline. Just which axillary buds are most apt to grow depends upon the
kind of tree, but trees of the same variety are nearly uniform in this
respect. Most trees are therefore readily recognized by the form of
outline and the characteristic branching. A good example of a tree of
very irregular growth is the Catalpa (Indian Bean), shown in Fig. 4. The
tendency to grow irregularly usually increases with age. The Buttonwood,
for example, grows quite regularly until it reaches the age of thirty to
forty years; then its new branches grow in peculiarly irregular ways.
The twigs of a very old and a young Apple-tree illustrate this change
which age produces.

[Illustration: Fig. 4.]

There are great differences in the color and surface of the bark of the
twigs of different species of trees; some are green (Sassafras), some
red (Peach, on the sunny side), some purple (Cherry). Some are smooth
and dotless, some marked with dots (Birch), some roughened with corky
ridges (Sweet Gum), etc.

The taste and odor of the bark are characteristics worthy of notice: the
strong, fragrant odor of the Spice-bush; the fetid odor of the Papaw;
the aromatic taste of the Sweet Birch; the bitter taste of the Peach;
the mucilaginous Slippery Elm; the strong-scented, resinous, aromatic
Walnut, etc.

The branches of trees vary greatly in the thickness of their tips and in
their tendency to grow erect, horizontal, or drooping. Thus the delicate
spray of the Birches contrasted with the stout twigs of the Ailanthus,
or the drooping twigs of the Weeping Willow with the erect growth of the
Lombardy Poplar, give contrasts of the strongest character. In the same
way, the directions the main branches take in their growth from the
trunk form another distinctive feature. Thus the upward sloping branches
of the Elm form a striking contrast to the horizontal or downward
sloping branches of the Sour Gum, or, better still, to certain varieties
of Oaks.

When the main trunk of a tree extends upward through the head to the
tip, as in Fig. 3, it is said to be _excurrent_. When it is soon lost in
the division, as in Fig. 4, it is said to be _deliquescent_.




CHAPTER III.

_Leaves._


Leaves are the lungs of plants. The food taken in by the roots has to
pass through the stem to the leaves to be acted upon by the air, before
it becomes sap and is fit to be used for the growth of the plant. No
portion of a plant is more varied in parts, forms, surface, and duration
than the leaf.

No one can become familiar with leaves, and appreciate their beauty and
variety, who does not study them upon the plants themselves. This
chapter therefore will be devoted mainly to the words needed for leaf
description, together with their application.


THE LEAF.--In the axil of the whole leaf the bud forms for the growth of
a new branch. So by noting the position of the buds, all the parts
included in a single leaf can be determined. As a general thing the leaf
has but one blade, as in the Chestnut, Apple, Elm, etc.; yet the
Horse-chestnut has 7 blades, the Common Locust often has 21, and a
single leaf of the Honey-locust occasionally has as many as 300. Figs.
17-58 (Chapter VII.) are all illustrations of single leaves, except Fig.
43, where there are two leaves on a twig. A number of them show the bud
by which the fact is determined (Figs. 25, 26, 31, 33, 34, 36, 40,
etc.); others show branches which grew from the axillary buds, many of
them fruiting branches (Figs. 37, 42, 43, 50, and 54), one (Fig. 51) a
thorny branch.

The cone-bearing plants (Figs. 59-67) have only simple leaves. Each
piece, no matter how small and scale-like, may have a branch growing
from its axil, and so may form a whole leaf. A study of these figures,
together with the observation of trees, will soon teach the student
what constitutes a leaf.


ARRANGEMENT.--There are several different ways in which leaves are
arranged on trees; the most common plan is the _alternate_;
[Illustration] in this only one leaf occurs at a joint or node on the
stem. The next in frequency is the _opposite_, [Illustration] where two
leaves opposite each other are found at the node. A very rare
arrangement among trees, though common in other plants, is the
_whorled_, [Illustration] where more than two leaves, regularly arranged
around the stem, are found at the node. When a number of leaves are
bundled together,--a plan not rare among evergreens,--they are said to
be _fasciculated_ or in _fascicles_. [Illustration] The term _scattered_
is used where alternate leaves are crowded on the stem. This plan is
also common among evergreens.


CAUTION.--In some plants the leaves on the side shoots or spurs of a
twig are so close together, the internodes being so short, that at first
sight they seem opposite. In such cases, the leaf-scars of the preceding
years, or the arrangement of the branches, is a better test of the true
arrangement of the leaves. The twig of Birch shown in Fig. 5 has
alternate leaves.

[Illustration: Fig. 5.]

[Illustration: Fig. 6.]

There is one variety of alternation, called _two-ranked_, which is quite
characteristic of certain trees; that is, the leaves are so flattened
out as to be in one plane on the opposite sides of the twig (Fig. 6).
The Elm-trees form good examples of two-ranked alternate leaves, while
the Apple leaves are alternate without being two-ranked. Most leaves
spread from the stem, but some are _appressed_, as in the Arbor-vitae
(Fig. 7). In this species the _branches_ are _two-ranked_.


PARTS OF LEAVES.--A _complete leaf_ [Illustration] consists of three
parts: the _blade_, the thin expanded portion; the _petiole_, the
leafstalk; and the _stipules_, a pair of small blades at the base of the
petiole. The petiole is often very short and sometimes wanting. The
stipules are often absent, and, even when present, they frequently fall
off as soon as the leaves expand; sometimes they are conspicuous. Most
Willows show the stipules on the young luxuriant growths.

[Illustration: Fig. 7.]


VEINING.--The leaves of most trees have a distinct framework, the
central line of which is called a _midrib_; sometimes the leaf has
several other lines about as thick as the midrib, which are called
_ribs_; the lines next in size, including all that are especially
distinct, are called _veins_, the most minute ones being called
_veinlets_ (Fig. 8).

[Illustration: Fig. 8.]


KINDS.--Leaves are _simple_ when they have but one blade; [Illustration]
_compound_ when they have more than one. Compound leaves are _palmate_
when all the blades come from one point, as in the Horse-chestnut;
[Illustration] _pinnate_ when they are arranged along the sides, as in
the Hickory. Pinnate leaves are of two kinds: _odd-pinnate_,
[Illustration] when there is an odd leaflet at the end, as in the Ash,
and _abruptly pinnate_ [Illustration] when there is no end leaflet.

Many trees have the leaves _twice pinnate_; they are either _twice
odd-pinnate_ [Illustration] or _twice abruptly pinnate_. [Illustration]
The separate blades of a compound leaf are called _leaflets_. Leaves or
leaflets are _sessile_ when they have no stems, and _petiolate_ when
they have stems.

When there are several ribs starting together from the base of a blade,
it is said to be _radiate-veined_ or _palmate-veined_.[Illustration]
When the great veins all branch from the midrib, the leaf is
_feather-veined_ or _pinnate-veined_. [Illustration] If these veins are
straight, distinct, and regularly placed, the leaf is said to be
_straight-veined_. The Chestnut is [Illustration] a good example. Leaves
having veinlets joining each other like a net are said to be
_netted-veined_. All the trees with broad leaves in the northern United
States, with one exception, have netted-veined foliage. A leaf having
its veinlets parallel to one another is said to be _parallel-veined_ or
_-nerved_. [Illustration] The Ginkgo-tree, the Indian Corn, and the
Calla Lily have parallel-veined leaves. The narrow leaves of the
cone-bearing trees are also parallel-veined.


FORMS.--Leaves can readily be divided into the three following groups
with regard to their general outline:

1. _Broadest at the middle._ _Orbicular_, [Illustration] about as broad
as long and rounded. _Oval_, [Illustration] about twice as long as wide,
and regularly curved. _Elliptical_, [Illustration] more than twice as
long as wide, and evenly curved. _Oblong_, [Illustration] two or three
times as long as wide, with the sides parallel. _Linear_, [Illustration]
elongated oblong, more than three times as long as wide. _Acerose_,
[Illustration] needle-shaped, like the leaf of the Pine-tree.

2. _Broadest near the base._ _Deltoid_, [Illustration] broad and
triangular. _Ovate_, [Illustration] evenly curved, with a broad, rounded
base. _Heart-shaped_ or _cordate_, [Illustration] similar to ovate, but
with a notch at the base. _Lanceolate_, [Illustration] shaped like the
head of a lance. _Awl-shaped_, [Illustration] shaped like the
shoemaker's curved awl. _Scale-shaped_, [Illustration] short, rounded,
and appressed to the stem. The Arbor-vitae has both awl-shaped and
scale-shaped leaves.

3. _Broadest near the apex._ _Obovate_, [Illustration] same as ovate,
but with the stem at the narrow end. _Obcordate_, [Illustration] a
reversed heart-shape. _Oblanceolate_, [Illustration] a reversed
lanceolate. _Wedge-shaped_ or _cuneate_, [Illustration] having a
somewhat square end and straight sides like a wedge.

These words are often united to form compound ones when the form of the
leaf is somewhat intermediate. The term which most nearly suits the
general form is placed at the end; thus _lance-ovate_ indicates a leaf
between lanceolate and ovate, but nearer ovate than lanceolate; while
_ovate-lanceolate_ indicates one nearer lanceolate.


BASES.--Oftentimes leaves are of some general form, but have a peculiar
base, one that would not be expected from the statement of shape. An
ovate leaf which should have a rounded base might have a tapering one;
it would then be described as ovate with a _tapering base_.
[Illustration] A lanceolate leaf should naturally have a tapering base,
but might have an _abrupt_ one. [Illustration] Many leaves, no matter
what their general form may be, have more or less notched bases; such
bases are called _cordate_, [Illustration] _deeply_ or _slightly_, as
the case may be; and if the lobes at base are elongated, _auriculate_.
[Illustration] If the basal lobes project outward, the term
_halberd-shaped_ [Illustration] is used. Any form of leaf may have a
base more or less _oblique_. [Illustration]


POINTS.--The points as well as the bases of leaves are often peculiar,
and need to be described by appropriate terms. _Truncate_ [Illustration]
indicates an end that is square; _retuse_, [Illustration] one with a
slight notch; _emarginate_, one with a decided notch; _obcordate_, with
a still deeper notch; _obtuse_, [Illustration] angular but abrupt;
_acute_, [Illustration] somewhat sharpened; _acuminate_, [Illustration]
decidedly sharp-pointed; _bristle-pointed_ and _awned_, [Illustration]
with a bristle-like tip; _spiny-pointed_, with the point sharp and stiff
(Holly); _mucronate_, [Illustration] with a short, abrupt point.


MARGINS.--_Entire_, [Illustration] edge without notches; _repand_,
[Illustration] slightly wavy; _sinuate_, [Illustration] decidedly wavy;
_dentate_, [Illustration] with tooth-like notches; _serrate_,
[Illustration] with notches like those of a saw; _crenate_,
[Illustration] with the teeth rounded; _twice serrate_, [Illustration]
when there are coarse serrations finely serrated, as on most Birch
leaves; _serrulate_, with minute serrations; _crenulate_, with minute
crenations. Leaves can be _twice crenate_ or _sinuate-crenate_.
_Revolute_ indicates that the edges are rolled over.

When a leaf has a few great teeth, the projecting parts are called
_lobes_, and the general form of the leaf is what it would be with the
notches filled in. In the description of such leaves, certain terms are
needed in describing the plan of the notches, and their depth and form.

Leaves with palmate veining are _palmately lobed_ [Illustration] or
_notched_; those with pinnate veining are _pinnately lobed_
[Illustration] or _notched_. While the term _lobe_ is applied to all
great teeth of a leaf, whether rounded or pointed, long or short, still
there are four terms sometimes used having special signification with
reference to the depth of the notches. _Lobed_ indicates that the
notches extend about one fourth the distance to the base or midrib;
_cleft_, that they extend one half the way; _parted_, about three
fourths of the way; and _divided_, that the notches are nearly deep
enough to make a compound leaf of separate leaflets.

So leaves may be palmately lobed, cleft, parted or divided, and
pinnately lobed, cleft, parted or divided. The term _pinnatifid_
[Illustration] is often applied to pinnately cleft leaves. The terms
_entire_, _serrate_, _crenate_, _acute-pointed_, etc., are applied to
the lobes as well as to the general margins of leaves.


SURFACE.--The following terms are needed in describing the surface of
leaves and fruit.

_Glabrous_, smooth; _glaucous_, covered with a whitish bloom which can
be rubbed off (Plum); _rugous_, wrinkled; _canescent_, so covered with
minute hairs as to appear silvery; _pubescent_, covered with fine, soft,
plainly seen hairs; _tomentose_, densely covered with matted hairs;
_hairy_, having longer hairs; _scabrous_, covered with stiff, scratching
points; _spiny_, having stiff, sharp spines; _glandular-hairy_, having
the hairs ending in glands (usually needing a magnifying glass to be
seen).


TEXTURE.--_Succulent_, fleshy; _scarious_, dry and chaffy; _punctate_,
having translucent glands, so that the leaf appears, when held toward
the light, as though full of holes; _membranous_, thin, soft, and rather
translucent; _thick_, _thin_, etc.


DURATION.--_Evergreen_, hanging on the tree from year to year. By
noticing the color of the different leaves and their position on the
twigs, all evergreen foliage can readily be determined at any time
during the year. _Deciduous_, falling off at the end of the season.
_Fugacious_, falling early, as the stipules of many leaves.




CHAPTER IV.

_Flowers and Fruit._


The author hopes that those who use this work in studying trees will
become so much interested in the subject of Botany as to desire more
information concerning the growth and reproduction of plants than can
here be given. In Professor Asa Gray's numerous works the additional
information desired may be obtained: "How Plants Grow" contains an
outline for the use of beginners; "The Elements of Botany" is a more
advanced work; while the "Botanical Text Book", in several volumes, will
enable the student to pursue the subject as far as he may wish. In this
small book the barest outline of the parts of flowers and fruit and of
their uses can be given.

[Illustration: Fig. 9.]


FLOWERS.--Parts. The flowers of the Cherry or Apple will show the four
kinds of organs that belong to a complete flower. Fig. 9 represents an
Apple-blossom. The _calyx_ is the outer row of leaves, more or less
united into one piece. The _corolla_ is the row of leaves within the
calyx; it is usually the brightest and most conspicuous part of the
flower. The _stamens_ [Illustration] are the next organs; they are
usually, as in this case, small two-lobed bodies on slender, thread-like
stalks. The enlarged parts contain a dust-like material called
_pollen_. The last of the four kinds of parts is found in the center of
the flower, and is called the _pistil_. It is this part which forms the
fruit and incloses the seed.

The stamens and the pistil are the _essential_ organs of a flower,
because they, and they only, are needed in the formation of seeds. The
pollen from the stamen, acting on the pistil, causes the _ovules_ which
are in the pistil to grow into _seeds_.

The calyx and corolla are called _enveloping organs_, since they
surround and protect the essential parts.

The pieces of which the calyx is composed are called _sepals_. The
Apple-blossom has five sepals.

The pieces that compose the corolla are called _petals_.


KINDS OF FLOWERS.--When the petals are entirely separate from each
other, as in the Apple-blossom, the flower is said to be _polypetalous_;
when they grow together more or less, as in the Catalpa (Fig. 10),
_monopetalous_; and when the corolla is wanting, as in the flowers of
the Oak, _apetalous_.

[Illustration: Fig. 10.]

When all sides of a flower are alike, as in the Apple-blossom, the
flower is _regular_; when one side of the corolla differs from the other
in color, form, or size, as in the Common Locust, or Catalpa, the flower
is _irregular_.

In trees the stamens and pistils are often found in separate flowers; in
that case the blossoms containing stamens are called _staminate_, and
those containing pistils _pistillate_; those that contain both are
called _perfect_. Staminate and pistillate flowers are usually found on
the same tree, as in the Oaks, Birches, Chestnut, etc.; in that case the
plant is said to be _monoecious_, and all trees of this kind produce
fruit. Sometimes, however, the staminate and pistillate flowers are on
separate trees, as in the Willows, which are _dioecious_; and then
only a portion of the trees--those with pistillate flowers--produce
fruit.


ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS.--Flowers, either solitary or clustered, grow in
one of two ways; either at the end of the branches, being then called
_terminal_, or in the axils of the leaves, then called _axillary_. The
stem of a solitary flower or the main stem of a cluster is called a
_peduncle_; the stems of the separate blossoms of a cluster are called
_pedicels_. When either the flowers or the clusters are without stems,
they are said to be _sessile_.


_Clusters with Pedicellate Flowers._

_Raceme_, [Illustration] flowers on pedicels of about equal length,
scattered along the entire stem. Locust-tree.

_Corymb_, [Illustration] like a raceme except that the lower flowers
have longer stems, making the cluster somewhat flat-topped; the outer
flowers bloom first. Hawthorn.

_Cyme_, [Illustration] in appearance much like a corymb, but it differs
in the fact that the central flower blooms first. Alternate-leaved
Cornel.

_Umbel_, [Illustration] stems of the separate flowers about equal in
length, and starting from the same point. Garden-cherry.

_Panicle_, [Illustration] a compound raceme. Catalpa.

_Thyrsus_, a compact panicle. Horse-chestnut.


_Clusters with Sessile or Nearly Sessile Flowers._

_Catkin_, [Illustration] bracted flowers situated along a slender and
usually drooping stem. This variety of cluster is very common on trees.
The Willows, Birches, Chestnuts, Oaks, Pines, and many others have their
flowers in catkins.

_Head_, [Illustration] the flowers in a close, usually rounded cluster.
Flowering Dogwood.


FRUIT.--In this book a single fruit will include all the parts that grow
together and contain seeds, whether from a single blossom or a cluster;
there will be no rigorous adherence to an exact classification; no
attempt made to distinguish between fruits formed from a simple pistil
and those from a compound one; nor generally between those formed from a
single and those formed from a cluster of flowers. The fruit and its
general classification, determined by the parts easily seen, is all that
will be attempted.

As stated before, it is hoped that this volume will not end the
student's work in the investigation of natural objects, but that the
amount of information here given will lead to the desire for much more.

_Berry_ will be the term applied to all fleshy fruits with more than one
seed buried in the mass. Persimmon, Mulberry, Holly. The _pome_ or
_Apple-pome_ differs from the berry in the fact that the seeds are
situated in cells formed of hardened material. Apple, Mountain-ash. The
_Plum_ or _Cherry drupe_ includes all fleshy fruits with a single
stony-coated part, even if it contains more than one seed. Peach,
Viburnum, China-tree. In some cases, when there is but one seed in the
flesh and that not stony-coated, it will be called a _drupe-like berry_.

The _dry drupe_ is like the Cherry drupe except that the flesh is much
harder. The fruit of the Walnut, Hickory, and Sumac.

[Illustration: Fig. 11.]

The inner hard-coated parts of these and some others will be called
_nuts_. If the nut has a partial scaly covering, as in the Oaks, the
whole forms an _acorn_. [Illustration] If the coating has spiny hairs,
as in the Chestnut and Beechnut, the whole is a _bur_. The coating in
these cases is an _involucre_. If the coating or any part of the fruit
has a regular place for splitting open, it is _dehiscent_ (Chestnut,
Hickory-nut); if not, _indehiscent_ (Black Walnut).

[Illustration: Fig. 12.]

Dry fruits with spreading, wing-like appendages, as in the Ash (Fig.
11), Maple (Fig. 12), Elm (Fig. 13), and Ailanthus, are called _samaras_
or _keys_.

Dry fruits, usually elongated, containing generally several seeds, are
called _pods_. If there is but one cell and the seeds are fastened along
one side, _Pea-like pods_, or _legumes_. Locust. The term _capsule_
indicates that there is more than one cell. Catalpa, Hibiscus.

[Illustration: Fig. 13.]

All the dry, scaly fruits, usually formed by the ripening of some sort
of catkin of flowers, will be included under the term _cone_. Pine,
Alder, [Illustration] Magnolia. If the appearance of the fruit is not
much different from that of the cluster of flowers, as in the Hornbeams,
Willows, and Birches, the term _catkin_ will be retained for the fruit
also. The scales of a cone may lap over each other; they are then said
to be _imbricated_ or _overlapping_, [Illustration] (Pine); or they may
merely touch at their edges, when they are _valvate_ [Illustration]
(Cypress). When cones or catkins hang downward, they are _pendent_. If
the scales have projecting points, these points are _spines_ if strong,
and _prickles_ if weak. The parts back of the scales are _bracts_; these
often project beyond the scales, when they are said to be _exserted_.
[Illustration] Sometimes the exserted bracts are bent backward; they are
then said to be _recurved_ or _reflexed_.




CHAPTER V.

_Winter Study of Trees._


Many of the peculiarities of trees can be studied much better during the
winter and early spring than at any other time of the year. The plan of
branching, the position, number, size, form, color, and surface of buds,
as well as the arrangement of the leaves within the bud and the
peculiarities of the scales that cover them, are points for winter
investigation.


GENERAL PLAN OF BRANCHING.--There are two distinct and readily
recognized systems of branching. 1. The main stem is _excurrent_ (Fig.
3) when the trunk extends as an undivided stem throughout the tree to
the tip; this causes the spire-like or conical trees so common among
narrow-leaved evergreens. 2. The main stem is _deliquescent_ (Fig. 4)
when the trunk divides into many, more or less equal divisions, forming
the broad-topped, spreading trees. This plan is the usual one among
deciduous trees. A few species, however, such as the Sweet Gum and the
Sugar-maple, show the excurrent stem while young, yet even these have a
deliquescent stem later in life. The English Maple and the Apple both
have a deliquescent stem very early.

All the narrow-leaved evergreens, and many of the broad-leaved trees as
well, show what is called _definite_ annual growths; that is, a certain
amount of leaf and stem, packed up in the winter bud, spreads out and
hardens with woody tissue early in the year, and then, no matter how
long the season remains warm, no additional leaves or stem will grow.
The buds for the next year's growth then form and often become quite
large before autumn.

There are many examples among the smaller plants, but rarely one among
the trees, of _indefinite_ annual growth; that is, the plant puts forth
leaves and forms stems throughout the whole growing-season. The common
Locust, the Honey-locust, and the Sumacs are illustrations.


BUDS.--Buds are either undeveloped branches or undeveloped flowers. They
contain within the scales, which usually cover them, closely packed
leaves; these leaves are folded and wrinkled in a number of different
ways that will be defined at the end of this chapter.


[Illustration: Fig. 14.]

POSITION AND NUMBER.--While the axils of the leaves and the ends of the
stems are the ordinary places for the buds, there are many peculiarities
in regard to their exact position, number, etc., that render them very
interesting for winter study. Sometimes there are several to the single
leaf. In the Silver Maple there are buds on each side of the true
axillary one; these are flower-buds, and during the winter they are
larger than the one which produces the branch. The Butternut (Fig. 14)
and the Walnut have several above each other, the upper one being the
largest and at quite a distance from the true axil. In these cases the
uppermost is apt to grow, and then the branch is said to be
_extra-axillary_. In the Sycamore the bud does not show while the leaf
remains on the tree, as it is in the hollow of the leafstalk. In the
winter the bud has a ring-like scar entirely around it, instead of the
moon-shaped scar below as in most trees. The Common Locust has several
buds under the leafstalk and one above it in the axil. This axillary
bud may grow during the time the leaf remains on the tree, and afterward
the growth of the strongest one of the others may give the tree two
branches almost together.

Some plants form extra buds especially when they are bruised or injured;
those which have the greatest tendency to do so are the Willows,
Poplars, and Elms. Such buds and growths are called _adventitious_. By
cutting off the tops or _pollarding_ such trees, a very great number of
adventitious branches can be made to grow. In this way the Willow-twigs
used for baskets are formed. Adventitious buds form the clusters of
curious thorns on the Honey-locust and the tufts of whip-like branches
on the trunks and large limbs of the Elms.

In trees the terminal bud and certain axillary ones, differing according
to the species or variety of tree, are, during the winter, much larger
than the rest. These are the ones which naturally form the new growth,
and upon their arrangement the character of branching and thus the form
of the tree depend. Each species has some peculiarity in this regard,
and thus there are differences in the branching of all trees. In
opposite-leaved plants the terminal bud may be small and weak, while the
two buds at its side may be strong and apt to grow. This causes a
forking of the branches each year. This plan is not rare among shrubs,
the Lilac being a good example.


BUD-SCALES.--The coverings of buds are exceedingly varied, and are well
worthy of study and investigation. The large terminal buds of the
Horse-chestnut, with their numerous scales, gummy on the outside to keep
out the dampness, and hairy within to protect them from sudden changes
of temperature, represent one extreme of a long line; while the small,
naked, and partly buried buds of the Honey-locust or the Sumac represent
the other end.

The scales of many buds are merely extra parts formed for their
protection, and fall immediately after the bursting of the buds; while
other buds have the stipules of the leaves as bud-scales; these remain
on the twigs for a time in the Tulip-tree, and drop immediately in the
Magnolia.


FORMS OF BUDS.--The size of buds varies greatly, as before stated, but
this difference in size is no more marked than the difference in form.
There is no better way to recognize a Beech at any time of the year than
by its very long, slender, and sharp-pointed buds. The obovate and
almost stalked buds of the Alders are also very conspicuous and
peculiar. In the Balsam Poplar the buds are large, sharp-pointed, and
gummy; in the Ailanthus they cannot be seen.

[Illustration: Fig. 15.]

All the things that might be learned from a small winter twig cannot be
shown in an engraving, but the figures here given illustrate some of the
facts easily determined from such specimens. The first twig (Ash) had
opposite leaves and is 3 years old (the end of each year's growth is
marked by dotted lines on all the figures); the year before last it had
6 leaves on the middle portion; last year it had 8 leaves on the end
portion and 12 on the side shoots of the middle portion. The buds near
the end of the annual growth are strongest and are most apt to grow.
The specimen illustrated was probably taken from the end of a branch of
a rather young and luxuriantly growing tree. Thus the Ash must have
quite a regular growth and form a regularly outlined tree.

The second twig (Sweet Gum) shows 7 years' growth and is probably a side
shoot from more or less within the tree-top. It is stunted in its growth
by the want of light and room. The leaves were alternate.

The third twig (Sycamore) also had alternate leaves; the pointed buds
must have been under the leafstalks, as the leaf-scars show as rings
around the buds. The larger branch grew three years ago. From the
specimen one judges that the Sycamore is quite an irregularly formed
tree. The twig had 11 leaves last year.

The fourth twig (Silver Maple) shows that the plant had opposite leaves,
and supernumerary buds at the sides of the true axillary ones; the true
axillary buds are smaller than those at the sides. It would, in such
cases, be reasonable to suppose that the supernumerary buds were floral
ones, and that the plant blooms before the leaves expand. The annual
growths are quite extended; two years and a part of the third make up
the entire twig. If it was cut during the winter of 1891-92, it must
have had leaves on the lower part in 1889 and 12 leaves on the middle
portion in 1890, as well as probably 4 on the lower portion on the side
shoots. Last year it had 14 leaves on the end portion, two at least on
each side shoot below, making 24 in all.


_Folding of Leaves in the Bud._

There are some peculiarities in the arrangement of leaves in the bud
which can be investigated only in the early spring. The common plans
among trees are--_Inflexed_: blade folded crosswise, thus bringing it
upon the footstalk. Tulip-tree. _Conduplicate_: blade folded along the
midrib, bringing the two halves together. Peach. _Plicate_: folded
several times lengthwise, like a fan. Birch. _Convolute_: rolled
edgewise from one edge to the other. Plum. _Involute_: both edges rolled
in toward the midrib on the upper side. Apple. _Revolute_: both edges
rolled backward. Willow. _Obvolute_: folded together, but the opposite
leaves half inclosing each other. Dogwood.




CHAPTER VI.

_The Preparation of a Collection._


[Illustration: Fig. 16.]

Three specimens are needed of each kind of tree: one, a branch showing
the flowers; another, showing the fruit--one of these, and in many cases
both, will show the leaves. The third specimen, cut from a large limb or
trunk, shows the bark and the wood. This should be a specimen with a
surface so cut as to show the wood in the direction of the silver grain,
_radial section_; with another surface cut in the direction of the
annual layers, _tangential section_; and with a third cut across the
grain, _cross-section_. It should be a specimen old enough to show the
change of color in the heart-wood. By taking a limb or trunk 8 inches in
diameter, all these points can be secured. A specimen cut as shown in
the figure will illustrate all the desired points. Side E F G shows
sap-and heart-wood in tangential section; side A B D C shows the same in
radial section; end A B F E, in cross-section; and B F G D shows the
bark. The central pith is at I; the heart-wood extends from C to J; the
sap-wood from J to D. The silver grain is well shown at the end, and the
blotches formed by it on the radial section.

By having the piece made smooth, and the upper part down to the center
(H) varnished, the appearance of the wood in furniture or inside finish
will be illustrated.

The specimens should be as nearly uniform in size as possible. If a limb
8 inches in diameter be taken and a length of 6 inches be cut off, the
section A B D C should pass through the line of pith; the section E F G
should be parallel with this at a distance from it of two inches; and
two inches from the line of pith, the section A E C should be made. The
whole specimen will then be 6 inches wide and long, and 2 inches thick.

The twigs containing leaves, flowers and fruit need to be pressed while
drying in order that they may be kept in good form and made tough enough
to be retained as specimens. The plants should be placed between a large
supply of newspapers, or, better still, untarred building-felt, while
drying. A weight of from 40 to 80 pounds is needed to produce the
requisite pressure. The weight is placed upon a board covering the pile
of plants and paper. On account of the size of many leaves and
flower-clusters, these pressed specimens of trees should not be shorter
than from 12 to 15 inches, and even a length of 18 inches is an
advantage. The pads or newspapers should be about 12 by 18 inches. A
transfer of the plants into dry pads each day for a few days will hasten
the drying and increase the beauty of the specimens. The specimens of
twigs can be mounted on cardboard by being partly pasted and partly
secured by narrow strips of gummed cloth placed across the heavier
portions. The cardboard should be uniform in size. One of the regular
sizes of Bristol-board is 22 by 28 inches; this will cut into four
pieces 11 by 14. Specimens not over 15 inches in length can readily be
mounted on these, and for most collectors this might be a very
convenient size. Another regular size is 22 by 32 inches, cutting well
into pieces 11 by 16. Specimens 15 to 18 inches long can be mounted on
these.

Some kinds of Evergreens, the Spruces especially, tend to shed their
leaves after pressing. Such kinds can in most cases be made to form good
specimens without pressing. Fasten the fresh specimens on pillars of
plaster in boxes or frames 2 to 3 inches deep, so that they touch
nothing but the column of plaster. Mix calcined plaster in water (as
plasterers do), and build up a column high enough to support the branch.
Place the specimen on the top of the pillar already formed, and pour
over the whole some quite thin plaster till a rounded top is formed
completely fastening the specimen. If the leaves are not touched at all,
after they are dry, they will hang on for a long time, making specimens
that will show the tree characteristics better than pressed specimens
possibly could.

PART II.

PLAN AND MODELS FOR TREE DESCRIPTION


All pupils should be required to write some form of composition on the
trees of the region. As far as possible, these compositions should be
the result of personal investigation. It is not what a pupil can read
and redescribe in more or less his own words, but how accurately he can
see and, from the information conveyed by his own senses, describe in
his own way the things he has observed, that makes the use of such a
book as this important as an educational aid. Some information in regard
to trees, in a finished description, must be obtained from books, such
as hardiness, geographical distribution, etc. Pupils generally should be
required to include only those things which they can give from actual
observation.

There are four distinct forms of tree descriptions that might be
recognized by the teacher and occasionally called for as work from the
pupil. 1st. A bare skeleton description, written by aid of a topical
outline, from the observation of a single tree and its parts. 2d. A
connected description, conveying as many facts given in the outline as
can well be brought into good English sentences. This again is the
description of a single tree. 3d. A connected, readable description of a
certain kind of tree, made up from the observation of many trees of the
same species to be found in the neighborhood. 4th. The third description
including information to be obtained from outside sources in regard to
the origin, geographical distribution, hardiness, character of wood,
habits, durability, etc. These four plans of description are more or
less successive methods to be introduced as the work of a class. Pupils
should be induced to carry on their own investigations as far as
possible before going to printed sources for information. A good part of
class work should be devoted to the first three of the methods given,
but the work might finally include the fourth form of composition. The
first two methods should follow each other with each of the trees
studied; that is, one week let a mere outline be written, to be followed
the next week with as clear and connected a description as the ability
of the pupil will allow, and containing as much of the information given
in the outline as possible.

NOTES ON THE FOREGOING OUTLINE.

The height of a tree can be readily determined by the following plan.
Measure the height you can easily reach from the ground in feet and
inches. Step to the trunk of the tree you wish to measure and, reaching
up to this height, pin a piece of white paper on the tree. Step back a
distance equal to three or four times the height of the tree; hold a
lead-pencil upright between the thumb and forefinger at arm's-length.
Fix it so that the end of the pencil shall be in line with the paper on
the trunk; move the thumb down the pencil till it is in line with the
ground at the base of the tree; move the arm and pencil upward till the
thumb is in line with the paper, and note where the end of the pencil
comes on the tree. Again move the pencil till the thumb is in line with
the new position, and so continue the process till the top of the tree
is reached. The number of the measures multiplied by the height you can
reach will give quite accurately the height of the tree.

The width of the tree can be determined in the same manner, the pencil,
however, being held horizontally.

In giving the forms of trees, it is well to accompany the description
with a penciled outline.

The distance from the ground at which the trunk begins to branch and the
extent of the branching should be noted. The direction taken by the
branches, as well as the regularity and the irregularity of their
position, should also be observed and described.

Although most twigs are cylindrical, still there are enough exceptions
to make it necessary to examine them with reference to their form.

Under leaves, it will be well to make drawings, both of the outline and
of the veining.

Crushed leaves will give the odor, and the sap can best be noticed at
the bases of young leaves. The differences in sap and juice need the
following words for their description: _watery_, _milky_,
_mucilaginous_, _aromatic_, _spicy_, _sweet_, _gummy_, _resinous_.

Pupils should not always be expected to find out much about the flowers
of a tree, as they are frequently very evanescent, and usually difficult
to reach.

The fruit lasts a greater length of time and, usually dropping
spontaneously, gives a much better chance for investigation.

Specimens of most of the common woods may be obtained from
cabinet-makers and carpenters. In cases where these specimens are at
hand, description of the wood should be required. If the school has such
specimens as are described in Chapter VI., Part I., the wood in all its
peculiarities can be described.


EXAMPLES OF TREE DESCRIPTION.

_Taxodium distichum (Bald Cypress)._

_(Atterbury's Meadow.)_

_No. 1._

Tree eighty-four feet tall, thirty feet wide near base, ovate, conical,
pointed; trunk seven feet in circumference near base and ridged
lengthwise, but only four feet at the height of six feet from the
ground, where it becomes round or nearly so, then gradually tapering to
the top; branches small, very numerous, beginning six feet from the
ground, sloping upward from the trunk at an angle of nearly forty-five
degrees; twigs very slender, numerous, pendulous, two, three or even
more growing together from supernumerary buds around the old scars; bark
brownish, quite rough, thick and soft on the trunk, smoother on the
branches, greenish on the young spray.

[Illustration]

Leaves about sessile, without stipules, alternate, crowded, two-ranked,
thin, linear, entire, parallel-veined, with midrib, dark green, smooth,
deciduous.

Buds show in the axils of only a few of the leaves, and are very small;
but there are several supernumerary buds around many of the clusters of
the shoots of the year.

Sap clear and slightly sticky with resin.

[Illustration]

Flowers looked for, but not seen; must have been small, or have bloomed
before my examination in the spring.

Fruit one inch in diameter, cone globular, brown in the autumn; did not
notice it before; fifteen six-sided scales, two seeds under each, still
hanging on, though the leaves have dropped; only to produce seeds, I
think.

The wood I do not know about.

_Remarks._ Around the base, at some distance from the trunk, there are
four peculiar knobs, seemingly coming from the roots, one being nearly a
foot high and nine inches through.


_No. 2._

The Bald Cypress standing near a small ditch in Atterbury's meadow is a
very beautiful, tall, conical tree, over 80 feet high, with an excurrent
trunk which is very large and ridged near the ground. It tapers rapidly
upward, so that the circumference is only about half as great at the
height of 6 feet, where the branches begin. The branches are very
numerous and, considering the size of the trunk, very small; the largest
of them being only about 2 inches through. They all slope upward
rapidly, but the tip and fine spray show a tendency to droop; the fine
thread-like branchlets, bearing the leaves of the year, are almost all
pendulous.

The bark is very rough, thick and soft, as I found in pinning on the bit
of paper to measure the height of the tree, when I could easily press
the pin in to its head.

The leaves are very small and delicate, and as they extend out in two
ranks from the thread-like twigs, look much like fine ferns. The small
linear leaves and the spray drop off together in the autumn, as I can
find much of last year's foliage on the ground still fastened to the
twigs. I could not see any flowers, though I looked from early in the
spring till the middle of the summer; then I saw a few of the globular
green cones, almost an inch in diameter, showing that it had bloomed.
Next spring I shall begin to look for the blossoms before the leaves
come out.

On the ground, about 6 feet from the tree, there are four very strange
knobs which I did not notice till I stumbled over one of them. They seem
to grow from the roots, and are quite soft and reddish in color.


_No. 3._

I have found twenty-two Bald Cypresses in Trenton; they are all
beautiful conical trees, and seem to grow well in almost any soil, as I
have found some in very wet places and some in dry, sandy soil. They
look from their position as though they had been planted out, and as I
have found none in the woods around the town, they are probably not
native in this region. They are from 50 to nearly 100 feet tall. I found
one 96 feet high. They are all of a very symmetrical, conical form, and
pointed at the top; in no case has the trunk divided into branches, and
on the old trees the trunk enlarges curiously near the ground, the lower
portion being very rough with ridges. The bark is very thick and rough,
and is so soft that a pin can readily be pushed through it to the wood.
The branches are very numerous and small, and are not regularly arranged
in whorls like most of the narrow-leaved trees. These branches all slope
upward from the trunk, the ends having a tendency to bend downward and
make delicate drooping spray, with very small, linear, entire leaves
only 1/2 inch long. Four of the largest trees show fruit, and each of
these has only about a half-dozen of the globular cones. Only a few of
the trees--those in the wettest places--have the knobs on the ground
near the base.


_No. 4._

The Bald Cypress (_Taxodium distichum_) is a common tree, a native of
the Gulf States, growing very abundantly in the wettest swamps of that
region. The northern limit of the tree in its wild state is said to be
central Delaware and southern Illinois, but it can be successfully
cultivated in the region around Boston. There are several named
varieties, one with the leaves but slightly spreading from the spray,
and the whole of the branches showing a decided weeping tendency, so
that it is called the Weeping Cypress. The knobs from the roots, called
Cypress-knees, grow very abundantly around all the trees in the southern
swamps. These grow to the height of from 2 to 4 feet, and are very
thick, sometimes as much as 5 feet. They are hollow, and are
occasionally used for bee-hives.

It is said to be a broad, flat-topped tree, spreading its top over other
trees. This seems very strange, as none of those in Trenton, N. J., show
such a tendency, but are quite spire-shaped. The wood is light, soft,
straight-grained, and is said to be excellent for shingles and for other
purposes. It generally has a dark reddish or brownish hue. It is a large
tree, growing to the height of 140 feet. The trunk is sometimes 12 feet
through near the ground. The flowers of the tree are in small catkins,
blooming before the leaves expand in the early spring; in February, in
South Carolina.




PART III.

KEY, CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIES.

_Method of Using the Key._


First read _all_ the statements following the stars (*) at the beginning
of the Key; decide which one of the statements best suits the specimen
you have. At the end of the chosen one there is a letter in parenthesis
( ). Somewhere below, this letter is used two or more times. Read
carefully _all_ the statements following this letter; at the end of the
one which most nearly states the facts about your specimen, you will
again be directed by a letter to another part of the Key. Continue this
process till, instead of a letter, there is a number and name. The name
is that of the genus, and forms the first part of the scientific name of
the plant. Turn to the descriptive part of the book, where this number,
in regular order, is found. Here descriptions of the species of the
genus are given. If there are many species, another Key will lead to the
species. While the illustrations are intended to represent
characteristic specimens, too much dependence must not be placed upon
them; the leaves even of the same plant vary considerably, and the
different varieties, especially of a cultivated plant, vary widely. Read
the whole description before deciding.

The fractions beside the figures indicate the scale of the drawing as
compared with the natural size of the part: 1/1 indicates natural size;
2/1, that the drawing is twice the length of the object; 1/4, that the
drawing is one fourth the length of the object, etc.

In the description of leaves the dimensions given refer to the blade.

stalked, ovate or lance-oblong, pointed, shining above, pale and either
smooth or pubescent beneath, somewhat toothed or entire. Flowers almost
always dioecious (May), thus the fruit is found on but a portion of

[Illustration: B. sempervirens.]

=Buxus sempervirens=, L. (BOXWOOD.) Leaves ovate, smooth, dark green;
leaf-stems hairy at edge. This plant is a native of Europe, and in its
tree form furnishes the white wood used for wood-engraving.

Var. _subfruticosa_ (dwarf boxwood) grows only a foot or two high, and
is extensively used for edgings in gardens. The tree form is more rare
in cultivation, and is of slow growth, but forms a round-topped tree.

abruptly pointed and doubly serrated. Fruit rounded, with a slightly
notched wing, naked. Branches drooping at their extremity, their bark
smooth and even. A medium-sized tree, 50 to 60 ft. high, with spreading
or often drooping branches; extensively cultivated under a dozen
different names, among the most peculiar being the White-margined (var.
_alba marginata_), the Crisped-leaved (var. _crispa_), and the Weeping
(var. _pendula_) Elms.

[Illustration: U. campestris.]

3. =Ulmus campestris=, L. (ENGLISH OR FIELD ELM.) Leaves much smaller
and of a darker color than the American Elm, obovate-oblong, abruptly
sharp-pointed, doubly serrated, rough. Fruit smooth, with the wing
deeply notched. A tall and beautiful cultivated tree, with the branches
growing out from the trunk more abruptly than those of the American Elm,
and thus forming a more pyramidal tree. A score of named varieties are
in cultivation in this country, some with very corky bark, others with
curled leaves, and still others with weeping branches.

[Illustration: U. racemosa.]

4. =Ulmus racemosa=, Thomas. (CORK OR ROCK ELM.) Leaves 2 to 4 in. long,
obovate-oblong, abruptly pointed, often doubly serrated, with very

[Illustration: P. acuminata.]

2. =Planera acuminata.= (KIAKA ELM OR JAPAN PLANER-TREE.) Leaves large,
glossy, smooth, deeply notched, on red stems; young shoots also red.
This is a larger, more hardy, and finer tree than the American
Planer-tree, and should be more extensively cultivated.

The Caucasian Planer-tree (_Planera parvifolia_), with very small
leaves, is also occasionally cultivated.


GENUS =76. CELTIS.=

[Illustration: M. rubra.]

1. =Morus rubra=, L. (RED MULBERRY.) Leaves broad, heart-shaped, 4 to 6
in. long, serrate, rough above and downy beneath, pointed; on the young
shoots irregularly lobed. Fruit dark red, almost purple when ripe,
cylindrical; not found on all the trees, as the flowers are somewhat
dioecious; ripe in July. Wood yellow, heavy and durable. Usually a
small tree, 15 to 60 ft. high; wild throughout, also cultivated.

[Illustration: M. alba.]

2. =Morus alba=, L. (WHITE MULBERRY.) Leaves obliquely heart-ovate,
pointed, serrate, smooth and shining; lobed on the younger growths; 2 to
7 in. long. Fruit whitish, oval to oblong; ripe in July. A small tree
from China, planted for feeding silkworms, but now naturalized
throughout.

Var. _multicaulis_ has large leaves, and is considered better for
silkworm food than the usual form. It is not very hardy, as it is
frequently winter-killed in the latitude of New York City.

Var. _Downingii_ (Downing's everbearing Mulberry) has large leaves and
very large, dark red or black fruit, of excellent flavor, which does not
ripen all at once as most Mulberries do.

=Broussonetia papyrifera=, L. (PAPER-MULBERRY.) Leaves ovate to
heart-shaped, variously lobed, deeply so on the young suckers, serrate,
very rough above and quite soft-downy beneath; leaves on the old trees
almost without lobes; bark tough and fibrous. Flowers in catkins,
greenish; in spring. Fruit club-shaped, dark scarlet, sweet and insipid;
ripe in August. Small cultivated tree, 10 to 35 ft. high, hardy north to
New York; remarkable for the great variety in the forms of its leaves on
the young trees.


ORDER =XXXVII. PLATANACEAE.=

(PLANE-TREE FAMILY.)

A very small order, containing but one genus:


GENUS =80. PLATANUS.=

Trees with alternate, simple, large, palmately lobed leaves. The base of
the petiole is hollowed to cover the bud. Flowers inconspicuous; in
early spring. Fruit a large, dry ball, hanging on a long peduncle, and
remaining on the tree through the winter. Large tree with white bark
separating into thin, brittle plates.

[Illustration: P. occidentalis.]

1. =Platanus occidentalis=, L. (AMERICAN SYCAMORE. BUTTONWOOD.) Leaves
large (6 to 10 in. broad), roundish heart-shaped, angularly
sinuate-lobed, the short lobes sharp-pointed, scurfy-downy till old.
Fruit globular, solitary, 1 in. in diameter, hanging on long, 4-in.
peduncles; remaining on the tree through the winter. A large, well-known
tree, 80 to 100 ft. high; found on river-banks throughout; also
cultivated. Wood brownish, coarse-grained; it cannot be split, and is
very difficult to smooth. The marking of the grain on the quartered
lumber is very beautiful.

[Illustration: P. orientalis.]

2. =Platanus orientalis=, L. (ORIENTAL PLANE.) Leaves more deeply cut,
smaller, and sooner smooth than those of the American Sycamore. Fruit
frequently clustered on the peduncles. This tree is similar to the
American Sycamore, and in many ways better for cultivation.


ORDER =XXXVIII. JUGLANDACEAE.=

(WALNUT FAMILY.)

A small order of useful nut-and timber-trees.


GENUS =81. JUGLANS.=

Trees with alternate, odd-pinnate leaves, of 5 to 17 leaflets, with 2 to
4 axillary buds, the uppermost the largest. Flowers inconspicuous, the
sterile ones in catkins. May. Fruit a large, bony, edible nut surrounded
by a husk that has no regular dehiscence. The nut, as in the genus
Carya, has a bony partition between the halves of the kernel.

  * Leaflets 13 to 17, strongly serrate; husk of the fruit not
      separating from the very rough, bony nut; native. (=A.=)

    =A.= Upper axillary bud cylindrical, whitish with hairs; nut
       elongated                                                      1.

    =A.= Upper axillary bud ovate, pointed; nut globular              2.

  * Leaflets 5 to 9; husk of the fruit separating when dry from the
      smoothish, thin-shelled nut; cultivated                         3.

[Illustration: J. cinerea.]

lanceolate, rounded at base, serrate with shallow teeth; downy,
especially beneath; leafstalk sticky or gummy. Buds oblong,
white-to-mentose. Fruit oblong, clammy, pointed. A thick-shelled nut,
deeply sculptured and rough with ragged ridges; ripe in September. A
widely spreading, flat-topped tree, 30 to 70 ft. high, with gray bark
and much lighter-colored wood than that of the Juglans nigra.

[Illustration: J. nigra.]

2. =Juglans nigra=, L. (BLACK WALNUT.) Leaflets 13 to 21,
lanceolate-ovate, taper-pointed, somewhat heart-shaped and oblique at
base, smooth above and very slightly downy beneath. Fruit globular,
roughly dotted; the thick-shelled nut very rough; ripe in October. A
large handsome tree, 50 to 120 ft. high, with brown bark; more common
west than east of the Alleghanies; often planted. Wood dark
purplish-brown.

[Illustration: J. regia.]

3. =Juglans regia=, L. (MADEIRA NUT. ENGLISH WALNUT.) Leaflets 5 to 9,
oval, smooth, obscurely serrate. Fruit oval, with a thin-shelled oval
nut not nearly so rough as that of Juglans cinerea, or of Juglans nigra.
When ripe the husk becomes very brittle and breaks open to let out the
nut. Tree intermediate in size, 40 to 60 ft. high, hardy as far north as
Boston in the East, but needs protection at St. Louis. It should be more
extensively cultivated. Introduced from Persia.


GENUS =82. CARYA.=

Hard-wooded trees with alternate, odd-pinnate leaves having
straight-veined leaflets. The leaflets are opposite each other, and the
terminal pair and end leaflet are usually much the largest. The sterile
flowers are in hanging catkins, the fertile ones minute, forming a
large, rounded, green-coated, dry drupe, with a roughened nut having a
bony partition. The drupes hang on till frost, when they open more or
less and usually allow the nut to drop out. Wood hard and tough.

  * Bark shaggy and scaly; kernel very good. (=A.=)

    =A.= Leaflets usually 5 (5 to 7)                                  1.

obovate-acuminate, sharply serrate, the odd one attenuate at base and
nearly sessile; downy beneath (more so than Carya alba). Fruit large,
oval, 4-ribbed above the middle, with 4 intervening depressions. Husk
very thick, entirely separating into 4 valves. Nut large, 1 1/4 to 2 in.
long, dull-whitish, thick-shelled, usually strongly pointed at both
ends. Kernel sweet and good. Tree 60 to 90 ft. high, with a shaggy bark
of loose, narrow strips on large trees. Quite common west of the
Alleghanies.

[Illustration: C. tomentosa.]

3. =Carya tomentosa=, Nutt. (MOCKERNUT. WHITE-HEART HICKORY.) Leaflets 7
to 9 (mostly 7), lance-obovate, pointed, obscurely serrate or almost
entire, the lower surface as well as the twigs and the catkins tomentose
when young. Fruit globular or ovoid, usually with a very hard, thick
husk slightly united at base. Nut somewhat hexagonal, with a very thick
shell and well-flavored kernel. A tall, slender tree, 60 to 100 ft.
high, with a rough deeply furrowed, but not shaggy bark. Common on dry
hillsides throughout.

[Illustration: C. microcarpa.]

4. =Carya microcarpa=, Nutt. (SMALL MOCKERNUT.) Leaflets about 5 (5 to
7), oblong-lanceolate, long-pointed, finely serrate, smooth, glandular

New York City.


ORDER =XXXIX. CUPULIFERAE.= (OAK FAMILY.)

This order contains more species of trees and shrubs in temperate
regions than any other, except the Coniferae. The genus Quercus (Oak)
alone contains about 20 species of trees in the region covered by this
work.


GENUS =83. BETULA.=

Trees or shrubs with simple, alternate, mostly straight-veined, thin,
usually serrate leaves. Flowers in catkins, opening in early spring, in
most cases before the leaves. Fruit a leafy-scaled catkin or cone,

thin, tough layers, and having peculiar horizontal marks. Many species
have aromatic leaves and twigs.

  * Trunks with chalky white bark. (=A.=)

    =A.= Native. (=B.=)

       =B.= Small tree with leafstalks about 1/2 as long as the blades  1.

       =B.= Large tree; leafstalks about 1/3 as long as the blades    2.

    =A.= Cultivated; from Europe; many varieties                      3.

  * Bark not chalky white, usually dark. (=C.=)

    =C.= Leaves and bark very aromatic. (=D.=)

[Illustration: B. populifolia.]

1. =Betula populifolia=, Ait. (AMERICAN WHITE OR GRAY BIRCH.) Leaves
triangular, very taper-pointed, and usually truncate or nearly so at the
broad base, irregularly twice-serrate; both sides smooth and shining,
when young glutinous with resinous glands; leafstalks half as long as
the blades and slender, so as to make the leaves tremulous, like those
of the Aspen. Fruit brown, cylindrical, more or less pendulous on
slender peduncles. A small (15 to 30 ft. high), slender tree with an
ascending rather than an erect trunk. Bark chalky or grayish white, with
triangular dusky spaces below the branches; recent shoots brown, closely
covered with round dots.

[Illustration: B. papyrifera.]

2. =Betula papyrifera=, Marsh. (PAPER OR CANOE BIRCH.) Leaves 2 to 4 in.
long, ovate, taper-pointed, heart-shaped, abrupt or sometimes
wedge-shaped at the base, sharply and doubly serrate, smooth and green
above, roughly reticulated, glandular-dotted and slightly hairy beneath;
footstalk not over 1/3 the length of the blade. Fruit long-stalked and
drooping. A large tree, 60 to 75 ft. high, with white bark splitting
freely into very thin, tough layers. A variety, 5 to 10 ft. high (var.
_minor_), occurs only in the White Mountains. Young shoots reddish or
purplish olive-green deepening to a dark copper bronze. New England and
westward, also cultivated.

[Illustration: B. alba.]

3. =Betula alba=, L. (EUROPEAN WHITE BIRCH.) Leaves ovate, acute,
somewhat deltoid, unequally serrate, often deeply cut, nearly smooth; in
var. _pubescens_ covered with white hairs. Fruit brown, cylindric,
drooping. A tree, 30 to 60 ft. high, with a chalky-white bark; from
Europe, extensively cultivated in this country, under many names, which
indicate the character of growth or foliage; among them may be mentioned
_pendula_ (weeping), _laciniata_ (cut-leaved), _fastigiata_ (pyramidal),
_atropurpurea_ (purple-leaved), and _pubescens_ (hairy-leaved).

[Illustration: B. lenta.]

4. =Betula lenta=, L. (SWEET, BLACK OR CHERRY BIRCH.) Leaves and bark
very sweet, aromatic. Leaves ovate or ovate-oblong, with more or less
heart-shaped base, very acute apex, and doubly and finely serrate
margin, bright shining green above, smooth beneath, except the veins,
which are hairy. Fruit 1 to 1 1/4 in. long, cylindric, with spreading
lobes to the scales. A rather large tree, 50 to 70 ft. high, with bark of
trunk and twigs in appearance much like that of the garden Cherry, and
not splitting into as thin layers as most of the Birches. Wood
rose-colored, fine-grained. Moist woods, rather common throughout; also
cultivated.

[Illustration: B. lutea.]

5. =Betula lutea=, Michx. f. (YELLOW OR GRAY BIRCH.) A species so like
the preceding (Betula lenta) as to be best described by stating the
differences. Leaves and bark are much less aromatic. Leaves 3 to 5 in.
long, not so often nor so plainly heart-shaped at base, usually

Low trees and large shrubs with simple, alternate, deciduous, doubly
serrate, straight-veined leaves. Flowers insignificant, in catkins in
early spring. Fruit an ovoid-oblong bony nut, inclosed in a thickish
involucre of two leaves with a lacerated frilled border; ripe in autumn.

cut-toothed at the margin and thick and leathery at the base. Merely a
shrub, 5 to 6 ft. high; quite common throughout.

[Illustration: C. rostrata.]

2. =Corylus rostrata=, Ait. (BEAKED HAZELNUT.) Leaves but little or not
at all heart-shaped; stipules linear-lanceolate. The involucre,
extending beyond the nut in a bract like a bottle, is covered with
stiff, short hairs. Shrub, 4 to 5 ft. high. Wild in the same region as

tree or shrub, 6 to 12 ft. high, from Europe; several varieties in
cultivation.


GENUS =86. OSTRYA.=

Slender trees with very hard wood, brownish, furrowed bark, and
deciduous, alternate, simple, exstipulate, straight-veined leaves.
Flowers inconspicuous, in catkins. Fruit hop-like in appearance, at the
ends of side shoots of the season, hanging on through the autumn.

[Illustration: O. Virginica.]

1. =Ostrya Virginica=, Willd. (IRON-WOOD. AMERICAN HOP-HORNBEAM.) Leaves
oblong-ovate, taper-pointed, very sharply doubly serrate, downy beneath,
with 11 to 15 straight veins on each side of the midrib; buds acute. The
hop-like fruit 2 to 3 times as long as wide; full grown and pendulous, 1
to 3 in. long, in August, when it adds greatly to the beauty of the
tree. A small, rather slender tree, 30 to 50 ft. high, with the bark on
old trees somewhat furrowed; wood white and very hard and heavy; common
in rich woods, and occasionally cultivated.

[Illustration: O. vulgaris.]

2. =Ostrya vulgaris=, Willd. (EUROPEAN HOP-HORNBEAM.) This species from
Europe is much like the American one, but has longer, more slender, more
pendulous fruit-clusters. Occasionally cultivated.


GENUS =87. CARPINUS.=

Trees or tall shrubs with alternate, simple, straight-veined leaves, and
smooth and close gray bark. Flowers in drooping catkins, the sterile
flowers in dense cylindric ones, and the fertile flowers in a loose
terminal one forming an elongated, leafy-bracted cluster with many,
several-grooved, small nuts, hanging on the tree till late in the
autumn.

[Illustration: C. Caroliniana.]

1. =Carpinus Caroliniana=, Walt. (AMERICAN HORNBEAM. BLUE OR WATER
BEECH.) Leaves ovate-oblong, pointed, sharply doubly serrate, soon
nearly smooth. Fruit with the scales obliquely halberd-shaped and
cut-toothed, 3/4 in. long, nuts 1/8 in. long. A tree or tall shrub, 10 to
25 ft. high, with a peculiarly ridged trunk; the close, smooth gray bark
and the leaves are much like those of the Beech. The wood is very hard
and whitish. Common along streams; sometimes cultivated.

[Illustration: C. Betulus.]

2. =Carpinus Betulus=, L. (EUROPEAN HORNBEAM.) This cultivated species
is quite similar to the American, but can be distinguished by the scales
of the fruit, which are wholly halberd-shaped, having the basal lobes
nearly equal in size, as shown in the cut; while the American species
has scales only half halberd-shaped.


GENUS =88. QUERCUS.=

Large trees to shrubs, with simple, alternate, deciduous or evergreen,
entire to deeply lobed leaves. The leaves are rather thick and woody,
and remain on the tree either all winter or at least until nearly all
other deciduous leaves have fallen. Flowers insignificant; the staminate
ones in catkins; blooming in spring. Fruit an acorn, which in the White,
Chestnut, and Live Oaks matures the same year the blossoms appear; while
in the Red, Black, and Willow Oaks the acorns mature the second year.
They remain on the tree until late in autumn. The Oaks, because of their
large tap-roots, can be transplanted only when small. Most of the
species are in cultivation. The species are very closely related, and a
number of them quite readily hybridize; this is especially true of those
of a particular group, as the White Oaks, Black Oaks, etc.

There is no attempt in the Key to characterize the hybrids, of which
some are quite extensively distributed. _Quercus heterophylla_, Michx.
(Bartram's Oak), supposed to be a hybrid between _Quercus Phellos_ and
_Quercus rubra_, is found quite frequently from Staten Island southward
to North Carolina.

inclosing 1 to 3 large, ovoid, brown nuts, ripe after frost, which opens
the bur into 4 valves. A common large tree, with light, coarse-grained
wood, and bark having coarse longitudinal ridges on the old trees. Many
varieties of this species are in cultivation, varying in the size and
sweetness of the nuts, the size of the trees, and the size and the
margins of the leaves, some of which are almost entire. The wild species
is var. _Americana_.

[Illustration: C. pumila.]

2. =Castanea pumila=, Mill. (CHINQUAPIN.) Leaves lance-oblong, strongly
straight-veined, coarsely serrate, usually with awned tips;
whitish-downy beneath, 3 to 5 in. long, 1 1/4 to 2 in. wide. Bur small,
prickly, with a single small, rounded, sweet, chestnut-colored nut. A
handsome small tree, or in the wild state usually a shrub, 6 to 40 ft.
high. Central New Jersey, southern Ohio and southward, and cultivated
successfully as far north as New York City.


GENUS =90. FAGUS.=

Trees with alternate, strongly straight-veined, almost entire to deeply
pinnatifid leaves. Flowers inconspicuous, appearing with the leaves.
Fruit a prickly bur, inclosing 2 triangular, sharp-ridged nuts, the bur
hanging on the trees during the greater part of the winter. Leaf-buds
very elongated, slender, sharp-pointed.

  * The straight veins all ending in the teeth; native                1.

      veins occasionally ending in the notches                        2.

[Illustration: F. ferruginea.]

1. =Fagus ferruginea=, Ait. (AMERICAN BEECH.) Leaves thin, oblong-ovate,
taper-pointed, distinctly and often coarsely toothed; petioles and
midrib ciliate with soft silky hairs when young, soon almost naked. The
very straight veins run into the teeth. Prickles of the fruit mostly
recurved or spreading. Large tree, 60 to 100 ft. high, with
grayish-white, very smooth bark, and firm, light-colored, close-grained
wood. Wild throughout, and frequently cultivated.

[Illustration: F. sylvatica.]

2. =Fagus sylvatica=, L. (EUROPEAN BEECH.) Leaves often similar to those
of the American Beech, but usually shorter and broader; the border,
often nearly entire, is wavy in some varieties, and in others deeply
pinnatifid. The bark in most varieties is darker than in the American.
This Beech, with its numerous varieties, is the one usually cultivated.
Among the most useful varieties are _atropurpurea_ (Purple Beech), with
the darkest foliage of any deciduous tree, and almost entire-margined
leaves; _laciniata_ (Cut-leaved Beech), with very deeply cut leaves; and
_argentea variegata_ (Silver Variegated Beech), having in the spring
quite distinctly variegated leaves.


ORDER =XL. SALICACEAE.= (WILLOW FAMILY.)

A small order of soft-wooded trees and shrubs, abundantly distributed in
the northern temperate and frigid zones.


GENUS =91. SALIX.=

Soft-wooded trees or shrubs growing in damp places, with alternate,
usually quite elongated, pointed, deciduous leaves, without lobes.
Stipules often large, leaf-like, and more or less persistent through the
summer; sometimes scale-like and dropping early. The stipules are always
free from the leafstalk and attached to the twig at small spots just
below the leafstalk. Even if the stipules have dropped off, the small
scars remain. Flowers staminate and pistillate on separate trees
(dioecious), in elongated catkins in early spring. Fruit consists of
catkins of small pods with numerous seeds having silky down at one end.
The seeds usually drop early. Among the Willows there are so many
hybrids and peculiar varieties as to render their study difficult, and
their classification, in some cases, impossible. The following Key will
probably enable the student to determine most specimens. No attempt has
been made to include all the cultivated forms.

  * Spray decidedly weeping                                           5.

to 7 in. long and nearly 2 in. in diameter, cylindric, sessile, with
large, entire, incurved scales; bracts large, exserted, reflexed,
spatulate, with terminal, awl-shaped points. A very large, beautiful
tree, from the Pacific coast, where it grows 200 ft. high. Hardy in
Pennsylvania, but needs some protection in Massachusetts.

[Illustration: A. pectinata.]

12. =Abies pectinata=, DC. (EUROPEAN OR COMMON SILVER FIR.) Leaves 1/2
to 1 in. long, linear, obtuse, occasionally with an incurved point,
polished green above, two white lines below, rigid, straight; branches
horizontal and in whorls. Cones 6 to 8 in. long, cylindric, brown when
ripe; scales broad, thin, rounded; bracts long, exserted, with an acute
reflexed tip. Introduced from Europe. Good specimens can be found as far
north as Massachusetts, though our climate is not fitted to give them
either long life or perfect form.


GENUS =97. LARIX.= (THE LARCHES.)

Leaves deciduous, all foliaceous, the primary ones scattered, but most
of them in bundles of numerous leaves from lateral globular buds. Cones
usually small (in one cultivated species 3 in. long), ovoid, erect, with
smooth scales.

  * Cones less than 1 in. long, of not more than 25 scales            1.

  * Cones 1 to 2 in. long, of from 40 to 60 scales                 2, 3.

      deciduous scales. (Pseudolarix)                                 4.

[Illustration: L. Americana.]

1. =Larix Americana=, Michx. (AMERICAN LARCH. TAMARACK OR HACKMATACK.)
Leaves less than 1 in. long, thread-like, linear, slender, light
bluish-green. Cones 1/2 to 3/4 in. long, ovoid, of a reddish color. A tree
of large size, 50 to 100 ft. high, growing wild in all the northern
portion of our region, and frequent in cultivation, although not quite
so fine a tree as Larix Europaea.

[Illustration: L. Europaea.]

2. =Larix Europaea=, DC. (EUROPEAN LARCH.) Leaves 1 in. long, linear,
obtuse, flat, soft, numerous, and bright green in color. Cones sometimes
more than 1 in. long, with oval, erect, very persistent scales. A
beautiful tree with horizontal branches and drooping branchlets;
abundant in cultivation.

Var. _pendula_ has long, pendent branches, and forms a very fine weeping
tree.

[Illustration: L. Leptolepsis.]

3. =Larix Leptolepsis=, Gordon. (JAPAN LARCH.) Leaves 1 to 11/2 in. long,
slender, pale green. Cones 1-1/3 in. long, and half as wide, of about 60
scales, reflexed at the margin, pale brown in color; bracts lanceolate,
acute, entire, thin, one half the length of the scales; seeds obovate,
compressed, with long, obtuse, thin wings. A small tree from northern
Japan, where it grows 40 ft. high. It is a handsome, erect-growing tree,
with slender, smooth, ash-colored branches, and rather rigid, spreading
branchlets.

[Illustration: L. Kaempferi]

4. =Larix Kaempferi=, Lamb. (GOLDEN LARCH.) Leaves from 1 to 2 1/2 in.
long, flat, linear, sword-shaped, somewhat soft, pale pea-green in the
spring, golden-yellow in the autumn. Cones 2 to 3 in. long, with
flattish, divergent scales which are very deciduous. A beautiful large
tree, over 100 ft. high, from China, which proves hardy as far north as
central New York. It is often placed in a new genus (Pseudolarix)
because of the deciduous scales to the cones.


GENUS =98. CEDRUS.= (THE LEBANON CEDARS.)

Leaves linear, simple, evergreen, in large, alternate clusters. Cones
large, erect, solitary, with closely appressed scales; seeds adhering to
the base of their lacerated, membranous wings. Large, spreading-branched
trees from southern Asia and northern Africa. Occasionally successfully
grown from New York City southward.

  * Leaves 1 in. or less long                                      1, 2.

  * Leaves over 1 in. long, light glaucous-green                      3.

[Illustration: C. Libani.]

1. =Cedrus Libani=, Barr. (CEDAR OF LEBANON.) Leaves 3/4 to 1 in. long,
acuminate, needle-form, rigid, few in a fascicle, deep green in color.
Cones 3 to 5 in. long, oval, obtuse, very persistent, grayish-brown in
color; scales thin, truncate, slightly denticulate; seeds quite large
and irregular in form. A cultivated tree with wide-spreading, whorled,
horizontal branches covered with rough bark. Somewhat tender when young
in the Middle States, but forming a grand tree in proper positions.

[Illustration: C. Atlantica.]

2. =Cedrus Atlantica=, Manetti. (MT. ATLAS, SILVER, OR AFRICAN CEDAR.)
Leaves 1/2 to 3/4 in. long, mostly cylindric, straight, rigid, mucronate,
crowded, and of a beautiful glaucous-green color. Cones 2 1/2 to 3 in.
long, ovate, glossy. This beautiful tree has been considered a silvery
variety of Cedrus Libani. They are about alike in hardiness and in
general form. Cedrus Atlantica has more slender branches, denser and
more silvery foliage. From Africa.

[Illustration: C. Deodara.]

3. =Cedrus Deodara=, Lindl. (DEODAR OR INDIAN CEDAR.) Leaves 1 to 2 in.
in length, 3- or usually 4-sided, rigid, acute, very numerous (about 20
in a fascicle), bright green, covered with a glaucous bloom. Cones 4 to
5 in. long, ovate, obtuse, very resinous, rich purple when young, and
brown when old; the scales separating from the axis at maturity. Seeds
wedge-shaped, with large, bright brown wings. A beautiful pyramidal
tree, with graceful drooping branches and light silvery foliage. Not
hardy north of Philadelphia; from India.


GENUS =98a. ARAUCARIA.=

[Illustration: A. imbricata.]

=Araucaria imbricata=, Pavon. (CHILE PINE.) Leaves 1 to 2 in. long,
ovate-lanceolate, sessile, rigid, acute, very persistent, closely
overlapping, completely covering the thick stems, in whorls of 6 to 8,
deep glossy green; branches horizontal, in whorls of 6 to 8, with
ascending tips, covered with resinous, corky bark. Flowers dioecious;
cones (on only a portion of the trees) large, roundish, about 7 in. in
diameter, erect, solitary; seeds wedge-shaped, 1 to 2 in. long. A large,
peculiar, beautiful, conical tree, with much the appearance of a cactus;
not fitted to our climate, although a few specimens may be found growing
quite well near the coast south of Philadelphia. From the mountains of
Chile.


GENUS =99. CUNNINGHAMIA.=

A genus of but one species. The cone-scales are very small, but the
bracts are large, thick, and serrate.

[Illustration: C. Sinensis.]

=Cunninghamia Sinensis=, R. Br. (CUNNINGHAMIA.) Leaves 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 in.
long, flat, rigid, numerous, alternate, somewhat serrulate; the leaf
gradually increases in width from the acute tip to the base, which is
decurrent on the stem and about 1/8 in. wide. Cones 1 to 1 1/2 in. long,
nearly globular, erect, very persistent, mostly clustered, sessile; the
scale is a mere transverse ridge, but the bract is large and prominent,
like a triangular-hastate, dilated leaf. A very handsome tree, from
China, which does not succeed very well in this region except in
protected situations.


GENUS =100. SCIADOPITYS.=

Cones elliptical or cylindrical, large, obtuse. Leaves evergreen,
somewhat flattened, arranged in distant whorls around the stems, and
spreading in all directions.

[Illustration: S. verticillata.]

=Sciadopitys verticillata=, S. and Z. (UMBRELLA-PINE.) Leaves 2 to 4 in.
long, 1/6 in. wide, linear, obtuse, smooth, persistent, sessile, entire,
in whorls of 30 to 40 at the nodes and extremity of the branches. Cones
3 by 1 1/2 in. Scales wedge-shaped, corrugated, overlapping, coriaceous,
persistent; bracts adherent, broad, and smooth. A beautiful, tall,
conical, slow-growing tree, with the branches whorled. Recently
introduced; hardy in the New England States.


GENUS =101. TAXODIUM.=

Leaves deciduous, spreading, in 2 ranks. Flowers monoecious on the
same branch, the staminate ones in spikes, and the pistillate ones in
pairs below. Cones globular; the scales peltate, angular, thick, firmly
closed till ripe, with 2 angular seeds under each.

[Illustration: T. distichum.]

=Taxodium distichum=, Richard. (SOUTHERN OR BALD CYPRESS.) Leaves
deciduous, flat, linear, 1/2 to 3/4 in. long, in 2 rows on the slender
branchlets, forming feather-like spray of a light green color. This
whole spray usually falls off in the autumn as though a single leaf.
Cones round, closed, hard, 1 in. in diameter. A fine, tall (100 to 125
ft. high), slender, spire-shaped tree with a large, spreading, rigid
trunk, 6 to 9 ft. thick, and peculiar conical excrescences (called
knees) growing up from the roots. Wild from Maryland south, and
cultivated and hardy in the Middle and many of the Northern States.

[Illustration: Var. pendulum.]

Var. _pendulum_, with horizontal branches and drooping branchlets, has
the leaves but slightly spreading from the stems, especially when young.
Very beautiful; hardy as far north as Massachusetts.


GENUS =102. SEQUOIA.=

Flowers monoecious, terminal, solitary, catkins nearly globular. Seeds
winged, 3 to 5 under each scale.

[Illustration: S. gigantea.]

1. =Sequoia gigantea=, Torr. (BIG OR GREAT TREE OF CALIFORNIA.) Leaves
on the young shoots spreading, needle-shaped, sharp-pointed, scattered
spirally around the branchlets; finally scale-shaped, overlapping,
mostly appressed, with generally an acute apex, light green in color.
Cones oval, 2 to 3 in. long, of about 25 scales. The largest tree known,
300 ft. high, with a trunk nearly 30 ft. through, found in California
and occasionally planted east, though with no great success, as it is
almost certain to die after a few years.

[Illustration: S. sempervirens.]

2. =Sequoia sempervirens=, Endl. (REDWOOD.) Leaves from 1/2 to 1 in. long,
linear, smooth, 2-ranked, flat, acute, dark shining green, glaucous
beneath; branches numerous, horizontal, spreading. Cones 1 in. long,
roundish, solitary, terminal; scales numerous, thick, rough, furnished
with an obtuse point. A magnificent tree from California, where it grows
200 to 300 ft. high. In the East it can be kept alive but a few years
even at Washington.


GENUS =103. THUYA.= (ARBOR-VITAE.)

Small, evergreen trees with flat, 2-ranked, fan-like spray and closely
overlapping, small, appressed leaves of two shapes on different
branchlets, one awl-shaped and acute, the other scale-like, usually
blunt and close to the branch. Fertile catkins of few, overlapping
scales fixed by the base; at maturity, dry and spreading. There are
scores of named varieties of Arbor-vitae sold by the nurserymen under 3
different generic names, Thuya, Biota, and Thuyopsis. There are but
slight differences in these groups, and they will in this work be placed
together under Thuya. Some that in popular language might well be called
Arbor-vitae (the Retinosporas) will, because of the character of the
fruit, be included in the next genus.

  * Scales of the cones pointless, thin, straight. (Thuya)         1, 2.

  * Scales reflexed and wedge-shaped. (Thuyopsis)                     3.

  * Scales thick, with horn-like tips. (Biota)                        4.

[Illustration: T. occidentalis.]

1. =Thuya occidentalis=, L. (AMERICAN ARBOR-VITAE. WHITE CEDAR.) Leaves
in 4 rows on the 2-edged branchlets, having a strong aromatic odor when
bruised. Cones oblong, 1/3 in. long, with few (6 to 10) pointless
scales. A small tree, 20 to 50 ft. high, or in cultivation 1 to 50 ft.
high, with pale, shreddy bark, and light, soft, but very durable wood.
Wild north, and extensively cultivated throughout under more than a
score of named varieties. Their names--_alba_, _aurea_, _glauca_,
_conica_, _globosa_, _pyramidalis_, _pendula_, etc.--will give some idea
of the variations in color, form, etc.

[Illustration: T. gigantea.]

2. =Thuya gigantea=, Nutt. (GIANT ARBOR-VITAE.) Leaves scale-shaped,
somewhat 4-sided, closely overlapping, sharp-pointed, slightly
tuberculate on the back; cones more or less clustered and nearly 1/2 in.
long. A very large and graceful tree, 200 ft. high, with white, soft
wood; from the Pacific coast; introduced but not very successfully grown
in the Atlantic States.

[Illustration: T. dolabrata.]

3. =Thuya dolabrata=, L. (HATCHET-LEAVED ARBOR-VITAE.) Leaves large,
sometimes 1/4 in. long, very blunt, in 4 rows on the flattened spray.
Cones quite small, ovate, sessile, with jagged edges; scales reflexed
and wedge-form. A small conical tree with horizontal branches and
drooping branchlets; which, because of its large leaves (for an
Arbor-vitae) and flexible branchlets, is quite unique and interesting. In
shaded and moist places it has done quite well as far north as New York.

[Illustration: T. orientalis.]

4. =Thuya orientalis=, L. (EASTERN OR CHINESE ARBOR-VITAE.) Leaves small,
in 4 opposite rows, appressed, acute, on the numerous 2-edged
branchlets. Cones large, roundish, with thick leathery scales having
recurving, horn-like tips. Of this species there are as many varieties
sold as of number one, and nearly the same varietal names are used; but
it is not so good a species for general cultivation in this country.

Var. _flagelliformis_, Jacq. (Weeping Arbor-vitae), has very slender,
elongated, weeping branches, curving gracefully to the ground. It is a
beautiful variety, often cultivated (a single stem is shown in the
figure).


GENUS =104. CHAMAECYPARIS.= (THE CYPRESSES.)

Strong-scented, evergreen trees with very small, scale-like or somewhat
awl-shaped, closely appressed (except in some cultivated varieties),
overlapping leaves and 2-ranked branchlets, almost as in Thuya. Cones
globular, with peltate, valvate scales, firmly closed till ripe; the
scales thick and pointed at the center.

  * Native trees; leaves light glaucous-green.                        1.

  * Cultivated trees from Western America; leaves dark green.
      (=A.=)

    =A.= No tubercle on the backs of the leaves.                      2.

    =A.= Usually a tubercle on the back                               3.

  * Cultivated small trees and shrubs from Japan (called Retinospora) 4.

[Illustration: C. sphaeroidea.]

1. =Chamaecyparis sphaeroidea=, Spach. (WHITE CEDAR.) Leaves very small,
triangular, awl-shaped, regularly and closely appressed in 4 rows, of a
light glaucous-green color, often with a small gland on the back. Cones
very small, 1/3 in. in diameter, of about 6 scales, clustered. Tree 30
to 90 ft. high, wild in low grounds throughout; abundant in Middle
States. With reddish-white wood and slender, spreading and drooping
sprays; bark fibrous, shreddy; sometimes cultivated.

[Illustration: C. Nutkaensis.]

2. =Chamaecyparis Nutkaensis=, Lambert. (NOOTKA SOUND CYPRESS.) Leaves
only 1/8 in. long, sharp-pointed, and closely appressed, of a very
dark, rich green color; very slightly glaucous, without tubercles on the
back. Cones small, globular, solitary, with a fine, whitish bloom;
scales 4, rough and terminating in a sharp straight point. Tree 100 ft.
high in Alaska, and would make a fine cultivated tree for this region if
it could stand our hot, dry summers.

[Illustration: C. Lawsoniana.]

3. =Chamaecyparis Lawsoniana=, Park. (LAWSON'S CYPRESS.) Leaves small,
deep green, with a whitish margin when young, forming with the twigs
feathery-like, flat spray of a bluish-green color; leaves usually with a
gland on the back. Cones scarcely 1/4 in. in diameter, of 8 to 10 scales.
A magnificent tree in California, and where it is hardy (in rather moist
soil, New York and south) it forms one of our best cultivated
evergreens. The leading shoot when young is pendulous.

[Illustration: R. obtusa.]

4. =Chamaecyparis= (=Retinospora=) =obtusa=, Endl. (JAPANESE ARBOR-VITAE.)
Leaves scale-formed, obtuse, closely appressed and very persistent.
Cones of 8 or 10 hard, light brown, wedge-shaped scales. Beautiful small
trees or generally shrubs (in this country), of a score of named
varieties of many colors and forms of plant and foliage.

There are probably a number of species of Japanese and Chinese
Chamaecyparis (Retinospora), but till their size, hardiness, and origin
have been more fully determined, it would be impossible to make an
entirely satisfactory list for such a work as this. Figures are given of
the common, so-called, species cultivated in this country; under each of
these, several varieties are sold by the nurserymen. The three twigs of
Retinospora squarrosa were all taken from a single branch; this shows
how impossible it is to determine the varieties or species; the twig at
the left represents the true _squarrosa_; the others, the partial return
to the original. Most of the forms shown in the figures have purple,
golden, silvery, and other colored varieties.

GENUS =105. CRYPTOMERIA.=

A genus of evergreens containing only the following species:

[Illustration: C. Japonica.]

=Cryptomeria Japonica=, Don. (JAPAN CEDAR.) Leaves about 1/2 in. long, not
flattened, but about equally 4-sided, curved and tapering quite
gradually from the tip to the large, sessile base; branches spreading,
mostly horizontal, with numerous branchlets. Cones 1/2 to 3/4 in. in
diameter, globular, terminal, sessile, very persistent, with numerous,
loose, not overlapping scales. A beautiful tree from Japan, 50 to 100
ft. high. Not very successfully grown in our climate. North of
Washington, D. C., it needs a sheltered position, and should have a
deep, but not very rich soil.


GENUS =106. JUNIPERUS.=

Leaves evergreen, awl-shaped or scale-like, rigid, often of two shapes
on the same plant. Spray not 2-ranked. Flowers usually dioecious.
Fertile catkins rounded, of 3 to 6 fleshy, coalescent scales, forming in
fruit a bluish-black berry with a whitish bloom, but found on only a
portion of the plants.

  * Leaves rather long, 1/2 in., in whorls of threes                  1.

  * Leaves smaller; on the old branches mostly opposite               2.

[Illustration: J. communis.]

1. =Juniperus communis=, L. (COMMON JUNIPER.) Leaves rather long, 1/2 in.,
linear, awl-shaped, in whorls of threes, prickly-pointed, upper surface
glaucous-white, under surface bright green. Fruit globular, 1/4 in. or
more in diameter, dark purple when ripe, covered with light-colored
bloom. A shrub or small tree with spreading or pendulous branches;
common in dry, sterile soils. There are a great many varieties of this
species in cultivation, but few of them grow tall enough to be
considered trees.

Var. _Hibernica_ (Irish Juniper) grows erect like a column. Var.
_Alpina_ is a low creeping plant. Var. _hemispherica_ is almost like a
half-sphere lying on the ground.

[Illustration: J. Virginiana.]

2. =Juniperus Virginiana=, L. (RED CEDAR.) Leaves very small and
numerous, scale-like on the older branches, but awl-shaped and somewhat
spreading on the young shoots; dark green. Fruit small, 1/5 in.,
abundant on the pistillate plants, dark purple and covered with fine,
glaucous bloom. Trees from 20 to 80 ft. high (sometimes only shrubs),
with mostly horizontal branches, thin, scaling bark, dense habit of
growth, and dark foliage. Wood light, fine-grained, durable; the
heart-wood of a handsome dark red color. Wild throughout; several
varieties are found in cultivation. Many other species from China,
Japan, California, etc., are occasionally cultivated, but few are large
enough to be called trees, and those that are large enough are not of
sufficient importance to need specific notice.


GENUS =107. TAXUS.=

Leaves evergreen, flat, linear, mucronate, rigid, scattered, appearing
more or less 2-ranked. Fertile flowers and the fruit solitary; the
fruit, a nut-like seed in a cup-shaped, fleshy portion formed from a
disk; red.

[Illustration: T. baccata.]

=Taxus baccata=, L. (COMMON EUROPEAN YEW.) Leaves evergreen, 2-ranked,
crowded, linear, flat, curved, acute. Fruit a nut-like seed within a cup
1/3 in. in diameter; red when ripe in the autumn. As this species is
somewhat dioecious, a portion of the plants will be without fruit. A
widely spreading shrub rather than a tree, extensively cultivated under
nearly a score of named varieties. We have a closely related wild
species, =Taxus Canadensis= (THE GROUND-HEMLOCK), which is merely a low
straggling bush.


GENUS =1O7a. TORREYA.=

[Illustration: T. taxifolia.]

The Torreyas are much like the Yews, but their leaves have two
longitudinal lines, and a remarkably disagreeable odor when burned or
bruised. =Torreya taxifolia=, Arn., from Florida, and =Torreya
Californica=, Torr., from California, have been often planted. They form
small trees, but probably cannot be grown successfully in the region.
The figure shows a twig of T. taxifolia.


GENUS =1O7b. CEPHALOTAXUS.=

[Illustration: C. Fortunii.]

=Cephalotaxus Fortunii=, Hook., does not form a tree in this section,
but a wide-spreading bush growing sometimes to the height of 10 ft., and
spreading over a spot 15 ft. wide. Leaves flat, with the midrib forming
a distinct ridge on both sides, linear, sometimes over 2 in. long,
glossy green on the upper side, slightly whitened beneath. Fruit very
large, 1 in. or more long, elliptical, with a single, thin-shelled
nut-like seed covered with purplish, pulpy, thin flesh. Branches
spreading, drooping, long, slender; buds small, covered with many
sharp-pointed, overlapping scales; twigs green, somewhat grooved. From
Japan; about hardy in New Jersey.


GENUS =108. PODOCARPUS.=

Leaves one-nerved, opposite, alternate, or scattered, linear or oblong.
Flowers axillary and mostly dioecious; fruit drupe-like, with a
bony-coated stone.

[Illustration: P. Japonica.]

=Podocarpus Japonica=, Sieb. (JAPAN PODOCARPUS.) Leaves alternate,
crowded, flat, linear-lanceolate, elongated, quite sharp-pointed,
narrowed to a short though distinct petiole, and continued down the stem
by two ridges; leaves not 2-ranked, large, 4 to 8 in. long and 1/2 in.
wide when growing in perfection; in specimens grown in this region, 2 to
5 in. long and 1/4 in. wide; midrib forms a ridge on both sides; upper
side dark glossy green; lower side with two broad whitish lines. A
beautiful, erect-growing, small tree; from Japan; about hardy in central
New Jersey; needs some protection in Massachusetts.


GENUS =109. SALISBURIA.=

Leaves broad, simple, alternate, stipulate, deciduous, deeply cut or
lobed at the apex, alike on both surfaces, with long petioles. Flowers
dioecious; staminate ones in catkins, pistillate ones either solitary
or in clusters of a few each. Fruit a nut with a drupaceous covering.

[Illustration: S. adiantifolia.]

=Salisburia adiantifolia=, Sm. (GINKGO TREE.) Leaves parallel-veined,
fan-shaped, with irregular lobes at the end, thick, leathery, with no
midrib. Fruit globular or ovate, 1 in. long, on long, slender stems. A
very peculiar and beautiful large tree, 50 to 100 ft. high; from Japan.
Hardy throughout, and should be more extensively cultivated than it
is.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
