          THE
          BAD CHILD'S
          BOOK OF
          BEASTS

          Verses by
          H. BELLOC

          Pictures by
          B. T. B.

          DUCKWORTH,
          3 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT GARDEN

          Child! do not throw this book about;
            Refrain from the unholy pleasure
          Of cutting all the pictures out!
            Preserve it as your chiefest treasure.

          Child, have you never heard it said
            That you are heir to all the ages?
          Why, then, your hands were never made
            To tear these beautiful thick pages!

          Your little hands were made to take
            The better things and leave the worse ones.
          They also may be used to shake
            The Massive Paws of Elder Persons.

          And when your prayers complete the day,
            Darling, your little tiny hands
          Were also made, I think, to pray
            For men that lose their fairylands.

INTRODUCTION


          I CALL you bad, my little child,
            Upon the title page,
          Because a manner rude and wild
            Is common at your age.

          The Moral of this priceless work
            (If rightly understood)
          Will make you--from a little Turk--
            Unnaturally good.

          Do not as evil children do,
          Who on the slightest grounds
          Will imitate the Kangaroo,
          With wild unmeaning bounds:

[Illustration]

          Do not as children badly bred,
            Who eat like little Hogs,
          And when they have to go to bed
            Will whine like Puppy Dogs:

          Who take their manners from the Ape,
            Their habits from the Bear,
          Indulge the loud unseemly jape,
            And never brush their hair.

          But so control your actions that
            Your friends may all repeat.
          'This child is dainty as the Cat,
            And as the Owl discreet.'

[Illustration]




The Yak


[Illustration]

          As a friend to the children
                             commend me the Yak.
            You will find it exactly the thing:
          It will carry and fetch,
                        you can ride on its back,

[Illustration]

          Or lead it about
            with a string.

[Illustration]

          The Tartar who dwells on the plains of Thibet
            (A desolate region of snow)
          Has for centuries made it a nursery pet,
            And surely the Tartar should know!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Then tell your papa where the Yak can be got,
            And if he is awfully rich
          He will buy you the creature--
          or else
                  he will _not_.
          (I cannot be positive which.)

[Illustration]




The Polar Bear


          The Polar Bear is unaware
            Of cold that cuts me through:
          For why? He has a coat of hair.
            I wish I had one too!

[Illustration]




The Lion


          The Lion, the Lion, he dwells in the waste,
          He has a big head and a very small waist;
          But his shoulders are stark, and his jaws they are grim,
          And a good little child will not play with him.

[Illustration]




The Tiger


          The Tiger on the other hand, is kittenish and mild,
          He makes a pretty playfellow for any little child;
          And mothers of large families (who claim to common sense)
          Will find a Tiger well repay the trouble and expense.

[Illustration]




The Dromedary


          The Dromedary is a cheerful bird:
          I cannot say the same about the Kurd.

[Illustration]




The Whale


[Illustration]

          The Whale that wanders round the Pole
            Is not a table fish.
          You cannot bake or boil him whole
            Nor serve him in a dish;

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          But you may cut his blubber up
              And melt it down for oil.
          And so replace the colza bean
            (A product of the soil).

[Illustration]

          These facts should all be noted down
              And ruminated on,
          By every boy in Oxford town
              Who wants to be a Don.

[Illustration]




The Camel


[Illustration]

          "The Ship of the Desert."




The Hippopotamus


[Illustration]

          I shoot the Hippopotamus
            with bullets made of platinum,
          Because if I use leaden ones
                  his hide is sure to flatten 'em.

[Illustration]




The Dodo


[Illustration]

          The Dodo used to walk around,
            And take the sun and air.
          The sun yet warms his native ground--

[Illustration]

          The Dodo is not there!

[Illustration]

          The voice which used to squawk and squeak
            Is now for ever dumb--

[Illustration]

          Yet may you see his bones and beak
            All in the Mu-se-um.




The Marmozet


          The species Man and Marmozet
            Are intimately linked;
          The Marmozet survives as yet,
            But Men are all extinct.

[Illustration]




The Camelopard


[Illustration]

          The Camelopard, it is said
            By travellers (who never lie),
          He cannot stretch out straight in bed
            Because he is so high.
          The clouds surround his lofty head,
            His hornlets touch the sky.

[Illustration]

          How shall
            I hunt this quadruped?
              I cannot tell!
                            Not I!

          (A picture of how people try
          And fail to hit that head so high.)
          I'll buy a little parachute
          (A common parachute with wings),
          I'll fill it full of arrowroot
          And other necessary things,
          And I will slay this fearful brute
          With stones and sticks and guns and slings.

[Illustration]

          (A picture of how people shoot
          With comfort from a parachute.)

[Illustration]




The Learned Fish


[Illustration]

          This learned Fish has not sufficient brains
          To go into the water when it rains.




The Elephant


[Illustration]

          When people call this beast to mind,
              They marvel more and more
          At such a +_LITTLE_+ tail behind,
          So _LARGE_ a trunk before.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




The Big Baboon


[Illustration]

          The Big Baboon is found upon
              The plains of Cariboo:
          He goes about
                        with nothing on
          (A shocking thing to do).

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          But if he
              dressed respectably
          And let his whiskers grow,
          How like this Big Baboon would be
                 To Mister So-and-so!

[Illustration]




The Rhinoceros


[Illustration]

          Rhinoceros, your hide looks all undone,
          You do not take my fancy in the least:
          You have a horn where other brutes have none:
              Rhinoceros, you are an ugly beast.

[Illustration]




The Frog


[Illustration]

          Be kind and tender to the Frog,
              And do not call him names,
          As 'Slimy skin,' or 'Polly-wog,'
              Or likewise 'Ugly James,'
          Or 'Gap-a-grin,' or 'Toad-gone-wrong,'
              Or 'Bill Bandy-knees':
          The Frog is justly sensitive
              To epithets like these.

[Illustration]

          No animal will more repay
              A treatment kind and fair;
          At least
                    so lonely people say
          Who keep a frog (and, by the way,
          They are extremely rare).

[Illustration]

          Oh! My!

       *       *       *       *       *

Transcriber's Note: The original edition was well-illustrated. The
illustrations were scattered amongst the poetry. For ease of
readability, the poems have been put back together with every effort of
retaining the original style.

For the poem titled "The Elephant," a word in small-capitals is denoted
by +. As usual, italics are indicated by _.

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
